Keiser argued that gold is more trusted than the US dollar globally, and said governments of foreign nations with an adversarial relationship to the United States would not accept dollar-pegged stablecoins. The BTC maximalist added: ""Russia, China, and Iran are not going to accept a US dollar stablecoin. I predict they will counter the USD stablecoin with a Gold one.

The Power Division is under way to conduct consultations for drafting competitive, un-subsidized charges, which will attract crypto miners to pay a decent percentage of what they earn towards power. Since miners end up using 60–70% of their spending on power, Pakistan’s surplus generation could save humongous amounts of costs. The move is also in line with the government’s broader vision of turning liabilities into economic drivers. Power Minister Awais Leghari has recently met with Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the newly formed Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), to consider this prospect. Shortly thereafter, the council had its inaugural official meeting, which was chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and featured prominent regulators in attendance. Regulatory Framework in the Works PCC session focused on how Pakistan would benefit from the unexploited potential of crypto within the nation. Saqib outlined a vision of transforming surplus electricity into value through Bitcoin mining, with regulatory clarity. The council resolved that local business models and regulations will be defined by embracing international best practices. Main discussions included legislation, consumer protection, blockchain mining policies, and a national blockchain strategy. Global Context: Learning from Other Nations Countries have reacted differently towards crypto mining. China prohibited it due to environmental and energy concerns. Kazakhstan initially welcomed it but charged higher tariffs during shortages. Potential miners in El Salvador, on the other hand, take advantage of affordable geothermal energy from volcanoes to fuel their equipment.

He posted on social media, “This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.” However, this statement is worrying winemakers in California. According to a recent CNN report , grape growers and winemakers have a huge share in US wine production. Trump’s recent proposal of 200% tariffs on wine products has spread unease among the state’s wine producers. Some winemakers take his threat with caution, but they still feel positive about the revival of interest in locally made Californian wine. Others are worried that this will cause severe damage to the industry, which is already facing difficulties due to recent crop destruction from the wildfires and droughts in California. Moreover, the demand for California-made wines is also low. John Williams, who runs a winery in California’s Napa Valley, says, “Even though we’re a farming family business, there’s a global link.” He added, “This is not good for our industry in general.” EU data shows that alcoholic beverages are among the major exports to the United States. In case Trum’s threat changes and becomes a reality, European wine, including other alcoholic beverages, will become way expensive for an average-class American ordering at a restaurant or buying it in a liquor shop. Trump has also officially imposed a 25% tariff on European metals, specifically steel and aluminum. In a retaliatory move, Europe is imposing a 50% tariff on US whiskey starting from April. Some Canadian stores are no longer selling American alcohol brands Williams has been in the wine business for 45 years. He worries that the tariff war will create difficulties for wine distributors, who buy wine from producers and sell it to restaurants and retailers. He said, “We all rely on the same distributors. The health of those businesses is important to wineries all over the world”. He also sold wine to Canada. The country is also on Trump’s tariff blacklist. As tariffs have escalated tensions between US neighbors, some Canadian stores are no longer displaying American alcohol brands on their shelves. William says, “We need to sell all the cases we can. We don’t need business interruption right now.” Overall, the demand for wine has been on a decline According to a recent report by Silicon Valley Bank, younger generations are consuming less alcohol than baby boomers. This has caused wine demand to decline. The estimates in the report say that in 2025 the sales in the wine category in total would fall between minus 3% and minus 1%. John Duarte, a former Republican Congressman blames this decline for the damage in smaller wineries and farms owned by families in California. Duarte also runs a family farm and grapewine nursery. Larger alcohol companies involved in both importing and exporting wine are less likely to be affected by tariffs on EU wines compared to smaller businesses, Duarte explained. This is because the U.S. Customs and Border Protection provides refunds for certain duties, taxes, and fees paid on imported products as long as the company exports similar goods. According to Duarte, these tariffs could unintentionally encourage big alcohol brands to import more European alcohol, even at higher prices, to increase the refunds they receive when exporting similar items. “At first, you want to be thankful that President Trump is standing up for the domestic wine industry. That should be a good thing,” Duarte said. However, imposing a 200% tariff on top of existing excise taxes and other tariffs already in place gives a massive advantage to global wine companies that both import and export from the United States. While Duarte acknowledged that some aspects of trade between the United States and the EU are unfair, he emphasized that the issue needs to be addressed “much more carefully.” Not all California winemakers think that Trump’s tariffs will be entirely harmful to their business Bruce Lundquist, co-founder of Rack & Riddle, the largest sparkling wine producer in the United States, remains optimistic that the tariffs could spark greater interest in his company’s products. According to Comité Champagne, an industry trade association, France shipped nearly 27 million bottles of Champagne to the United States in 2023, making the U.S. the top market for its sparkling wine exports. However, a 200% tariff on Champagne imports, along with the inevitable price increase, would likely be a major setback for that market, Lundquist noted.

Bitcoin’s Steady Rise and Gala’s Web3 Expansion Make Headlines,https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-highest-roi-crypto-right-now-bitcoins-steady-rise-and-galas-web3-expansion-make-headlines/,"Crypto markets are shifting fast, and the search for the highest ROI crypto in 2025 is leading many toward high-growth projects. Bitcoin remains the anchor of the market, holding strong at key support levels as institutional demand fuels its stability. Meanwhile, Gala is making major moves in the Web3 gaming space, expanding its ecosystem and proving that blockchain-based entertainment is far from a fading trend. But the real shockwave in the market? Qubetics, a next-gen blockchain aggregator, is revolutionizing interoperability while its presale rockets past $15.3 million. While Bitcoin remains the go-to asset for security and Gala drives the future of gaming, Qubetics is solving the biggest problem in crypto—seamless, cross-chain transactions without the need for risky third-party bridges. With a mainnet launch set for Q2 2025 and massive upside potential, Qubetics is shaping up to be the highest ROI crypto this year. Qubetics ($TICS) – The Future of Cross-Chain Transactions Blockchain technology has come a long way, but users are still stuck dealing with siloed ecosystems. Want to move assets from Ethereum to Solana? That means using centralized exchanges or risky third-party bridges prone to hacks. Qubetics eliminates these problems with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, allowing seamless asset movement across major blockchains without intermediaries. For example, imagine a business accepting payments in multiple cryptocurrencies. With Qubetics, they can receive and manage BTC, ETH, SOL, and BNB—all in one secure wallet. No more conversion headaches or juggling multiple platforms. Retail users, businesses, and developers all benefit from Qubetics’ unified system, making it a game-changer for Web3 adoption. Qubetics Presale – The Window to Buy at a Low Price is Closing The Qubetics presale is catching fire, and early participants are piling in. With over $15.3 million already raised, 502 million $TICS tokens sold, and more than 23,500 token holders, it’s no wonder crypto circles are calling this one of the hottest opportunities of 2025. The pricing model is simple but powerful: each stage lasts just 7 days, and every Sunday at 12 AM, the token price jumps by 10%. Right now, we’re in Stage 26, with $TICS sitting at $0.1181. If you hop in now and $TICS hits $1, that’s a 746.04% return. If it climbs to $10 post-mainnet, you’re staring at an 8,360.26% ROI. A $100 buy today bags you 846 tokens. At $10, that’s $8,460. At $15? You’re holding $12,590.69. Time is ticking—this isn’t the moment to hesitate. Bitcoin (BTC) – The Market’s Most Reliable Anchor Despite volatility, Bitcoin continues to prove itself as the backbone of the crypto market. As of 2025, Bitcoin is holding strong at critical support levels, with large-scale accumulation from institutions keeping prices steady. Long-term holders are doubling down, with many betting that BTC’s limited supply will fuel its next surge. With global adoption increasing and ETFs providing easier access to traditional finance, Bitcoin remains a safe haven asset for long-term crypto participants. While other projects focus on innovation, BTC’s role as the “digital gold” of the market ensures it remains a staple in every serious portfolio. Market analysts are watching Bitcoin’s next move closely, with many predicting that a successful breakout could push BTC toward new all-time highs. If macroeconomic conditions remain favorable and institutional demand grows, Bitcoin’s dominance will likely continue into 2025 and beyond. Gala (GALA) – Leading the Web3 Gaming Revolution Gaming is one of the biggest industries in the world, and blockchain technology is transforming how players engage with in-game economies. Gala is leading this shift by offering fully decentralized, player-owned ecosystems where in-game assets have real-world value. Gala’s ecosystem allows players to earn, trade, and own digital assets without relying on centralized game publishers. This model is proving successful, with Gala continually expanding its gaming partnerships and strengthening its Web3 footprint. As blockchain gaming adoption increases, Gala remains one of the top projects driving the sector forward. Its model of player-owned economies and decentralized gaming is gaining momentum, and as Web3 adoption grows, Gala’s position as a leader in blockchain gaming will only strengthen. Conclusion – Qubetics is the Highest ROI Crypto to Watch Bitcoin remains the market’s safest bet, and Gala is paving the way for the future of blockchain gaming, but when it comes to groundbreaking innovation and massive upside potential, Qubetics is leading the charge. With $15.3 million already raised, a 10% price increase happening every week, and a Q2 2025 mainnet launch on the horizon, the window to buy $TICS at a low price is closing fast. If Qubetics reaches $10 post-launch, that’s an 8,360% ROI—making it one of the highest ROI cryptos in 2025. For those looking to secure their spot before the next price increase, now is the time to act. Don’t miss out on one of the most innovative projects in Web3.

Monero Trades at $213 In the last 12 months, market observers have spotted that it outperformed major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). According to CoinMarketCap data, XMR is trading at $213.66 , following a 0.62% price increase within the last 24 hours. Before finally resting at this level, the coin climbed to $216.3, representing a 110% spike from its lowest level in 2024. XMR went from trading at a low of $102 in February 2025 to hitting $215. The coin has remained above the 50-week Exponential Moving Average, a sign that bulls are in control. Some technical indicators, including Stochastic RSI and Momentum, are pointed upwards, suggesting an incoming bull season. This trend will likely continue in the coming weeks and probably get the coin to hit $290, like it did in April 2022. Markedly, the positive momentum in the Monero ecosystem is catalyzed by several factors, including Tornado Cash’s woes. Tornado Cash and OFAC Sanction In 2022, the crypto mixer was sanctioned by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, for its role in laundering over $7 billion in crypto from illicit activities. This case also put privacy-focused coins under the radar of the US authorities. However, the case took a different turn in 2024 when a judge ruled that OFAC had erred when it implemented sanctions on the company. The judge cited Tornado Cash’s autonomy and smart contracts, stating that these make it illegible to the purview of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In the long run, the US Treasury Department was forced to lift the sanction , making the crypto mixer service available to US residents. This singular act triggered Monero’s rise to stardom. Woes Faced by Privacy-centered Cryptocurrencies The situation with Tornado Cash and the United States Treasury Department has negatively impacted this category of digital assets. Exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, and HTX even delisted Monero from their platforms. As a result, it was left with trading on small exchanges like Bitifinex, MEX, and KuCoin. With the reinstatement of Tornade Cash , most of these popular crypto exchanges may decide to relist XMR, although no announcement has been made. Dash (DASH), Zcash (ZEC), and Horizen (ZEN) may also be impacted.

It was reported that Tether is currently subject to quarterly reports but not a full independent annual audit, which is much more extensive and provides more assurance to investors and regulators.

Analysts predict DOGE, currently trading around $0.17, could finally reach the $1 mark. Meanwhile, PEPE, now at $0.0000076, is expected to surge to $0.0001, driven by meme coin hype. However, the biggest potential gain lies with MUTM, priced at $0.02 in the third phase of its presale, which is projected to soar past $3, marking a 150x increase. The initiative has managed to gather 6300 owners who helped raise $4.4 million so far. Investors currently take advantage of the $0.02 price point because phase 4 will push the value up to $0.025. Over 50% of the presale has been sold out making this the perfect time for investors to get in before the phase closes. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance keeps attracting users swiftly because its innovative dual-lending model innovates traditional decentralized lending protocols. The confidence level rises as 6300 individuals from various parties spend $4.4 million through the presale funding stage. Investors will benefit from major earning potential when Phase 4 price rises 25% from $0.02 due to upcoming projections. The presale of MUTM received support from 6300 investors because they recognized both its distinctive financial structure and powerful market potential which multiple analysts believe will result in this DeFi project surpassing $5 when it is launched. Mutuum Finance is special in the sense that it blends both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. The P2C model allows users to accrue passive income through USDT liquidity pools, enjoying the fruits of automated smart contract-based lending. Meanwhile, the P2P model provides direct transactions without intermediaries, giving users full control over their funds. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. Building a Secure and Stable Ecosystem Users can find evidence of Mutuum Finance’s stability through its issuance of a completely backed stablecoin using Ethereum network resources. The token achieves trustworthiness over an extended timespan because its overcollateralized design cuts down potential risks contrary to algorithmic stablecoins that face insolvency challenges. Open financial architectures and audited smart contracts alongside this architecture deliver higher investor trust by solving the major issues of past DeFi projects. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance continues to grow its community foundation by providing attractive benefits to users. The Mutuum Finance giveaway offers $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens to ten winners among participants entering the million-dollar contest. Additionally the innovative referral system provides rewards for new investor acquisitions. The platform provides early adopters with special staking pools as well as governance advantages and VIP communication which enhances their continued investment in the platform. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Scarcity in Mutuum Finance derives from supply control during presales together with built-in asset deflation which increases token value. Through staking activities active users gain desirable benefits because stake programs ensure network sustainability in the long run. Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been the face of meme coins. Pepe (PEPE), another meme token riding the wave of viral success, is predicted to hit $0.0001, capitalizing on market enthusiasm. While both coins rely heavily on community hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a fundamentally stronger case for long-term growth. The dual-lending DeFi platform has already attracted 6,300 investors, raising $4.4 million in presale funding. Currently priced at $0.02, MUTM is set to climb to $0.025 in the next phase and could skyrocket past $3, offering a staggering 150x return. Get in today before the presale completes.

According to reports, Binance exchange has emerged the leading CEX by download, beating apps like OKX, Bitget, Coinbase, and Bybit. According to an X post by @crypto_rand, Binance has almost 60 million monthly visits, supports more than 400 coins and saw about 4.83 million downloads in February alone. That number is more than double the amount of downloads OKX, which came in second place, had. Binance leads crypto exchange apps in terms of downloads this month. Source: Sensor Tower As for DEXs, Trust Wallet leads the group in activity and downloads as volume pushes hard. According to an X post from @Axel_bitblaze69 and reposted by Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Trust Wallet beat all other DEXs in the number of wallet downloads it has racked up so far this month. Trust Wallet reportedly got downloaded about 35% more times than other apps like MetaMask, Phantom, Coinbase and Bitget. Trust Wallet retains its popularity among BNB Smart Chain users. Source: Sensor Tower In his X post, Axel highlighted how much Trust Wallet has grown in the past couple of years, claiming that he first downloaded the app in 2021 “for the $BNB memeseason,” and has been using it ever since. Since then, he noted that the wallet has become one of the most widely used with milestones like 200M+ downloads, 2.5M monthly new users and 35% of captured market share with 100+ chain integrations. Axel also called attention to the Trust Wallet zero swap fees campaign, which allows zero swaps for all token pairs on the BNB Smart Chain and will be live until March 27. The campaign was reportedly sponsored by OxProject and 1inch. Building together with the buddy @BNBCHAIN ⚒️ pic.twitter.com/6QMN1cRO3A — Trust Wallet (@TrustWallet) March 21, 2025 “With BSC flipping Solana in DEX volume lately and Trust Wallet still the OG for most BNB on-chain players, those numbers are only getting bigger from here imo,” he concluded his post. In the comment section, there were many who agreed that Trust Wallet is a great innovation, with some claiming they had never encountered any issues while using the app. However, there were also those with complaints about the app. Is it really BNB season? While the BNB token has been showing some strength, rumors of a BNB season are still just that for now, but the excitement is building. The coin is definitely showing solid momentum. It owes much of it to the growing meme coin activity on the chain and technical signals that signal short-term bullishness. Analysts on X have highlighted resistance levels around $640-$665, but if it clears that, they see a potential run to $875. The BNB Chain recently beat out Solana in weekly DEX volume, and it has contributed to the growing euphoria about a possible BNB season. Binance wallet has also promoted 0% trading fees until September which could encourage more trading activity. Overall, many analysts are looking forward to a parabolic move from BNB soon, with some even going as far as tagging the token a silent winner as it weathers the current market volatility. The volatility is one of the threats to the potential BNB season. Bitcoin has not been doing too well and altcoins historically follow its trend so there is skepticism about BNB pumping especially if BTC doesn’t change its downward trajectory. Even if BNB season does happen, some X users have warned that it may not last long. @fishermancrypt0 in a post cautioned that the “BNB season” might fizzle by the weekend if Solana, known for its memes, steals the spotlight. BNB got on the Trump train… briefly Binance’s BNB token has been doing relatively well in the past couple of days. On March 13, the token jumped by 4% after Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump family has been in talks to secure a financial interest in the U.S. arm of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. However, CZ quickly denied any discussions about a deal for Binance.US or conversations about seeking a pardon from the president. “Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong,” he wrot e . “I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with… well, anyone.” 4. Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong.

LTC Market Cap Declines & Bitget PAWS Trading Gains Attention,https://thecoinrise.com/traders-are-flocking-to-blockdags-xp-page-for-big-rewards-ltc-market-cap-declines-bitget-paws-trading-gains-attention/,"Imagine a platform where every action earns rewards, not just for holding coins but for active engagement. That’s exactly what BlockDAG (BDAG) delivers, rewarding participation with BDAG instead of just tracking price movements. On the other hand, Litecoin’s recent 11.05% decline pushed its market cap down to $6.5 billion, while Bitget PAWS trading began its pre-market phase. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is setting new records. Being part of BlockDAG is about more than just acquiring BDAG—it’s about earning XP, unlocking significant rewards, and rising up the leaderboard. Unlike Litecoin’s price fluctuations and PAWS’ early-stage appeal, BlockDAG’s 2,380% rise since batch 1 and $205 million raised in presale funding show clear momentum. With fresh achievements released weekly, users keep accumulating BDAG, proving that in crypto, active participants reap the most rewards. Litecoin (LTC) Market Cap Declines Following 11.05% Price Drop On March 12, 2025, Litecoin (LTC) recorded an 11.05% price dip, bringing its value down to $89.11. This decline significantly impacted the Litecoin market cap, reducing it to $6.5 billion. The drop followed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s postponement of several cryptocurrency ETF approvals, including one tied to Litecoin. This regulatory delay led to increased selling pressure, driving the price down further. Although market analysts have mixed opinions about Litecoin’s next move, some remain hopeful about future recovery. However, market watchers are keeping a close eye on the Litecoin market cap and price shifts as uncertainty persists. Bitget PAWS Trading Begins Early Access for Millions of Users Bitget has introduced pre-market trading for PAWS, allowing users to engage in transactions before its official launch. The pre-market phase lets traders buy and sell PAWS ahead of its full listing, using Bitget’s over-the-counter system for early-stage access. PAWS, a Telegram-based mini-game, rewards users with PAWS tokens for completing in-app activities. Developed by the same team behind Notcoin and Dogs, PAWS has grown rapidly, now attracting over 32 million users. By adding PAWS, Bitget continues its push to introduce tokens with strong community backing and widespread user engagement. BlockDAG’s Achievement Page Turns Engagement Into Profits! BlockDAG’s Achievement Page changes how crypto participation works. Instead of simply holding BDAG, users accumulate XP (Experience Points) through their interactions, unlocking special rewards in the process. This approach motivates continued engagement while offering real returns. XP is earned by completing tasks like purchasing BDAG and taking part in exclusive bonus programs. The more XP collected, the greater the rewards, which include special perks and leaderboard recognition. With new achievements introduced every week, earning opportunities remain high, ensuring active users benefit the most. Currently valued at $0.0248 in Batch 27, BlockDAG has soared 2,380% since its presale launch, accumulating over $205 million. The XP system enhances this momentum, offering a structured pathway for users to earn additional BDAG. With XP playing a key role in the ecosystem, participation goes beyond passive holding—it creates a direct path to higher earnings. BlockDAG’s reward system does more than acknowledge engagement; it provides a competitive advantage to those maximizing their involvement. More XP means more BDAG payouts, making every interaction worthwhile. Top Crypto Coins 2025— Final Remarks! The crypto market is no longer just about price trends—it’s about long-term development and utility. Litecoin’s market cap dropped to $6.5 billion after an 11.05% decline, largely due to ETF delays. Meanwhile, Bitget’s PAWS trading is attracting early traders, aiming to transform its Telegram mini-game into a major crypto asset. While these two face their respective challenges, BlockDAG is changing the way crypto works by making engagement profitable. With a 2,380% price surge and $205 million secured in its crypto presale , BlockDAG is more than just a digital asset—it’s an active ecosystem where participation turns into real value. The XP system ensures users benefit at every stage, rewarding involvement with direct BDAG earnings.

Bitcoin Shows Bullishness As Analyst Sets ‘Blast Off’ Date, Here’s When",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/global-m2-vs-bitcoin-bullishness/,"A recent analysis comparing Bitcoin’s price movement and the Global M2 money supply has added another data point to the growing argument for a bullish phase ahead for the cryptocurrency. Colin, a crypto analyst known on social media platform X as “The M2 Guy,” recently shared an update suggesting that Bitcoin may be on the verge of a significant upward move, and the expected timeline might continue to test the patience of Bitcoin traders. Bitcoin’s Incoming Rally May Mirror M2’s Explosive Growth Colin, a crypto analyst known on X as “The M2 Guy,” has continued to build his case around the correlation between Bitcoin and macro liquidity trends. His outlook on Bitcoin, which is currently bullish, is based on an offset correlation between the cryptocurrency’s price action on the daily candlestick chart and the global M2 money supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin Vs. Global M2 Money Supply Shows A Big Move Coming, Here’s The Target In a previous analysis, the analyst noted that Bitcoin’s price action on the daily candlestick chart has the best correlations on the 70-day and 107-day offsets. The most recent update from the analyst focuses on the 107-day offset, which he termed “the most likely scenario.” Analysis of Bitcoin’s 107-day offset with the global M2 money supply shows that Bitcoin is about to go on a blast-off spike. However, this isn’t just about a one-day spike. Colin projects the rally could last for two months based on the sharp vertical trend of the global M2 supply. As for the timing, the 107-day offset suggests that the blast-off spike is expected to kick off around April 30 based on a mathematically strong correlation. If the M2 line continues its upward surge, the rally could last even longer. Focus On The Macro, Not Just The Day Although April 30 is a focal point in his projection, Colin cautioned followers not to become overly fixated on the exact date. “Don’t get caught up in the weeds,” he advised. The larger narrative is more important, reflected in the soaring global M2 levels, which should create an environment ripe for Bitcoin and other crypto assets to benefit from increased liquidity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Net Position Turns Green For The First Time In 2025 In terms of a price target, the current trajectory of the global M2 money supply points to a rally above $140,000. However, interesting predictions have suggested that the Bitcoin price has a chance of doubling before the end of 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $84,310, having spent the last 24 hours trading in a range between $83,700 and $84,300. Based on this analysis of correlation with the global M2 money, bullish Bitcoin investors might need to wait for at least another month before any significant movement. This delay might pose challenges for short-term traders depending on their positioning and risk tolerance. On the other hand, it gives long-term holders the opportunity to accumulate more bitcoins at the current low price before the predicted rally.

AAVE is on the edge of a significant squeeze, while Stacks faces a crucial resistance level. The market's next move could determine the future path for both coins. Investors are watching closely, eager to see if these assets will break out or break down. Aave Market Trends: Past Movements and Key Levels Analysis Last month Aave saw a notable decline of 28.64%, contrasting with a six-month gain of 11.15% that signals recovery and resilience. Price behavior over these periods reflects significant volatility with a temporary dip that has given way to a moderate rebound across a broader timeline. Current price action is trading between $136 and $290.80 with support around $79.81 and resistance near $389.26, while a second resistance appears at $543.99. Indicators show mixed pressure with a slightly negative summary recommendation and moving averages, indicating rivalry between bulls and bears. Traders may consider opportunities around these levels, potentially buying near support and targeting the initial resistance. Stacks Slump Hints at Bearish Pressure and Key Price Barriers Last month STX showed a notable drop of nearly 29%, while the half-year performance displayed a decline of roughly 64%. Price behavior indicated a strong downward movement that negatively impacted investor sentiment and led to a decline in momentum. The overall trend during these periods strongly leaned toward lower values, with negative indicators highlighting ongoing pressure on the coin. Current prices range from approximately $0.58 to $1.21, with immediate resistance around $1.60 and support near $0.32. Bears dominate the market, as evidenced by the negative momentum and a sub-50 RSI. Traders might look for a potential bounce from the support level before testing resistance, although a clear uptrend has not yet developed. Conclusion AAVE and STX are at critical points. AAVE is under strong pressure and must find stability. STX faces a key resistance level that could determine its path. Decisions made now will shape their futures. Market trends and investor reactions will be crucial. Watching these developments closely is essential for understanding their next moves.

Report shows that banks still hesitate to work with crypto companies, making it difficult to open accounts, process payments, and run their businesses smoothly. Many believe this is part of “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” While President Donald Trump has shown support for the crypto industry , experts believe that the problem of debanking is yet over. DeBanking Issues Persists Amid Crypto-Friendly Policies The issue of debanking has been ongoing for years, but it got worse in early 2023 when many crypto-friendly banks started to collapse . This made people worry that the government was trying to stop crypto investors from using traditional banks, calling this situation “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” In 2025, President Trump took several steps in favor of cryptocurrency. He recently ordered that Bitcoin seized from criminal cases be used to create a national reserve. However, despite these efforts, crypto firms continue to struggle with banking access. The Federal Reserve Is Still Against Crypto Banking In a recent interview, Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank , stated that the Federal Reserve remains a major obstacle. She pointed out that two crypto-friendly banks are currently under close examination by the Fed. Some regulatory officials have allegedly pressured certain banks to halt digital asset operations, citing regulatory uncertainty. Long believes this is part of a larger strategy to regulate how banks engage with cryptocurrency tightly. Even though some regulators have relaxed their rules on crypto, the Federal Reserve has not changed its stance. Many in the industry are concerned since the agency is still led by officials appointed before Trump’s latest moves. They fear the restrictions will persist until new leadership takes over. A Global Problem for Crypto Firms Crypto companies outside the U.S. are also facing similar challenges. In Europe, many crypto firms have had their bank accounts shut down multiple times in recent years. Some companies have been forced to move their operations from one country to another to find banks working with them. Crypto businesses have lost time and money trying to work with banks. Many spend years and millions searching for a bank, only to face rejection. Even those following all the rules still struggle for basic services. While 2024 was a better year for some European crypto firms, the issue has not been fully solved. Regardless, many hope that the situation will improve. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently announced a more relaxed approach to how banks can work with crypto businesses. This decision came just hours after President Trump promised to end the crackdown on crypto firms’ banking access. During the White House Crypto Summit, the president assured industry leaders that he was ending Operation Chokepoint 2.0. Despite these promises, many in the industry remain cautious.

Messari’s latest analysis revealed that the figure rose from $51.2 million to $79.5 million. Market Participation Plummets Despite this growth, both the average daily sellers and buyers declined significantly, with daily sellers dropping 43.0% from approximately 1,500 to 880, and daily buyers falling 38.1% from about 1,300 to 800. This suggests a shift toward higher average transaction values amid fewer market participants. The sales surge was primarily driven by strong demand for Guild of Guardians Heroes and Avatars NFTs, which accounted for more than 99% of the total NFT trading volume in the quarter. Most of the sales occurred on Immutable zkEVM, where Guild of Guardians NFTs are traded. Immutable zkEVM also saw a substantial 73.3% rise in average daily NFT sales volume, growing from around $484,000 in Q3 to $839,000 in Q4, boosting its share of total sales volume to over 97% across both chains. During the same period, Immutable zkEVM saw a decline in user engagement following record highs in Q3. In fact, average daily transactions decreased by 21.1% quarter-over-quarter, from approximately 595,000 in Q3 to around 469,000 in Q4. Similarly, average daily active addresses dropped 23.8%, from about 267,000 to 204,000, and average daily new addresses fell 29.8% to roughly 32,000 by the end of the quarter. This decline in activity mirrored broader trends in the GameFi market, which according to Messari, likely reflects a cooldown after the surge in Q3 driven by popular game releases like Guild of Guardians, Immortal Rising 2, and Illuvium. Throughout last year, Immutable progressively expanded developer access to zkEVM. In October, the platform removed its deployer allowlist which allowed for permissionless deployment of smart contracts and applications. This move lowers entry barriers for developers, positioning Immutable zkEVM for increased developer activity in the coming months. In Q4 2024, average daily transaction fees on Immutable zkEVM fell by 17.0% quarter-over-quarter, from approximately 574 IMX to 477 IMX. Messari attributed this decline to reduced network congestion, which was a result of lower transaction activity during the period. To improve the user experience, Immutable has implemented a policy where it covers all gas fees for Immutable Passport holders, removing the need for players to pay gas fees and thereby reducing friction in the transaction process. By the end of 2024, the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) on Immutable decreased to $13.8 million. This decline was likely due to a quarter-over-quarter drop in the price of the IMX token, which reduced the USD value of locked assets. However, TVL measured in IMX showed a positive trend, increasing by almost 17% quarter-over-quarter to 10.33 million IMX, which suggests that the rise could have been driven by capital inflows despite the decrease in USD value. Immutable’s SEC Trouble On November 1, 2024, Immutable announced that it had received a Wells notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – an enforcement action concerning its 2021 IMX token sales. Immutable expressed concerns over the notice and released a statement saying that it was issued with limited prior communication and minimal details. The company had then highlighted that the notice was delivered shortly after its first direct interaction with the securities regulators which raised questions about the timing and transparency of the process. Fast forward to 2025, the SEC has closed several of its crypto investigations, with no enforcement charges resulting from probes into OpenSea , Gemini , Robinhood Crypto, and Uniswap . However, investigations into Immutable, and other platforms such as Crypto.com, and Unicoin are still ongoing.

According to recent technical analysis, this resistance zone has triggered past reversals, and analysts caution that another failure to break above could lead to a downward correction. The altcoin is trading within a descending channel, a pattern typically associated with bearish trends. While some analysts remain optimistic about a potential rebound, others warn that the next move could push ETH price lower, targeting a key support of $1,700. Analysts Warn of Ethereum Price Potential Fall to $1,700 According to a recent analysis, Ethereum price is nearing a resistance zone at $2,200. This level coincides with the upper boundary of a Descending Channel. Technical analysts consider this pattern bearish. Price movements within the channel have shown lower highs and lower lows, indicating downward pressure. Crypto analyst MadWhale shared a chart showing Ethereum trading close to this critical resistance. Previous interactions with this level have led to downward reversals. The analyst suggests that failure to break this zone may trigger a 13% decline. The projected target is $1,700, a level that has previously served as support. Source: TradingView More so, another recent analysis shows that ETH/BTC is currently testing a critical support zone last seen in late 2020, raising the possibility of a trend reversal after years of decline. This technical setup, combined with record-high futures open interest of 10.23M ETH, signals a rising potential for a rebound. Technical Indicators Support a Bearish Outlook The Ethereum price chart also shows weakening bullish momentum. A rounded top pattern is forming near the resistance. This technical formation suggests that buying pressure is declining. Volume analysis reveals that trading activity is inconsistent, with low participation during recent gains and higher volume during declines. Lower highs on the daily chart further support a potential downward continuation. These are typical in bearish trends. Traders are advised to monitor for signs of increased selling pressure. Confirmation of a rejection, such as a bearish candlestick pattern or rising sell volume, could strengthen the case for a decline toward $1,700. According to the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), ETH is currently showing signs of waning bearish momentum as the MACD line is approaching a bullish crossover with the signal line. If this crossover occurs and is supported by increasing histogram bars, it could indicate a potential price rebound for the top altcoin. Alternate Scenario: Analyst Forecasts Bullish Targets While bearish indicators persist, some market observers maintain a positive view. Analyst Patron has outlined three possible bullish price targets. According to his analysis, if the top altcoin holds support near $1,980, a short-term rally could occur. His initial target is $2,296, reflecting a potential increase of over 15%. Source: X Further upside targets include $2,913 and $4,000. These projections assume that current support holds and momentum shifts in favor of buyers. The analyst’s outlook is based on Ethereum price recovering from recent lows and reclaiming previous highs. This scenario would challenge the bearish narrative if confirmed by increased volume. At press time, the crypto is trading at $1,999.75, marking a 1.20% gain over the past 24 hours. Despite the price uptick, trading volume has dropped sharply by 37.37%, indicating a possible divergence.

The whale, who first acquired Bitcoin in late 2016, had been holdings in a single address for nearly a decade. In early 2017, the whale’s BTC holdings were worth around $3 million. Today, the same assets are worth over $250 million due to Bitcoin’s massive price increase over the years. The sudden movement at this long-inactive address has led to speculation about the whale’s intentions. Such movements typically precede market changes, as large holders may be either preparing to sell or reallocating funds for other purposes.

42176232,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=698164,1742685372,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42176232.jpeg,"Trump’s economic policies put $5,000 DOGE dividend checks on hold",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-delays-5000-doge-checks/,"The $5,000 DOGE dividend checks sit in limbo as stock markets quiver and inflation fears grow. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plans and revived pleas for the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates complicate the economic landscape. Despite growing anticipation, taxpayers remain in the dark about the direct payment stimulus checks. Trump has maintained that the economic toll from tariffs is a necessary “detox” for the US economy. Yet his administration’s hesitance to issue direct payments — despite its initial backing of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — points to a move away from immediate financial relief toward more systemic economic restructuring. As Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues its effort to gut the government, the idea has been floated that savings could end up in checks mailed to taxpayers . Trump had embraced the notion before, describing it as a “20% dividend” from less waste and inefficiency. Analysts had estimated that the amount to each taxpaying household could approach $5,000, but economic turmoil has placed the proposal on the back burner. “If you can save the government $2 trillion, that’s $5,000 per household. Even if we save only half that, it’s still $2,500,” James Fishback, the CEO of an investment firm, said in an interview. “That’s real money.” However, leading economists caution that flooding the economy with large sums could stoke inflation rather than ease financial hardship. America finds it difficult to walk a thin line between headline inflation and stimulus MDRN Capital CEO Aaron Cirksena warned that stimulus checks threaten to ignite the already blistering-hot economy. Cirksena cautioned that putting $5,000 into the economy per household sounds nice but can be inflationary. He estimated that spending would create demand and inflation, and saving or investing would push it out but leave a hole in the future. Another Trump aide, Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, defended the plan and dismissed worries about inflation. The notion that the checks would cause inflation was not rooted in actual economics, he said, and if tax cuts are spent in the long term by returning money to taxpayers, then the cuts will finance themselves. Since the administration has previously expressed interest in DOGE dividends, it will value tax reductions, infrastructure spending, and tariffs over direct payments. Cirksena also elaborated that Trump’s approach seems more investment-oriented in the industry than in cash payments to people. Cirksena likened direct cash stimulus to an adrenaline injection, which was swift but fleeting. He also referred to infrastructure investment as a strength program that, although slower to come together, lasted longer. Jonathan Ernest, a Case Western Reserve University professor, was also concerned about the same issue; he reasoned that stimulus checks would counteract the Federal Reserve’s move to lower inflation. Since inflation is still in excess, the addition of stimulus now would be contrary to monetary policy currently, DOGE dividend’s future is uncertain Alice Kassens, the Center for Economic Freedom director and a professor of economics at Roanoke College said that much depends on how recipients spend the payout. The plan was designed to give dividends only to net payers of income taxes, she noted, hoping that, unlike pandemic-era stimulus checks (meant to maintain consumption), the money would be saved by households that save more. The $5,000 DOGE dividend is currently in limbo. Trump has not fully eliminated it, but the economy’s current state and changes in policy priorities suggest that the initiative is on indefinite hold. Ernest pointed out the irony that if Trump’s tariffs and job cuts destabilized the economy enough, a stimulus payment may become necessary. The administration may reconsider the idea if economic pressures build, with national debts now topping $36 trillion and midterm elections coming up. Until then, a taxpayer hunting for DOGE dividends will have to wait. Besides, the DOGE dividends have been met with skepticism as to whether achieving the big savings required is feasible. Experts and lawmakers said it was impractical to find such significant waste within the federal budget. The proposal would also exclude some low-income people, retirees, and certain families; DOGE checks would only go to tax-paying households. The plan is also difficult to implement because it requires Congress’ approval, and there was skepticism over whether the suggested savings would be realized.

The unfolding market dynamics suggest that these two digital currencies may be gearing up for notable movement. Discover which coins are poised for potential growth amidst these developments. Solana Price Insights: Recent Trends and Key Levels SOL dropped nearly 23% over the past month and about 10% over the last six months, with a slight 3% decline in the past week. Price movements have been uneven, marking a period of volatility and mixed momentum. Technical swings have highlighted both sharp corrections and brief recoveries, indicating ongoing uncertainty in past performance. Currently, SOL trades between $104 and $213.04, facing immediate resistance at $277.85 and further overhead at $386.39 while support stands near $60.77.

Ethereum Price Trends: Key Levels & Recent Market Movements Monthly drop of 26.77% and a half-year decline of 22.93% mark the recent performance. A one-week gain of 3.95% hints at fleeting recovery amid overall weakness and volatility. Price adjustments over these periods reflect investor caution and a challenging environment for the coin.

While the premier cryptocurrency recorded a price breakout on March 20 to reclaim the $87,000 price zone, selling pressure soon forced a return to below $84,700, resuming a sideways movement. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price action over the past few months has created a bullish pattern hinting at a substantial price breakout. Related Reading: Is It Time To Buy The Bitcoin Dip? Analysts Share Insights On Current Market Conditions Bitcoin Falling Wedge Signals Another Major Rally- How High Can BTC Fly? In a recent post on X, a digital asset market analyst with the username Mister Crypto provided some bullish insights on the Bitcoin market based on a continuation chart pattern and historical price data. According to Mister Crypto, Bitcoin’s price appears to be forming a falling wedge suggesting a possible price surge could occur upon breakout. The falling wedge is a familiar bullish pattern in technical analysis formed by two converging trend lines due to price action forming lower highs and lower lows. It usually indicates that bearish momentum is weakening and Bitcoin could embark on a sustained uptrend following a breakout from the upper trend line. Interestingly, Mister Crypto notes that Bitcoin has consistently experienced strong price rallies following previous formations of a falling wedge as indicated in the chart above. Notably, there have been three distinct cases in the past two years during which the premier cryptocurrency has surged for an average of 54 days producing an average gain of 67.5%. Looking at the previous periods and the gradual rise in price gain, Bitcoin could rise by an estimated 77% upon a confirmed breakout from its current falling wedge suggesting a strong bullish market in the majority of Q2 2025.

This development is strongly bullish as it indicates growing market confidence in price appreciation as investors are opting to keep their assets rather than sell. At the time of trading, Bitcoin trades at $84,309 reflecting a price loss of 0.14% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the flagship crypto asset is down by 0.39% on the 7-day chart as consolidation continues. BTC must decisively break above $84,700, avoiding any retrace to confirm any intent of an uptrend.

The lending option will target long-term Bitcoin holders who might need access to cash but don't want to sell their digital assets. Many crypto holders choose to sit on their investments by holding them in secure Bitcoin wallets . While the best crypto wallets will facilitate easy access and use, there are still many consumers who see crypto as an investment opportunity and choose to sit on it rather than use it as an active digital currency. How the Loans Will Work Xapo Bank now offers US Dollar loans of up to £1 million to customers and their product differs from previous crypto-backed loan products. They offer no collateral re-usage on BTC assets and store the collateral in their purpose-built crypto-vault which uses MPC (multiparty computation custody. The product offers flexible terms with repayment schedules available from just 30 days, up to 90, 180, and 365 days. Customers will also benefit from there being no penalties attached to early repayments. Eligibility As with any financial product, eligibility factors will come into who can apply for these loans. Consumers will be pre-approved for the loans based on eligibility criteria established by XapoBank. The most significant factor that will affect eligibility is how much Bitcoin holdings the consumer has and how long they have held it for. Long-term holdings will be preferred, with the product being made available to global investors, excluding the United States. Could this Signal a Return to Crypto Lending This is not the first time crypto lending products have been offered to consumers, but it has taken 3 years for the industry to recover from the bear market in 2022 which led to the collapse of lenders including BlockFi and Celsius. The collapse of the crypto lending industry resulted in a loss of trust that Xapo Bank is working hard to restore. By offering a product that removes asset rehypothecation and providing customers with a variety of risk management tools and protection against automatic liquidation, Xapo Bank is beginning to gain the trust of consumers. The Current Crypto Climate The end of 2024 and the beginning of 2025 saw cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin in particular, enjoy record-breaking valuations. This came as a result of political backing, particularly in the US. Plans for America to implement a transparent regulatory framework for crypto businesses have seen renewed confidence in digital currencies. While recent values have dropped, they still remain relatively high across the board and this has seen greater adoption across consumers and businesses. With more businesses around the world beginning to accept cryptocurrencies because of the countless benefits to international transactions, the industry is starting to appeal to those who might have previously seen it as a fad. Speculation about the US Federal Reserve stepping in to stabilize markets and rumours of the White House planning to invest heavily in Bitcoin has experts predicting another Bitcoin price boom, which could be great news for lenders and consumers.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-03-22 23:36:38

The temporary delay will give ByteDance time to sell its well-known social media platform. However, if it does not find a buyer for TikTok’s U.S. operations, then the ban passed by Congress will take effect on April 5. Oracle moves forward, becoming the centre of focus in the TikTok deal Vice President JD Vance told reporters that it was almost certain that a high-level agreement would address U.S. national security issues by early April. In addition, President Trump said last weekend that four bidders had shown up, but he did not name them. Names proposed earlier by Trump and others included Microsoft (MSFT), AI startup Perplexity, a coalition of billionaire investors, and even the U.S. government. However, Oracle’s name kept coming up. Notably, Oracle previously attempted to acquire TikTok in 2020 during Trump’s first term but failed. Despite this, the company remains deeply involved with TikTok as its primary cloud provider. In 2022, Tiktok began directing its U.S. traffic through Oracle’s cloud as part of a “Project Texas” overhaul to comply with U.S. regulations on domestic data storage. A report published last week revealed that Oracle recently became a top candidate to help TikTok escape its current situation. However, the executives of ByteDance are said to want to continue to be actively involved in TikTok’s business operations in any such agreement. Bloomberg separately reported that the White House is considering a deal with Oracle to give the tech giant a stake in the company in exchange for protecting American data on TikTok while leaving ByteDance control of the app’s algorithm. On the other hand, TikTok and its CEO, Shou Zi Chew, have repeatedly resisted sharing the app’s proprietary algorithm. A request for comment from Oracle and TikTok was not answered. On Friday, Reuters presented another Oracle scenario stating that while Oracle safeguarded U.S. user data to prevent China from accessing it, the largest non-Chinese investors in ByteDance may increase their current holdings and purchase TikTok’s U.S. operations as part of a new company. In this case, Chinese ownership in the new company would drop under the crucial 20% level to avoid the U.S. ban. Among these investors are General Atlantic, owned by Bill Ford, and Susquehanna International Group, owned by Jeff Yass. Vice President JD Vance remains optimistic that an agreement on TikTok will be reached Although Politico reported earlier that Oracle is “accelerating talks” with the White House on TikTok and that company representatives were scheduled to visit Capitol Hill last week to meet with lawmakers regarding the negotiations, reports indicated that no deal had yet been finalized on the platform. In an interview with NBC on Friday, Vance said that although an agreement on TikTok would probably be reached by April 5, it was still unclear whether the deal would be finalized by then. He highlighted that similar deals, which were much smaller and required less capital, took months to close. “I think that the outlines of this thing will be very clear by April 5,” Vance said. “The question is whether we can get all the paper done.” Since the Chinese government needed to approve any measure in which ByteDance divests from TikTok, one significant issue that was reportedly still up for debate was whether or not it would approve any final TikTok deal. However, China has recently become less aggressive, stating that such business deals should be determined independently per market principles. The Chinese government and ByteDance have long opposed any attempts to sell TikTok. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Bitcoin’s meteoric rise created fortunes overnight, but its window of opportunity has already closed. Now, the focus has shifted to finding the next top-rated crypto that could follow a similar explosive path. With dozens of contenders, five names are grabbing attention for all the right reasons: Solana (SOL), Aave (AAVE), Ethereum (ETH), BlockDAG (BDAG), and Thorchain (RUNE). These projects are not just surviving—they’re building momentum. If you”re wondering where the next big opportunity lies, now is the time to take a closer look before prices move beyond reach. 1. BlockDAG: Could Be the Top-Rated Crypto Soon BlockDAG (BDAG) is catching the eye of serious buyers. With its advanced hybrid blockchain tech, BDAG delivers faster transaction speeds and superior scalability through its DAG-based model. This approach gives BlockDAG a clear advantage over traditional blockchains bogged down by slow processing and high fees. What’s driving BlockDAG’s appeal? Its presale numbers are setting records. The project has already raised over $205 million, with its price sitting at $0.0248 in batch 27. Early buyers are enjoying a 2,380% return, drawing even more interest as word spreads. The excitement suggests another price surge may be just around the corner. Right now, BlockDAG is offering its most generous bonus yet—400% extra coins with the BDAG800 code. For anyone eyeing the next top-rated crypto, BDAG offers a window of opportunity that may not stay open for long. 2. Aave (AAVE): DeFi Lending That’s Gaining Ground Aave (AAVE) has earned its place in the DeFi space by making crypto lending and borrowing seamless and accessible. Users can deposit their digital assets, earn interest, and borrow funds through Aave’s smart contracts—all without middlemen. Its liquidity pools support major assets like Tether (USDT) and DAI, giving it a key role in DeFi. What sets Aave apart is its push into real-world assets through its partnership with Centrifuge. This move bridges traditional finance with blockchain, expanding its use cases. As DeFi grows, AAVE could prove to be the top-rated crypto for those betting on decentralized finance. 3. Solana (SOL): Speed & Low Fees Keep It in the Spotlight Solana (SOL) continues to impress with its lightning-fast transactions and affordable fees. It emerged as one of the strongest alternatives to Ethereum, thanks to a growing community of developers launching DeFi projects, NFT marketplaces, and more on its blockchain. Despite facing major challenges in 2022 and 2023, Solana has staged an impressive comeback in 2024. It’s already delivered significant returns, but analysts believe there’s still upside potential left. With its network efficiency and expanding ecosystem, Solana remains a top-rated crypto worth watching. 4. Ethereum (ETH): The Original Smart Contract Powerhouse Ethereum (ETH) remains a leader in blockchain innovation. It pioneered smart contracts and built the foundation for thousands of decentralized applications (dApps). As the second-largest crypto by market cap, Ethereum continues to anchor DeFi, NFTs, and countless blockchain projects. Its 2022 shift to proof-of-stake dramatically cut energy usage by over 99.9%. In July 2024, the SEC approved Ethereum ETFs, boosting its reputation and reach. While competitors are emerging, Ethereum’s long-established dominance and mainstream adoption keep it in the conversation as a top-rated crypto. 5. Thorchain (RUNE): The Decentralized Exchange Gaining Momentum Thorchain (RUNE) offers a compelling alternative to centralized exchanges. As a decentralized exchange (DEX), it allows users to trade over 5,500 cryptocurrencies directly from their wallets without relying on middlemen. Its automated market maker (AMM) model guarantees liquidity, making transactions simple and secure. Following the collapse of centralized platforms like FTX in 2022, many traders are turning to decentralized solutions. Thorchain gives users full control of their funds, establishing itself as the top-rated crypto for those prioritizing security and decentralization in their trading experience. Which Project Will Earn the Title of Top-Rated Crypto? Still weighing your options for the top-rated crypto? Aave’s expansion into real-world lending gives it an edge in DeFi. Thorchain appeals to those seeking decentralized, self-custodial trading platforms. Solana and Ethereum remain key players, but their past highs and continued market swings make them riskier bets for cautious investors. BlockDAG, however, is just beginning its rise. Currently priced at $0.0248 in its presale, BDAG holds enormous growth potential. With more than $205 million raised and early buyers seeing 2,380% gains, BlockDAG is making its case as the next top-rated crypto to buy now.

42178917,https://thecoinrise.com/heres-why-miners-are-leaving-pi-network-for-blockdags-x1-mining-app/,1742688008,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/42178917.jpeg,Here’s Why Miners Are Leaving Pi Network for BlockDAG’s X1 Mining App,https://thecoinrise.com/heres-why-miners-are-leaving-pi-network-for-blockdags-x1-mining-app/,"Crypto mining has undergone a major transformation. Gone are the days when high-cost hardware and huge energy demands were the only way in. Mobile mining has opened up the process to millions, and for a time, Pi Network led the charge, offering a free and straightforward method to earn crypto. But times have changed. Pi Network has seen its price fall by 23% in just one week, and confidence among its user base is fading. In response, many miners are shifting their focus to BlockDAG X1 App, now recognized by many as the best crypto mining app in the market. With over 500,000 users mining BDAG daily, the X1 App is reshaping mobile mining. While Pi Network struggles to hold attention and value, BlockDAG’s growing ecosystem, robust presale, and pathway to major exchanges stand out. Here’s why so many are making the move to BlockDAG—and why mining BDAG now could pay off if its value reaches the projected $1 mark. Pi Network’s Struggles Are Pushing Miners to New Opportunities Pi Network was once seen as a leader in mobile crypto mining. However, delays in its mainnet launch, liquidity concerns, and falling prices have raised serious doubts about its future. Its price has dropped 23% in just seven days, down to $1.38. Meanwhile, investor withdrawals continue to climb. If this negative trend persists, Pi Network may not hold its $1.19 support level, with further declines toward $1.00 likely. These ongoing issues are prompting miners to seek out more promising alternatives. BlockDAG’s X1 App has quickly gained traction as a trusted solution. Its stable platform and efficient mining process offer users a better opportunity to earn BDAG coins without the uncertainty. Why BlockDAG’s X1 Miner Is Emerging as the Best Crypto Mining App 1. Easy and Accessible—Mining BDAG Is Simple for Everyone BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App stands apart from traditional mining methods. Instead of investing in expensive equipment or facing high energy costs, users can mine BDAG with a single tap each day. The app works on both iOS and Android, making it accessible to anyone, regardless of their technical skills. No costly hardware required—just a smartphone. No rising electricity bills—mobile mining remains energy-efficient. One-tap simplicity—just open the app daily to earn BDAG. 2. BlockDAG’s Ecosystem Is Expanding Fast BlockDAG’s presale has made headlines, raising over $205 million and selling 18.8 billion BDAG coins at a current price of $0.0248 in Batch 27. This success inspires confidence among early miners and suggests that BDAG could become a valuable asset once listed on exchanges. Unlike Pi Network, which still faces challenges securing exchange listings, BlockDAG has already confirmed plans for over 10 major centralized exchange listings after its presale. The BDAG coins being mined today are expected to be tradable soon, potentially increasing their worth substantially. 3. Real Earnings—Earn 20 BDAG Per Day with Significant Upside One of the key advantages of using the X1 App is the potential to accumulate BDAG without spending money upfront. The earnings breakdown looks like this: Daily reward: 20 BDAG Monthly total: 600 BDAG (20 BDAG x 30 days) Annual total: 7,200 BDAG (20 BDAG x 365 days) At BDAG’s current price of $0.0248, this annual total is worth $178.56. If BDAG achieves its $1 target post-listing, those same coins could be valued at $7,200—a staggering 3,932% increase from current mining rewards. Why Mining BDAG with BlockDAG’s X1 App Makes Sense Now 1. Major Growth Potential—BDAG Could Hit $1 BlockDAG’s adoption is accelerating, and its DAG-based parallel processing technology gives it a real edge over older blockchains. As exchange listings approach, demand for BDAG could surge. Those who mine early through the X1 App might secure life-changing gains if BDAG hits the predicted $1 value. 2. Zero-Cost Passive Income Mining with BlockDAG’s X1 App is entirely free, removing the financial risks typically tied to traditional mining. Users collect BDAG daily, without worrying about hardware investments or energy consumption, while waiting for potential price increases. 3. BlockDAG’s Ecosystem Continues to Grow Beyond mining, BlockDAG is building a complete blockchain ecosystem. Notable initiatives include: A $30 million Developer Grants Program designed to attract DeFi, NFT, and dApp projects. A partnership with HackerEarth to host global hackathons, driving innovation within the network. Collaboration with SpaceDev to provide technical expertise and enhance BlockDAG’s infrastructure. These developments show that BDAG isn’t just another token—it’s a long-term player with increasing adoption and utility. What’s Next for Mobile Mining? While Pi Network’s future remains uncertain, BlockDAG has stepped up as the best crypto mining app of 2025. Its easy-to-use X1 Miner, record-setting presale, and soon-to-launch CEX listings make it an attractive option for miners seeking strong potential returns with zero upfront investment. Miners who start collecting BDAG today could see their holdings grow dramatically if BDAG hits $1. With over 500,000 users already mining through the X1 App, the opportunity to get in early won’t last forever.

Binance Launchpool, which lets users stake coins to farm new assets, says its 65th project will be Nillion (NIL), a secure computation network that decentralizes trust for high-value and private data. Explains the project, “Nillion is Humanity’s First Blind Computer – a whole new category of decentralized network designed for AI and the future of the Internet. Nillion makes new applications possible by providing storage and computation on high-value, encrypted data without ever seeing it. Whether a user, an app, or an enterprise, your data stays yours – always.” Between March 21st and 24th, Binance users can lock their BNB , the crypto exchange platform’s native asset, as well as the stablecoins First Digital USD ( FDUSD ) and USDC , to receive NIL airdrops. The top global crypto exchange then plans to list the asset on March 24th. Binance will attach a seed tag to NIL, which the exchange applies to lower-liquidity projects that may exhibit higher volatility compared to other listed tokens. Binance requires users who own assets with seed tags to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they’re aware of the risks before trading the tokens.

Ethereum (ETH) Bulls Defending $2,000 Support After Profit-Taking Phase Ethereum (ETH) ended the week on a strong note signaling enhanced optimism ahead of the impending Pectra mainnet update . Hoodi network update deployment. Following former U.S. President Donald Trump’s appearance at Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit, ETH price surged to a weekly high above $2,070. Ethereum price action | March 23 However, amid the rally, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to pause interest rate hikes boosted risk-on sentiment across crypto markets. This led traders to take early profits on large ETH and BTC holdings, shifting capital toward low-cap altcoins with high-growth potential. As the market rotation cools, ETH price has shown signs of active buy-side pressure. As of March 23, Ethereum price continues to consolidate well above key support levels. Investors Deposit $220M into Ethereum 2.0 Staking Contracts in 48 Hours When Ethereum price dropped below $2,000 on Friday, many expected cascading liquidations to drive prices lower. However, 48 hours later, ETH has remained resilient above the $1,950 mark. On-chain data trends suggest increased staking among investors has helped stabilize prices. Official Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain contracts show a significant surge in ETH deposits within the last 48 hours. Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain Staking Deposits as of March 23, 2025 | Source: Beaconcha.in Investors held 33.72 million ETH staked on March 20. That figure has now risen by 110,000 ETH, reaching 33.83 million at press time. Valued at current prices, this indicates that investors have staked over $220 million worth of ETH in just two days, coinciding with Ethereum’s consolidation phase around the $2,000 level. Ethereum Price Outlook Today: $1,950 Stop-loss Intact if Current Staking surge persists Ethereum price consolidation around $2,000 has coincide with in significant 110,000 ETH staking deposits in the last 48 hours. This suggests that Ethereum’s declining trading volume is not entirely due to investor disinterest or a shift toward low-cap assets. Instead, some investors are also reallocating assets into staking contracts to mitigate downside risks and earn yield income. By pulling 110,000 ETH from short-term supply, this has reduced sell-side pressure, forcing buyers to bid higher in a market with fewer available tokens, which supports a mildly bullish outlook for ETH price to consolidate above the $1950 support for the coming trading sessions. Ethereum Technical Price Analysis Today: $2,100 Resistance to Limits Short-term profits Ethereum price forecast signals are swinging positive, amid the ongoing consolidation phase. As investors weigh recent staking inflows against macroeconomic uncertainties, ETH is currently trades at $1,979, holding above critical support at $1,950. The bullish scenario suggests that sustained staking demand and the Bollinger Bands indicator tightening could precede a breakout. Notably, ETH price is testing the middle Bollinger Band (~$2,005), which, if breached, may open the door to a rally toward $2,100. Additionally, the MACD remains in positive momentum, hinting at potential buyer re-entry. Ethereum Technical Price Analysis Today: On the bearish side, failure to reclaim $2,000 may invite sellers back into the market. The lower Bollinger Band ($1,768) serves as a key downside target if Ethereum loses the $1,950 support. Declining trading volumes also indicate weakening demand, reinforcing the possibility of a breakdown. Traders should watch for a decisive move above $2,005 or below $1,950 to confirm ETH’s next major direction.

However, one crypto expert has waded in to explain the delay behind a potential listing, citing a dire lack of transparency by the Pi Core Team. Pi Network Needs A High Level Of Transparency Pseudonymous crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin has explained the reason behind Pi Network’s absence on top cryptocurrency exchanges. According to a post on X, Dr Altcoin noted that the reason may be a lack of transparency by the Pi Core Team. Dr Altcoin noted that the transparency issue revolves around Pi Network’s tokenomics. Per the analyst, information on the locking mechanism for Pi Network remains shrouded in mystery. “It is likely that the Pi Core Team has not been transparent enough about the locking and burning mechanism involving the billions of Pi coins currently owned by the PCT,” read the post. At the moment, Pi Network is not listed on centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Coinbase. While whispers of an imminent listing are growing louder, Binance excluded the asset from its Vote To List program. Decreasing Circulating Supply Leaves Community Scratching Their Heads A closer look at Pi Network’s tokenomics reveals a decline in its circulating supply to 6.77 billion. The Pi Core Team removed 10 million coins from circulating in what Dr. Altcoin described as an attempt at price control ahead of a token unlock . “Without transparency, this could easily be misconstrued as potential plans for market manipulation, as we have seen indications of this in recent days,” said Dr Altcoin. A previous token unlock sent prices cascading to new lows but a burn roadmap is in development for the network. Experts say burning Pi Network tokens will prevent a steep drop in prices. However, some community members disagree with Dr Altcoin’s theory of a lack of transparency behind Pi Network’s listing delays. The cross-section of community members says the delay stems from the Pi Core Team refusing to pay exchanges for a listing. They argue that the Pi Core Team is seeking a free listing from exchanges, taking the longer route. Pi is trading at $1 and is down 66% from its all-time high of $2.98 that it set in February.

The potential for a price rebound is creating a stir in the crypto market. Investors are keen to discover if these coins are poised for growth. Dive into the latest analysis to see what could be on the horizon for ADA and XLM. Cardano’s 6-Month Surge Amid Short-Term Adjustments Cardano climbed over 100% in the past six months, alongside a 7.88% monthly dip and a 3.39% decline last week. This performance highlights strong long-term growth balanced by recent short-term corrections, likely due to profit-taking. Despite these pullbacks, Cardano has maintained a notable upward trend over the last half-year, indicating resilience in its price movement. Current prices trade between$ 0.44 and $0.88, with resistance testing at $1.15 and another hurdle at $1.59, while support remains at $0.26. Slightly negative indicators and an RSI around 46 suggest a selling bias in the market. Traders might look for entries near support or wait for a clear break above resistance, given the uncertainty in the trend. Stellar Price Dynamics: Short-Term Dip, Long-Term Rise Stellar has faced an 18.65% decline in the past month, which stands in stark contrast to its impressive 189.83% gain over the last six months. The recent trading sessions have exhibited notable volatility, with a slight increase of 0.964% over the past week providing a glimmer of hope amid short-term setbacks. This price activity indicates that Stellar's recent struggles are set against its stronger, longer-term performance, characterized by both sharp declines and substantial recoveries over half a year. Stellar is currently trading between $0.2193 and $0.3871, with immediate resistance at $0.4877 and support at $0.1521. Although bears are currently dominant, the absence of a clear trend presents traders with chances to buy near support levels and sell around resistance. Maintaining tight positions could prove beneficial for a potential breakout in either direction. Conclusion ADA and XLM have shown promising buy signals. This presents a good opportunity for a potential price bounce. Both coins have key strengths that could attract attention. The market conditions appear favorable for these tokens. Investors might consider this as a moment to observe their performance closely. While no guarantees exist, the current indicators suggest possible gains ahead.

Why ADA Has Fallen 70% Since Its 2021 Peak and the Best Competitor Crypto For 2025 Gains,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-cardano-ada-ever-cross-3-again-why-ada-has-fallen-70-since-its-2021-peak-and-the-best-competitor-crypto-for-2025-gains/,"Cardano (ADA) investors are wondering whether the token will ever reclaim the $3 mark after falling nearly 70% from its 2021 peak of $3.10. Currently trading around $0.73, ADA has struggled due to slower-than-expected adoption and increased competition from other blockchain networks. While some believe a market-wide rally could push ADA higher, others are looking for stronger alternatives. One standout competitor is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gained momentum. The project is emerging as a high-growth performer in its recently launched presale. The presale is now in phase 3 after selling out more than 50%. Over $4.4 million has been raised, attracting more than 6300 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.02 before the price jumps 25% to $0.025 in phase 4. Investors have limited time to join the presale as it nears conclusion. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows The evolution of decentralized lending through Mutuum Finance proved its dual-lending model as a key factor in achieving its triple-digit customer growth. A remarkable number of investors has backed the project through its presale by supplying $4.4 million from over 6300 contributors. Customers can seize major profit potential by buying MUTM during Phase 3 for $0.02 since the token price will surge to $0.025 in Phase 4. Experts regard MUTM as one of the most undervalued yet promising DeFi protocols because it unites strong market demand with distinctive lending features which they believe could reach above $2 after the launch. Mutuum Finance is special in the sense that it blends both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. The P2C model allows users to accrue passive income through USDT liquidity pools, enjoying the fruits of automated smart contract-based lending. Meanwhile, the P2P model provides direct transactions without intermediaries, giving users full control over their funds. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. Building a Secure and Stable Ecosystem Users can find evidence of Mutuum Finance’s stability through its issuance of a completely backed stablecoin using Ethereum network resources. The token achieves trustworthiness over an extended timespan because its overcollateralized design cuts down potential risks contrary to algorithmic stablecoins that face insolvency challenges. Open financial architectures and audited smart contracts alongside this architecture deliver higher investor trust by solving the major issues of past DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance works to build a growing community by providing attractive benefits to its members. The platform will provide $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a million-dollar giveaway that benefits ten lucky participants while also having an innovative referral program designed to reward user-driven new investor acquisitions. The platform provides early adopters with separate staking pools and governance access and VIP updates that enhance their loyalty and continued support. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth The project’s tokenomics strategy ensures controlled supply and sustained value growth.By restricting token supply during presale and imposing deflationary pressures, Mutuum Finance creates scarcity, which can lead to price appreciation. Staking rewards along with its usage mechanism help users gain advantages that drive sustainable usage over time within the network ecosystem. Cardano (ADA) faces uncertainty in reclaiming $3 due to slow adoption and rising competition. Once a top Ethereum rival, its momentum has faded, pushing investors toward stronger alternatives. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction with its dual-lending DeFi model, raising $4.4 million from 6,300+ investors. Its presale price will soon rise from $0.02 to $0.025, offering early investors a promising opportunity amid ADA’s struggles.

Meanwhile, whales view the altcoin’s price dip as an opportunity that they must seize by increasing their holdings while the price is down, leading to large investors buying a huge volume of Ethereum in the last three days. Related Reading: 1 Million Bitcoin In New Whale Hands—A Mega BTC Rally On The Horizon? ETH Trading Below $2,000 Analysts said that Ethereum’s price continues to fall as the broader cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a challenging situation. Data showed that the world’s largest altcoin struggles to gain an upward momentum and continue to stumble below $2,000. As of writing, Ethereum is traded at $1,988 per coin, with a market cap of nearly $240 billion. According to CoinGecko, since ETH hit $3,640 per coin on January 6, the crypto has been steadily decreasing in value with its first major dip happening on January 14, after hitting $3,007. On February 3, the coin slid further reaching $2,460 and dropped to $2,100 on February 28. Ethereum hit below $2,000 for the first time on March 11. Since then, ETH has been having trouble keeping itself above $2,000.

Ethereum struggling to maintain itself at the $2,000 level might worry many crypto traders, but large-scale investors saw an opportunity in the price dip. Whales used this situation to buy more ETH and further increase their holdings. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez commented in a post that ETH price decline attracted large investors to increase their buying activity. “Whales bought over 120,000 #Ethereum $ETH in the last 72 hours,” Martinez said. The analyst presented a chart that showed a spike in the whale ETH accumulation coinciding with the coin’s price decline, adding that Ethereum’s retreat allowed whales to acquire more than 120,000 ETH tokens with a value of about $236 million and they only did that in three days. “That’s a significant move by the whales! Their accumulation often indicates confidence in the market. It’s fascinating to see how these big players can influence price trajectories,’ Agent Snek commented on Martinez’s post. Whale Buys Over 7,000 ETH Meanwhile, data analytics platform Lookonchain tracked a whale who added nearly $14 million worth of ETH. “A whale bought 7,074 $ETH($13.8M) today! The whale withdrew 4,511 $ETH($8.81M) from #OKX 3 hours ago and deposited it into #Aave,” Lookonchain said in a post.

By March 22, the 12 Bitcoin ETFs collectively held $94.35 billion worth of BTC, accounting for approximately 5.65% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. On March 21 alone, the 12 ETFs tracked, Blackrock’s IBIT accrued close to $105 million. Like the inflow count, IBIT contributed the most to the rise in trading volume, which settled at $1.3 billion by the same date. Overall, Bitcoin ETFs performed fairly well this week, drawing in more than $785 million in the last six days, including about $83 million on March 21. IBIT pulled in over $104 million in inflows on March 21 According to Sosovalue, cumulative net ETF inflows stood at $36.05 billion as of March 21, with institutional investor interest in Bitcoin picking up. Blackrock’s IBIT contributed the most to the net inflows count, having accumulated over $104.99 million on the 21st, bringing its total net inflows to almost $40 billion. Fidelity Capital comes second to IBIT with total net inflows of $11.48 billion, though it had no inflows on March 21. The other ten funds showed little or no change over the past six inflow sessions. However, by March 22, the 12 funds collectively held $94.35 billion worth of BTC. According to Farside Investors, the Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $785 million in the last week, with BlackRock IBIT accumulating over $486 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC saw $70 million in inflows, while Ark Invest’s ARKB accumulated just over $100 million in inflows during this period. However, on Friday, U.S. spot ether ETFs witnessed outflows of about $18.63 million. Analysts pointed out the outflows were caused by Blackrock’s ETHA and Grayscale’s ETH Mini Trust, which recorded losses of $11.94 million and $6.69 million, respectively. Bitcoin is seeing rising institutional demand The institutional demand for Bitcoin has grown quickly, with BTC demand at its highest levels since the collapse of the FTX exchange in 2022. Since February 23 this year, new investors have bought over 172,705 BTC. Crypto analyst Trader T even expects investors to pull in funds from US pension funds and Target Date Funds (TDFs). According to Grok’s analysis, the analyst believes that these sources will flow about $103 to 122 billion into the US equity market. He even claimed that people could allocate 5% to 10% of this amount, roughly $1 to $2 billion, to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This presents a bullish outlook for the meme coin’s price, which is currently eyeing a rally to $4.5. Dogecoin Whales Accumulate As Price Eyes Rally To $4.5 In an X post , Martinez revealed that Dogecoin whales have bought over 120 million DOGE this past week, as they continue to actively accumulate despite the market downtrend. This provides a bullish outlook for the meme coin, which is currently eyeing a rally to $4.5. In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade noted that DOGE’s 20 Simple Moving Average (SMA) highlights various phases in DOGE’s history. His accompanying chart showed that the top meme coin is just about to enter its parabolic phase in this bull run and could rally to as high as $4.5 when that happens. Crypto analyst Crypto Elites also asserted that a Dogecoin price rally to $5 is coming soon. These price predictions indicate that the foremost meme coin could still surpass its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.73. Crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL recently provided an ultra-bullish outlook for Dogecoin, predicting that the meme coin could rally to as high as $80. The analyst alluded to historical trends as to why DOGE could reach such an ambitious price target. DOGE Needs To Continue To Hold The Line In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital noted that Dogecoin, on the weekly candle, received a weekly demand candle last week at the ‘last line of bull market support.’ He remarked that it is crucial that DOGE holds this level at $0.139 while it resets higher time frame indicators like the 3-day MACD, weekly Stochastic RSI, and 2-week Stochastic RSI, which are getting very close to being fully reset. Kevin opined that this price level continues to be a spot where the risk-reward ratio on DOGE is “absolutely phenomenal,” considering that if the meme coin loses that level on weekly closes, market participants could easily cut their trades and losses. He added that the upside potential outweighs the downside risk by miles. From a holder perspective, the analyst remarked that market participants simply have to hold this $0.139 level while these higher frame indicators reset and prepare for the next big move. Kevin stated that the 1-week Stochastic RSI has fully reset, the 3-day MACD is getting closer to fully resetting, and the 2-week Stochastic RSI is also close to a full reset. The analyst indicated that the Dogecoin price boasts a bullish outlook as long as the Bitcoin price holds these levels and does not drop below $70,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) Consolidation Despite Trading Volume Decline Signals Whale Buying the Dip Bitcoin (BTC) opened trading at the $84,000 level on Sunday, March 23, extending its consolidation phase for three days. Looking at the chart below, Bitcoin trading volumes have declined from 22,900 BTC traded on Binance on March 20 to just 5,420 BTC at the close of Saturday, March 22. When an asset’s price consolidates at a critical support level despite a persistent decline in trading volume, it often signals bullish undertones. Bitcoin price today | March 23, 2025 | Source: TradingView Firstly, this suggests that large Bitcoin investors have been executing significant transactions, counteracting the impact of retail traders’ inactivity. Beyond that, high-frequency traders typically prefer volatile conditions, and Bitcoin’s flat price action within a narrow 1% range does not offer wide profit margins. As a result, this low-volatility market environment allows whales to sidestep OTC fees and execute large-volume buys on BTC spot markets without causing significant price fluctuations. These factors explain why BTC has held steady around $84,000 despite a 75% decline in Bitcoin trading volumes over the past few days. $51.9 Billion Open Interest Suggests Bottom Formation for BTC Price Action Bitcoin derivatives market data shows that open interest has dipped 1.77% to $51.98 billion, while options open interest has also declined slightly by 0.54% to $33.51 billion. Across all major metrics, Coinglass data highlights a prevailing bearish sentiment, with a significant 79.28% drop in options volume, indicating reduced speculative activity. Despite this, the long-short ratio remains near neutral at 0.9589 for the past 24 hours, with Binance and OKX showing a higher tilt toward long positions. This suggests that while open interest has declined, existing traders are still positioning for potential upward movement. Bitcoin Open Interest Dips Below $52 billion, March 23, 2025 | Source: Coinglass Liquidations data further supports the bottom formation narrative. Over the last 12 hours, $4.63 million in liquidations have occurred, with shorts accounting for $806.59K—significantly more than long liquidations. This indicates that downward momentum is being absorbed by bullish traders. The current environment suggests that BTC price may be nearing a local bottom after three days in retreat. A decisive move above $85,000 would validate the bullish thesis, while failure to hold $83,500 could invite further downside exploration. Traders should watch derivatives volume recovery and long-short ratio fluctuations for confirmation of the next major move. Bitcoin Technical Analysis Today: BTC to Remain Range Bound Within $88,000 – $83,265 Bitcoin price forecast chart below shows BTC remains trapped in a tight range between $83,265 and $88,000, as conflicting signals from spot and derivatives markets suggest a prolonged consolidation phase. However, sustained consolidation could also indicate a period of market indecision. Bitcoin price requires a decisive breakout from the $88,000 to $83,900 range before a clear directional trend emerges. Bitcoin Technical Analysis The Fibonacci retracement levels indicate immediate support at $83,265, while resistance looms at $86,363.22. A break above this level could see BTC retest the $88,866.76 resistance, signaling a bullish continuation. However, waning trading volume, as seen in the lower histogram bars, suggests weakening momentum, raising the risk of a bearish breakdown. If sellers take control, Bitcoin could dip below $83,265, exposing the next key support at $78,258.52. The red-shaded liquidity zones above $91,000 highlight potential supply zones where selling pressure could intensify. Until a decisive breakout occurs, Bitcoin’s sideways movement suggests traders remain cautious, awaiting confirmation of a trend shift.

According to Keiser, gold is more trusted than the U.S. dollar globally, and said governments of foreign nations with an adversarial relationship with the United States would not accept dollar-pegged stablecoins. The BTC maximalist added: Russia, China, and Iran are not going to accept a U.S. dollar stablecoin. I predict they will counter the USD stablecoin with a Gold one. China and Russia have a combined 50,000 tonnes of Gold — more than what is reported. Max Keiser Tether’s alloy and the rise of gold-backed digital assets The emergence of gold-backed stablecoins may jeopardize U.S. legislators’ attempts to secure dollar supremacy via stablecoin integration, potentially transforming the world finance system. This was followed in June 2024 with stablecoin issuer Tether announcing Alloy (aUSD₮), a gold-backed stablecoin collateralized by Tether’s XAU₮ token, a paper claim on physical gold. Gabor Gurbacs, the founder of Tether’s Gold and a former VanEck executive, noted that Tether Gold is what the dollar was before 1971. “XAU₮ is up 15.7% year-to-date, while the broad crypto market is in the red. Foundations and businesses should hedge their holdings with XAU₮,” the executive wrote in a March 19 X post . U.S. pushes for dollar supremacy through stablecoin regulations U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that dollar-pegged stablecoins would be a priority for the Trump administration. The administration was intent on protecting the dollar’s status as a reserve currency and U.S. dominance in finance. While speaking at the Crypto Summit at the White House on March 7, Bessent reiterated that incorporating stablecoins into the financial system would be a critical policy priority. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller expressed similar views on Tuesday, promoting stablecoins to strengthen the U.S. dollar’s global standing ahead of Bessent’s comments at the summit. In the meantime, U.S. legislators have filed various stablecoin legislation, including the Stable Act of 2025 and a GENIUS stablecoin bill, to establish a regulatory framework for fiat tokens.

Ethereum is grappling to maintain the $2,000 mark amid growing bearish forces, and Hedera is seeing a downturn in interest, hitting a yearly low. On the flip side, BlockDAG (BDAG) is on an upward trajectory, breaking presale records with over $205 million accumulated and 18.8 billion coins sold. Cementing a strategic partnership with SpaceDev, BlockDAG is transcending its status as a mere Layer 1 blockchain by aiming for widespread use, backed by a $30 million grants program and plans for listings on 10 top exchanges. While Ethereum and Hedera are bogged down by negative trends, BlockDAG’s focus on scalability and drawing institutional interest positions it as the cryptocurrency to keep an eye on in 2025. The pressing question now is: will you catch BDAG before its value soars? BlockDAG and SpaceDev Join Forces to Elevate Blockchain Technology BlockDAG, a pioneering Layer 1 blockchain, has allied with SpaceDev , experts in blockchain consulting and software development, to boost the adoption of decentralized solutions. This partnership marries BlockDAG’s cutting-edge Proof-of-Work and Directed Acyclic Graph technology with SpaceDev’s extensive blockchain development know-how, promising a more scalable, secure, and efficient blockchain environment. BlockDAG’s CEO, Antony Turner, highlights the partnership’s importance, saying, “SpaceDev’s technical expertise is a perfect match for our vision to develop a robust blockchain that surpasses traditional network limitations.” The collaboration is set to expand BlockDAG’s community through worldwide hackathons, ambassador programs, and events. SpaceDev will also lend technical assistance to BlockDAG’s $30 million grants program, which supports developers in creating and expanding projects on the network. Furthermore, joint marketing initiatives will boost visibility. With BlockDAG’s presale now exceeding $205 million and 18.8 billion coins sold at $0.0248 each in the latest batch, confidence among buyers is strengthening. The project’s swift progress, the anticipation of listings on 10 exchanges, and a beta test net launch in March 2025 are pivotal for its projected growth spurt. This strategic partnership with SpaceDev solidifies BlockDAG’s position, preparing it to emerge as a leader in blockchain innovation as it transitions to mainnet. Is Ethereum on the Brink of Breaking Below $2,000? Ethereum has tumbled 13% over the past week, now at a new low of $1,997 since December 2023. The crypto faces ongoing selling pressure, with the possibility of dipping beneath the pivotal $2,000 mark. Positioned below the Ichimoku Cloud, resistance levels at $2,346 and $2,742 hint at potential further declines. Now, 50% of Ethereum holders are seeing losses, reduced from 82% in January, which might trigger more selling. Should the downward trend intensify, Ethereum could fall to $1,924. Conversely, a shift in sentiment might lift its price to $2,224, and possibly to $2,500 if it establishes new support. Market watchers should keep an eye on Ethereum’s next moves as its stability is tested. Hedera Struggles to Maintain $0.25 as Interest Wanes—What Lies Ahead? In the last week, Hedera has seen a 17% decrease, now priced at $0.21. With open interest plummeting to a yearly low of $149 million, confidence seems to be waning, pointing to potential further losses unless there’s a resurgence of buying. Currently, Hedera is back in a downward trending channel, a bearish sign that has dominated its movements from January through March. The Parabolic SAR indicates continued bearish momentum, with Hedera below essential resistance levels. A further drop to $0.16 could occur if demand stays low. However, a resurgence in buying could push prices up to $0.24. Traders should look for signs of momentum shifts as they navigate Hedera’s volatile market landscape. Crypto Momentum: Who’s Up and Who’s Down? The divide between a faltering coin and a thriving one is defined by its momentum. Ethereum grapples with technical challenges, with half its holders in the red and resistance pushing prices lower. Hedera contends with negative sentiment, worsened by diminishing trading interest, signaling a drift of focus away from it. Meanwhile, BlockDAG bucks the market downturn, nearing its $600 million presale goal. With technical support from SpaceDev, BlockDAG’s ecosystem is evolving into a hub for development, enhancing its appeal. The impending March 2025 beta test net and upcoming exchange listings further bolster its position, distinguishing BlockDAG as a formidable Layer 1 innovator. As the crypto presale window narrows, while Ethereum and Hedera face uncertainties, BlockDAG’s path forward looks promising. The real question shifts from if to when BlockDAG will surge significantly.

It feels like just yesterday everyone was buzzing about the rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum, but fast forward to 2025, and the crypto market has leveled up in ways people didn’t expect. It’s not just about the big players anymore—newer coins are making waves, and some are set to explode. If you’re keeping an eye on the Top Cryptos to Buy for 2025, it’s time to start looking beyond the usual suspects and explore the next big thing. But while everyone is talking about new coins, some missed opportunities are still fresh in the minds of those who didn’t act fast enough. One coin that has a lot of people kicking themselves is HNT (Helium). It had potential, but by the time it started to hit its stride, the window closed for many. But don’t worry, there’s still hope. One crypto, in particular, is showing a ton of promise— Qubetics ($TICS), and it’s got people excited for all the right reasons. Stick around, because if you haven’t heard about Qubetics yet, you’ll want to pay attention. This could be one of the most talked-about coins of 2025. HNT Coin: A Missed Opportunity HNT was one of those coins that seemed like it was on the brink of something big, especially back when it first started. People were hyped about its innovative approach to decentralizing wireless networks. It was marketed as a game-changer, and for a while, it looked like it could be the next big thing in the crypto world. Unfortunately, by the time most people caught on, the coin had already hit its peak. As a project, Helium did a lot of things right. Its vision to allow anyone to build a decentralized wireless network and earn HNT for doing so was pretty unique. The idea of creating a global, decentralized internet is certainly a cool one—especially in areas where traditional internet infrastructure isn’t strong. For a time, it felt like it was going to be a revolution. But here’s the thing: timing is everything. Helium didn’t scale as quickly as expected, and the market shifted towards other emerging technologies, leaving HNT in the dust. Looking back, the missed opportunity with HNT can’t be ignored. Many hoped for a steady rise, but the lack of adoption and scalability ultimately led to its fall from grace. So, if you’re kicking yourself for not jumping on the HNT train, don’t worry—it’s part of the game. However, now is the time to look for the next big thing that could fill the gap. Enter Qubetics. Qubetics: Still a Hot Ticket for 2025 While HNT might be a coin that many regret overlooking, Qubetics ($TICS) is still very much on the rise—and there’s no sign of it slowing down. The key to Qubetics’ appeal lies in its revolutionary Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, which is setting it apart from other projects. The world is finally ready for a wallet that can easily handle multiple chains without the hassle of being tied to one specific blockchain. Imagine being able to manage a whole range of tokens, from Ethereum to Binance Smart Chain, without needing to constantly switch wallets or get stuck in a tech mess. That’s exactly what Qubetics aims to solve, and people are starting to take notice. Currently in its 26th stage of crypto presale , Qubetics has already sold over 502 million tokens to 23,500+ holders, raising more than $15.3 million. At the current price of $0.1181 per $TICS token, it’s an exciting time to get involved. But that’s just the beginning. After the presale, analysts are predicting a $1 price for $TICS—imagine a 746% ROI. And if Qubetics hits $5 after its mainnet launch? That’s a jaw-dropping 4130% ROI. But it’s not just about the numbers. The real appeal of Qubetics lies in its usability and potential to serve everyday people. Whether you’re a small business owner, a freelancer, or just someone who’s been looking for a way to simplify crypto management, Qubetics has you covered. How Qubetics Can Help Real People in Real Life Imagine a freelancer getting paid in multiple cryptocurrencies for their work. One client might pay in Bitcoin, another in Ethereum, and someone else might use a stablecoin. Managing all these payments can quickly become a nightmare. That’s where Qubetics comes in. The Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet makes it easy to manage all those payments without worrying about which chain each coin is on. You don’t have to jump between wallets or deal with the risk of having your assets tied up in a single chain. Let’s say you own a small business and want to accept crypto payments. But you don’t want to be limited to just Bitcoin or Ethereum. With Qubetics, you can integrate payments from multiple chains, giving your customers more flexibility and, in turn, making your business more attractive to a broader audience.

42184582,https://timestabloid.com/?p=61265,1742696134,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,10 Cryptos Making Moves—Why This Coin is the Best Crypto to Buy in March 2025,https://timestabloid.com/10-cryptos-making-moves-why-this-coin-is-the-best-crypto/,"The crypto market is moving fast in March 2025, with several projects making significant strides. From Layer-1 powerhouses expanding their ecosystems to DeFi protocols integrating real-world assets, the competition is fierce. Some of the most anticipated crypto presales are also gaining traction, with community members jumping in before the next price surge. With so many options, picking the best crypto to buy in March 2025 can feel overwhelming. But one project is standing out above the rest—Qubetics ($TICS). With its cross-border transaction solutions, seamless interoperability, and record-breaking presale, Qubetics is shaping up to be the biggest crypto opportunity of the year. Below, we’ll explore 10 cryptos making big moves this month and why Qubetics is leading the pack. 1. Qubetics ($TICS) – The Best Crypto to Buy in March 2025 Qubetics is shaking up the blockchain world by introducing a next-gen cross-border transaction platform, leveraging AI and interoperability to connect blockchains seamlessly. Unlike traditional payment systems that struggle with slow speeds, high fees, and limited connectivity, Qubetics enables ultra-fast transactions across multiple networks while maintaining security and privacy. For businesses, Qubetics opens up a new era of borderless payments, where companies can send and receive stablecoins, crypto assets, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) without the usual hurdles. Imagine a freelancer in Asia getting paid in USDC by a client in the U.S. instantly—no banks, no intermediaries, and no delays. Similarly, e-commerce businesses can integrate Qubetics’ blockchain-powered payment rails to settle transactions globally without high conversion fees. Let’s be real—this presale is on fire. Qubetics is in Stage 26, with $TICS priced at $0.1181, and every Sunday at midnight, the price jumps by 10%. Each presale stage lasts just 7 days, which means if you’re sitting on the fence, you’re literally losing money by the week. It’s no wonder early participants are scrambling to lock in their spots before the next price hike. Here’s what the buzz is all about: Qubetics has already raised $15.3 million, has 23,500+ holders, and more than 502 million tokens sold. But the real attention-grabber? The projected gains. If $TICS reaches $1, you’re looking at 746.04% ROI. Hit $10, and that jumps to 8,360.26%. And at $15, it’s a ridiculous 12,590.69%. A quick math check: drop $7,500 today and you’ll snag about 63,450 tokens. If $TICS hits $10, that’s a sweet $634,500. That’s not hype—that’s straight up potential. Blink, and the price goes up again. Your move. 2. AAVE – DeFi’s Powerhouse Expands with RWA Integration AAVE is pushing DeFi to new heights with its latest integration of Real-World Assets (RWAs). This move allows institutional players and everyday users to collateralize tokenized assets like real estate, commodities, and equities for DeFi lending. With institutional demand for RWAs growing, AAVE’s ecosystem could attract billions in new liquidity. The price of AAVE has shown strong momentum in recent weeks, reflecting optimism around the protocol’s expansion. Analysts believe that if DeFi continues to bridge TradFi with blockchain technology, AAVE could be among the biggest beneficiaries in 2025. 3. Astra – AI Meets Blockchain for an Intelligent Future Astra is making waves by integrating AI-powered smart contracts, allowing businesses and developers to automate transactions and optimize blockchain-based operations. The rise of AI-driven automation in DeFi, GameFi, and supply chain management is putting Astra at the center of the next crypto revolution. With AI playing a crucial role in Web3, Astra’s ability to combine predictive analytics with decentralized smart contracts makes it a strong contender for long-term growth. Its adoption could increase exponentially as blockchain companies look for smarter, self-learning protocols. 4. Algorand – The Green Blockchain is Back in the Spotlight Algorand continues to impress as one of the most energy-efficient and scalable Layer-1 blockchains in the industry. Recent upgrades have boosted TPS (transactions per second), making it a go-to blockchain for institutions looking for sustainability and efficiency. More importantly, Algorand is at the forefront of tokenized assets, with partnerships in government-backed stablecoins, green energy credits, and NFT marketplaces. As regulations around tokenization become clearer, Algorand could see massive institutional adoption in 2025. 5. Polygon (MATIC) – Scaling Ethereum Faster Than Ever Polygon remains Ethereum’s top Layer-2 scaling solution, but its ambitions go beyond reducing gas fees. With new ZK-Rollup advancements and integrations with major brands like Starbucks and Disney, Polygon is rapidly evolving into a multi-use blockchain powerhouse. The rise of enterprise adoption in Web3 has placed Polygon at the center of major discussions. With ETH transaction fees still fluctuating, Polygon’s low-cost, high-speed infrastructure makes it an essential ecosystem player for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming dApps. 6. Avalanche – Blazing Fast Smart Contracts Avalanche’s subnet technology allows developers to launch customizable blockchain networks while maintaining ultra-fast speeds. With GameFi and institutional finance moving toward custom-built blockchains, Avalanche’s appeal is growing. The network recently announced several high-profile partnerships, expanding its influence in both DeFi and enterprise blockchain adoption. As more projects shift toward Avalanche for custom scaling solutions, its native token AVAX could see significant price action. 7. Cosmos – The Internet of Blockchains Expands Cosmos is leading the charge in interoperability, making it easier for different blockchains to communicate with one another. As new projects integrate with Cosmos’ Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, the network’s value continues to grow. With the rise of multi-chain ecosystems, Cosmos is positioned to be a long-term winner for those betting on interoperability. 8. Near Protocol – A Web3 Powerhouse in the Making Near Protocol is quickly becoming a Web3 development hub, attracting builders looking for a scalable and developer-friendly blockchain. Its latest upgrade has reduced transaction fees even further, making it a strong competitor to Solana and Ethereum. With more applications launching on Near, the network is poised for continued growth in 2025. 9. XRP – Big Developments in Global Payments XRP has been making headlines with ongoing legal battles, but its real-world use case in global payments remains unmatched. March 2025 is shaping up to be a crucial time for XRP, with speculation that new partnerships could fuel a major price rally. If XRP continues to expand its role in cross-border payments, it could be one of the best crypto to buy in March 2025 for those betting on utility-driven growth. 10. Binance Coin (BNB) – The Powerhouse of the Binance Ecosystem BNB continues to dominate as the utility token of the Binance Smart Chain, which powers countless DeFi projects, NFT marketplaces, and blockchain applications. March 2025 has seen increased BNB staking activity, signaling strong demand. With Binance constantly expanding its ecosystem, BNB remains a top-tier asset for long-term growth. Conclusion: Qubetics Leads the Charge as the Best Crypto to Buy in March 2025 March 2025 is proving to be a high-stakes month in crypto, with major projects rolling out game-changing developments. While established players like Binance, Polygon, and AAVE continue to perform well, Qubetics stands out as the ultimate pick for those seeking real-world utility and massive growth potential. With its cross-border transaction technology, seamless multi-chain interoperability, and a rapidly growing crypto presale , Qubetics is capturing the attention of crypto participants worldwide. The presale is already at stage 26, with $TICS priced at $0.1181, and a price hike is just days away. For those looking to secure a high-ROI opportunity before Qubetics’ mainnet launch in Q2 2025, now is the moment to take action. As always, early adopters stand to gain the most, and Qubetics is shaping up to be one of the best crypto to buy in March 2025 before it takes off.

42183827,https://coingape.com/?p=245518,1742696650,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Analyst Predict XRP Price Could Hit $77 in This Bull Cycle, Here’s Why",https://coingape.com/analyst-predict-xrp-price-could-hit-77-in-this-bull-cycle-heres-why/,"A market analyst has presented a bold projection for XRP price movement, suggesting it could reach as high as $77.7 during the ongoing bull market cycle. This prediction is based on the application of advanced technical tools, including Exponential Fibonacci models and Elliott Wave theory, which are often used to forecast long-term price trends in financial markets. According to the analyst, conventional linear models fail to capture the compounding nature of crypto price movements, especially during the upcoming altcoin rally. XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Says $77 Target Possible in Current Bull Cycle Crypto analyst Dark Defender revealed XRP price could climb to $77.7 during the current market cycle. The forecast is based on the use of Exponential Fibonacci levels, a method he claims is underused in crypto market analysis. He explains that standard linear projections do not reflect the actual growth patterns often observed during accelerated market conditions. Dark Defender outlines a five-wave impulse structure based on Elliott Wave theory. In his analysis, Wave 3 is positioned as the most explosive part of the cycle. He suggests that the top altcoin rally may first move between $5 and $8 during this wave. A further push toward $18 to $23 is anticipated before the final wave. Wave 5, the final leg in the structure, is projected to carry XRP price into three-digit levels. His analysis sets the upper range at approximately $77.7, based on the extended Fibonacci measurements. This would mark a substantial increase from current levels and surpass previous highs. Source: X Technical Indicators and Chart Patterns Supporting the Outlook Dark Defender’s projection includes a review of multiple technical indicators. He references Relative Strength Index (RSI) trends and momentum indicators as supporting factors in his analysis. These tools suggest continued bullish pressure, especially on higher time frames like the monthly chart. Volume clusters are another factor he incorporates. According to the chart data, strong accumulation zones have formed, typically supporting future crypto rallies. He also notes that current price movements mirror those of previous bull runs, reinforcing the idea of an upcoming altcoin rally. Chart structures from earlier cycles show similar formations that preceded large price expansions. These historical similarities, momentum signals, and volume behavior form the basis of his extended projection for the XRP price. Meanwhile, another more bullish analysis projects the Ripple token could cross $1,000 if the partnership with SWIFT leads to the global adoption of XRP for real-time liquidity in cross-border payments. Analysts suggest that such integration would require massive XRP reserves and institutional demand, which could drive the altcoin rally. Impact of Ripple Lawsuit and Legal Developments Additionally, analyst Egrag Crypto has also shared a bullish forecast for XRP price earlier on. He places initial targets between $5 and $6, with a possibility of reaching $10. His prediction is partly tied to the recent resolution of the Ripple lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which some believe could act as a catalyst for further gains. Egrag Crypto’s analysis also uses Fibonacci levels, identifying consistent full-body monthly candle closings above Fib 1.0. He states that this chart’s behavior reflects price strength and momentum. A potential altcoin rally to the Fib 1.618 level, targeting up to $10, remains a possibility according to his analysis.

Notably, this development resulted in a significant demand for XRP as the altcoin surged over 13% to briefly trade at $2.60 on March 20. However, XRP has since retraced over the last 24 hours and is now valued at around $2.39. Albeit, the altcoin still remains set for major bullish gains based on recent analysis by market expert Egrag Crypto. Related Reading: CMT-Certified Expert Explains Why Bitcoin May Not Reach Past Extremes On Indicators XRP Strong Monthly Close Indicates Major Upside Potential In an X post on March 21, Egrag Crypto shares an interesting bullish prediction on the XRP based on price action in recent months and the Fibonacci retracement levels. The analyst notes that XRP has consistently closed above Fib. 1.0 level over the past three months forming full body candles. This development demonstrates XRP’s resilience amidst an uncertain crypto market reinforcing the potential of bullish momentum. This is because full-body candles provide stronger confirmation of price movements compared to wick formations. With the altcoin maintaining such strong technical strength, Egrag predicts XRP could soon start gaining with its first price target at Fib 1.236. However, there is no serious resistance at this level suggesting a continuous surge to Fib Circle 5 and Fib 1.414 i.e. a price range of $5-$6. Based on the Fibonacci levels, XRP could then see major price extensions to Fib 1.618 hinting at a potential price target of $9-$10. However, it is worth noting that the timing of these events is quite consequential for XRP and the general crypto market. According to Egrag Crypto, if the projected price gains occur between now and May, a price correction is likely to follow hinting at a continuation of the bull run and higher price targets for XRP. However, if the anticipated price movements happen in the summer of 2025 or in Q4 2025, it could suggest a market top, marking the end of the current market cycle.

However, there are some significant potential positives for the fourth-largest cryptocurrency on the horizon. Aside from recent legal developments, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed much optimism on an XRP Spot ETF suggesting a possible approval before 2025 runs out. In addition, Garlinghouse expects US President Donald Trump to include XRP in the digital asset stockpile. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.38 reflecting a 1.43% price loss in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 31.64% indicating a decline in market interest despite a recent price surge.

Rogers said, unfortunately, the most straightforward scams work best because scammers rely on people making simple mistakes. “People give their 24-word phrases to people every day, so as long as that happens, then they are going to go for the low-cost tax,” he said, adding: “Anyone who asks for your 24 words is a criminal.” Rogers highlighted a common crypto scam where victims get tricked by replies under “any post on Twitter about crypto,” with messages like “DM me, and I’ll help you.” “You know that scammers are always asking you for your 24 words,” Rogers said. CertiK chief business officer Jason Jiang recently told Cointelegraph that being aware of phishing attacks on social media can drastically increase a user’s crypto security . Sometimes, scammers hijack the accounts of well-known industry figures to post malicious links, making it even harder for users to spot the scam. In September 2023, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s account was compromised , leading to a fake NFT giveaway that tricked followers into clicking — only to drain over $691,000 from their wallets. Source: CertiK Rogers emphasized that this will always be the case, just as bad actors aren’t limited to crypto — scams like fake emails from the “Nigerian president” have been around for years. “The cost of the attack is always commensurate with the size of the prize, right?” Rogers said. In 2024, crypto hacks jumped 15% from 2023, with over $3 billion stolen .

Pig butchering is a type of phishing scheme that involves prolonged and complex manipulation tactics to trick investors into willingly sending their assets to fraudulent crypto addresses.

Despite the broader market facing turbulence from ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and heightened trade war fears, ADA has managed to maintain stability—offering hope to investors watching for a breakout. While Bitcoin and other altcoins have struggled under selling pressure, Cardano’s current structure could be setting the stage for a strong recovery rally. Related Reading: Investors Withdraw 360,000 Ethereum From Exchanges In Just 48 Hours – Accumulation Trend? Bulls now face the task of reclaiming higher levels to confirm a bullish reversal and capitalize on this window of opportunity. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, Cardano has just flashed a buy signal on the TD Sequential indicator on the 4-hour chart—an early sign that momentum may shift in favor of the bulls. Historically, this technical pattern has been a reliable indicator for short- to mid-term price rebounds, especially during consolidation phases like the one ADA is currently experiencing. If this signal holds and buyers step in with strength, Cardano could soon challenge its next resistance zones and begin a new upward move. With sentiment across the market cautiously optimistic, ADA might be one of the first altcoins to lead the way in a broader recovery. TD Sequential Signal Sparks Hope For Cardano Cardano (ADA) has been standing out as one of the more resilient altcoins during a critical period of heightened selling pressure across the crypto market. While broader macroeconomic conditions—such as trade war fears and policy uncertainty—have pushed equities and crypto into volatile zones, ADA has managed to hold its ground above crucial support levels. This performance has caught the attention of investors and analysts who believe Cardano could lead the next leg up once the market finds its footing. Related Reading: XRP Active Addresses Hit Highest Level Since April 2023 – Will Price Follow? With the market beginning to form local lows and signs of a potential rebound emerging, sentiment is cautiously optimistic. Still, some experts warn that this could be a temporary pause in a larger corrective phase. The lack of clarity around global economic direction continues to cast a shadow over all risk assets, including crypto. For Cardano, however, a new technical development has sparked renewed hope. Martinez’s analysis on X reveals the TD Sequential indicator has just flashed a buy signal on ADA’s 4-hour chart. Historically, this signal is known for predicting potential reversals or short-term trend changes, especially during periods of consolidation. If the pattern plays out, Cardano could be preparing for a breakout move, positioning itself ahead of many other altcoins. A successful rebound would require ADA to reclaim higher resistance levels and confirm bullish momentum. But with a technical buy signal in place and market-wide signs of stabilization, the stage could be set for Cardano to initiate a recovery in the days ahead. ADA Struggles Below $0.73 Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.71 after several days of struggling to reclaim the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) near $0.73. Despite the resistance, ADA has held firmly above the 200-day simple moving average (MA) around $0.70, a level acting as key demand support in recent sessions. This tight range between the 200-day MA and EMA reflects growing pressure on bulls and bears as ADA approaches a critical decision point. For bulls to regain control and shift momentum in their favor, a decisive push above the $0.85 level is essential. Reclaiming this price zone would confirm a breakout from the current consolidation and potentially trigger a recovery rally toward higher resistance levels. Such a move would signal renewed bullish sentiment and open the door for ADA to revisit early 2024 highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Trades At A Critical Level – Major Reclaim Or Steep Drop Ahead? On the downside, failure to hold the $0.70 level could spell trouble. If ADA drops below this support, a sharp move toward $0.60—or even lower—could follow, especially amid broader market weakness. A break below $0.60 would mark a significant technical breakdown, potentially wiping out recent gains and resetting ADA’s bullish structure. As price action tightens, the next few days will be critical for determining Cardano’s short-term direction.

Notably, the cryptocurrency has been trading within a descending trendline, but a decisive move above this resistance could ignite a long-awaited rally to a new all-time high. XRP Price Eyes Breakout To $4 According to pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst ONE1iMPACT, the XRP price has been making lower highs, forming a descending trendline on the 8-hour chart. The analyst’s chart analysis highlights key technical indicators based on price action that suggest that the XRP price may be gearing up for a possible rally to $4. Related Reading: XRP Price Face Major Resistance At $2.9, Why This Analyst Believes $20 Is Still Possible XRP’s projected surge to a $4 ATH is dependent on how it reacts to the descending trendline, which acts as a critical resistance area. With this in mind, a breakout and close above this trendline with higher-than-average volume signals bullish momentum for the XRP price. Interestingly, the analyst disclosed that the market is currently hovering near or just below a key Moving Average (MA), indicated by the blue line in the chart. If XRP’s price can reclaim and hold above this MA, it would reinforce its bullish position and solidify the analyst’s optimistic price target. On the flip side, if it remains below this MA, the TradingView expert believes that it would put a barrier to its upside potential. Moving forward, the analyst has shared key technical areas that could determine XRP’s next price movements. He revealed that if the cryptocurrency breaks above the descending trendline, the next major resistance area is the horizontal level around $3.40. Furthermore, a confirmed breakout could send its price toward $3.9 – $4.00, aligning with the target shown by the grey arrow in the chart. The TradingView crypto expert warned investors and traders to pay attention to the volume and momentum of XRP as it aims for a descending trendline breakout. He explained that a low volume push above the trendline is a clear indication of a possible fakeout, where traders could be lured into entering long positions, only for the price to trace quickly. On the other hand, a high volume surge confirms the conviction of XRP’s bullish potential, leading to a sustained upward momentum and increasing prices. The analyst also added that oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) could help traders gauge whether XRP’s momentum is building or fading as its price approaches the descending trendline resistance. Possible Downside Target If Resistance Fails In his analysis, ‘ONE1iMPACT’ also shared a bearish outlook for the XRP price if it fails to break and close above the descending trendline resistance. The TradingView analyst revealed that a rejection at this trendline could trigger further consolidation and decline for XRP. Related Reading: XRP Price Retraces Gains From Sunday Rally, This Important Support Level Could Be The Defining Factor He has shared several important support levels that could help prevent an even deeper correction in the XRP price. The $2.0 and $2.1 region, marked by the pink and gray box on the chart, acts as a strong support area for XRP, where buyers have stepped in before. If the XRP price loses this zone, the analyst predicts a major breakdown toward $1.8 – $1.77. Another decline below this price low could result in a much larger correction.

Cardano Dips 18% While XRP News Reveal Network Expansion,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-cmo-hosts-blockbuster-6th-ama-cardano-dips-18-while-xrp-news-reveal-network-expansion/,"Crypto trends can shift quickly, but the debate between adoption strategy and price action is heating up. This week, Cardano’s decline and a major surge in XRP wallet numbers have stirred fresh market signals. While ADA sees falling volume and no major updates, XRP is gaining traction through broader usage and network expansion. Amid this, BlockDAG (BDAG) is catching attention for taking a real-world approach to visibility. Rather than sticking to threads or community chats, BlockDAG’s marketing roadmap reflects large-scale planning. From football stadiums to international tech events, the goal is widespread awareness. As presale momentum builds with over $205 million raised, BlockDAG positions itself for long-term relevance well beyond online hype. XRP News: Wallet Surge Signals Steady Growth A major update from the XRP Ledger confirms it has reached 6.87 million unique wallet addresses. This increase reflects broader use by both institutional players and everyday users. With Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity platform supporting real-world applications like cross-border payments, the XRP network continues to build genuine utility. In addition to financial services, the XRP ecosystem is expanding with more developers and features. Smart contracts through Hooks and ongoing DeFi development are making XRP more than just a payment tool. Backed by legal wins and regulatory clarity in regions like Japan and the UAE, XRP is regaining traction. Those following XRP news can see a strong foundation forming behind the scenes. Cardano Price Fall Raises Doubts Over Its Momentum Cardano (ADA) has declined to $0.7119, down from $0.7177, marking a 0.80% drop in 24 hours. Trading volume has also dropped 7.22%, settling at $1.18 billion. With an 18.53% slide over the last week, ADA’s market cap now stands at $25 billion. This continued downtrend suggests weakening short-term momentum. What makes this more concerning is the absence of any major update or catalyst. As attention moves toward projects with better outreach or practical usage, Cardano might struggle to stay relevant based on network stability alone. Other altcoins are now drawing attention with stronger real-world activity. BlockDAG Focuses on Global Growth, Not Just Short-Term Hype Stepping beyond crypto-only channels, BlockDAG’s 2025 outreach plan aims to make a lasting global impact. During a recent AMA, CMO Nicolaas David van den Bergh confirmed the strategy, spotlighting brand visibility at Inter Milan stadiums and appearances at global events like ETHPanama and Token2049. This isn’t casual PR—it’s a planned approach to build consistent worldwide awareness. While others focus on short-term buzz, BlockDAG targets meaningful global placements. The approach centers on direct audience reach across both crypto and non-crypto spaces. This change of direction shows BlockDAG is thinking bigger, not just louder. For those looking at 2025 growth, this project stands out for its clear execution and long-term potential. Its growing popularity is backed by numbers. Over $205 million has already been raised in the crypto presale , with 18.8 billion coins sold. BDAG is now priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, showing a rise of 2,380% from its initial value. With the testnet launch approaching and marketing plans unfolding, BlockDAG is being talked about as one of the best crypto picks for 2025. Final Say Latest XRP news points to growth, with wallet numbers climbing to 6.87 million and adoption increasing across user groups. On the other hand, Cardano’s falling price and volume, without any positive updates, reflect limited short-term strength. That’s why attention is turning toward projects aiming for broader presence. BlockDAG is a key name here. With confirmed appearances at Inter Milan matches and global events like ETHPanama and Token2049, the project is pushing for visibility that extends beyond crypto circles. The presale is already in batch 27 at $0.0248, after crossing $205 million. This could be a ideal time to watch closely before the momentum drives it further.

In the past 24 hours, Pi’s value has fallen by 2%, and over the past week, it has seen a massive decline of 31%. Many are now asking what caused this drop—Is it just another dip in the crypto market or is there more going on? While Pi had been stable at around $1.50 for a while, it has now fallen sharply. This price drop isn’t just a Pi-specific issue; the entire cryptocurrency market is seeing declines, with major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum also losing value. The broader market is affected by factors like rising inflation, higher interest rates, and ongoing global financial uncertainty. Moreover, Pi Network faces challenges such as limited exchange listings, slowing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, and uncertainty about its circulating supply. These issues have contributed to price instability and investor concerns. Pi Network has climbed back above the $1 mark after dropping to $0.86. It is currently trading at $1.01.. Despite recent gains, Pi faces resistance at $1.20. If it breaks through, it could target $1.35, a key milestone. However, reaching this level may be tough due to Pi’s volatility. If it manages to go above $1.90, analysts predict it could rally towards $3. However, there is hope for Pi’s future. The upcoming launch of its open mainnet could provide a much-needed boost. If the mainnet launch is successful and Pi can secure partnerships for real-world use, it could gain more demand and stability. Additionally, regulatory clarity and major exchange listings would increase liquidity and make Pi more accessible to investors.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-23 04:52:25

This technical strength has sparked speculation about whether PEPE is gearing up for a bullish continuation, potentially reigniting its upward momentum. With traders closely monitoring price action, a breakout above nearby resistance could confirm a bullish continuation, setting the stage for further gains. However, failure to maintain support may shift momentum in favor of the bears as PEPE hovers at this critical juncture. PEPE Recent Price Action: A Snapshot PEPE has been displaying steady price movement, holding above a key support level and maintaining bullish momentum. After bouncing from recent lows, the meme coin has managed to stay above a crucial moving average. This stability suggests that buyers are still in control, preventing a deeper pullback and keeping the uptrend intact. Related Reading: Analyst Says PEPE Price Must Break This Resistance Level For 150% Surge Toward ATHs Technical indicators continue to support a bullish outlook for PEPE. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains in positive territory, reflecting sustained buying momentum. If the RSI holds its current course, it can strengthen the case for more upside, suggesting that the uptrend has room to extend. Trading volume has remained consistent, indicating sustained interest from market participants. However, resistance levels ahead will play a crucial role in determining whether PEPE can extend its rally or face a temporary slowdown. If bullish momentum strengthens, the price could push toward the $0.00000766 resistance level. A decisive breakout above this level serves as a strong bullish confirmation, paving the way for further upside. Should buying pressure intensify, PEPE may rally toward the next significant resistance, attracting more traders looking to capitalize on the upward trend. Bearish Scenario: Key Support Levels If Momentum Shifts While PEPE remains in bullish territory, a shift in momentum will open the door for a potential pullback. If selling pressure increases, the first key support to watch is the moving average level that has been acting as a price floor. A break below this level could weaken bullish confidence and trigger a deeper decline. Related Reading: PEPE Struggles Against Strong Resistance, Bearish Pressure Intensify Further downside raises the risk of a decline toward secondary support zones such as $0.00000589 and $0.00000398, where buyers may attempt to regain control. Failure of the bulls to defend these levels will open the door for other support levels to be tested. Additionally, declining volume and a bearish crossover in momentum indicators such as the MACD or RSI could further confirm a shift in sentiment. For now, the uptrend remains intact, but traders should remain cautious of any signs of weakness. Holding above these key support zones will be crucial in determining whether bulls can maintain control or if bears will take over.

Despite the data, misleading narratives persist,” CryptoQuant contributor “onchained,” said in a March 22 market report. “Such claims often lack onchain validation and are driven by sensationalist market sentiment rather than objective analysis,” the analyst said, adding: “Trust data, not noise, verify sources and cross-check onchain metrics.” Onchained pointed to the recent movements of Bitcoin ( BTC ) long-term holders (LTH) — those holding for over 155 days — as an example of false narratives clashing with real data. The analyst pointed out that while some narratives claim Bitcoin long-term holders are “capitulating,” the data shows they’re remaining consistent. “The data leaves no room for speculation,” Onchained said. The Inactive Supply Shift Index (ISSI) — which measures the degree to which long-dormant Bitcoin supply is shifting — “shows no meaningful LTH selling pressure, reinforcing a narrative of structural demand outpacing supply,” Onchained said. Narratives are always being challenged Crypto analytics platform Glassnode recently made a similar observation based on data, saying, “Long-Term Holder activity remains largely subdued, with a notable decline in their sell-side pressure.” Crypto market narratives are constantly changing and being challenged. One long-standing crypto narrative under debate is the relevance of the 4-year cycle theory, which suggests that Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable pattern tied to its halving event every four years. Source: Tomas Greif MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe said in a March 22 X post, “I assume that we can erase the entire 4-year cycle theory and that we’re in a longer cycle for Altcoins.” Related: Crypto markets will be pressured by trade wars until April: Analyst Echoing a similar sentiment, Bitwise Invest chief investment officer Matt Hougan recently said that “the traditional four-year cycle is over in crypto” due to the recent change in the US government’s stance. “Crypto has moved in four-year cycles since its earliest days. But the change in DC introduces a new wave that will play out over a decade,” Hougan said. Alongside this, some analysts are even debating whether the entire Bitcoin bull market is over . CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju said in a March 17 X post, “Bitcoin bull cycle is over, expecting 6-12 months of bearish or sideways price action.” Ju said all Bitcoin onchain metrics indicate a bear market. “With fresh liquidity drying up, new whales are selling Bitcoin at lower prices,” Ju said.

After a long legal battle, the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple, which has left the industry buzzing with excitement.. This decision marks a huge shift in how regulators will handle digital assets in the U.S., and it could set an important precedent for future cases. Jeremy Hogan, a legal expert, provided a detailed breakdown of the current situation, explaining that while the SEC has dropped its appeal, it’s still unclear if Ripple has agreed to the same. He said that the judgment from Judge Torres, which includes a $125 million penalty and an injunction, is the worst case scenario for Ripple. Here’s what could happen next: Ripple could continue appealing, seeking a court ruling on whether investment contracts require formal agreements. Ripple might agree to drop its appeal, returning the case to the trial court where both sides could try to amend the judgment. Ripple could drop its appeal and come to a private agreement with the SEC without modifying the judgment. Ripple might just pay the $125 million and move on without further legal action. This outcome could have lasting effects on the crypto industry, as the SEC’s decision to back off from its aggressive stance signals a potential shift toward more clear and balanced regulatory guidelines The legal victory clears a major roadblock for Ripple and sets the stage for the company to continue its mission of revolutionizing cross-border payments. It also suggests a future where digital assets may be regulated under clearer rules, creating opportunities for growth in the industry.

The Small Business Confidence Index has collapsed nearly 60% in just a few months. That’s not a typo. Even at the lowest point of the 2008 financial crisis, confidence was 10 points higher than it is now. Things are falling apart. And no one’s even bothering to sugarcoat it. Confidence is crashing faster than it did during the March 2020 lockdowns. By early 2025, small business sentiment had already started slipping. But once the trade war with the U.S. kicked off, it dropped to 25—the lowest reading ever recorded. Nothing else comes close. Source: The Kobeissi Letter on X Consumer confidence collapses as inflation and housing kill demand Meanwhile, Consumer sentiment in Canada just hit a new all-time low. In the U.S., consumer confidence is bad too—but Americans are still three times more optimistic than they were in 2008. In Canada, it’s 15 points below where it was during that global meltdown. It’s a record low. And it’s dragging everything else down with it. The economic chaos is starting to flip Canadian politics upside down. On February 16, the Liberal Party had about a 1% chance of winning the most seats in Parliament. That’s not an exaggeration. But now? They’ve got an 89% chance of taking the lead. That’s one of the biggest electoral reversals ever seen. Just two months ago, the Liberals were projected to grab 35 seats. The Conservatives were on track to grab 236. Now, the numbers show the Liberals with 178, and the Conservatives with just 131. A total reversal. Blame the economy. The trade war is ripping into what little confidence was left. Tariffs are brutal for Canada, and everyone knows it. Imports from Canada only make up 14% of what the U.S. buys. But on the flip side, the U.S. takes 78% of Canada’s exports. That’s not a trade relationship. That’s dependence. In 2023, Canada exported CAD$700 billion to the U.S. Meanwhile, interprovincial trade was only CAD$532 billion. Canada trades more with one foreign country than with itself. No surprise that tariffs are wrecking things. But confidence was already falling before tariffs showed up. Since 2020, Canada’s population grew by over 9%, but real GDP per worker dropped by 2%. At the same time, housing prices have gone up 300% since 2000. Tariffs didn’t cause this mess—but they might be the final blow. Canada’s housing shortage is so bad that people aren’t even hoping for price drops anymore. The country is running a structural deficit of 250,000 housing units every quarter. That’s a full-on crisis. Housing starts have been falling since 2021, while demand has doubled. People literally don’t know where they’re supposed to live. Inflation rebounds while businesses cut spending and jobs The U.S. inflation outlook isn’t helping. Americans now expect inflation to hit 6.0% over the next year. That’s the highest since May 2023. Long-term inflation expectations in the U.S. just hit 3.9%, the highest in 30 years. And Canada’s not immune. In February, Canadian CPI jumped from 1.9% to 2.6%, or 1.1% month-over-month. The forecast was 2.2% year-over-year and 0.6% month-over-month. Reality came in way worse. And those numbers don’t even include the full impact of the retaliatory tariffs yet. Give it a few more weeks and Canada’s inflation could easily blow past 3%. All this is happening while wages are flat, housing is unaffordable, and businesses are slamming the brakes on everything. According to the Bank of Canada, “the threat of tariffs is already affecting financial markets and business decisions.” The January Monetary Policy Report ran multiple scenarios. Under the baseline case—25% U.S. tariffs, with Canada retaliating—Canada’s GDP is expected to shrink by 2.5 percentage points in year one, 1.5 points in year two, and stay flat in year three. That’s three years of economic zero growth or worse. Another Bank of Canada report looked at how workers and businesses are reacting to trade tensions. People are planning to spend less because they’re worried about their jobs and financial health. Sectors like oil, mining, manufacturing, and agriculture are getting hit hardest. Those jobs are directly tied to exports and sensitive to tariffs. Workers in those industries are bracing for layoffs. Released on March 12, that report also showed businesses are preparing to cut hiring, reduce investments, and raise prices in response to the tariffs. In plain English: less work, less growth, more inflation. The report also said : “Inflation expectations are on the rise.” No surprise. Meanwhile, Canada’s canola industry is walking straight into a buzzsaw. Starting March 20, China hit Canadian canola oil and meal with 100% tariffs. On top of that, the U.S. might slap a 25% tariff on Canadian canola beginning April 2. This is on top of Trump’s new wave of aggressive trade policies. Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba have been begging the federal government for help, especially for farmers. But so far? Nothing. No assistance. No relief. Just tariffs and silence. So let’s run the full list: record low consumer confidence, a massive trade war, a housing shortage no one’s fixing, GDP per worker going down, inflation bouncing back hard, and a government trying to figure out how the hell it’s suddenly winning an election. “People are scared to spend, worried about their jobs, and businesses are reacting with layoffs and price hikes,” one Bank of Canada researcher said. “We’re watching real economic activity fall apart.” The confidence numbers don’t lie. The inflation numbers don’t lie. The trade numbers don’t lie. This isn’t a soft landing. It’s a crash. Canada is deep in it. Whether they call it a recession or not.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/anodos-co-founder-says-xrp-was-not-created-for-banks-heres-why/,"Panos Mekras, co-founder of Anodos Finance, recently took to social media to address what he describes as a widespread misconception about XRP. He stated , “XRP was not created for banks, and Ripple with their founders actually hated institutions and middlemen.” He went on to outline the history of XRP, its intended use case, and how the narrative surrounding it has changed over time. XRP was not created for banks, and Ripple with their founders actually hated institutions and middlemen. Here is the full story: Many people (within and outside the XRP community) still believe that XRP was created for banks and cross-border payments. It's a common… pic.twitter.com/iD2QkRfozl — Panos {X} (@panosmek) March 20, 2025 XRP’s Intended Purpose and Early History Mekras explained that many people, inside and outside the XRP community, believe that XRP was created for banks and cross-border payments. He asserted that this is incorrect and originated from narratives pushed by “Bitcoin maxis.” According to Mekras, “XRP was created for the opposite purpose – to destroy the banks’ monopoly and disintermediate them.” He described XRP as a more efficient alternative to Bitcoin with additional functionalities, such as a decentralized exchange (DEX) and tokenized assets. The goal, he stated, was to serve individuals and businesses rather than banks or institutions. He then provided a historical account of XRP’s development, stating that it was built by three developers—David Schwartz, Arthur Britto, and Jed McCaleb. By June 2012, the XRP Ledger was live, but at that time, Ripple did not exist. Later, Chris Larsen joined the project, and Ripple Labs Inc. was established under the name OpenCoin. Mekras emphasized that the supply of 100 billion XRP was created from the start, with no mechanism to create more. Ripple’s Early Vision and Shift in Focus According to Mekras, Ripple Labs initially had no interest in working with banks or facilitating cross-border payments. He cited their original vision, stating they wanted to “enable people to break free of the ‘walled gardens’ of financial networks like credit cards, banks, PayPal and other institutions that restrict access with fees, charges for currency exchanges and processing delays.” He claimed that the founders of Ripple disliked banks and aimed to develop an open payments system and peer-to-peer credit network on the XRP Ledger. However, Mekras stated that Ripple changed its approach in 2014, pivoting toward payments and engaging with the banking system . He explained that their goal was to “create a level playing field for the smaller banks and destroy the SWIFT’s cartel owned by the big ones.” He also mentioned that David Schwartz was inspired to work on the XRP Ledger partly because of a ban from PayPal, reinforcing the idea that the system was designed to free users from centralized financial intermediaries. XRP’s Role in Decentralized Finance In his concluding remarks, Mekras reiterated that the XRP Ledger was built for decentralized finance and was primarily meant for individuals and businesses that wanted alternatives to traditional banking. He argued that XRP was designed to address high fees, transaction delays, and censorship imposed by centralized entities. He concluded, “Anyone who tells you otherwise, is either clueless or deliberately lying to you for his interest. Power to the people.” Mekras’s statement challenges the perception that XRP was created as a tool for banks and cross-border payments, instead asserting that it was originally designed as a decentralized solution to disrupt traditional financial structures.

COIN shares plunged to a low of $176 this month, down by almost 50% from the year-to-date high. Its market cap has dropped from $86 billion to $48 billion, leading to a $38 billion wipeout. Coinbase news: to acquire Deribit Coinbase, the biggest crypto exchange in the US, made headlines this month. A key Coinbase news was the decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to end a case that has been going on for a while. Under Gary Gensler, the agency accused Coinbase of offering unregistered securities on its platform. The SEC has also ended other similar lawsuits against other top players in the crypto industry like Uniswap, Ripple Labs, Kraken, and OpenSea, the NFT giant. Another top Coinbase news came from Bloomberg, which reported that the company was considering making a bid for Deribit, a top crypto derivatives company. This would be a big move as it would transition it into the biggest derivatives player in the crypto industry. Estimates are that the deal will value Deribit at about $5 billion. There are signs that crypto companies are considering making large purchases this year. Just this week, Kraken acquired NinjaTrader in a $1.5 billion deal. These actions are happening at a time when the crypto industry is going through major challenges. Bitcoin price remains in a correction after falling from an all-time high of $109,300 to $84,000 today. Ethereum price has plunged from $4,080 to $1,800, while most altcoins have imploded. Also, crypto ETFs have lost substantial assets this year. Coinbase is also battling heightened competition from the likes of Binance, MEXC, Kraken, OKX, HTX, and other top crypto exchanges. COIN growth to slow this year The most recent financial results showed that Coinbase’s business did well in the fourth quarter as crypto prices surged. Its quarterly revenue rose from $904 million in Q4’23 to $1.128 billion in Q4’24. The most important detail in its report was that it has almost balanced its transaction revenue with that of its subscriptions. Its transaction revenue rose to $572 million, while the subscription and services segment made $641 million. The subscription revenues come from different areas. Most of it comes from stablecoins, while the rest comes from blockchain rewards, interest and finance fees, custodial fees, and other services. This division has higher margins, and its business is more stable. Wall Street analysts expect that Coinbase’s business will slow down in the coming months as crypto prices ease. The average estimate is that its revenue will be $2.23 billion this quarter, up by 35% from the same period last year. It will then make $8.12 billion this year. However, this growth will depend on the performance of the crypto market. Coinbase stock price analysis COIN chart by TradingView The daily chart shows that the COIN share price has crashed in the past few months, falling from a high of $350 to $190. It is about to form a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) have formed a bearish crossover pattern. The stock has also formed a bearish pennant pattern, a characterized by a long vertical line and a triangle pattern. Therefore, the Coinbase stock price will likely have a strong bearish breakdown in the coming days. The next key support level to watch will be at $150, down by 20% from the current level.

42192782,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=698197,1742709285,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42192782.jpeg,Elon Musk says he wants to use X to control the entire global financial system,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musk-x-entire-global-financial-system/,"Elon Musk wants X to run your whole financial life. Not just payments. Not just messages. Everything. That’s the plan. He says the rebrand from Twitter to X wasn’t just a facelift. It’s the start of something bigger. “Comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world,” Elon said in an interview. No more switching apps. No more banks. Just X. Elon also said it would be the most efficient money database ever built. He promised real-time processing, low fraud, and a system so big, it could become “half the global financial system.” His words , not ours: “I don’t know, maybe half the global financial system. Or some big number. I’m not sure what the number is, but pretty big. It would be by far the biggest financial institution.” Musk ignores past [and current] failures and wants to build the next WeChat Elon wants X to beat WeChat, the Chinese app that’s used for texting, shopping, sending money, paying bills, and even borrowing cash, which over a billion people use. But here’s the problem for the golden boy. Other tech giants already tried this, and they all failed. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg had Libra, and it was supposed to be this big cross-border payments project, but it got killed by regulators and Facebook’s own users. Google had a financial tool lined up with 11 banks that never launched. Amazon had talks with JPMorgan Chase to build a checking account, and nothing happened. Microsoft worked with BlackRock on retirement planning, and that plan disappeared too. Only Apple got something off the ground when it launched the Apple Card with Goldman Sachs in 2019. But hilariously enough, now Goldman wants out because the product is simply not profitable enough. So yeah—there’s a track record here. And it’s not great. Elon is already facing heat from regulators. The SEC just hit him with a lawsuit for not disclosing his stock purchases in Twitter before trying to buy the company in 2022. A court filing says a process server showed up at SpaceX in Brownsville, Texas on March 14 to serve the papers. But three guards refused to take the documents. One even told the guy he was trespassing. So the server left the paperwork on the ground. The guards snapped pictures of him and his car while he walked off. According to the court, Elon was supposed to file a disclosure within 10 days of owning more than 5% of Twitter. He didn’t. He waited longer. The SEC says that delay let him underpay by at least $150 million for the shares he grabbed after the deadline. The case was filed in Washington, D.C., and Elon has to respond by April 4. He can also file to dismiss it. This isn’t his first dance with the SEC either. Back in the Tesla days, he got hit with civil fraud charges. That time, he paid $20 million, Tesla paid $20 million, and he had to step down as chairman of Tesla’s board. X raises money, recovers valuation, and pulls in earnings Despite all this, X is raising money and pulling in numbers. A Bloomberg report says the platform raised nearly $1 billion in new funds. That deal puts X’s value at $32 billion. Yes, that’s lower than what Elon paid for it, but still a huge rebound. Remember—Fidelity said in September the company was worth under $10 billion. That’s a big jump in a few months. The Financial Times also dropped some numbers. They say X made $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings in 2024. That’s before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. And yeah, it’s roughly the same amount the platform made before Elon bought it. So even though ad revenue dropped and users left, somehow the earnings stayed up. That same report from the Financial Times puts X’s valuation back at $44 billion, matching what Elon paid for it back in 2022. Two different valuations—$32 billion from Bloomberg, $44 billion from FT—but either way, it’s clear the company made a big recovery. And yes, Elon helped fund that $1 billion raise himself. Not just outside investors. His own money went in. Meanwhile, Elon is busy in Washington. After taking over Twitter, he used the platform to back president Donald Trump and other Republican politicians. According to filings, he spent $290 million to help Trump get back into office. Now, he’s a top advisor inside the Trump administration. That new role might help explain what’s going on at the SEC. Trump’s White House just cut the agency’s budget and staff. Employees were offered $50,000 buyouts to leave or retire by March 21. That’s right around the same time the SEC filed the civil complaint against Elon. Trump also changed a long-standing SEC rule. For the past 15 years, the agency’s enforcement director could issue investigation orders directly. That power is gone now. All formal investigations have to go through the commissioners and get a vote. That slows everything down. Including cases like the one targeting Elon. So while X raises cash and posts numbers, its owner is knee-deep in court dates, politics, lawsuits, and a powerful affair with the leader of the free world. And through all of it, he’s still pushing to turn X into the main hub for global money. From texts to transfers. From tweets to loans. It’s no wonder Elon has backtracked on his crypto support.

42192455,https://coingape.com/?p=245521,1742709336,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Crypto Market This Week: US FOMC, XRP Lawsuit, & Pi Network In Spotlight",https://coingape.com/crypto-market-this-week-us-fomc-xrp-lawsuit-pi-network-in-spotlight/,"The crypto market concluded another week, primarily witnessing major developments surrounding the U.S. FOMC, XRP lawsuit, and Pi Network. While the Ripple community rejoiced in light of the U.S. SEC lawsuit end, the Fed Reserve kept interest rates unchanged. Simultaneously, Pi Network fluxed around the $1 mark this week, triggering a wave of speculation among investors. Other developments like a SUI ETF filing followed, stirring market optimism globally. Mentioned below are some of the top market updates reported by CoinGape over the past week. US FOMC Sparks Crypto Market Speculations With Unchanged Interest Rates The crypto market saw the latest US FOMC in play, with the Federal Reserve deciding to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25 to 4.5% this week. Nevertheless, speculations of a dovish stance as the year longs persist across the market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the inflation outlook is transitory with the Donald Trump-induced tariff in North America. Notably, the Fed appears to be gauging the impact of recent macro dynamics before making a rate cut decision. BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes further took the stage amid the FOMC decision, stating he believes a rate cut is looming for April 1. In turn, the CEO also anticipated a BTC rally to follow, given that the feat happens. Bitcoin closed the week at the $84K price level, whereas major altcoins mainly prevented downturns. XRP Lawsuit End: Affirms Ripple CEO Simultaneously, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse proclaimed that the U.S. SEC has agreed to drop the XRP lawsuit this week. While this news offered the Ripple community immense relief, a butterfly effect occurred in the crypto market. The SEC’s stance on cryptocurrencies saw a loosened grip under Trump’s presidency. Meanwhile, CLO Stuart Alderoty revealed the next steps following the U.S. SEC’s declaration of an appeal drop in the lawsuit. In the interim, XRP price closed this week considerably above the $2 level, although the weekly chart showed a dip of 2%. Pi Network: What’s The Buzz? Pi Network stole the broader market’s attention, showcasing a highly fluxing action over the past week. CoinGape reported that this volatility came attributed to nearly 129 million Pi Coins ready for an unlock, worth about $175 million, set to be added to the supply this month. On the other hand, the crypto saw rising adoption in the Asian landscape this week. Vietnam-based Pi enthusiast Cryptoleakvn recently shared an update on X, highlighting a surge in Pi-accepting regions across the country. However, the Pi token faced investor selloff concerns amid its turbulent price action this week. The lack of major announcements by the crypto team has added to market concerns about future movements. In conclusion, mentioned above were some of the top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape over the past week. It’s also worth mentioning that Canary Capital filed for SUI ETF approval with the U.S. SEC this week.

Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, is showing signs of bullishness but struggles to overcome crucial resistance points, sparking speculation about its potential to break out. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is setting itself apart. As the market experiences fluctuations, BlockDAG captures attention with its forthcoming beta testnet. All individuals who participated in the presale receive 10,000 testnet coins at no cost and stand a chance to win $2,000 in BDAG rewards if they are among the top 30 contributors. This initiative targets those engaged in smart contract deployment or active participation, offering significant early benefits. BlockDAG’s Testnet Evolves Into a $60K Incentive Challenge BlockDAG is rewarding its 110,000+ presale participants uniquely by offering tangible incentives for engagement. Every participant receives 10,000 complimentary testnet BDAG coins for activities like testing smart contracts, executing transactions, or exploring new functionalities. The excitement builds as the top 30 contributors during the testnet phase will secure $2,000 in BDAG when the cryptocurrency officially launches, based on criteria such as wallet activity, testnet balance, and mining prowess. This is not just a competition; it’s an open invitation for all presale joiners to engage deeply from the outset. The ongoing crypto presale is robust, with more than 18.8 billion BDAG coins sold, accumulating over $205 million. The price per coin has surged from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0248 in Batch 27, marking a 2,380% gain for early supporters. Additionally, a 150% retroactive bonus has been applied to all previous purchases, and we are now in the final phase before bonus offerings conclude. With the beta testnet soon to become operational, the focus is shifting towards the mainnet, enhancing utility, and preparing for exchange listings. BlockDAG is not just a potential purchase; it’s proving to be a proactive choice for crypto enthusiasts. With free coins, competitive rewards, and forthcoming functionalities, BlockDAG is quickly building momentum. With planned support for CEX listings and smart contracts, it’s poised as a top crypto to consider before its official launch cements its status. Challenges for Dogecoin (DOGE) as Price Remains Under $1 Amid Speculation The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently well below the much-anticipated $1 mark, hovering at around $0.165. Achieving the $1 milestone this year would require a dramatic 600% surge—a daunting task without a significant catalyst. Despite potential indicators like a falling wedge suggesting a possible recovery, there lacks sufficient momentum or impactful news to drive a significant price increase. Concerns are growing over Elon Musk’s potential departure from the Dogecoin community, with a 54% probability he might disengage, potentially dampening market sentiment. Additionally, broader market challenges, such as concerns over tariffs and speculation about an AI industry bubble, could further depress Dogecoin’s value. Without robust support or fresh demand, a price breakout seems unlikely in the near term. Ethereum (ETH) Encounters Stubborn Resistance Ethereum (ETH) is displaying resilience with its recent bullish behavior, yet it consistently meets strong resistance at the $2100 level. The cryptocurrency managed a peak of $2000 but fell back to $1,922 before regaining some ground. The price action includes patterns such as triangles, channels, and unconfirmed breakouts, all occurring within a narrow range. Mixed signals from technical indicators like the MACD and RSI hint at possible trend reversals and overbought conditions but fail to predict a robust upward movement. Currently, Ethereum is in a consolidation phase, with many traders anticipating a significant movement post-consolidation, contingent on increased volume and a decisive breach of the $2100 resistance. Until then, Ethereum’s market position remains uncertain, with short-term traders possibly finding opportunities, while long-term participants may hold off for a more definitive breakout. The Final Take Dogecoin’s trajectory remains sluggish, still far from the $1 goal, with potential shifts in Elon Musk’s involvement adding to the uncertainty. Ethereum’s attempts to surpass the $2100 barrier continue without success, indicating ongoing market hesitancy for both cryptocurrencies. Conversely, BlockDAG is taking a proactive approach by spotlighting its upcoming features. Each participant in the presale is rewarded with 10,000 testnet coins, and the top 30 most active users will receive $2,000 in BDAG rewards. More than just a test, this initiative positions itself as a rewarding contest for early participants. For those evaluating the crypto market, BlockDAG’s engaging community and imminent bonuses offer compelling reasons to consider its potential, especially with key exchange listings on the horizon.

After a steep correction from recent highs, DOGE is now consolidating in a tight range between $0.16 and $0.18. This zone has become a critical battleground for bulls and bears alike as investors wait for a clear breakout or breakdown. Related Reading: Investors Withdraw 360,000 Ethereum From Exchanges In Just 48 Hours – Accumulation Trend? For bulls, reclaiming levels above $0.18 is essential to kickstart a recovery and restore confidence in the asset’s short-term outlook. If DOGE can break above this resistance, momentum could quickly build toward higher price targets. However, continued weakness below $0.16 could signal a deeper correction ahead. Despite the recent struggles, on-chain data paints a more optimistic picture. According to Santiment, whales have accumulated over 120 million DOGE in the past week, suggesting that large holders are positioning for a potential rebound. This increase in whale activity is often seen as a bullish signal, especially during periods of consolidation. Whether Dogecoin can capitalize on this support remains to be seen, but for now, the groundwork for a breakout is being laid. Dogecoin Consolidates Ahead Of Potential Breakout Dogecoin has remained in a tight consolidation range since March 11, trading between $0.16 and $0.18 with no clear breakout in sight. This prolonged period of sideways movement has left investors on edge, as the entire crypto market awaits a decisive catalyst to determine the next major direction. Market conditions remain highly uncertain, driven by global macroeconomic instability, aggressive monetary policies, and ongoing trade tensions. As a result, traders are preparing for increased volatility. Meme coins like Dogecoin are typically among the most volatile assets during both bull and bear phases. In bear markets, they tend to be hit the hardest due to their speculative nature and lack of strong fundamentals compared to large-cap projects. With analysts split on whether this is a correction within a larger bull cycle or the beginning of a full-fledged bear market, Dogecoin’s next move could be pivotal. Despite the fear in the market, on-chain metrics suggest that large holders may be positioning for a move higher. According to data shared by top analyst Ali Martinez on X, whales have bought over 120 million DOGE in the past week alone. This accumulation by major players could signal growing confidence in a potential rebound, especially if Dogecoin can break above the $0.18 resistance zone. For now, the market continues to watch closely. A breakout from this range could lead to a rapid move, either up or down, with whale activity hinting that bulls may be preparing to take control. Whether Dogecoin rallies or retreats will depend on the broader market’s next move—but all eyes are on the meme coin leader. Related Reading: XRP Active Addresses Hit Highest Level Since April 2023 – Will Price Follow? Price Holds Key Support But Faces Crucial Resistance Ahead Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.16 after several days of consolidation between the $0.15 support and the $0.17 resistance level. This narrow range reflects the uncertainty dominating the broader crypto market, with meme coins like DOGE experiencing low volatility and cautious trading activity. Despite holding above $0.15—a critical support zone—bulls have been unable to generate enough momentum to push prices toward the $0.20 level. Reclaiming $0.20 is essential, as it would likely signal the start of a recovery phase and potentially trigger bullish sentiment across the Dogecoin community. That level could serve as a launchpad for a new rally, especially if broader market conditions stabilize and BTC leads a move upward. However, if DOGE fails to hold the $0.15 support, the risk of a deeper correction increases significantly. A breakdown below this level could send the price into lower demand zones, potentially testing the $0.13 or even $0.12 levels in a more bearish scenario. Related Reading: Ethereum Trades At A Critical Level – Major Reclaim Or Steep Drop Ahead? For now, the price remains range-bound, but pressure is building. Bulls must act soon to reclaim higher ground, or bears may seize control and drive DOGE into deeper losses. The coming days will be critical for determining short-term momentum.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-investors-are-sending-letters-to-sec-heres-why/,"Recent developments have brought renewed attention to allegations against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its handling of XRP and potential conflicts of interest within its ranks. Edward Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, highlighted these concerns in a recent tweet, sharing an email allegedly sent by an XRP investor to the SEC. The email claims that the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple led to financial devastation for many investors and points to questionable ties between former SEC official William Hinman and Ethereum-linked entities. XRP investors are sending letters to @SECGov , stating the SEC has destroyed lives, with many losing their life savings on the same day the SEC sued @Ripple , crashing $XRP . Conflict of interest also exposed: Bill Hinman reportedly received $16M linked to ETH while in office. pic.twitter.com/hy6eW21n96 — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) March 20, 2025 Investor Alleges Life Savings Lost Due to SEC Lawsuit The email shared by Farina presents a strong criticism of the SEC’s decision to sue Ripple, arguing that it resulted in severe financial consequences for investors. The writer of the email states, “I personally lost my life savings the same day that SEC sued XRP and caused it to crash 15 billion dollars in the first 24 hours.” The statement underscores the claim that the SEC’s actions directly led to significant market losses, impacting countless individuals who held XRP. The email also criticizes the SEC for failing to protect investors. “SEC should be to protect investors, yet not one case against Crypto has protected civilians,” the writer states, arguing that the agency’s regulatory actions have disproportionately benefited large financial institutions at the expense of retail investors. Accusations of Conflict of Interest One of the most serious claims in the email involves William Hinman, former SEC Director of Corporation Finance. The email alleges that Hinman was “receiving 16 million USD from an ETH (Crypto) firm at the same time he gave only that coin positive clarity (while concurrently crushing ETH competitors).” This statement suggests that while Hinman was in a position to influence regulatory decisions, he had financial ties to entities linked to Ethereum, raising concerns over impartiality. This accusation aligns with broader claims in the crypto community that Ethereum was given a regulatory advantage over other digital assets. The SEC has maintained that its enforcement actions are based on legal principles rather than favoritism, but allegations of inconsistency in its treatment of different cryptocurrencies continue to surface. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Calls for Accountability The email further criticizes the SEC for failing to target fraudulent projects while allegedly harming legitimate blockchain businesses. The writer questions, “If SEC wants to protect people, then why can’t you use funds to destroy scams and ponzi coins (you have several thousand to pick from), instead of destroying genuine good-willing USA businesses like Ripple?” This suggests that the SEC’s priorities may be misaligned, focusing on well-established projects rather than actively preventing financial harm caused by fraudulent schemes. The concerns raised in this email reflect the frustration among XRP investors who believe they are unfairly targeted by regulators. While the SEC maintains that XRP was sold as an unregistered security, the broader debate over the agency’s approach to digital assets remains unresolved.

The BNB token plays a pivotal role in powering the BSC network, which has been rapidly growing and gaining traction among developers and users alike. Binance Coin’s strength lies in its adaptability and integration into the growing DeFi and Web3 sectors.

Understanding Blockchain Interoperability: Why It Matters Blockchain interoperability is a crucial factor that often gets overlooked in the crypto world. Essentially, interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain systems to work together seamlessly. This is where Qubetics shines. The coin’s ability to facilitate cross-chain transactions makes it a vital player in a world where blockchain ecosystems often operate in silos. With interoperability, businesses and developers don’t need to pick just one blockchain; they can choose the best features of each and combine them in innovative ways. This is a game-changer for the blockchain industry, and it’s one of the reasons why Qubetics has garnered so much attention. In simple terms, it solves a problem that has been plaguing the space for a while now, making it easier for people to move assets across different blockchains without the headaches of compatibility issues. In the coming years, blockchain interoperability is expected to become even more important, as the demand for decentralized applications and cross-chain solutions increases.

Analyst Shares Bermuda Triangle Update,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-27-analyst-shares-bermuda-triangle-update/,"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has shared a new update on XRP’s price trajectory, refining his earlier projections with a focus on Fibonacci extensions. His analysis maintains a long-term price target of $27 while emphasizing key structural patterns in XRP’s price action. By removing candle wicks and focusing solely on full-body closes, he aims to provide a clearer and more reliable interpretation of market trends. #XRP Bermuda Triangle Update: Targeting $27 (Chart Analysis): For comprehensive insights about the Bermuda Triangle, please refer to my previous post from January 2025: Link https://t.co/KMrCJZLqyj .

According to Egrag, this is a strong bullish signal, as full-body candle formations provide more reliable confirmations of price movements compared to wick-based fluctuations. He also identifies the absence of resistance at the Fibonacci 1.236 level as a critical factor, suggesting that XRP is poised for its next leg up. His projections estimate a price range of $5 to $6 in the near term, with the potential for wicks reaching up to $9 or $10 if Fibonacci 1.618 is tested. Market Scenarios and Cycle Considerations Egrag outlines multiple potential scenarios based on market timing. If the anticipated price surge occurs before May, a correction could follow before further bullish continuation. However, if this move happens later in the year—toward the end of summer or in Q4—this could indicate a cycle top, signaling the conclusion of the current phase. He supports the four-year cycle theory, suggesting that XRP’s price movements align with historical market behavior. Revisiting the Bermuda Triangle Framework This update builds upon Egrag’s January 2025 analysis, where he introduced the “Bermuda Triangle” framework. This structure incorporates Fibonacci Circle price targets, critical support levels, and long-term market patterns. He previously identified key technical elements, such as the Atlas Line, which he described as an essential support structure maintaining XRP’s price stability. In that analysis, he also emphasized the importance of the Seven Arcs, which represent Fibonacci Circle-based price targets. With the first four already breached, the next focus is on Arcs 5, 6, and 7, particularly around March 10, 2025. His outlook remains unchanged in this latest update, reinforcing his belief in the long-term trajectory of XRP.

Notably, this surge arrives just a day before the highly anticipated PepeX presale launch , stirring curiosity in the crypto community. With the BTC price hovering near $84,000, the timing of these events could sway the Bitcoin bull run and ripple across the market. Investors are now eyeing both BTC dominance and the rising meme coin sector for clues. Bitcoin exchange whale ratio hits yearly high The Bitcoin exchange whale ratio, a critical on-chain indicator, has spiked to a 2025 peak, unsettling traders watching the BTC price. This metric which tracks the share of the top 10 inflows to centralized exchanges against total inflows has jumped to over 0.6, the highest since September 2024, suggesting whales are moving hefty sums of Bitcoin (BTC) to exchanges. Such activity often signals looming sales, threatening the price of Bitcoin. At press time, the BTC USD price sat at $84,153, with analysts fearing the whale-driven trend could derail the chances of any Bitcoin bull run. When large holders transfer BTC to exchanges, it historically sparks sell-offs, dragging BTC USD price lower. CryptoQuant’s EgyHash recently noted the ratio’s steady climb since December 2024, calling it a bearish omen for Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin exchange whale ratio chart analysis by CryptoQuant’s EgyHash The Bitcoin heatmap reflects this tension, with clusters of activity hinting at shifting sentiment. Beyond whales, external factors add complexity. As flagged in recent BTC news, speculation about Trump in Bitcoin or US government moves fuels uncertainty. If whale selling accelerates, BTC dominance—its market share—could wane, pushing attention toward alternatives like memecoins. For now, the Bitcoin price teeters, with traders bracing for volatility. PepeX presale launch amid BTC price uncertainty As the BTC price wavers, the crypto spotlight shifts to PepeX, an AI-powered meme coin launchpad debuting its presale on March 24, 2025. PepeX promises a fresh take on meme coin creation, offering a fairer platform than rivals like pump.fun. The PepeX.fun launchpad platform’s model caps memecoin founders at 5% of tokens, leaving 95% for the community, and redistributes locked liquidity if projects flop. This setup aims to curb scams and boost trust in memecoins. The timing of the PepeX.fun platform launch fascinates observers. With Bitcoin (BTC) under whale-induced strain, some see meme coins as a hedge or opportunity. Notably, the PepeX.fun platform will feature an AI marketing bot, automating the promotion of created tokens across social platforms and making its memecoin launches stand out from the likes of Pump.fun. These innovations position PepeX’s token as a contender for the best meme coin to buy now, especially if the Bitcoin price falters seeing that the meme coin niche often thrives when BTC news turns sour, drawing risk-tolerant investors. Over the recent past, memecoins have carved a loyal following, and PepeX’s tools might elevate their appeal. In addition, if BTC dominance slips, capital could flow into the meme coin space, amplifying interest in the likes of the PepeX presale .

42195198,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104020,1742713018,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,"Coinbase Creates Verified Pools, a Verified DeFi Built from Uniswap, with Noncustodial Wallet",https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-creates-verified-pools-a-verified-defi-built-from-uniswap-with-noncustodial-wallet/,"Coinbase has launched Verified Pools, a tool to swap or trade tokens over a DeFi network. However, with an added feature, liquidity providers must verify their identities. This new feature, according to Coinbase , will increase security and transparency. Decentralized Finance allows people to trade tokens without an intermediary. However, such an approach creates a new problem because liquidity providers do not know who they are trading with, adding to the risk profile of DeFi trading. Coinbase solves this problem by verifying users through the Coinbase wallet, making the process less cumbersome. Verified Pools run on Base, a layer 2 Ethereum blockchain. It operates as an online service, adding a level of security and transparency to the Coinbase exchange. The pools are noncustodial, meaning users have more control over their funds. “Coinbase is excited to introduce Verified Pools,” announced Coinbase, “a trusted way to seamlessly trade and swap on-chain. Whether you’re an institution seeking to provide liquidity or a retail trader looking for an easy way to start trading onchain, Verified Pools is setting a new standard: compliance meets efficiency, and trust meets transparency”. Verified Pools, developed from Uniswapv4, allows Coinbase to create a custom smart contract, including verification data, running on Base, Coinbase’s layer 2 network, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. Coinbase contracted Gauntlet, a risk modelling company, to make sure the pools work correctly, minimising risk for consumers. Base, a layer 2 blockchain, allows users to exchange directly within the pools, minimizing transaction times and verifying all users, thus increasing the market’s liquidity. And on top of that, Coinbase claims that users have complete control of their wallets. Such a balance between trustless blockchains and centralized exchanges, on paper at least, provides benefits from both approaches. In other words, Coinbase could be trying to have its cake and eat it by using both centralized and decentralized technology. Coinbase, although announcing the new technology, has not provided a date for its implementation. Despite the use case for verified pools, a market for decentralized exchanges (DEX) already exists, providing a possible challenge for Coinbase. The promise of a noncustodial wallet also sounds very appealing, especially after the FTX exchange collapse. Yet whether the user has complete control over their wallet while required to verify their identity is yet to be seen. “Decentralized finance (DeFi),” wrote Coinbase, “has been one of the most exciting frontiers in crypto, offering innovative ways to engage in various on-chain activities. Liquidity pools are a primary example, allowing users to trade digital assets without intermediaries. However, liquidity pools have traditionally been opaque-it hasn’t always been clear who is providing funds, leading to potential risks”. Verified Pools will be available in select countries like America, Singapore, and the Netherlands. Moreover, Coinbase plans to extend its service to more countries, add more trading pairs, and integrate the blockchains of more Decentralized Exchanges (DEX). Coinbase has been renenergized since Trump ended the ‘war on crypto’, taking him seriously when he said he wants America to be the ‘crypto capital of the world’, a complete reversal from the previous administration, and giving Coinbase a good reason to employ more staff and invest in research and development. Moreover, the SEC has dropped their legal investigation into Coinbase, freeing up time for the exchange to pursue more valuable activities. The watchdog of American securities behaves more like a security guard, a form of unproductive labor, than an institution aiming to promote fair trade and honest business. “Coinbase Verified Pools”, wrote Coinbase, discussing the problem of anonymous liquidity providers, “change that. It’s a curated selection of liquidity pools by connecting your Prime Onchain Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, or another third-party wallet with the Coinbase Verifications credential, which serves as a trusted badge in the Onchain ecosystem. Verified Pools is currently open to users in the U.S., Singapore, Netherlands, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, and the Channel Islands”.",Cryptocurrency|News|Coinbase,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MINING|TRADING|UNI|ASIA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-23 06:56:58

However, certain tokenomics and technical patterns point to a price reversal in the near future. The massive Pi Network community finally saw the release of the project’s Open Network and native token on February 20 after years and years of development. The asset experienced enhanced volatility in its first trading days, which included a drop from $1.8 to $0.7 and an all-time high of $3. However, its progress has stalled since then and PI is now down by over 30% on a weekly scale. It was once close to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, but it’s currently at the 26th spot, losing a significant chunk of its own. As reported yesterday, certain partnerships could propel a price reversal for the token. However, there are other bullish hints as well. A Pi Network-dedicated channel based in Vietnam indicated that this price crash could be related to the massive amount of unlocked PI tokens in the first month of its official existence. The team explained, though, that the supply continues to decline and is down to 6.7 billion from 7.2 billion. The post further said the actual circulating supply is about 1.7 billion as many Pi Network users have failed to complete the necessary verification steps , and their 5 billion PI tokens are still locked. The team concluded that the number of unlocked PI tokens for the next month should decrease significantly, from 13M PI per day to 3.8M/day. Should that transpire and there are fewer coins being unlocked, the asset’s price could start to recover, especially if the demand remains the same or increases. Separately, a popular analyst on X noted that the PI/USDT pair has been “confined within a falling channel, facing repeated rejections at the upper trendline while finding strong support at the lower edge.” He determined that a breakout from this descending channel with “notable momentum” could reverse the trend. In addition, a previous resistance has been reclaimed and turned into a support line, which reinforces the bullish sentiments and could lead to a surge to $2 soon. #PI Analysis: The PI/USDT pair has been confined within a falling channel, facing repeated rejections at the upper trendline while finding strong support at the lower edge.

This has prompted Coinbase to discuss the possible takeover with regulators. Coinbase currently runs a Bermuda-based derivatives platform, launched in 2023, but it still operates predominantly as an exchange. Coinbase’s customers mainly use the exchange for spot trading but have started to branch out to other services. Deribit holds an operational license in Dubai, so Coinbase has to seek out regulators in the country before initiating takeover procedures. The anonymous sources who broke the story are working with Bloomberg News. The anonymous sources may be Coinbase employees or could be connected to the regulatory process in Dubai. Coinbase, a publicly listed company, operates the largest crypto exchange in America, sells hundreds of thousands of digital tokens, and offers an Ethereum-based wallet to allow clients to safeguard their tokens while accessing popular exchanges. The company has expanded rapidly, with various departments operating within the organization. Coinbase announced that 1,000 American jobs would be created at the White House summit. Kraken, a rival exchange, has already started the process of buying futures platform NinjaTrader, worth around $1.5 billion. This would be the first time a crypto company was allowed to sell crypto derivatives in America. Deribit’s founders, John Jansen and Marius Jansen, created the exchange in 2016. Initially based in the Netherlands, it attracted many early crypto investors. In January this year, a spokesperson for Deribit said the company was still not for sale but was in talks with various investors at the time. Deribit did not name the investors who were interested in the company. As the U.S. embraces the crypto business under Trump’s new administration, American exchanges may see this as a rare opportunity to expand their operations. Trump has dramatically escalated government support for the crypto industry, hiring pro-crypto civil servants. The changes may benefit companies like Coinbase and Kraken. In 2024, Deribit’s trading volume doubled to around $1.2 trillion. It operates with derivatives such as futures and is the largest exchange trading Bitcoin and Ethereum options. Coinbase’s decision to buy Deribit could be part of a strategy to enter the Middle East market since Deribit is based in Dubai. Innovation hubs have emerged from adopting crypto, including the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Conversely, during the ‘war on crypto’, American and European innovation suffered and became less noticeable despite these regions showing a strong market for crypto amongst the general population.",Cryptocurrency|News|Coinbase,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|TRADING|ASIA|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-23 07:01:09

These Levels Are Critical,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/moment-of-destiny-in-ethereum-bullish-or-bearish-these-levels-are-critical/,"Cryptocurrency analysis firm MakroVision has published an assessment of the current state of Ethereum. According to the analysis, although the ETH price is showing signs of recovery after recent declines, the market still remains uncertain. The latest sell-off has sent Ethereum’s price down to $1,730. A limited recovery has been observed in this area, but a clear trend reversal has yet to be confirmed, according to the analyst firm. According to MakroVision's analysis, the critical levels to watch in Ethereum are as follows: $2,132: Short-term target area. Breaking this level will determine whether the recovery gains momentum. $2,550-2,600: A significant resistance point, both psychologically and technically. The falling trend line also passes through this level. $1,730: Support level that must be maintained to prevent Ethereum from falling further. $1,544: The last line of defense. Losing this level could be a strong bearish signal. Related News: Big Whale Patiently Waited Three Weeks: Sold This Altcoin Out, Made a Hefty Profit It is emphasized that as long as the Ethereum price remains below $ 2,132, the downtrend is dominant. According to the analysis, exceeding the $ 2,600 level will be a critical threshold for the trend to change completely. *This is not investment advice.

Despite closing with a bearish candlestick yesterday, the price managed to stay above the ascending trendline, indicating that bullish momentum remains intact. However, early trading hours saw a sharp attempt by bears to push the price lower, only for bulls to step in aggressively and defend the $2.35 support zone. As a result, XRP rebounded and is currently trading around $2.3895. Potential Bullish Breakout If bulls successfully maintain support above $2.35 and the daily candlestick closes bullish, it could trigger a strong upside move . A sustained breakout may propel XRP past the $2.59 resistance level, opening the door for further gains toward $2.71. Beyond this mark, a close above $2.71 could ignite a powerful rally, potentially driving prices into the $3.0–$3.4 range before facing any meaningful correction. This scenario would reinforce the broader bullish trend, attracting more buyers into the market. Bearish Risks Loom If Support Fails On the flip side, failure to hold the $2.35 support level could give bears the upper hand, increasing selling pressure. A decisive break down below this key level may push XRP toward $2.20, with extended losses potentially testing the $2.00–$1.80 zone before a significant rebound occurs. If this scenario plays out, traders should be cautious of further downward volatility. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Outlook and Key Levels to Watch As XRP trades near this crucial price point, investors and traders must closely monitor market movements. The $2.35 support level remains the defining threshold for XRP’s next move. A bullish close above this level could signal a fresh rally, while a break below may expose the asset to further declines. With both scenarios in play, XRP’s price action in the coming sessions will determine its next major trend direction.

Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 231,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin tends to witness a two-stage bull market based on historical precedence. The trader shares a chart suggesting that the second stage of the Bitcoin bull market would last until the end of the year. “Bull market – Stage two BTC.” Source: Inmortal/X Zooming in, the crypto strategist outlines a potential price path for Bitcoin, predicting that BTC will be stuck in a wide trading range for months before igniting a huge upside burst en route to new all-time highs. “Something like this. BTC.” Source: Inmortal/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that BTC will trade between $90,000 and $76,000 until June before taking off and ascending to a new record high at around $140,000, At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $83,994. Turning to Ethereum, Inmortal says that the native asset of the top smart contract platform could spark surges after ETH’s relative strength index (RSI) indicator dropped to oversold territory on the three-day chart. The RSI is a momentum indicator with values above 70 suggesting overbought conditions while a reading below 30 indicates oversold levels. “Probably nothing ETH.” Source: Inmortal/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that ETH tends to carve a major bottom after its RSI nears 20 on the three-day timeframe. Earlier this month, ETH’s three-day RSI plunged to 25 as Ethereum’s price collapsed to a 2025 low of $1,754. At time of writing, ETH is trading for $1,987.

This Critical Metric Says It Might Be,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-bull-cycle-over-this-critical-metric-says-it-might-be/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) prolonged downturn over the last two months has raised speculation about the end of the bull cycle and the onset of a bear market. While several market analysts continue to predict the cryptocurrency’s short-term price trajectory, only on-chain data and metrics can paint a clear picture. A weekly report from the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant says the Bitcoin Bull Score Model can tell if this drawdown is a temporary correction or the start of a prolonged downturn. Unfortunately, this metric does not paint a bullish scenario for BTC. The Bull Score Model According to CryptoQuant, the Bull Score Model assesses the investment environment for BTC by evaluating nine on-chain indicators and one market metric. Each metric acts as a binary indicator of market conditions and is assigned a value of 1 (bullish) or 0 (bearish) based on rules that evaluate network activity, market liquidity, demand, and investor behavior. The metrics include the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio, the Bitcoin Profit and Loss Index, the Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator, and the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP). The Bitcoin Bull Score Model also includes indicators like the CryptoQuant Network Activity Index, Stablecoin Liquidity, Bitcoin Demand Growth, Trader On-chain Profit Margin, Trader Realized Price, and Technical Signal. Currently, only two out of the ten metrics – Stablecoin Liquidity and Technical Signal – are flashing bullish signals, signifying a predominantly bearish market. CryptoQuant said such conditions reveal a lack of strong fundamentals to support and sustain a price rally or recovery. “We can observe that the metrics have switched between bullish and bearish phases multiple times, with extended periods of green indicating strong bullish cycles and prolonged stretches of red corresponding to market conditions. Recently, a significant number of metrics have turned red, particularly since mid-February 2025,” the market analytics platform added. Bitcoin’s Bull Cycle is Over Some metrics, like the Network Activity Index, have been bearish since December 2024, signaling a sustained reduction in network activity. Overall, these metrics are at their least bullish state since January 2023. The Bull Score Model measures the percentage of bullish metrics from 0 to 100, with the former being bearish and the latter being bullish. During past bull markets, BTC has experienced strong rallies with the Bull Score at 60 and above. However, whenever the Bull Score falls below 40, the cryptocurrency has witnessed prolonged downturns aligned with bear markets. Bitcoin’s Bull Score is currently at 20 – its lowest level since January 2023 – signaling a weak investment environment and low chances of a sustained rally in the near term.

One is fueled by hype, while the other has the potential for Ethereum-like growth. The TRUMP token, currently trading around $3, has gained attention due to its politically charged branding, but analysts argue it lacks the long-term fundamentals to sustain momentum. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance is building real utility with its all-in-one DeFi platform. The project raised its stake to $4.4 million and obtained 6400 holder accounts. The third phase of MUTM token presale has attracted investors to purchase at $0.025 while the asset currently trades at $0.02. The ongoing presale which is 50% sold out offers Mutuum Finance at $0.02 but the project launch price will begin at $0.06. Analysts forecast a surge to $1. Mutuum Finance is in the process of a smart contract audit by CertiK, an essential measure to strengthen security and trust. The official report will be published on their social media once the audit is complete. Surging Interest in the MUTM Presale During phase 3 of the MUTM presale investors have rapidly increased their contributions through 6300 accounts resulting in $4.4 million token deposits throughout the first several purchase days. Investors with hardware wallets can obtain Mutuum Finance tokens during pre-sale but they receive the following advantages: they get an opportunity to purchase tokens at $0.06 setting their future value potential. Mutuum Finance tokens will reach prices expected to surpass $1 after their listing date because exchange agreements will improve their value following launch. Mutuum Finance achieves its innovative expansion and sustainable growth objectives through its secure and scalable design which supports expansion potentials and architectural components. Predictive smart contracts optimize the lending mechanisms of the platform that connects various networks because of its platform-independent features. Stakeholders receive periodic rewards which generate passive income throughout their whole investment period. USD stablecoin provides stability to users through system-supported platform assets which establish a new economic direction. Mutuum Finance oriented itself as a top DeFi investment platform by deepening its liquidity operations while building its market positioning prior to its market listing. Exclusive Perks for Early Investors Mutuum Finance conducts an early adopter celebration giveaway that distributes $100,000 MUTM tokens while providing $10,000 Mutuum Finance tokens to each participant from the ten members who join. The platform gives users benefits from its referral network because new members earn greater rewards advantages through it. Mutuum Finance delivers foremost decentralized lending solutions through their dual-lending model that includes adjustable capabilities along with optimal operational results. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) platform strengthens both lender and borrower interactions by providing better rates of capital accessibility together with automatic management systems for interest rates. Each user within the Peer-to-Peer model independently establishes their personal loan agreements using the direct operating system provided by the model. Mutuum Finance establishes its place as the top DeFi lending service by implementing its dual-lending system for the market. Mutuum Finance stands out as the stronger long-term investment, offering real utility through its innovative DeFi lending model. With $4.4 million raised and 6,400 holders already on board, the project is rapidly gaining traction. As the presale nears its next phase, investors still have a chance to buy at $0.02 before the price rises to $0.025. Given its CertiK audit, Ethereum-backed stability, and high growth potential, MUTM presents a unique opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the next big DeFi project.

Based on recent on-chain data, an analyst has pointed out how the changing investor sentiment could affect the world’s largest cryptocurrency over the next few weeks. Can BTC Price Charge To New All-Time High? In a recent post on X, crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr explained how the Bitcoin market dynamics could significantly shift in the coming weeks. This projection is based on recent changes in the “Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Nears Major Resistance At $2,200, Why A 13% Crash Could Follow The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index refers to a metric that aggregates the average sentiment of investors in the BTC market. The indicator is divided into five zones, including extreme fear, fear, neutral, greed, and extreme greed. Extreme fear signals that traders and investors are moving with high caution, while extreme greed suggests an overheating market condition with traders flooding in with new positions. Historically, periods of extreme fear have been correlated with market bottoms while price corrections usually occur during extreme greed. According to Adler Jr., the 90-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index has fallen by approximately 22 percentage points over the past two months. This decline has seen the BTC metric shift from extreme greed to a more moderate level of greed. Going further, the on-chain analyst mentioned that if the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index drops by another 10 to 15 points in the near future, the market may experience a cooling-off period where participants could have become accustomed to negative factors and emotional price movements may even subside. Adler Jr added in his post: At the current pace, it may take approximately 4 to 6 weeks for the index to drop by an additional 10–15 points. The analyst also highlighted that the 30-day (monthly) moving average appears to be reaching a local bottom, one seen at the end of the Bitcoin price correction to $54,000. The last time the Fear and Greed Index monthly SMA reached this level, the premier cryptocurrency climbed to a new all-time high price. If this historical pattern holds, investors could see the BTC price break out of its consolidation range. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC is just beneath the $84,000 level, reflecting a 0.5% decline in the past 24 hours.

This may raise questions for the AI crypto sector, which has, at times, seemed to react to Nvidia’s price. “NVDA just formed a Death Cross for the first time since April 2022. The last one sent shares plunging 47% over the next 6 months,” markets data platform Barchart said in a March 23 X post. A death cross is a bearish signal that occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of an asset’s market price falls below the 200-day SMA. Source: Barchart While Nvidia’s stock price formed the bearish signal before the trading week closed on March 21, several crypto AI tokens have risen since then. Render ( RENDER ) is up 4.06%, while Bittensor ( TAO ) and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance ( FET ) are both up around 2.88%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Nvidia has been a closely watched stock for AI crypto traders in recent times. While some crypto analysts have linked AI crypto token surges to NVDA’s performance — like its nearly 70% rally ahead of Nvidia’s Q2 earnings in 2024 — there have also been times when no clear correlation emerged. After Nvidia’s Q1 2024 revenue jumped 18% from Q4 2023 , some AI token traders seemed disappointed that the strong results didn’t lead to a similar move in AI crypto token prices. Nvidia’s stock price is down 9.66% over the past month. Source: Google Finance Some crypto traders recently suggested that the bubble has burst and that only AI tokens with real utility will thrive. Crypto trader CryptoCosta said in a March 22 X post, “The whole AI hype has already died down, now it's time for those who provide market solutions and have revenue.” Over the past month alone, the market capitalization of the top AI and big data crypto tokens has fallen 23.70%. The largest token in this sector by market cap, Near Protocol ( NEAR ), has retraced almost 59% over the past 12 months, now trading at $2.70. NEAR is trading at $2.70 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap However, in a recent survey, nearly half of crypto pundits said they are bullish over crypto AI tokens prices . Of the 2,632 respondents surveyed by CoinGecko between February and March, 25% were “fully bullish,” and 19.3% indicated they were “somewhat bullish” for crypto AI tokens in 2025. Related: AI and crypto drive criminal efficiency: Europol Around 29% of respondents were neutral on the subject, while a combined 26.3% were either somewhat bearish or bearish. Meanwhile, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao recently said , “While crypto is the currency for AI, not every agent needs its own token.” “Agents can take fees in an existing crypto for providing a service. Launch a coin only if you have scale. Focus on utility, not tokens,” he said. In February, Sygnum said in an investment report , while AI agents have gained “remarkable traction” so far, they have “struggled to prove their worth beyond speculation.” Magazine: What are native rollups?

Arctic Pablo’s journey through 14 locations has been a massive success, and it’s now entered Nippy Nook—the 15th stage of its presale journey. The presale price has risen steadily with each new location, and the current price at Nippy Nook presents an incredible opportunity for investors looking to get in while prices are still low.

But despite its popularity, Pi remains absent from top-tier platforms like Binance and Bybit. A listing on these exchanges could significantly boost its value, giving it more credibility and market access. However, the wait continues, and now, crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin has pointed to a major reason for the delay—transparency issues within the Pi Core Team. I now better understand why Pi is not listed on major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. It is likely that the Pi Core Team has not been transparent enough about the locking and burning mechanism involving the billions of Pi coins currently owned by the PCT. Without… — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) March 22, 2025 Lack of Transparency Delays Pi’s Listing According to Dr. Altcoin, the biggest hurdle keeping Pi Network from getting listed is the project’s lack of transparency, especially around its tokenomics. The analyst claims that the Pi Core Team hasn’t been clear about the locking and burning mechanisms for billions of Pi tokens under their control. Without a clear framework, exchanges may see Pi as a risk. Recently, the circulating supply of Pi dropped to 6.77 billion after 10 million coins were removed. Dr. Altcoin believes this move was an attempt to control prices before a token unlock. Without transparency, such actions could raise concerns about potential price manipulation, which may be why Binance and other exchanges remain hesitant. Refusing to Pay for Listings? Not everyone agrees with Dr. Altcoin’s take. Some Pi Network supporters argue that the delay isn’t about transparency but rather the team’s refusal to pay listing fees. Many projects spend millions to secure a spot on major exchanges, but Pi’s developers are reportedly holding out for a free listing, which naturally takes longer. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Coin Price Prediction Today: What’s Next After 31% Drop? , Pi Current Market Sentiment Pi Network is currently trading at $1, down 66% from its all-time high of $2.98 in February. Over the past week, it has dropped 34% and fallen to the 25th spot on CoinGecko, with concerns heightened after Bybit’s CEO labeled it a scam . Moreover, Binance listing could push prices higher , but unless the Pi Core Team improves transparency or rethinks its listing strategy, the wait for mainstream exchange support may drag on. To regain stability, Pi Network announced a partnership with PiDaoSwap, a community-driven project promoting transparency. This move briefly boosted PI’s price by 7%, offering a glimmer of hope. However, it remains to be seen whether this collaboration can change market sentiment in the long run. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a brief but direct statement, SMQKE wrote, “Yes, XRP IS FOR BANKS. Documented.” Alongside this response, he shared multiple documents to support his claim regarding XRP’s role in financial institutions. Yes, XRP IS FOR BANKS. Documented. https://t.co/GvXhxlgTEk pic.twitter.com/SFMdzmxF8F — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) March 21, 2025 Mekras had previously stated that “XRP was designed as a P2P digital asset and the XRP Ledger as a P2P network.” His post suggested that while XRP and the XRP Ledger were initially developed for peer-to-peer use, Ripple shifted its focus toward institutional adoption . Mekras emphasized that this shift did not change the decentralized nature of the XRP Ledger but influenced how Ripple positioned its products. Documents Highlight XRP’s Institutional Use In response, SMQKE presented a series of documents that outlined Ripple’s business model and its integration with financial institutions. One document stated that “Ripple’s business model centers around its digital payment protocol, XRP Ledger,” describing how financial institutions must integrate their systems with the XRP Ledger to utilize Ripple’s services. Another document highlighted that “this integration enables them to send and receive payments seamlessly using Ripple’s native digital currency, XRP.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A separate document examined Ripple’s cross-border payment strategy, explaining that “Ripple intends to use XRP as a ‘bridge currency’ to make transactions cheaper and faster.” It further stated that Ripple provides banks with software access to its network, allowing them to execute transactions without requiring a unified accounting system. The document also noted that Ripple’s xRapid product enabled nearly instantaneous transfers using XRP. Ripple’s Shift Toward Financial Institutions Another excerpt referenced Ripple’s transition toward institutional adoption, stating that the company “pivoted towards cross-border payments in 2015.” It detailed Ripple’s regulatory challenges at the time, including compliance with the US Bank Secrecy Act and securing a New York State BitLicense for “institutional sales of the cryptoasset XRP.” The document also stated that Ripple had “pivoted towards financial institutions to partially outsource regulatory compliance: serving banks rather than individuals.” The commentary from both parties reflects differing perspectives on XRP’s intended use case. While Mekras acknowledged that Ripple had pivoted toward banks, he maintained that XRP was created for peer-to-peer transactions. SMQKE, however, pointed to official documents highlighting XRP’s integration with financial institutions, reinforcing his claim that XRP is designed for banks.

According to a Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company seeks to register an ""OnChain"" share class of its Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX) and use blockchains as transfer agent. FYHXX holds cash and U.S. Treasury securities and was launched late last year. The OnChain class of the fund currently uses the Ethereum (ETH) network, and the firm may expand to other blockchains in the future, the filing said. The registration is subject to regulatory approval, with the product expected to become effective on May 30. The filing happened as global banks and asset managers increasingly put traditional financial instruments such as government bonds, credit, and funds on blockchain rails, a process often referred to as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). They do so to pursue operational and efficiency gains and faster, around-the-clock settlements. Fidelity, with $5.8 trillion in assets under management, is the latest traditional financial heavyweight seeking to enter the fast-growing tokenized U.S. Treasuries space. Blackrock (BLK), in partnership with digital asset firm Securitize, launched a similar tokenized T-bill fund last March called BUIDL and has become the market leader with nearly $1.5 billion of assets, rwa.xyz data shows. Franklin Templeton's fund, which was the first on-chain money market product, gathered $689 million in assets since its 2021 debut. The entire tokenized U.S. Treasury market is currently worth $4.77 billion, growing almost 500% over the past year, per rwa.xyz. Fidelity is also one of the largest issuers of spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the U.S., with its $16.5 billion FBTC and $780 million FETH, per SoSoValue data .",Finance|Tokenized Assets|Tokenization|Fidelity Investments|Ethereum,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ETH|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-23 07:53:32

Many altcoins have produced bigger moves, as ETH has bounced above $2,000 once again, while DOGE is close to breaking below $0.17. BTC Stalls at $84K As the chart on the bottom of this article will show, BTC’s price stood at $84,000 last Sunday before it headed south on Monday and later on Tuesday. The weekly bottom came at just over $81,000 at the time as traders were preparing for the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Wednesday. Once it became known that the Fed will not change the interest rates again, BTC faced some volatility but ultimately shot up to a multi-week peak of over $87,000 during Thursday morning’s Asian trading session. However, this was short-lived, and the bears pushed the asset south later on Thursday and Friday. The biggest drop at the time came with a slide to $83,000. Nevertheless, BTC managed to defend that level and has returned to just over $84,000, as mentioned above. The weekend has been quite dull , with little to no movements. Its market cap has remained still at $1.670 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has been reduced this week to 58.3%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView ETH Above $2K The market moves over the past day have been lacking, so we will focus on the weekly performances. Ethereum is actually up by over 4%, which has helped it jump past the coveted $2,000 mark. Tron and Toncoin have popped up as the top gainers from the larger-cap alts, surging by 9% and 6.5%, respectively. UNI, APT, KBT, AAVE, GT, and HYPE lead the way from the mid-cap alts. In contrast, Pi Network’s PI token has plummeted by over 32% since last Sunday to $1. Solana, Cardnao, and Dogecoin are also in the red from the larger-cap alts, with losses of up to 4%.

According to the authorities, the fraud proceeds were recovered using civil asset forfeiture, with the DOJ announcing plans to return the funds to their rightful owners. According to documents produced in court, the criminals used social engineering schemes to convince their victims to invest in digital assets using fake investment websites. These websites were spoofed, in the sense that they mimicked the original websites of big crypto exchanges and entities. Their modus operandi was to first lure their victims, convince them after talking for a long to gain their trust, and introduce them to the fake website they run. According to authorities, the perpetrators funneled the funds through over 75 bank accounts, using the names of several shell companies. The filing showed that after the victims make their investments, the site falsely represents that their investments are doing well and accruing gains. DOJ recovers and seizes $7 million from investment scammers According to the filing, the victims were not allowed to make withdrawals or take profits from the investments. Anytime they attempt it, the perpetrators will convince them to make more deposits, citing several reasons, with taxes on their purported profits the most used excuse. The criminals laundered most of the funds from their operations, often taking the money outside the United States. After the perpetrators receive the victim’s funds, they move it to the shell company account before transferring it across several banks inside the United States. After the series of internal transfers, the funds are then sent abroad to specific bank accounts that they control. According to the authorities, the group describes the wiring instructions associated with the transfer as domestic wires, while in reality, the funds are being moved outside the country. In its statement, the DOJ mentioned that it will begin to invite victims who were affected to submit petitions to have their funds returned. “The United States will now begin the process of inviting the victims from whom those funds were stolen to submit petitions to have the funds remitted back to them,” the DOJ said. Forfeiture actions and the way forward According to the DOJ filing, the Secret Service, in June 2023, seized some of the fraud proceeds from a bank account being run by a foreign bank. The documents, unsealed in federal court at the time, revealed that the Secret Service executed several seizure warrants to confiscate funds from the bank’s U.S. accounts amid their investigation into “international criminal money laundering syndicates operating cryptocurrency investment and other wire fraud scams.” The seizures were authorized on June 12 and 23. According to the Secret Service, it received authorization to confiscate up to roughly $58 million from a custodial account opened with Mitsubishi UFJ Trust in New York by Deltec on behalf of its corporate clients. The total amount of funds officials ultimately seized remains unclear. After the seizure, the United States initiated a civil forfeiture proceeding against the seized funds, filing a public civil forfeiture complaint at the United States District Court. After the filing, the United States then sent notice of the forfeiture actions to every person and entity with an interest in the funds, noting that it gave notices through online publications, allowing the potential claimants the opportunity to contest the forfeiture action in court. The bank that owned the account made a claim and both parties reached the settlement figure. “Following a claim by the bank that owned the account from which the funds were seized, the United States reached a settlement in which $7 million of the seized funds would be forfeited to the United States, allowing victims to petition to recover on their losses,” the DOJ said.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to show volatility, XRP remains a hot topic of discussion . With Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC now over , many expected XRP to skyrocket—but that hasn’t happened yet. XRP’s Slow Reaction Despite SEC Lawsuit Win When news broke that the SEC had dropped its lawsuit against Ripple, XRP briefly surged 16% to $2.60. However, the excitement faded fast, and the price dipped back to $2.38 the following day. Investors were left wondering why XRP didn’t take off as expected. Crypto analyst Armando Pantoja weighed in, pointing out that the SEC has yet to release an official statement confirming its withdrawal. So far, only Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse and CLO Stuart Alderoty have spoken on the matter. Without an official SEC position, many investors are staying cautious, preventing an immediate price surge. Why Isn’t #XRP Skyrocketing After Ripple’s SEC Victory? GMC Analysts Explains https://t.co/jEvXZwKzt5 pic.twitter.com/XjhgE7HUHC — Johnny Krypto (Good Morning Crypto Co-Host) (@johnnykrypto00) March 22, 2025 While, Johnny Krypto, co-founder of Merlin, says XRP’s muted price reaction is normal, as markets often rally on speculation and settle when news is confirmed. He points to XRP’s surge from $0.50 to $2.50 in November as traders betting on Ripple’s legal win. If the SEC had appealed, XRP would have likely dropped, but without bad news, it’s just holding steady. A 10x Rally Won’t Happen Overnight Many in the crypto space expect XRP to hit double digits, but Pantoja warns that it won’t happen overnight. Unlike meme coins, which can spike rapidly due to hype, XRP is influenced by derivatives and institutional trading, making sudden, wild moves less likely. “A 10x rally will come soon, but not in 24 hours,” he stated, urging investors to be patient. What Will Drive XRP Higher? With the lawsuit behind it, XRP’s next big move will depend on real-world adoption. Krypto believes institutional investment, major partnerships, and growing use cases—such as cross-border payments—will be the key drivers of price growth. While XRP may remain stable in the short term, many analysts see huge long-term potential. Some even predict that in a strong bull cycle, XRP could climb to $8 or beyond . For now, patience is key—XRP’s breakout will come, but not at meme coin speed. However, Edoardo Farina believes in XRP’s long-term growth despite its recent dip to $2.40. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have struggled, XRP has gained 12% since January. Farina points to potential XRP ETF approvals , stablecoin regulations benefiting Ripple’s RLUSD , and possible Trump administration support as key drivers of growth. He also predicts a “supply shock,” where transaction fee burns and institutional adoption could reduce available tokens, pushing prices higher. While this offers hope for investors, experts caution that crypto markets remain unpredictable. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin, currently trading around $84,000, has experienced a period of correction alongside the broader crypto market, with total market capitalization climbing 2.44% to $2.76 trillion. While some sellers are exiting, uncertainty remains over whether the current rebound can hold.

In terms of… pic.twitter.com/ywVw8InId0 — Timothy Peterson (@nsquaredvalue) March 22, 2025 Analyst Predicts a 90-Day Bear Market Market analyst Timothy Peterson believes Bitcoin’s recent downturn is relatively mild compared to past bear markets. Defined as a 20% drop from an all-time high, this pullback is weaker in magnitude than historical declines and is expected to last only 90 days. Peterson analyzed ten previous bear markets, noting that only four were worse in terms of duration—2018, 2021, 2022, and 2024. He argues that despite short-term price drops, Bitcoin’s adoption trends remain strong , making a deep decline below $50,000 unlikely. He also suggests that BTC may not fall below $80,000 based on momentum. Peterson predicts a possible slide over the next 30 days, followed by a 20-40% rally after April 15. This rally could bring renewed investor interest and push Bitcoin to new highs. Trade War Fears Impact Investor Sentiment The recent bloodbath caused due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s new tariffs on multiple trading partners. These tariffs have triggered retaliatory measures across the globe, leading to fears of a prolonged trade war. Investors are now moving away from riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, as macroeconomic conditions are not good. In the meanwhile, Data from Glassnode’s Hot Supply metric, which tracks BTC held for a week or less, shows a sharp decline from 5.9% in November 2024 to 2.3% in March 2025. This suggests a drop in speculative trading and highlights weak market sentiment.

Fraudsters create fake trading platforms, promise huge returns, and manipulate users into depositing funds—only to steal the money. Authorities worldwide are cracking down on these schemes, recovering stolen funds, and urging victims to come forward. DOJ Recovers $7M From Crypto Scam The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is inviting victims of a global crypto scam to claim their share of $7 million in recovered funds. The scheme, which used fake trading platforms and shell companies, tricked investors into believing they were making profits—only to drain their funds through fraudulent tactics. Meanwhile, scammers created websites mimicking legitimate crypto exchanges , luring victims with fake gains while secretly funneling money through over 75 bank accounts. When investors attempted to withdraw, they were pressured into sending more money under the pretense of paying taxes on their supposed profits. Eventually, the funds were laundered overseas. In June 2023, the U.S. Secret Service seized a portion of the stolen money from a foreign bank account. A civil forfeiture case followed, leading to a settlement that allowed the DOJ to reclaim $7 million. Now, victims can submit claims to get their money back. It’s Not New! One Crypto User said wash trading and fake volume have always been a problem in crypto. While it’s good that the DOJ is taking action, they argue that $23 million is nothing compared to the bigger issue. Instead of relying on enforcement, they believe the real fix is designing markets that prevent manipulation from the start. Another Crypto Scam Exposed—Court Orders $2.3M Restitution In a separate case, a federal court ruled against Debiex, a fraudulent crypto trading platform, ordering it to return nearly $2.3 million to victims. The scheme convinced users to deposit funds into fake trading accounts, only to siphon off their money. A federal court ordered the recovery of nearly $2.3M for victims of an online romance scam following a complaint filed by the CFTC. It is a recent victory in the CFTC’s continued effort to combat relationship fraud and shine a light on these scams. https://t.co/LyrbNpfJjL pic.twitter.com/G1tboTM278 — CFTC (@CFTC) March 21, 2025 The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) stated that Debiex never actually traded crypto on behalf of its users. Instead, it displayed fabricated trading activity to keep investors hooked. Alongside the restitution order, Debiex was slapped with a $221,466 civil monetary penalty and banned from CFTC-regulated markets. Plus, authorities recovered $120,000 from a digital wallet linked to Zhāng Chéng Yáng, a money mule involved in the scam. However, the CFTC warns that restitution isn’t always guaranteed, as scammers often hide or spend stolen assets before authorities intervene. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a new announcement , crypto trading platform Bithumb says that it is now supporting the interoperable cross-chain bridge Across Protocol ( ACX ), triggering rallies for the digital asset. News of the event caused ACX to surge, as it went from a March 21st low of $0.275 to a peak of $0.462 just a few hours later, a rise of nearly 68%. It has since retraced and is trading for $0.319 at time of writing, a 10% gain during the last 24 hours. In its whitepaper, Across Protocol says it is the only cross-chain platform powered by intents. Explains Across Protocol, “Intents introduce a third party, a relayer (alternatively named filler, or solver), that does the job of delivering assets / executing user transactions quickly. An intent is a type of order where a user specifies an outcome instead of an execution path. In practice, intents manifest as a combination of a cross-chain limit order and an action to execute, all encoded within a standardized order structure. Relayers compete on cost and speed to fill these orders, which can include on-chain actions as well as assets. Relayers deliver very quickly, without any messages. From the user’s perspective, interoperability is solved. Their desired outcome is achieved.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

It recently fell below $1, hitting as low as $0.87 before slightly bouncing back to $0.9913. Over the past week, Pi has lost about 41% of its value, making investors worried that the price could drop even further, possibly below $0.60. This uncertainty has made many in the community nervous. However, to fight back against this downward trend, Pi Network supporters are working on a new project called PiDaoSwap. This will be a decentralized exchange (DEX), which means a platform where people can trade Pi without depending on external exchanges that might be manipulating its price. PiDaoSwap: A DEX to Counter Price Manipulation In response to allegations of price manipulation by external exchanges, the Pi Network community is building PiDaoSwap , a decentralized exchange (DEX) to ensure Pi’s value reflects real market demand. According to reports, the platform is in its final stages of development and awaiting Know Your Business (KYB) approval from the Pi core team. However, PiDaoSwap has already secured Twitter’s organizational verification, showing its progress. The Pi Network VietNames community claims the DEX will prevent external exchanges from manipulating Pi’s price. Reports also suggest some platforms are using bots to alter Pi’s valuation artificially. Meanwhile, Pi supporters are frustrated as Binance still hasn’t listed the token despite growing community pressure. Pi Network Branding Restrictions Could Impact PiDaoSwap While PiDaoSwap is gaining traction, concerns have emerged regarding Pi Network’s intellectual property (IP) policies. The official documentation prohibits the use of “Pi-related” branding without approval from the core team. The PiDaoSwap team has raised questions about whether their project name and domain need modifications to comply with these restrictions before its launch. Will Pi Network Survive? As Pi struggles with declining prices and price manipulation claims, industry experts have voiced concerns about the project’s sustainability. Justin Bons, the founder of CyberCapital, criticized Pi’s mining process and tokenomics, claiming that the project is highly centralized and its key functions remain locked behind KYC verification. He went as far as calling Pi an “investment scam.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network News: Why Pi Is Struggling to Get Listed on Major Exchanges , However, not all opinions are negative. Crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin defended Pi Network, stating that after years of involvement with the project, he has found no evidence suggesting it is a scam. With growing scrutiny, price instability, and regulatory challenges, Pi Network faces a critical test. Whether PiDaoSwap can successfully counter price manipulation and restore investor confidence remains to be seen. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

TRX is currently trading at $0.23, and Cardano, trading at $0.73. Meanwhile, this new performer is likely to be the one to deliver more returns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently in its presale at $0.02, as analysts predict a surge to $5 after launch. This fast-growing altcoin currently exists in the third stage of its presale period contributing to its nearly $4.4 million funding pool. Over 50% of the phase has been sold meaning investors have little time left. The cryptocurrency price stands at $0.025 in the upcoming stage and more than 6300 investors have already added their stakes before the expected 25% increase occurs. Early investors who purchase during this stage can multiply their investment by 200% upon release at $0.06. Tron vs. Cardano: Competing or Just Coexisting? Tron (TRX) and Cardano (ADA) are often seen as rivals, but their focus areas differ. Tron, trading at $0.23, prioritizes speed and low fees, making it popular for payments, DeFi, and stablecoin transactions. However, concerns over centralization persist. Cardano, at $0.73, emphasizes security and scalability through a research-driven approach, but its slower development has affected adoption. While both support smart contracts, they cater to different audiences rather than directly competing. As they continue to evolve, a new contender, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is emerging and could shake up the market. Transforming Crypto Lending with a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance offers a modern lending platform that joins Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models for better access to assets as well as transparency and user empowerment. Through the Peer-to-Contrast model users can add stablecoins to smart contract pools to earn passive income as they instantly allow borrowing access to platform users. Smart contracts manage automatic interest rate adjustments that provide enhanced earnings for lenders at reduced borrowing expenses. When people utilize the P2P model they create immediate lending relationships free of intermediaries that fulfill decentralization goals and let users exercise complete negotiation capabilities. Borrowers together with lenders operate in a system which offers complete transparency and efficiency to form custom agreements for loan transactions creating enhanced user-centric borrowing situations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance attracts investors through its crypto loan decentralized finance system which funds its financial services operations using decentralization technology. The project continues to gain pace because it has attracted more than 6300 investors and has accumulated over $4.4 million in investments. The pre-launch token price of $0.02 should be viewed as a short-term chance since a forthcoming 25% price increase marks the end of initial funding opportunities for investors. New investors throughout the presale period can achieve a 200% return on investment through the determined listing price at $0.06. The growth of the Decentralized market enables Mutuum Finance to lead with its innovative lending plan while securing strong market placement. Transforming Crypto Lending Mutuum Finance employs Ethereum to maintain stability in its stablecoin through the deposit of USD funds. The stablecoin framework provides secure transactions because it features a resistant network design helper with algorithmic stability issues. Mutuum Finance establishes decentralized finance development by connecting advanced financial lending methods and strong infrastructure platforms into one cohesive system. Tron (TRX) and Cardano (ADA) have long been seen as rivals, but their differences in focus make them more complementary than direct competitors. Tron, trading at $0.23, excels in speed and low fees, while Cardano, at $0.73, emphasizes security and scalability. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a high-growth alternative, offering a hybrid lending system. Currently in its third presale phase at $0.02, it has raised $4.4 million from 6,300+ investors.

Here are some of the most important events in the Pi Network ecosystem, which is one of the newest (yet not so new) and hottest trends. Partnerships in the pipeline Pi Network saw the light of day just over a month ago but has made the headlines numerous times since then. In one of the latest updates posted by the team, they indicated about a notable partnership that could enhance transparency. Pi News, the project’s official media source online, outlined a collaboration with PiDaoSwap, which is a fully community-driven, decentralized project. The DAO’s governance, which is run 100% by the community, should remove some of the uncertainties around the project, which has struggled with controversy for years. Additionally, such partnerships could increase the faith in the underlying asset and thus lead to price resurgences. Fewer unlocked PI tokens, positive price trajectory? A Pi Network X channel based in Vietnam explained that the recent price drop for PI’s price could be attributed to the growing selling pressure because of the substantial amount of unlocked tokens during its first month of being live for trading. However, the team expects that selling pressure will ease off, as the unlock rate should drop from 13 million PI per day to just 3.8 million. This could help stabilize or even boost PI’s price if demand holds or rises. A crypto analyst explained on X that the PI/USDT pair had been stuck within a falling channel for a month. Nevertheless, the overall PI sentiment has turned bullish after a resistance line was reclaimed and is now acting as support. As such, he added that PI could shoot up toward $2 soon if it breaks out of this descending channel with “notable momentum.” Previous price predictions for PI Pi Network has a big community and a growing number of supporters. Analysts are often highlighting potential price movements on X, and some of the recent predictions included a surge back to its all-time high of $3 registered a month ago. Other speculators have been even more bullish, suggesting a potential surge to $314.159 – a number symbolically linked to π (Pi) ≈ 3.14159. It’s safe to say that this sounds more than far-fetched at the moment, as it would require PI’s market cap to skyrocket to the stratosphere (multi-trillion dollars).

Premier Li told business leaders that China would choose the “correct path” of globalization and multilateralism despite rising uncertainty and instability. China said it is ready for any “unexpected shocks,” ahead of US President Donald Trump imposing higher tariffs on the rival superpower and world’s second-biggest economy. China also claimed that it is ready for “any type of war” with the US following Trump’s tariffs. “If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” asserted China. According to the Center for Economic and Business Research (CEBR) at Western Washington University, Trump’s tariffs have unleashed a new “China shock,” devastating jobs in emerging economies from Mexico to Indonesia as Chinese exports flood their markets. The situation is set to get worse, with Trump threatening to raise levies on China even higher. China braces for economic challenges in anticipation of Trump tariffs Premier Li Qiang, who is responsible for the Chinese economy under leader Xi Jinping, told foreign business leaders gathered in Beijing on March 23 that China is prepared for possible unexpected shocks as the US prepares to impose additional levies on imports from China on April 2. He added that uncertainty and instability are rising despite China’s decision to choose the “correct path” of multilateralism and globalization. The warning message from the Chinese premier comes as Beijing tries to improve consumer and investor sentiment while also preparing potential retaliatory measures against future US tariffs and sanctions. Countries and companies are also bracing for the impact of reciprocal tariffs amid expectations that Trump is not inclined to give waivers before the deadline. “We have preparations for possible unexpected shocks, which, of course, mainly come from external sources.” – Premier Li Qiang Trump has already imposed 20% tariffs on goods from China, in a move the White House said was designed to pressure Beijing to crack down harder on companies that make the ingredients for fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid that has triggered an epidemic of drug use in the United States. In response, China introduced retaliatory tariffs on about $22bn of US goods, including agricultural exports, targeting President Trump’s rural base. Daines uses meeting with He to reiterate Trump’s tariff demands on China Montana’s Republican senator Steve Daines, a very close Trump ally who previously worked in China on business, met Vice Premier He Lifeng on March 22 in a rare meeting between a senior American lawmaker and a top Chinese official. Daines’ office said he used his meeting with He to reiterate Trump’s call for China to halt the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl. It added that the senator had “expressed hope that further high-level talks between the United States and China will take place in the near future.” However, there have been very few top-level talks between the US and China since Trump took office. Economic analysts in Beijing also pointed out that ministerial-level talks with the US on a trade deal had not yet begun, and it was unlikely that Xi would meet Trump without first agreeing on some elements of a deal. Donald Trump has said China’s President Xi Jinping will soon visit the US, but China has not issued public remarks about a meeting between the two leaders since Trump took office in January. Notably, Daines is expected to meet Premier Li later today. Daines is also scheduled to attend the Beijing forum in a rare move that the US politician hopes will lead to a meeting with Xi on behalf of the American president. The Financial Times previously reported that Daines wanted to be designated as a presidential envoy to facilitate a meeting with Xi—which the senator’s office denied.

The put/call ratio was 0.84, which means there were more call buyers than put option buyers, suggesting a short-term bullish sentiment. The maximum pain was around $85K, while $BTC is currently trading around $84,300. Max pain, for those unaware, is the level where option sellers experience the least losses. This also suggests a small upward move. However, the larger picture for Bitcoin is more or less sideways. The short-term Implied Volatility (IV) has fallen below 50%. This implies that market participants aren’t expecting large price moves on either side, and the price may stabilize around the $85K mark for a while. However, as we’ll highlight below, there are several reasons to be bullish on $BTC, which also makes this the perfect time to invest in the best crypto presales . A Bitcoin Rally Is Just Around the Corner Analysts have predicted that the FED might announce fresh rate cuts in April in the direction of Trump after economic upheaval caused by the tariff war. This could prove to be a great catalyst in pushing $BTC prices above $85K. What’s more, the influx of funds in Bitcoin ETFs has also picked up, recording a cumulative net inflow of $166M in the last five sessions. Amid this, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a net inflow of $172M in just a single day. Increasing ETF investments suggest that investors are accumulating BTC after a significant correction from its all-time high of $110K. Technical Analysis of Bitcoin Comes Bearing Fruits Even better, a deep dive into the technical analysis of Bitcoin’s chart reveals a handful of positive signs. For starters, $BTC is bouncing off the 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) on the weekly chart. Both the 50 & 200 EMAs are sloping upwards, which is another strong bullish signal. In addition to the 50 EMA, the current bounce is also occurring from the 50% Fibonacci level . This simply means $BTC has had a healthy amount of correction and is now continuing its longer-term bullish trend. To put it simply, Bitcoin is trading in a discounted zone. Although the OG crypto presents a fantastic risk-to-reward opportunity here, the following presales could easily match (and even eclipse) $BTC’s gains. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto Presale to Buy Right Now Combined with increased institutional buying and a promising technical chart, several signs are pointing toward an upcoming Bitcoin rally. If you wish to make the most of the next $BTC run, consider investing in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – one of the best altcoins on the market right now. It stands out by being the ONLY crypto to offer free (and real) $BTC to token holders who buy and hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet . The aforementioned Bitcoin giveaways will take place as and when $BTC surges past a new milestone figure (such as $150K, $200K, and $250K) for the very first time. Additionally, the project’s roadmap also includes periodic burn events. Essentially, at every $25K mark ($125K, $150K, $175K, and so on), the developers will shave off a part of the total $BTCBULL supply. As you might have already guessed, this will contract supply and ultimately boost BTC Bull Token’s price. The best part is that $BTCBULL is currently in presale ($3.9M+ raised), meaning prices are at their lowest. You can buy each token for just $0.002425. Need help with the purchase process? Check out our detailed guide on how to buy $BTCBULL . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana Meme Coin with Real-World Use Case Solana’s approximately 50% fall from its all-time high (ATH) in mid-January is concerning, especially when it has been dubbed the “Ethereum killer.” In addition to a temporary drop in enthusiasm regarding meme coins, Solana’s inability to accommodate the growing number of investors on the network post $TRUMP and Pump.fun’s launch has been its biggest worry. Solaxy ($SOLX) , however, could be Solana’s knight in shining armor. After all, it plans to build the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. Solaxy’s plan to process Solana’s transactions on a sidechain would significantly reduce the burden on Solana’s primary network. Additionally, Solaxy would process transactions in batches – rather than one by one. This would further reduce the overall costs required to operate on Solana. All in all, Solaxy will solve Solana’s long-standing problems of scalability, congestion, and failed transactions. Thanks to its revolutionary mission, Solaxy has attracted both retail investors and crypto whales. It is, in fact, one of the hottest cryptos going around, with over $27.5M in its purse at the time of writing. 1 $SOLX is currently available for only $0.001672, but hurry up because the price increases in just a few hours. Here’s how to buy Solaxy. 3. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) – Unique Crypto Presale Planning to Build Secure Blockchains Lightchain AI ($LCAI) harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to develop smarter and more secure decentralized crypto exchanges. A highlight of the project is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), which has been masterfully designed to tackle AI tasks with maximum efficiency. The good news keeps coming, as $LCAI token holders will also get a say in how the project moves forward. The token is currently in presale, where it has amassed a whopping $18M so far. Such massive investor interest in an AI-crypto project is a telltale sign of this hybrid industry’s potential. Also, because $LCAI is only selling for $0.007125 per token, it’s among the best cheap cryptos you can get your hands on right now. Conclusion Although the three cryptos above are certainly worth including in your portfolio, it’s worth remembering that no token is risk-free – largely due to the larger crypto market’s volatility and unpredictability. You should, therefore, only invest an amount that doesn’t hurt your belly. Also, we urge you to do your own research before investing.

The flagship cryptocurrency’s muted price performance comes despite the Securities and Exchange Commission delivering good news on mining and ETF inflows in positive territory. BTC is marginally down over the past 24 hours as it continues to trade around the $84,000 mark, with neither buyers nor sellers having a substantial impact on prices. Bitcoin ETFs Back In Action Bitcoin investors had been cashing out of spot Bitcoin ETFs for most of March. However, data from Farside suggests a significant shift in investor sentiment this week, with capital flowing back into the ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs registered inflows totaling around $734 million earlier this week as market sentiment turned positive, with the Federal Reserve announcing it would cut rates twice this year. However, the positive sentiment has not reached all crypto ETFs, with Ethereum ETFs registering outflows for a thirteenth straight day, even as Bitcoin ETF inflows pick up pace. Spot Bitcoin ETFs closed the week positively, registering inflows worth $83 million on March 21. BlackRock’s IBIT saw inflows worth $104 million, while Grayscale’s GBIT saw outlaws worth $21 million. Meanwhile, the other ETFs reported little or no movement. IBIT’s inflows extended the inflow streak to six consecutive days while trading volumes across all ETFs hit $1.13 billion on March 21. Markets Will Remain Pressured Until April A research analyst at Nansen has said global trade war concerns will keep the crypto and traditional markets under pressure until at least April. However, the analysts stated any potential resolution could bring the next big market catalyst and dictate price action. Bitcoin has dropped nearly 20% since President Donald Trump announced import tariffs on Chinese goods, a day after his presidential inauguration. Despite a pro-crypto narrative, tariff and trade war fears will continue to pressure the market until at least April 2. The analyst stated in a post on X, “I’m looking forward to seeing what happens with the tariffs from April 2 onwards, maybe we’ll see some of them dropped but it depends if all countries can agree. That’s the biggest driver at this moment. Risk assets may lack direction until the tariff-related concerns are resolved, which may happen between April 2 and July, presenting a positive market catalyst.” The analyst also stated that the Fed’s interest rate is also contributing to the market slump by adversely impacting risk appetite among traders. “We’re waiting for the Fed to see proper “bad news” before they will really start cutting rates.” Markets have priced in an 85% chance that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged during the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, set for May 7. However, the Fed has indicated that inflation and recession concerns are transitionary, which could be interpreted as a positive sign for investors. According to Iliya Kalchev, Dispatch Analyst at Nexo Digital, “Markets may now expect upcoming economic data with greater confidence. Cooling inflation and stable economic conditions could further boost investor appetite, driving additional upside for Bitcoin and digital assets. Keep an eye on key reports, including Consumer Confidence, Q4 GDP, jobless claims, and next week’s crucial PCE inflation release, to gauge the likelihood of future rate cuts.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a marginal decline on Saturday as price action remained muted following Wednesday’s rally. The optimism after the FOMC meeting has faded, with traders looking to the capital for the next catalyst to dictate price action. The hope that the government will make a significant BTC purchase has also waned in recent weeks, impacting investor sentiment. President Trump had recently signed an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. However, traders felt the order fell short of expectations, proposing only to use the Bitcoin seized during criminal and civil forfeitures to build the reserve. CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno stated, “CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index shows the least bullish conditions since January 2023. With a Bull Score of 20, the model suggests a weak investment environment for Bitcoin, reducing the likelihood of a sustained rally in the near term. If the score remains below 40 for an extended period, it could signal the continuation of bearish market conditions, similar to previous bear market phases.” However, the Bitcoin Act, reintroduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis, could revive waning BTC demand. The act proposes the US government purchase 1 million BTC over the next five years, with a mandatory 20-year holding period. BTC entered the weekend positively, rising almost 4% to move past the 200-day SMA and reach an intraday high of $85,363 before settling at $84,002. Buyers retained control on Saturday as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $84,398. Despite the positive sentiment, the price fell back in the red on Sunday, dropping over 2%, slipping below the 200-day SMA and settling at $82,611. BTC started the current week on a bullish note, rising almost 2% and settling at $84,016. However, selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the price plunged to an intraday low of $81,187. It recovered from this level to settle at $82,775, ultimately registering a drop of 1.54%. Source: TradingView Markets rallied on Wednesday following the FOMC meeting. As a result, BTC surged over 5%, moving past the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settling at $85,875. However, the rally was short-lived as BTC lost momentum on Thursday, dropping over 3%, slipping below the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settling at $84,215. Price action remained muted on Friday as BTC registered a marginal decline and settled at $84,051. Sellers retained control on Saturday as buyers failed to build momentum. As a result, BTC registered another marginal decline and settled at $$83,822. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers look to push the price above the moving averages and $85,000. A break above the moving averages could set BTC on a course cross above $85,000. A break above this level could see BTC push towards $90,000. On the other hand, if sellers retake control, the price could fall to $80,000. The RSI sits under the neutral zone, while the MACD indicates buyers have the upper hand.

Defillama’s data confirmed that BNB Chain has been leading in weekly DEX trading volume and fee generation, showing strong growth despite “broader market doldrums.” According to data from Defillama on March 22, BNB Chain’s weekly DEX trading volume surged 81.34% while Ethereum’s, Solana’s, Base’s and Arbitrum’s DEX volumes plummeted by 44.39%, 29.99%, 43.4%, and 45.13% respectively. BNB Chain’s 24-hour DEX volume stood at over $2.6 billion, Ethereum’s DEX volume was at ~$1.44 billion, and Solana’s was slightly over $1 billion. At the same time, Base and Arbitrum recorded DEX volumes of 353.84M and 353.6M, respectively, over the same period. However, the total weekly DEX volume across all networks fell 19.82% to settle at $46.24 billion, while the 24-hour volume stood at $6.79 billion. Defillama’s data also showed that memecoins fueled BNB Chain’s DEX volume. The network witnessed the eruption of memecoins such as MUBARAK (up 71%), BROCCOLI (market cap exceeding $101 million), and TST (which hit $500,000 in just a few hours). BNB Chain seized the opportunity to solidify its dominance as Solana faced declining trust due to major memecoin crashes like LIBRA. The influence of CZ, the co-founder of Binance, also created price triggers in the memecoin sector. BNB Chain embraces Pascal Hardfork upgrade amid DEX volume boom The chain introduced the Pascal Hardfork on March 20, an upgrade designed to boost transaction efficiency and improve its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The update came as memecoin trading continued to fuel record-breaking DEX activity on BNB Chain. The update integrated Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7702, enabling advanced functionalities such as gas abstraction, smart contract wallets, and batch transactions. The Pascal Hardfork marked a major step in the network’s development, positioning it as an early adopter of this EVM enhancement. The upgrade is also expected to improve user onboarding and provide greater flexibility for dApp developers. The Binance-backed blockchain advised node operators, validators, exchanges, and infrastructure providers to update their systems in preparation for the upgrade. Meanwhile, crypto exchanges and infrastructure providers were expected to confirm compatibility, while developers were asked to ensure that their dApps aligned with the new transaction structure. According to Binance, its native network has additional improvements beyond Pascal on the horizon. The Lorentz Hardfork, scheduled for April 2025, aims to reduce block times to 1.5 seconds, enhancing network speed. The Maxwell Hardfork in June 2025 will further decrease block processing times to 0.75 seconds, making transactions even faster. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Algorithmic stablecoins employ code-based mechanisms to ensure their price stability, as opposed to fiat stablecoins pegged directly to the value of the underlying currency. The Sonic blockchain is working on the implementation of an algorithmic stablecoin with up to 23% annual percentage rate (APR), according to Andre Cronje, co-founder of Sonic Labs and founder of Yearn.finance. Cronje wrote in a March 22 X post : “POC looks good. Yielding > 200% APR @ 10m tvl, around 23.5% APR @ 100m, steady at around 4.9% at 1bn+. Will scale up and get team for a full release.” Source: Andre Cronje The announcement came a day after Cronje admitted to experiencing Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to algorithmic stablecoin due to previous cycles: “Pretty sure our team cracked algo stable coins today, but previous cycle gave me so much PTSD not sure if we should implement.” In May 2022, the $40 billion Terra ecosystem collapsed, erasing tens of billions of dollars of value in a matter of days. Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), was yielding an over 20% annual percentage yield (APY) on Anchor Protocol. As UST lost its dollar peg, crashing to a low of around $0.30, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon took to X to share his rescue plan. At the same time, the value of sister token LUNA, once a top-10 crypto project by market capitalization, plunged over 98% to $0.84. For reference: LUNA was trading north of $120 in early April.

The collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin issuer created shockwaves among both crypto investors and lawmakers. To create more stability, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) bill will prohibit the issuance of algorithmic stablecoins to avoid another collapse similar to the Terra ecosystem’s.

Peterson noted in his statement that since 2015, Bitcoin has experienced ten bear markets, each defined by a 20% drop from its all-time high (ATH). While these declines are common (they occur roughly once a year), he noted that only four bear markets in the past have lasted longer than the current one: 2018, 2021, 2022, and 2024. Peterson also described the current downturn as relatively weak in magnitude. According to his analysis, Bitcoin’s underlying sentiment suggests that prices are unlikely to fall much below $50,000. He also noted that price momentum makes it difficult for Bitcoin to fall below $80,000, especially as central banks move toward looser monetary policies. Related News: Moment of Destiny in Ethereum: Bullish or Bearish? These Levels Are Critical Peterson, who predicted a timeline for recovery, suggested that the bear market would end within 90 days. He expects a potential price drop over the next 30 days, followed by a significant rally of 20-40% after April 15. He argued that this expected recovery could generate enough media attention to draw hesitant investors back into the market, pushing Bitcoin’s price even higher. *This is not investment advice.

The Solana price, for instance, appears to be stuck in the $120 – $140 range over the past two weeks. Interestingly, a popular analyst on the social media platform X has come up with an exciting bullish projection for the sixth-largest cryptocurrency. Can SOL Price Reclaim $150 In The Short Term? In a March 22 post on X, a crypto analyst with the pseudonym Satoshi Flipper put forward an interesting short-term analysis of the Solana price. According to the online pundit, the altcoin’s price appears to be on the verge of a breakout with sights on a new higher high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Under Threat? Analyst Explores Two Bearish Black Swan Scenarios to Watch This bullish prediction revolves around the appearance of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour timeframe of the Solana price chart. The symmetrical triangle is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a diagonal falling upper trendline (connecting a series of lower highs) and a rising lower trendline (connecting the higher lows). The asset price typically moves in a converging pattern toward the apex of the symmetrical triangle. At the apex, the asset’s price will move to break either the upper trendline (a breakout) or the lower boundary (a breakdown). Depending on whether it is a breakout or breakdown, the symmetrical triangle could signal a continuation or reversal of a trend. Symmetrical triangles tend to be continuation patterns, meaning the price tends to resume its initial trend direction before falling into the triangle formation. However, the direction of the breakout is never certain, as the pattern indicates the indecisiveness of the market at a given moment. According to Satoshi Flipper, the prevailing downward trend of the Solana price is about to witness a reversal and a potential run to the upside. The crypto analyst expects the price of SOL to witness a turnaround if it successfully closes above the upper trendline at $132. In a symmetrical triangle pattern, the price target is calculated by adding the length of the widest point of the triangle (or base) to the breakout point. Based on this logic, investors could see the price of Solana hit as high as $152 (representing an almost 20% surge from the current price point). Solana Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of SOL is hovering around the $130 mark, reflecting an over 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

This time, it’s $77.6 billion for 2024. That brings the total damage under Powell to $192 billion in just two years. The central bank released its audited financials on Friday. It’s the second straight year of red ink, following a $114.3 billion loss in 2023. This isn’t some accounting trick. The Fed is actually burning through cash. The losses don’t stop it from functioning or require any help from the Treasury. But this is the same Fed that used to send billions in profits back to the government. Now, it’s got a pile of IOUs it owes itself. Fed took on too much debt and now pays more than it earns Powell’s mess started back in 2020 and 2021. That’s when the Fed went all in on pandemic stimulus, loading up on Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. It worked for a while—rates were low, and the Fed made money on those assets. But then came the inflation spike. To fight that inflation in 2022 and 2023, the Fed jacked up interest rates fast. That move crushed its balance sheet. The problem? The Fed earns income from its bond portfolio, but it also pays interest on bank reserves. By September 2022, those interest payments were higher than the income from bonds. And the bleeding hasn’t stopped. Until 2022, the Fed was a profit machine. It sent $109 billion to the Treasury in 2021 alone. Between 2012 and 2021, it sent more than $870 billion. Now, it’s losing money because it has to pay banks more interest than it’s making on its own portfolio. That’s the “monetary plumbing” Powell is stuck with. And it’s not just some cash drain. The Fed is also on the hook to fund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), thanks to the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. So even while it’s losing billions, it’s still covering other agencies. Powell adds $216B IOU to Fed’s books while inflation stays hot Here’s how Powell is keeping the lights on: instead of asking Congress for help, the Fed started cooking up a thing called a “deferred asset”. It’s basically an IOU the Fed writes to itself. It started doing this in late 2022 when losses kicked in. The deferred asset hit $16.6 billion by the end of that year. Then it ballooned to $133 billion in 2023. Now it’s sitting at $216 billion. The Fed says it’ll pay itself back eventually. But that depends on when it starts making money again. That won’t happen until interest rates fall below what it earns on its $6.8 trillion portfolio. And that portfolio has been shrinking for the past three years. Right now, the average yield is 2.6%. But the Fed is paying 4.4% on $3.4 trillion in reserves. That math doesn’t work. The New York Fed said in 2023 that the Fed would keep losing money if short-term rates stayed above 4%. The current rate is around 4.3%, down from 5.3% last September. It’s close—but still underwater. According to Seth Carpenter, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley and a former Fed staffer, “They are getting closer and closer to break-even… but it could take a couple of years.” None of this is a surprise. The Fed has known this was coming. Internal meeting transcripts show that officials were already worried years ago about the political fallout if losses started showing up after rate hikes. Now that’s exactly what happened. Fed keeps rates steady while Trump tariffs threaten inflation While Powell juggles losses, inflation is still a problem. The core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s go-to inflation metric, likely rose 0.3% in February for the second month in a row. The annual rate is now expected to hit 2.7%, according to Bloomberg. Consumer spending is back up too. The government report due Friday is expected to show spending climbed 0.5%, while personal income rose 0.4%. That income bump follows the biggest monthly gain in a year. The economy is heating up again—but that’s not always good news for inflation. All of this comes just before Trump’s planned April 2 announcement of new tariffs. He’s calling it “Liberation Day in America.” Fed officials are waiting to see how that plays out. That’s why they didn’t raise or cut rates at their latest meeting. Powell said they need more time to see what the tariffs will do to inflation and growth. Other Fed officials are now stepping in to speak. Adriana Kugler, Alberto Musalem, and Raphael Bostic are all lined up this week. Bostic is set to appear on Bloomberg TV on Monday. The focus? How to deal with inflation while Powell holds the line on rates and manages a multi-billion-dollar shortfall. More data is on the way too. February durable goods orders might show if businesses are holding back on spending. And trade numbers will help shape first-quarter GDP forecasts. Imports will probably be skewed again by a wave of incoming gold that doesn’t count in GDP. Consumer sentiment is also due Friday from the University of Michigan. That report will include short-term and long-term inflation expectations. Basically, everyone’s watching prices—and the Fed’s broke. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

After four years in court and $150 million in legal costs, the case is officially closed. In 2023, a judge had already ruled that XRP isn’t a security when traded on public exchanges. That decision weakened the SEC’s case, and now the charges against Ripple’s executives—Brad Garlinghouse and Stuart Alderoty—have also been dropped. #SEC drops its lawsuit against #Ripple , #XRP surges nearly 10% On the evening of March 19, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that #SEC had officially withdrawn its lawsuit against #Ripple , marking the end of a legal battle that lasted over 4 years. This positive… pic.twitter.com/dJhFl7saaI — ONUS (@ONUSFinance) March 20, 2025 After the news, XRP’s price jumped 11%. Ripple is now urging the SEC to stop using lawsuits and start giving clear rules for the crypto industry. Even the SEC seems to be listening—at a recent crypto roundtable, Commissioner Hester Peirce said the agency is working on better policies, with input from the crypto community. XRP’s Technical Picture Supports Upside Potential As of today, XRP is trading at $2.40, slightly down 0.35% with a daily trading volume of $1.74 billion. It holds the #4 spot among all cryptocurrencies, with a market cap of $139.4 billion. $XRP Technical Outlook Price: $2.40 | Vol: $1.74B Holding above key support at $2.37 (50 EMA) inside a symmetrical triangle. Break above $2.49 = Possible move to $2.59–$2.71 Drop below $2.37 = Risk toward $2.31 or $2.22 Volume low — breakout brewing? #XRP #Crypto pic.twitter.com/ra3YKvPiO7 — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) March 23, 2025 On the chart, XRP is moving inside a symmetrical triangle , which shows that buyers and sellers are still undecided. However, the price is holding above a strong support level at $2.37, which also matches the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA)—a technical indicator often used by traders to track trends. If XRP can break above $2.49, it could gain momentum and target the next resistance levels at $2.59 and $2.71. But if it falls below $2.37, it could drop to support zones near $2.31 or even $2.22. Key Levels to Watch: Support: $2.3730, $2.3183, $2.2230 Resistance: $2.4925, $2.5921, $2.7192 50 EMA (4H): $2.3730 (acting as support) Currently, trading volume is low, which means traders are waiting for a strong signal before making big moves. What’s Next for Ripple and XRP? Ripple’s legal win is a big moment for the whole crypto market. It shows that companies can challenge regulators—and win. Ripple is now pushing for clearer, fairer crypto laws in the U.S., including tools like safe harbor rules and sandbox testing, which have worked well in other countries. At the same time, the SEC seems to be stepping back from its lawsuit-heavy approach. Cases against other platforms like Coinbase and Binance have been delayed or dropped. This could mean friendlier regulations are finally on the way. If XRP breaks above $2.49 and legal clarity continues to improve, it could set the stage for a strong rally in the weeks ahead. Key Insights: Ripple’s win over the SEC may accelerate crypto-friendly regulation. XRP remains supported near $2.37, reinforced by the 50 EMA. A break above $2.49 could lead to further gains toward $2.71.

After peaking at $350 in November last year, the company’s share prices plunged to $190, and technical patterns point to further downside. Crypto prices have crashed this year The ongoing crash happened as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most altcoins plunged: Bitcoin fell from an all-time high of $109,400 in January to today’s price of $84,400. Similarly, Ethereum ( ETH ) has slipped from last year’s high of $4,100 to $2,000. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies has dropped from over $3.8 trillion in 2024 to $2.76 trillion. Coinbase is highly exposed to crypto prices. Historically, its business has boomed when prices rise, and vice versa. For example, its revenue surged to $7.3 billion in 2021 as most coins soared and then crashed to $3.1 billion in the following year as Bitcoin crashed to $16,000. Full-year revenue for 2023 totaled $3.1 billion, and doubled in 2024 to $6.6 billion, Fortunately, Coinbase has diversified its business in the past few years, so transaction revenue is not the only source of income. The most recent financial results showed that transaction revenue was $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, while its subscriptions and revenue were $641 million. You might also like: Bitcoin race intensifies as Pompliano, Saylor address urgency for a reserve Its subscription and services revenue is growing quickly, thanks to its stablecoin, blockchain rewards, custodial fees, and interest and finance fee income. Coinbase is seeking to grow its business in other areas. For example, Base, its layer-2 blockchain network, has become the biggest player in the industry. Protocols in the network handled over $22 billion in volume in the last 30 days and have over $3.1 billion in total value locked. Coinbase is also in talks to acquire Deribit for between $4 billion and $5 billion. That acquisition would make it a big player in the booming derivatives industry. Coinbase is contending with rising competition in the crypto industry. Most of this competition comes from international players like OKX, HTX, and Binance. Coinbase stock price is at risk of further downside COIN stock by TradingView Wall Street analysts are highly optimistic about the COIN stock. The average estimate is that its annual revenue will grow 23.7% this year to $8.12 billion and $8.38 billion next year. These analysts expect Coinbase’s stock will rise to $318 from the current $189. The daily chart shows that the Coinbase stock has formed two risky patterns that point to an eventual crash to $150. It has formed a bearish pennant pattern with its two triangle lines about to converge. COIN is also about to form a death cross pattern, which happens when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross each other. Therefore, the stock is expected to have a strong bearish breakout in the next few weeks. Coinbase was founded in June 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam. Armstrong currently serves as the CEO.

However, reaching the $10 mark for both tokens remains a big challenge due to their large market caps and current supply dynamics. Emerging projects with lower valuations and strong fundamentals like Lightchain AI (LCAI) are gaining attention as investors look for high-growth alternatives. Lightchain AI raised over $17.9 million during the presale phase at a price of $0.007 , positioning itself as a serious contender in the AI-powered blockchain space. Lightchain AI provides a possibility for exponential growth with its focus on decentralized intelligence and real-world AI integration. The following article will explore why XRP and TON may struggle to hit $10 and why Lightchain AI could outperform them in the coming years. Market Capitalization Matters One of the key factors that determines the ability of a cryptocurrency to achieve an exponential growth in its price is market capitalization. Ripple (XRP) and Toncoin (TON), for instance, both of them have multi-billion-dollar market caps, and they will have a tough time shooting up to $10 in a short period of time. When a digital asset’s market value goes up, larger amounts of money are required to flow into the market to lift the price significantly. Consequently, emerging projects with lower market caps have an enhanced expected profit. The investor that looks for a good return on his investment can often be found attached to assets that have more space for expansion rather than tokens that are already into the billions in liquidity. Even though XRP and TON are still deeply rooted in the market, their potential to become a higher worth yet is limited by their competition with new alternative coins that offer innovation, lower supply, and more potential for a win that is in a flash. Why Ripple and TON May Struggle to Reach $10 Ripple (XRP) and Toncoin (TON) have strong ecosystems and an increasing rate of mainstream adoption, but their path to $10 remains difficult. One major hurdle is their large circulating supply—XRP has nearly 55 billion tokens in circulation, requiring an enormous market capitalization to reach double-digit prices. TON also faces liquidity constraints and strong competition from other layer-1 blockchains. Regulatory concerns may also continue to impact XRP, thus limiting its growth potential in certain markets. TON still lacks the widespread adoption necessary to drive a parabolic rally despite its rapid expansion. Both TON and XRP need large institutional investments and market-wide bullish conditions to see such price levels. Investors are, therefore, looking at smaller-cap alternatives with higher growth potential, and lower valuations provide a more realistic path to substantial price increases. Lightchain AI outperforms XRP and TON Lightchain AI is quickly becoming a serious competitor in the crypto market, offering innovative AI-powered blockchain solutions that distinguish it from Ripple (XRP) and Toncoin (TON). Lightchain AI is tapping into the rapidly growing AI sector which has received notable mainstream attention, unlike XRP which mainly focuses on cross-border payments, and TON which relies on its integration with Telegram.

42206943,https://timestabloid.com/?p=61222,1742727610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bitcoin (BTC) Set to Surge Toward $90K—Which Altcoin Should You Consider Before the Market Rallies?,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-btc-set-to-surge-toward-90k-which-altcoin-should/,"As Bitcoin moves through a volatile market phase, analysts predict a potential recovery pushing its value toward $90,000. With the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy playing a crucial role in shaping investor sentiment, BTC could soon regain its bullish momentum. However, seasoned investors understand that when Bitcoin gains traction, certain altcoins often experience even greater growth. One standout project in this cycle is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rapidly expanding DeFi lending platform that is capturing investor interest as the market prepares for its next upswing. Bitcoin’s Roadmap to a $90K Rally Following a two-month downturn, Bitcoin has left some traders questioning whether the bull market is slowing down. However, experts suggest BTC has entered a consolidation phase, positioning itself for a potential surge toward the $90,000 mark. Key macroeconomic indicators, including the Federal Reserve’s anticipated easing of interest rates, have bolstered optimism for a renewed market uptrend. The upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, along with statements from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, will heavily influence Bitcoin’s direction. If the Fed adopts a dovish or neutral stance, it could reignite investor confidence and drive BTC’s value higher. Institutional interest remains robust, and historical patterns suggest that once Bitcoin stabilizes, altcoins tend to follow with even larger percentage gains. As a result, many investors are actively searching for high-potential projects like Mutuum Finance before the broader market rally begins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Prime Altcoin Opportunity As Bitcoin gears up for its next upward movement, early-stage crypto projects with strong fundamentals are gaining momentum. Among them, Mutuum Finance is making waves as a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol focused on long-term sustainability and passive income generation. Unlike speculative assets that rely purely on market hype, MUTM operates within a structured financial model that ensures consistent demand and functionality. The platform introduces a dual lending system that accommodates different investor preferences. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending allows users to deposit assets such as ETH, USDT, and DAI into liquidity pools, earning variable interest based on borrowing activity. Simultaneously, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending provides a more flexible approach, allowing users to customize loan terms directly, making it ideal for assets that are often excluded from traditional lending platforms. Mutuum Finance has been experiencing rapid adoption, with its presale progressing quickly. Currently priced at $0.02 in its third presale phase, over 60% of the phase has already been sold, raising more than $4.35 million from over 6,200 investors. With the next phase set to increase the token price by 25% to $0.025, this presents a compelling opportunity for those looking to enter before MUTM is listed on major exchanges. The project’s structured pricing model ensures steady price appreciation, reducing speculative volatility while rewarding early adopters. A key element that sets Mutuum Finance apart is its mtTokens mechanism, allowing users to passively earn yields simply by supplying assets to the protocol. Unlike conventional staking, mtTokens accumulate value over time without requiring continuous management, making it an attractive option for long-term investors. Additionally, the project is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, adding another layer of utility and reinforcing the ecosystem’s long-term viability. Mutuum Finance also incorporates a unique buy-and-distribute mechanism, which continuously applies upward pressure on the token’s price. A portion of the platform’s transaction fees is allocated toward buying MUTM from the market, ensuring sustained demand while rewarding long-term holders. With a growing community, active development, and increasing presale interest, analysts foresee significant price appreciation once the token goes live on exchanges. Short-term projections suggest a 3x surge post-launch, with longer-term forecasts estimating MUTM could reach as high as $1 by 2025 as adoption scales. For those seeking high-growth opportunities before the broader bull market takes off, investing in MUTM at its current $0.02 valuation offers a promising upside. With Bitcoin’s anticipated rebound expected to trigger renewed enthusiasm in the crypto sector, Mutuum Finance is well-positioned as one of the most promising altcoins for substantial gains in the near future.

42205124,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=698220,1742727630,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42205124.jpeg,Trump declares April 2nd as “Liberation Day” for new targeted tariffs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-april-2nd-liberation-day-new-tariffs/,"Trump plans to announce reciprocal tariffs on April 2nd. These tariffs will target countries that have imposed tariffs and other long-term limitations on the US. Officials who are aware of the matter say this announcement on “Liberation Day” will be more specific than Trump’s overall global threats. It will relieve stock and trade markets’ concerns about an extensive trade war. However, the announcement will increase the tariffs that Trump has already imposed. While these tariffs will be focused on a group of countries, others will be exempted. The officials told Bloomberg that the administration would not reveal the industry-based tariffs on the same day, even though Trump had hinted at their possibility. Trump vowed to introduce sector-specific tariffs targeting industries such as automobiles, semiconductor chips, pharmaceuticals, and lumber. He specifically mentioned that auto tariffs would be included in the same batch. While an auto tariff is still under consideration, Trump has not dismissed the possibility of implementing it at a later time. Avoiding the measure in the April 2 announcement would likely be a relief for the auto industry, which is already concerned about the potential strain of multiple tariff streams on supply chains. Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs will take effect immediately The upcoming rates will be implemented and enforced right away to have an immediate impact. Officials say this will further damage the relations between the US and the allied countries, with possible reactions leading to a back-and-forth trade war. Although nothing is certain yet, as with Trump, decisions can be unpredictable until he officially announces them. Trump’s administration is having discussions on how to advance the trade strategy. Despite these internal negotiations, Trump himself is the force of aggressive intentions. He supports high tariffs. This is because Trump views raising import taxes as a way to generate revenue for the U.S. government. On Friday, during an Oval Office meeting, Trump said, “April 2nd is going to be liberation day for America. We’ve been ripped off by every country in the world, friend and foe”. Trump announces April 2 as “Liberation Day.” Source: Forbes Trump believes these tariffs can bring in “tens of billions.” Another aide recently said the revenue could be worth trillions of dollars over 10 years. However, the market is showing different signs. It responded negatively to Trump’s initial tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico, as well as his recent tariffs on metals such as steel and aluminum. The market’s decline has put pressure on the White House due to economic instability. Trump has often measured his success as president by how well the major stock indexes are performing. So, if tariffs cause the market to drop, it reflects poorly on his presidency by his own standards. US is focusing on “reciprocal tariffs” for a fair trade Trump officials have admitted that the list of countries facing new tariffs might not include everyone. Some countries may be exempted. For certain products, like steel, the new tariffs may not be added on top of existing tariffs. Instead, they may be adjusted or applied differently, reducing the overall impact on those industries. Trump himself is increasingly talking about reciprocal measures. This means he is focusing on making trade fair by imposing tariffs only on countries that impose tariffs on the U.S. or have an unfair trade advantage. The officials say it’s uncertain which countries will be included in targeted tariffs. Trump has mentioned the EU, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, India, China, and Canada and called them trade abusers in discussions with the officials. Although narrower in scope, Trump’s proposal still represents a much larger effort than his first term. It challenges the market’s tolerance for unpredictability and includes a series of import taxes. Kevin Hassett, Director of Trump’s National Economic Council, indicated that markets are overestimating the extent of the tariffs. Kevin Hassett in an interview with Larry Kudlow. Source: Fox Business He said in an interview with Larry Kudlow on Fox Business, “One of the things we see from markets is they’re expecting they’re going to be these really large tariffs on every single country.” Larry Kudlow held the same position as Hasset during Trump’s first term. Hasset said that market expectations should be changed as not all countries cheat the US on trade. The tariffs are for a few countries only. “Liberation Day” event could include some tariff reductions In the past, Trump imposed and then significantly scaled back tariffs on Canada and Mexico over alleged failures to curb fentanyl shipments to the U.S. The future of these tariffs is still uncertain, as a Trump-imposed pause on many of them is nearing expiration. Officials noted that the tariffs could either be lifted altogether or replaced with an equivalent amount. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent mentioned last week that steel and aluminum tariffs may not necessarily be added to existing country-specific rates. He told Fox Business.“I will have a better sense as we get closer to April 2nd. So, they could be stacked,” Bessent also identified around 15% of countries as the most significant offenders. “It’s 15% of the countries, but it’s a huge amount of our trading volume,” he said, labeling them the “dirty 15”. He said these 15 countries are the primary target. Before abandoning the idea, Trump’s team reportedly considered a three-tiered global tariff system that would categorize countries based on how restrictive their trade barriers were, according to sources familiar with the discussions. The Wall Street Journal previously reported on this approach. Trump sees tariffs as a strategic tool Trump views tariffs as a critical instrument to encourage new investment in the U.S. while also generating revenue that could potentially offset Republican-led tax cuts. “Tariffs will make America more competitive. They will incentivize investment into America,” said Stephen Miran, chairman of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, said during an interview. The administration argues that foreign governments and corporations pledging trillions of dollars in investments proves Trump’s strategy is effective. Miran told Fox Business last week that discussions are ongoing as the April 2nd deadline approaches. “I do think that it’s perfectly reasonable to expect that we could raise trillions of dollars from tariffs over a 10-year budget window and like I said before, using those revenues to finance lower rates on American workers, on American businesses,” he stated. Moreover, companies could adapt to the tariffs, particularly if not all countries are affected. According to a survey last year by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, U.S. customs revenue from China surged following the imposition of tariffs in 2018, but then peaked in 2022 and experienced a sharp decline in 2023.

BTC/USD four-hour price chart. Source: TradingView Key factors behind Bitcoin’s flat price action include: Unpredictable US economic policies. Lack of fresh capital entering the market. Technical setups. Trade war fears offset pro-Bitcoin news Bitcoin’s price is stuck as bullish and bearish headlines are clashing, creating bias conflicts that keep traders guessing and BTC range-bound. The bullish signals: On March 19, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% and announced a slower pace of balance sheet runoff, signaling looser policy ahead. Fed Chair Jerome Powell used the word “transitory” to describe tariff-driven inflation, striking a dovish tone that briefly lifted market sentiment. President Donald Trump declared the US the "" undisputed Bitcoin superpower "" and is pushing for pro-crypto policies, including stablecoin legislation. MicroStrategy continues to lead institutional demand , adding 130 BTC for $10.7M million, bringing its total to 499,226 BTC. Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed selling US gold reserves to acquire 1 million BTC over five years—a bold sign of shifting attitudes toward Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The bearish signals: Despite Powell’s dovish tone, the Fed raised its 2025 inflation forecast to 2.8% from 2.5% and cut GDP growth expectations to 1.7% from 2.1%, suggesting stagflation risks are on the rise. Bitcoin’s post-FOMC breakout was short-lived , with the price quickly falling back into a narrow trading range—signaling a lack of conviction. BTC/USD four-hour price chart. Source: TradingView Ongoing trade tensions and tariff uncertainty continue to hang over markets, with no clear resolution in sight. A European Central Bank official warned that Trump’s pro-crypto stance could trigger a global financial crisis. In short, macroeconomic caution and geopolitical noise offset the bullish catalysts. Until one side decisively breaks through, Bitcoin’s price is likely to remain in limbo. Shrinking liquidity stagnates Bitcoin market A contraction in liquidity, declining speculative activity, and fading capital inflows are further keeping BTC locked inside the $82,400-85,300 range. What to know: The realized Cap is growing at just +0.67% per month, signaling weak capital inflows compared to 13.2% in December, according to Glassnode’s weekly on-chain report .

Lower liquidity and subdued sentiment are capping larger upside and downside moves. BTC price trapped inside ascending triangle pattern Bitcoin’s price remains stuck as technical barriers continue to cap both upside and downside momentum. Key takeaways: Price is consolidating between a horizontal support-turned-resistance level and an ascending trendline support. The upper boundary acts as a strong ceiling.

Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and even Floki Inu have proven that a strong community, meme culture, and smart tokenomics can turn what seems like a joke into a multi-billion-dollar asset. Now, a new meme coin to buy is gaining attention— Troller Cat ($TCAT). If there’s one thing crypto history has taught us, it’s that getting in early makes all the difference. Those who identified the potential of Dogecoin before it went mainstream or grabbed Shiba Inu before it skyrocketed saw life-changing gains. The question is—which meme coin to buy next? The answer? Troller Cat ($TCAT), a game-changing project that’s still in its whitelist phase. Troller Cat isn’t just another token—it’s a movement, an experience, and possibly the next major meme coin sensation. Crypto traders are keeping an eye on its upcoming presale, and with the early access phase still open, now’s the best time to jump in. Why Troller Cat Is the Best Meme Coin to Buy Right Now Picking the right meme coin to buy isn’t just about hype—it’s about spotting strong fundamentals mixed with an engaged community. Troller Cat stands out for multiple reasons. First, let’s talk about community. Meme coins live and die by their communities, and Troller Cat is already building a strong following. The biggest meme coin successes—Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe—were all driven by dedicated holders who pushed the project forward. Troller Cat is no different. It’s backed by traders, meme lovers, and crypto influencers who believe in its mission of turning trolling into a full-scale blockchain experience. Second, there’s growing excitement about Troller Cat’s rumored staking rewards. While nothing is confirmed yet, whispers in the crypto space suggest that early investors might get exclusive staking benefits, making it even more lucrative to get in now rather than later. Third, Troller Cat is launching on Ethereum, meaning it benefits from high security, seamless DeFi integration, and massive adoption potential. Ethereum-based meme coins historically outperform those on lesser-known blockchains because of the ease of trading, staking, and exposure to mainstream investors. If you’re looking for a meme coin to buy with strong foundations, this is it. And then there’s Troller Cat’s rumored Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game Center . If this turns out to be true, it could add major utility to the token, making it deflationary—meaning the supply constantly shrinks while demand grows. That’s a winning formula in the meme coin space. Troller Cat has all the elements of a meme coin ready to explode, making it the best meme coin to buy before it’s too late. The Importance of Buying Early in a Meme Coin’s Life Cycle If there’s one thing that separates winners in crypto from those who regret missing out, it’s timing. The best time to buy a meme coin isn’t when it’s already on everyone’s radar—it’s before it explodes. Troller Cat is currently in its whitelist phase, meaning early buyers get first dibs on a project that could surge in value once it launches. Take a look at Dogecoin. It started as a joke, but those who bought early saw their investment multiply by thousands of times. The same goes for Shiba Inu. Before it became a top meme coin , it was just another low-market-cap project that savvy investors scooped up at bargain prices. Troller Cat’s presale isn’t open yet, but whitelisted investors will have the first opportunity to secure TCAT tokens before they hit the public market. This means getting in at a lower price, avoiding the rush when everyone realizes the coin’s potential. Another factor to consider is hype and community growth. The best meme coins don’t just launch—they build momentum before they even go live. The community around Troller Cat is growing fast, and as more investors discover it, demand could surge overnight. The difference between those who profit and those who chase the pump? Getting in while things are still early. Buying into a meme coin at the right moment is everything. With Troller Cat still in its early phase, now is the time to act. Why Meme Coins Like Troller Cat Are More Than Just Hype A common misconception is that meme coins are purely hype-driven. While hype plays a role, the most successful meme coins have something extra—utility, community, and long-term vision. Troller Cat isn’t just a token; it’s an experience. The crypto world is buzzing about Troller Cat’s rumored Play-to-Earn Game Center. If this feature is confirmed, TCAT could become more than just a meme coin—it could be an interactive ecosystem. The game could introduce a deflationary mechanism, meaning a portion of tokens is burned as players engage with the ecosystem, creating natural scarcity that could drive up the token’s value. Then there’s the speculation about staking rewards. If true, this could allow early adopters to earn passive income just by holding TCAT. Imagine buying early, watching the token’s value rise, and getting rewarded along the way. Ethereum’s blockchain is also a major advantage. Unlike meme coins on lesser-known networks, Ethereum-based tokens are easy to trade, integrate with DeFi platforms, and reach a massive audience. That means Troller Cat has a strong foundation for long-term growth. This isn’t just another meme coin. Troller Cat is shaping up to be a meme-driven project with real substance, making it a prime meme coin to buy before its full launch. Final Thoughts: The Best Meme Coin to Buy Before It Takes Off Every once in a while, a meme coin comes along that completely changes the game. Troller Cat ($TCAT) has all the makings of a breakout success, from a growing community to potential staking benefits and a rumored Play-to-Earn gaming ecosystem. Right now, the whitelist is open. Those who secure their spot now will have early access before the presale begins. If you’re looking for the best meme coin to buy now before the next bull run, this might be your best shot. Meme coins aren’t just about luck—they’re about recognizing opportunities before the masses do. The choice is yours: join now or risk missing out while others celebrate their gains. Troller Cat’s whitelist is live. Secure your spot today.

Then it hitched its wagon to Trump’s coattails and skyrocketed in Oct. 2024. After that, the world’s premier cryptocurrency hit a historical record high price of $109,000 on Jan. 20, 2025, according to data from CoinGecko. But soon after, the market euphoria began to recede, and BTC began to steeply correct and even plunged beneath $77,000. Polymarkets Bet Bitcoin Price High Of $110K In 2025 Bettors in a $5.4 million Polymarket betting pool recently placed the odds that BTC marks $110,000 in 2025 at 61%. That would be a big gain over the Mar. Bitcoin price, but not much more than the Jan. record high. Meanwhile, the decentralized betting pool also bets overall that there’s a 68% chance BTC will crash to $70,000 in 2025. Either or both of these price levels are possible in 2025. But regardless of the path markets take on the BTC price chart to get there, these seven big financial technology companies from traditional finance and the blockchain industry anticipate the leading cryptocurrency’s market capitalization to continue to drink Wall Street’s milkshake every time the Fed expands the dollar supply. As a result, they forecast a melt up for Bitcoin through 2030. 1. Standard Chartered Speaking on CNBC in March, Geoffrey Kendrick, a crypto analyst for the trillion-dollar London bank Standard Chartered, said he expects Bitcoin’s price to top $200,000 in 2025 and $500,000 by 2029. $1 TRILLION STANDARD CHARTERED SAYS #BITCOIN IS GOING TO $500,000 IN THE NEXT 4 YEARS BULLISH pic.twitter.com/UnqOJBOZXL — Bitcoin Josh (@Josh_ideal1) March 7, 2025 “So within the crypto ecosystem, what we need are traditional financial players like Standard Chartered, like BlackRock and others that have the ETFs now to really step on in size,” Kendrick said. “It’s institutions like ours that now offer custody businesses that are much more secure,” the London crypto markets analyst added. “So as the industry becomes more institutionalized, it should be safer… That could see a lot more traditional players entering the market.” 2. Bank of America Bank of America expects Bitcoin to revolutionize finance in the 2020s. In fact, its CEO Brian Moynihan said in January that the $1.62 trillion Charlotte, North Carolina bank will adopt Bitcoin if regulators give the go-ahead. Bank of America CEO says the banking industry will adopt bitcoin and crypto if regulation allows them pic.twitter.com/wkWFErbOQ9 — Documenting ₿itcoin (@DocumentingBTC) January 21, 2025 “If the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you will find the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it,” Moynihan said. Revealingly about the long-term tailwinds for its market price, the Bank of America CEO said the traditional finance bank will adopt Bitcoin, “Because we have to.” In a March note to investors, BoA said it expects the Federal Reserve to take a dovish turn and cut interest rates. Lower rates historically strongly correlate with tidal rises in Bitcoin’s price. “Our rates strategists expect the statement to indicate that the Fed is pausing QT until the debt ceiling is resolved, as suggested in the January meeting minutes,” the note read. “They do not expect to restart after the debt ceiling is addressed, but the announcement won’t be made until later this year.” 3. Morgan Stanley The $1.66 trillion New York City banking juggernaut has consistently been early among its peers to offer crypto products. The corporate bank offered wealth clients crypto custody services in 2021. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick told CNBC in January that the bank wants to make a big move into offering customers payment rails through cryptocurrency, but it’s waiting on the okay from regulators. Meanwhile, in March, the SEC held its first crypto task for a roundtable to find regulatory clarity. “Spring signifies new beginnings, and we have a new beginning here, a restart of the commission’s approach to crypto regulation,” said Republican SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce. 4. Block Twitter founder and Block CEO Jack Dorsey is very bullish for Bitcoin’s price prospects over the long term. He predicts a $20 trillion market cap and a $1 million price for Bitcoin by 2030. “At least a $1 million. I do think it hits that number and goes beyond. The most amazing thing about bitcoin, apart from the founding story, is anyone who works on it… is making the entire ecosystem better, which makes the price go up.” That would be a nearly 12x increase in a principal sum invested at Bitcoin’s Mar. 21 price around the $84,000 level. That would turn $10,000 into $120,000 in five years. The average annualized ROI (return on investment) for the investor would be 220%. 5. Coinbase Coinbase is a New York City-based cryptocurrency exchange, the largest in North America, and publicly traded on the Nasdaq under the stock ticker COIN. It offers 240 digital assets for altcoin investors to trade, but the most popular cryptocurrency on its 24/7 automated retail Internet exchange is Bitcoin. Like Dorsey, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said at Davos in January that he expects Bitcoin to flip gold’s $18 trillion global market cap and go to a million dollars per BTC, then beyond to “multiple millions.” “The US has reserves in many assets—gold, oil, and various rare minerals,” Armstrong says. “I believe the world is moving toward a Bitcoin standard for money.” 6. BlackRock BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, with over $11 trillion in assets under management. Under the leadership of its CEO Larry Fink, the behemoth New York City investment manager has made one of the biggest plays for Bitcoin so far. It’s right up there with MicroStrategy (half a million BTC) and the wildest ambitions of Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) for the US government (a million BTC). After becoming one of a dozen BTC ETF issuers last year, BlackRock owns over half a million BTC for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to Bitcoin treasuries data maintained by Bitbo. Fink predicted in January that Bitcoin’s price could soon go up to $700,000 if markets must hedge against more currency debasement and economic uncertainty. 7. Ark Invest Ark Invest, the tech-focused St. Petersburg, Florida-based hedge fund led by Cathie Wood, anticipates Bitcoin prices to reach $1.5 million by 2030. It’s a forecast Wood has stood by for months now. She said in February that she thinks the consolidation phase Bitcoin markets are in at the moment is “extremely healthy” for the asset. After the sellers shake out of the market, its next leg up will be “unleashed.” Speaking to attendees of the Cboe Global Markets 2025 Bitcoin Outlook webinar, Wood said, “We would not want the market to continue straight up to the right without looking back. We want a wall of worry.” The post These 7 Big Financial Technology Companies Expect Bitcoin’s Price to Melt Up appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|featured1|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Long-Term Prediction|BlackRock,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-03-23 11:11:04

Pakistan’s Crypto Council has proposed using surplus energy for Bitcoin mining, signaling a clear policy shift toward crypto adoption. The council’s CEO, Bilal Bin Saqib, highlighted the opportunity to attract foreign investment and establish Pakistan as a regional crypto hub. This follows Pakistan’s move to legalize cryptocurrency as tender starting November 4, 2024, aligning with recent U.S. policy changes. Under the Trump administration, executive orders blocked a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and created a Bitcoin strategic reserve—a step that mirrors El Salvador’s pro-Bitcoin stance. By repurposing idle energy into BTC mining, Pakistan could reduce mining costs and boost energy efficiency. The move could also enhance the country’s financial inclusion while bolstering Bitcoin’s case as a tool for national innovation.

Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser argues that gold’s historical reliability makes it a superior collateral option for stable assets. He predicts nations like China and Russia, with over 50,000 tonnes of gold combined, may soon favor gold-pegged tokens over USD-based ones. Tether has already introduced Alloy (aUSD)—a gold-backed stablecoin collateralized by its XAU token.

Bitcoin Eyes $85K Breakout, But Faces Resistance Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is consolidating just under $84,500, with it’s price action is tightening within a symmetrical triangle pattern, with the $84,000 zone acting as a key support-turn-resistance level. BTC is now testing both the upper trendline of the triangle and the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which currently sits at $84,058. A decisive break above $85,800 would confirm bullish momentum, potentially driving prices toward $87,400 and $89,000. However, multiple rejections at this level suggest caution. On the downside, $81,500 remains critical support, followed by $80,000 and $78,400. Volume continues to remain low, indicating that traders are still waiting for a strong directional move. Technical Summary: Resistance: $85,800, $87,400, $89,000 Support: $81,500, $80,000, $78,400 50 EMA: $84,058 Bitcoin is at a pivotal technical and geopolitical intersection. Between growing adoption, stablecoin competition, and regulatory enforcement, the next breakout could set the tone for the weeks ahead.

Jim Chalmers, the country’s treasurer, warned from Canberra that the United States is about to light a fuse under world markets with new tariffs and trade chaos, just days before he delivers his fourth national budget on March 25. “This is a whole new world of uncertainty that we’re dealing with here. The changes out of the US are not surprising, but they are seismic,” Jim said in a Sunday interview with Bloomberg. He said the global economic fallout from Trump’s new trade war has already cast a shadow over this budget, which comes less than two months before Australia’s federal election, due by May 17. Jim confirmed that the budget will include a $1.8 billion in new electricity bill subsidies, lasting six months. That translates to $1.1 billion USD, and it will drag the budget bottom line down. But the money is meant to help with what Jim called a continuing cost-of-living crisis. He said the pressure on Australian families isn’t just coming from home—it’s coming straight out of Washington. Chalmers links Trump’s new tariffs to global instability On Tuesday, Jim said he expects only a small boost to government revenue in this budget. “What you’ll likely see in the budget is that Treasury expects any upgrade next week to be about a sixth of the average of our budget updates. The smallest revenue upgrade of the four budgets, by far,” he said during a press conference in Canberra. He made clear that the chaos isn’t just financial. It’s political too. “We’ve got conflicts in the Middle East and Europe. We’ve got political uncertainty and division around the world,” Jim said. “The budget is designed not just to respond to all of that uncertainty, but to make ourselves more resilient in the face of those external shocks.” Jim said the current international environment is worse than anything he’s seen in years. And that includes what Trump is doing with tariffs. Trump said on Sunday aboard Air Force One that he’ll impose reciprocal tariffs and additional tariffs on specific sectors starting April 2. “They charge us and we charge them and then in addition to that on autos on steel on aluminum we are going to have additional tariffs,” Trump said. Jim responded Tuesday by saying those tariffs are a serious threat to everyone. “These sorts of tariffs are self-defeating, they’ve self-sabotaging, they’re a recipe for less growth and higher inflation, not just in the US but around the world,” he told ABC. He added, “We’re not uniquely disadvantaged by the sorts of tariffs coming out of DC, but we deserve better as a long-term partner and ally.” Australia has been trying to get an exemption from the U.S. tariffs, especially on steel and aluminum, but Jim confirmed the effort failed. Trump had earlier said he would consider it, but that never turned into anything. Now, Jim said Canberra is focused on what happens in April. The government is worried that the next wave of tariffs will hit Australian exports, including beef and pharmaceuticals. Canberra prepares for economic fallout from U.S. trade war In a pre-budget speech, Jim said that the impact of last week’s tariffs on Australian growth would be minor—less than 0.02% by 2030. But he warned that number could rise fast if Trump keeps going. Jim said the Trump administration’s moves are already hurting trade stability, and could cause long-term damage to economies that rely on open trade, including Australia. Jim also addressed interest rates and wages. He said that the Reserve Bank of Australia had finally cut rates for the first time in four years, back in February. That’s a change from last year, when rate hikes were used to fight inflation. Now, Jim said, there are signs of recovery. “We’ve got inflation down, real wages are up and incomes are strengthening. Unemployment is very low by historical standards. We’ve got the debt down, interest rates have started to come down and now growth is rebounding solidly in our economy as well, led by the private sector,” he said Sunday. Even with that domestic progress, Jim said the outside risks—especially from the U.S.—are too big to ignore. Trump already hit China with a 20% tariff, and he imposed a 25% levy on steel and aluminum across the board. He also added 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, although he gave those countries a one-month extension if their goods follow the USMCA trade agreement from his first term. Trump said Canadian energy and potash, a major fertilizer input, would only get a 10% tax. But there’s no carve-out for Australia, and Jim said the country now has to prepare for fallout on key industries, especially exports that depend on U.S. markets. Jim said that even though Australia’s green energy and pro-industry policies are similar to what Joe Biden supported in his presidency, there won’t be any new announcements in that area in the budget. He said the focus is now on keeping the economy stable, not rolling out more programs. He also confirmed that the Labor government will make this election about one thing—economic resilience. That’s because Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been under pressure for months. Polls show the Labor party is basically tied with the opposition, and the campaign is expected to launch soon. Albanese has taken heat for not solving the housing mess, and voters are still angry about rising grocery costs and rent hikes. With an election deadline coming up by May 17, Jim said the government wants to use the budget to show it’s responding to global risks. “The vote will focus on making the national economy more resilient at a time of very serious global economic uncertainty,” Jim said Tuesday. Jim said Trump’s new tariff regime, set to start in April, is adding major pressure to an already fragile global system. The tariffs are based on what Trump calls reciprocal rates—if a country has high tariffs on U.S. goods, he’ll return the favor. On top of that, Trump wants extra tariffs on cars, steel, aluminum, microchips, and pharma. Trump told reporters on Sunday that he’s going after “foreign goods imported to the U.S.” in two ways—first through the reciprocal system, and then with sector-specific hits. “April 2 is a liberating day for our country,” Trump said on Air Force One. “We’re getting back some of the wealth that very, very foolish presidents gave away because they had no clue what they were doing.” Jim said Australia isn’t taking chances. He confirmed the budget will respond to these new trade threats with policies designed to shield the economy. But he also said the international situation is changing so fast that no budget can fully absorb the damage if Trump’s tariffs expand. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Earlier this month, President Trump reinvigorated crypto markets with his announcement of five cryptocurrencies for U.S. strategic reserves: Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cardano ( ADA ). In making this announcement, Trump has opened the door to a new financial era and created an opportunity for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to go toe-to-toe with the leader in global reserve fiat currency, the US dollar. You might also like: Sovereign wealth funds and Bitcoin’s future | Opinion How did Bitcoin get here? The Bitcoin revolution started and grew as a reactionary movement to another global financial event, the 2008 financial crisis that was driven by an unsustainable housing bubble propped up by poor lending practices and toxic assets. The interventions made by central banks to correct the problem—including the bailout of institutions “too big to fail”—demonstrated to Bitcoin whitepaper writer and “inventor” Satoshi Nakamoto what they had already long believed about the fundamental problems of centralized economics and the need for a decentralized “e-cash.” The Bitcoin blockchain itself went live when Satoshi embedded the following message in the genesis block: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” The current era might be even more auspicious for driving the second wave of the Bitcoin revolution, especially if you believe Bitcoin is strong enough to become something like digital gold or a global reserve currency. The problem presented by the current era is not that of the bailout but the fundamental problem of fiat currency itself, that sticky problem of inflation. Prone to centralized currency manipulation and with countries still drowning in the fiat pumped out during and after the COVID-19 crisis, inflation has proven to be a fundamental complication that has bedeviled leaders across the globe and the political spectrum. Even with a number of political incumbents in different countries falling in defeat to the problem, inflation is proving to be especially resilient, even for the many disruptors who came in on the anti-inflation, anti-incumbent sentiment. In some cases, it is a problem isolated to a few products and sectors facing unique and probably temporary supply challenges, such as in the case of the price of eggs. However, if the problem persists, a crypto reserve, and especially a Bitcoin reserve, could present an elegant solution to at least partly halting inflation. This will be a good thing not only for those governments, but for the evolution of the one truly free and fair digital currency, the one that has been with us since 2009. Can a US Bitcoin reserve actually work? Is this even workable, especially here in the United States? Generally, a Bitcoin-led reserve would present a hedge against inflation, with the drawback being that governments would lose some flexibility around these holdings in the customary fiat-driven toolkits that have helped those governments heat up or cool down economies as needed. It makes sense that governments would look at Bitcoin as some portion of a reserve, particularly as a small, high-risk, high-reward portion of reserves, even as those governments missed out on the initial march to $100,000. There could be other rewards as well. As Senator Cynthia Lummis has pointed out to Elon Musk, now a top advisor to President Donald Trump, a crypto reserve could also be an automatic solution for governments to better audit those reserves, digitally. State governments in the US have actually been leading the way on this issue, providing a sort of roadmap for the federal government to use. Nearly half of all state governments have either put money into crypto reserves or are beginning that process. If Bitcoin continues to grow through this increased demand on its fixed supply, that makes it an even more attractive option to the U.S. federal government and other governments like it. If Bitcoin is to truly become part of the US national reserves, there must be clear regulatory frameworks, robust custody solutions, and bipartisan political will. From a monetary policy standpoint, the Federal Reserve would face an asset it cannot directly manipulate, potentially altering how we manage interest rates and national debt. Getting in while the getting’s good But what would all these governments diving in do for Bitcoin itself? We’ve already seen the temporary price bump on just the news itself, but the actual ramifications if it’s implemented will be more far-reaching. For one, Bitcoin would immediately be tied to fundamental avenues of public investment, especially retirement and pension funds. That is real attention and institutional interest that goes beyond online message boards, Telegram, and the Robinhood app. The US federal government following the states’ lead would, in turn, create a ripple effect where large companies in the private sector would follow the public sector’s lead. If Bitcoin were in national reserves, it would legitimize Bitcoin as an institutional-grade asset, prompting companies to hold it more confidently on their balance sheets. In practice, we’d see new liquidity strategies—like crypto-backed lending—become mainstream, and corporations would more actively integrate Bitcoin into their long-term capital planning. If Bitcoin were deemed a national reserve, its credibility as collateral would also skyrocket. Bitcoin-backed loans would become as standard as borrowing against gold, adding a modern dimension to liquidity in times of crisis. Its digital nature offers global 24/7 markets, which can provide flexibility and speed that gold or treasuries can’t match, although volatility remains a consideration. A national BTC reserve would cement Bitcoin’s status as “digital gold.” We’d see broader acceptance by banks and alternative lenders offering BTC-collateralized loans, lines of credit, and treasury management solutions. New financial tools—like Bitcoin-based municipal bonds or sovereign BTC ETFs—could also become viable. There would still be risks, including price volatility, but that can be a benefit, not a bug, especially if it were incorporated as just one segment of a diversified portfolio with different risk thresholds. Policymakers must balance both perceived and real concerns with the massive upside of holding a finite digital reserve asset. On the flip side, Bitcoin provides an uncorrelated hedge against inflation and can attract global capital if the US is seen as Bitcoin-friendly, truly positioning it as the best reserve asset in the world. It behooves the federal government to follow President Trump’s lead and begin to seriously explore this option while Bitcoin is still at a relatively low and investment-friendly price.

Following multiple analysts’ higher-price predictions for the asset — which at above $4,800 is now eying up its previous $4,865 ATH — by mid 2025, fueled by network upgrades, institutional inflows, and expanding decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. This bullish movement isn’t some stand alone. Of ETH-Connected tokens that will rally as Ethereum sky rockets is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM stands out in particular with its presale picking up steam, MUTM (Mutuum Finance), with half of Phase 3 sold already at $0.02 per token. Investors clamoring for early access expect profits even before Ethereum’s rally hits a peak. The Possibility of an Ethereum to $4,800 The rebound of Ethereum from its 2022 lows is emblematic of the growing maturity of the crypto markets. The Merge succeeded in reducing energy consumption by 99% and plans for sharding will increase transaction speeds. This technical progress coincides with a growing DeFi economy, where 60% of all protocols live on Ethereum. The ignition of institutional interest: Ethereum ETFs now hold $8 billion worth of capital worldwide, while corporates embed ETH into payment systems. The regulatory clarity is critical. If U.S. agencies deem ETH a commodity, institutional participation could soar. Technical analysis suggests a breakout and a falling wedge pattern implying a rise up to $3,793 by mid-2025. If macroeconomic conditions stabilize, analysts see $4,800 as attainable — a 153% jump from levels as of this writing. Mutuum Finance Investors Smell Blood Before Exchange Listing Ethereum has its sights on record highs, but one very promising ETH-based project has flown under the radar — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Its Phase 3 of presale has raised some $4.4 million with 6300 holders being attracted by its lending protocol and tokenomics. If we consider Phase 4 the launch price of $0.025 paid at launch for MUTM, that leaves MUTM priced at $0.02 for a 25% gain. Early purchasers could bag a 200% return at its $0.06 exchange listing — a figure that is written into its token distribution model. Targets get bolder after the launch: analysts expect MUTM to hit $1.20 in 12 months, a 5,900% jump from Phase 3 prices. MUTM’s mtTokens model — deposited tokens like ETH earn interest-bearing tokens — inflates recurring demand. The buy and distribute mechanism is another supply hammer: 15% of paid platform fees repurchase MUTM from the markets and redistribute the tokens to stakers. This double-edged strategy maintains buy momentum, rewarding long-term investors in the process. Security still takes center stage, as Certik audits MUTM’s smart contracts. Results are set to be released shortly, and will be announced through official channels. Investors Are Buying Mutuum Finance Rapidly Unlike speculative memecoins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines DeFi utility with structured growth. Its overcollateralized lending format lowers default risks making it favourable to institutions hunting yields in volatile markets. In order to ensure liquidity even in downtime, borrowers are locking assets worth 140% of their loan values. On the other hand, a dynamic interest rate responds to market pressures so that lender profits align with borrower accessibility. The rapid sell-out of Phase 3 indicates urgency. Over 50% of tokens have already been claimed and remaining inventory is running low at $0.02! MUTM’s post-launch projections depend on adoption as 0.5% of Ethereum’s $42 billion DeFi TVL gives substantive volume for MUTM’s $1.20 target. Presale commitment is rewarded by entry into a $100,000 giveaway for early joiners. Last Chance for Early Access Before Certik Audit End Ethereum’s surge beyond $4,800 could trigger rallies throughout its ecosystem, yet few projects match the presale value proposition of MUTM. Phase 3 represents a point of entry at 66% off its listing price, with a discount that isn’t likely to appear again. Confidence in MUTM’s security could spark a last presale rush as Certik audit draws to a close Investors who skip this are risking a 25% premium in Phase 4—and a 200% premium after launch. For investors looking for asymmetric returns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an outlier when the trifecta of cheapness, use case, and growth converge. Secure MUTM at $0.02 before Phase 3 sells out—price hikes loom as Ethereum’s rally accelerates.

The macro environment is what’s slamming the breaks on capital flowing into the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. But once the backdrop shifts in the coming weeks, BTC “will rip forward with a vengeance,” according to MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor. And a return of upward trajectory in Bitcoin may boost interest in other digital assets, including the meme coins, as it typically does, in the back half of 2025. That’s what makes the up-and-coming Bitcoin Pepe an exciting investment for crypto enthusiasts at the time of writing. Why are Saylor’s remarks positive for Bitcoin Pepe? Saylor sees Bitcoin as the only “long-term store of value” that’s worth investing a billion dollars in in 2025. While the industry expert is known for his bullish remarks on BTC only, his view bodes well for the market at large, including Bitcoin Pepe, since they add to optimism surrounding the future of cryptocurrencies. When a veteran like Michael Saylor discusses the crypto market, enthusiasts tend to read it as a sign of legitimacy, driving more capital into cryptocurrencies. And let’s face it: Bitcoin at over $80,000 looks inaccessible to retail investors. Instead of buying a fraction of BTC, they typically prefer building a sizable position in a meme coin with about $100, hoping only a few cents of increase in the meme coin could bring them a big return within a matter of months. Note that meme coins are known for offering explosive returns in their initial stages – that’s what may help drive capital into Bitcoin Pepe as the BTC starts to recover. Bitcoin Pepe seems to be firing on cylinders Bitcoin Pepe could emerge as the top meme coin that benefits from the expected Bitcoin recovery as it’s being advertised as the “world’s first Bitcoin meme ICO.” The narrative, which essentially suggests it’s a close relative of Bitcoin, has been sitting so well with the investment community that the native token has raised more than $5.6 million already in presale. Continued demand for Bitcoin Pepe indicates it may invite more capital once it lists on a crypto exchange after the presale, which could help drive its price significantly up as we advance through the rest of 2025. Additionally, the broader macro environment is expected to turn the corner in the coming months, given the Fed continues to see two more rate cuts this year. Together, these factors make Bitcoin Pepe an exciting meme coin to invest in today. If you want to learn more about the native digital token first, you should click here to visit its website now.

The price rose 1.25% from the previous day, fluctuating between $0.2406 and $0.2334. Several developments are fueling the rally: deeper blockchain integration, growing investor speculation, and a high-profile post by TRON founder Justin Sun. Build — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) March 23, 2025 Sun’s brief “ Build ” tweet, posted on X, stirred market interest. Although the message was vague, many viewed it as a hint toward upcoming initiatives, partnerships, or upgrades within the TRON ecosystem. The post fueled speculation and supported positive price movement, aligning with a broader narrative of ongoing TRON development. These signals have been well-received by investors, especially as TRON continues to scale its blockchain and broaden its role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. TRON (TRX) rose 9% last week, trading at $0.238373. Price surge fueled by TRON’s Solana integration, TRX ETF rumors, and Justin Sun’s “Build” tweet. Sun’s tweet sparks optimism for new projects and price growth. TRON-Solana Link Enhances Blockchain Utility A major catalyst behind TRX’s surge is TRON’s announced integration with the Solana blockchain. This move aims to improve the network’s transaction throughput and cost-efficiency by leveraging Solana’s high-speed infrastructure. The integration also allows TRON-based applications to connect with Solana’s expansive DeFi ecosystem. By working seamlessly with Solana’s native token (SOL) and tapping into Solana’s network architecture, TRON is strengthening its cross-chain capability. The initiative supports Justin Sun’s long-standing goal of reducing stablecoin transfer costs to near zero—a move designed to attract more retail and institutional DeFi users.

TRX ETF Speculation Adds to Market Buzz Another factor supporting TRON’s recent momentum is growing speculation around the launch of a TRX exchange-traded fund (ETF). Though no formal announcement has been made, hints from Justin Sun’s social media activity have stirred investor excitement. The anticipation follows the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which helped increase mainstream adoption and institutional interest in crypto. A potential TRX ETF could further legitimize TRON in traditional finance, drawing attention from larger funds and market players.

TRON Outlook: TRX Eyes Breakout Above $0.255 Analysts remain optimistic about TRON’s near-term trajectory. Many expect TRX to push above $0.255, a key resistance level, backed by strong support at $0.234. Technical forecasts suggest that if TRX breaks out, it could reach $0.2621, representing a potential 12% gain from current levels. Longer-term projections for 2025 put TRX in the $0.2562–$0.3202 range, depending on market conditions and continued network development. Momentum will likely be driven by ecosystem expansion, broader DeFi integration, and the realization of ETF-related catalysts. BTC Bull: Earn Bitcoin Rewards with the Hottest Crypto Presale BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is making waves as a community-driven token that automatically rewards holders with real Bitcoin when BTC hits key price milestones. Unlike traditional meme tokens, BTCBULL is built for long-term investors, offering real incentives through airdropped BTC rewards and staking opportunities.

Arctic Pablo Coin Hits $1.96M While Burning Supply – A Must-Watch with SLERF and Broccoli!,https://thecoinrise.com/whats-behind-this-meme-coin-boom-arctic-pablo-coin-hits-1-96m-while-burning-supply-a-must-watch-with-slerf-and-broccoli/,"The crypto world never sleeps, and with groundbreaking developments happening every day, investors are constantly on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) has taken the market by storm, drawing attention with its unique presale structure, aggressive token burns, and skyrocketing potential returns. Meanwhile, Broccoli and TST are also making headlines with their latest updates. Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is heating up as it reaches its 15th phase, known as Nippy Nook. With its price currently at $0.000079, early investors are looking at a massive potential ROI of over 10,027.85% when APC launches at $0.008. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Broccoli, and TST. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Magic: Token Burns to Skyrocket Value Scarcity fuels demand, and Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), one of the top cryptos to join for the long term, is leveraging this principle through its strategic token burn mechanism. Each week during the presale, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation, reinforcing scarcity. At the end of the presale, any remaining tokens will also be burned, fostering a deflationary model that enhances investor value over time. All transactions related to token burns are publicly recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency. This unique approach builds trust while setting APC apart from other meme coins. With a rapidly shrinking supply and an increasing number of investors joining in, the question is—will you secure your position before the supply tightens further? Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Reaches Nippy Nook – The Clock Is Ticking! The journey of Arctic Pablo Coin continues, with Nippy Nook marking the 15th phase of its presale adventure. Currently priced at just $0.000079, APC offers an unparalleled entry point before its value skyrockets to its launch price of $0.008. The numbers speak volumes—over $1.96 million raised so far, and interest keeps growing. Unlike traditional presales divided into fixed stages, Arctic Pablo meme Coin presale moves through different locations, creating an immersive experience. Investors who act now can still buy in at an incredibly low price before APC ventures to its next stop. The token burn mechanism, the high 66% APY staking rewards, and referral incentives make this presale an unmatched opportunity. Once Arctic Pablo Coin leaves Nippy Nook, prices will surge again. Will you take advantage of this window before it closes? Broccoli Coin Leads Binance Vote-to-List Campaign Broccoli Coin, a meme token inspired by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s (CZ) dog, is making waves in the crypto space. It currently leads Binance’s “vote to list” campaign with 50% support, positioning itself for a potential listing. CZ has also supported merging various Broccoli-themed tokens to strengthen market impact. The coin is gaining traction, with a current price of $0.001423 and a 24-hour trading volume of $97,435.74. This surge highlights the growing influence of community-driven tokens in the market. TST’s New Partnership Propels Its Market Presence TST has recently announced a strategic partnership with a major DeFi platform, further strengthening its utility and adoption. This collaboration will allow TST holders to access new staking options and liquidity pools, enhancing the token’s long-term viability. With the market responding positively to this news, TST’s trading activity has experienced an uptick, reinforcing its potential as a strong investment prospect. Final Words The race is on, and Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale momentum shows no signs of slowing down. With its innovative deflationary model, strong staking rewards, and a presale structure that keeps investors engaged, APC is drawing significant attention. Meanwhile, Broccoli’s AI-driven trading signals and TST’s strategic partnership add further excitement to the crypto landscape. With Arctic Pablo Coin’s current phase set to end soon, this could be the last opportunity to get in at an unbeatable price. As APC moves through its final presale locations, the clock is ticking for investors to secure their positions before the inevitable price surge.

IntoTheBlock says on the social media platform X that the market cap of stablecoins has risen to a new all-time high. While the analytics firm notes that a growing stablecoin market cap is a sign that traders are selling their coins in favor of dollar-pegged crypto assets, it also indicates that a massive amount of capital is ready to be deployed once conditions turn bullish. “The stablecoin market cap keeps growing, recently surpassing $220 billion. While these tokens are widely used to sidestep volatility, it’s hard to ignore how all that liquidity could become the spark for the next market upswing once sentiment flips bullish.” Source: IntoTheBlock/X One stablecoin on IntoTheBlock’s radar is Ripple USD ( RLUSD ), a dollar-pegged crypto asset launched just a few months ago. “Ripple’s new RLUSD stablecoin is gaining traction. With a circulating supply reaching $160 million and a growing number of Ethereum mainnet addresses holding it, RLUSD appears positioned to become a notable player in the stablecoin space.” Source: IntoTheBlock/X Looking at Bitcoin, the insights firm says deep-pocketed investors are gobbling up BTC after trimming their exposure for almost a year. “Bitcoin whale balances have been trending downward for nearly a year, but March data hints at a possible reversal. Whales now hold around 62,000 more BTC than they did at the start of the month, indicating renewed accumulation.” Source: IntoTheBlock/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $84,039.

42207019,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=698267,1742730348,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42207019.jpeg,Congress fears Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E will push young talent away from federal jobs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/congress-fears-d-o-g-e-talent-federal-jobs/,"Federal agencies across the country are losing workers by the thousands, and Congress is warning that Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E is driving the next generation of talent straight into the private sector, according to NBC News. Lawmakers say President Trump’s layoffs and hiring freeze, carried out by the Department of Government Efficiency, are not just gutting the system now—they’re cutting off its future. Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator from Virginia, said on Capitol Hill that the Trump-Musk cuts are blocking fresh talent from ever stepping foot into federal service. “The recruiting challenge they’re creating for themselves is enormous,” Tim said. “I don’t think that’s an accidental byproduct. I think that’s a known consequence — and they don’t care.” Virginia holds hundreds of thousands of federal jobs, and Tim said those workers are being tossed aside with zero regard for long-term hiring needs. Chris Van Hollen, a Democratic senator from Maryland, said the scorched-earth approach from D.O.G.E is pushing young people away before they even get started. Maryland is packed with civil servants, especially around D.C., and Chris said they’re now surrounded by fear and chaos. “I’m very worried that this will discourage talented young people from joining the federal service,” he said. Chris, whose parents both worked in government, said young people used to enter federal jobs to serve the country. “With the Musk-Trump approach, they’re effectively terrorizing the federal civil service,” he said . Even Don Bacon, a Republican congressman from Nebraska, said the operation has gone too far. “DOGE has been good for showing where our money is being spent and some of the stupid projects that were funded,” Don said. “But it has been too rash in the firings. Better analysis needed to be done. It’s not efficient to fire someone and then rehire.” Don said it’s basic logic. “Measure twice, cut once,” he said. Students drop government careers after D.O.G.E cuts Georgetown University students near D.C. are already dropping federal work from their career plans. One student, who asked not to be named because she wasn’t allowed to speak to reporters, said her internship at a science agency was supposed to become a full-time job after graduation in May. That plan collapsed after D.O.G.E layoffs hit her department, and the federal hiring freeze locked the door shut. “I loved the work that I did so much and I could feel like it had a tangible impact on real people,” the student said. She had wanted to go into the public sector, unlike most Georgetown students who head to private firms. But now? “I’m probably just going to try to pivot into consulting, even though it’s kind of late, or do tech.” She said she’s holding out “a little bit of hope” that the freeze will end in April. “But I know that is probably not realistic.” This kind of shift is exactly what Tim and Chris say they’re worried about. The D.O.G.E policies are pushing skilled college students out of public service and into high-paying jobs at crypto and tech companies instead. Tim said the administration is making no effort to reverse this trend. Chris said this isn’t some silent result. He said it’s deliberate. Russ Vought says civil servants should feel ‘trauma’ Russ Vought, who now leads the Office of Management and Budget under President Trump, said the goal is to hit government workers emotionally. In a 2023 speech, Russ said: “We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.” The video of that speech was obtained by ProPublica and has since circulated among lawmakers. Chris responded to that quote by saying, “Russ Vought was quite open about it. Unfortunately, this will have a huge dampening effect on the ability to recruit.” When reporters asked the White House about these concerns, Liz Huston, a spokesperson, didn’t mention young professionals or hiring freezes at all. She pointed to the 2,000+ political appointees Trump has installed in under two months. “Never before in history has an administration hired such a huge number of qualified, capable, and America-first Patriots in such little time,” Liz said in a written statement. She named Russ, Tom Homan, Sean Parnell, Harmeet Dhillon, Kash Patel, Kari Lake, Brent Bozell, and Jay Bhattacharya as examples of “incredible MAGA warriors.” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, also said the Trump administration has been busy filling top jobs. She said 281 appointees had already been confirmed by the Senate, with another 280 in the process, and that all political jobs at the White House, Office of Personnel Management, and General Services Administration are already filled. But those are just the political slots. Most of the federal workforce—over 3 million people—are career civil servants, not political picks. Those are the ones now being shut out or pushed out. Trump shuts down Presidential Management Fellows Program While firing workers and freezing hires, President Trump also signed an executive order on February 19 to kill off one of the only remaining federal career pipelines. The Presidential Management Fellows Program, launched almost 50 years ago, pairs grad students with government agencies. These aren’t just interns. These are people trained to become future leaders in public service. The Office of Personnel Management announced the “talent management system” will be shut down by the end of this week. That means all future placement is canceled. Chris said the message is clear: “So I guess they don’t want young people serving the country. I mean, that’s the message they’re sending.” Arati Prabhakar, who was director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy under Biden, said D.O.G.E is telling people with technical skills and science degrees to “pound sand.” Arati used to lead DARPA under Obama and said it took hard work to bring in tech talent. People left better salaries in the private sector to solve big national problems, and that was only possible because federal jobs gave them the freedom to work at scale. “It takes so much nurturing to find those few people, and then they make such a difference, and that’s what’s being disrupted,” Arati said. She now lives in Silicon Valley and recently reconnected with a former White House intern who’s about to graduate from Stanford with a computer science degree and deep AI knowledge. That student wants to enter public service and already has an offer. But now she’s doubting it. “She doesn’t know if it’s going to stick in this current environment,” Arati said. “And you know what DOGE’s actions are doing? Those actions are telling these immensely talented people who want to serve our country — they’re telling them to pound sand.” Arati said that’s the opposite of what should be happening if the government wants to bring in the best and brightest.

Critical Levels to Monitor,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-surges-will-2-50-breakout-trigger-a-massive-rally-critical-levels-to-monitor/,"XRP has been experiencing significant price swings, driven by legal developments and technical market factors. Currently trading at $2.40, XRP recently surged to $2.60 after the U.S. SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple. However, profit-taking quickly followed, leading to a price correction. Key Resistance and Support Levels Resistance: $2.50 – A strong barrier preventing further gains. If XRP breaks this level , a rally toward $4 could be in play. Support: $1.95 – If selling pressure increases, XRP may retest this lower support level. A decisive move above $2.50 could signal the start of a strong bullish trend, while failure to hold above $2.00 might result in deeper corrections. Market Sentiment and Price Predictions Short-Term Outlook: XRP could break out toward $4, provided it maintains momentum above resistance levels. Mid-Term Forecast: XRP could reach $7–$10 if broader market conditions remain favorable. Long-Term Prediction: Bullish projections suggest a potential price of $27, but such forecasts remain speculative and depend on market trends, adoption, and regulatory clarity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors Influencing XRP’s Price Regulatory Developments: The resolution of Ripple’s legal battle has provided temporary relief, but future regulations will impact XRP’s trajectory. Market Sentiment: Investor confidence plays a major role in XRP’s price movement. Increased adoption or partnerships could drive further gains. Technical Trends: XRP must maintain strong support levels to sustain an upward trend. XRP’s price remains volatile as it reacts to legal victories and market dynamics. The key level to watch is $2.50 , as a breakout could lead to sustained bullish momentum. Investors should monitor price movements and regulatory updates for informed decision-making.

Analysts project a long-term target of $0.60, fueled by bullish technical indicators and a recovering crypto market. Yet reaching $1, $2, or $3 in 2025 remains improbable for the meme coin. Market capitalization hurdles, reliance on speculative trading, and competition from utility-driven projects cloud its path to higher valuations. As DOGE’s momentum hinges on broader market trends, investors are shifting focus to assets blending innovation with tangible financial mechanisms—a niche where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly ascending. Dogecoin’s ceiling and market realities Dogecoin’s 5% daily gain reflects renewed interest, but its $0.60 forecast underscores the gap between current prices and aspirational targets. The meme coin’s $25 billion market cap would need to multiply 18-fold to touch $3—a feat requiring unprecedented capital inflow. Technical signals like the MACD’s bullish crossover and rising Chaikin Money Flow index suggest short-term strength, yet these metrics falter against macro challenges. DOGE’s lack of inherent utility and dependence on social sentiment further dent its ability to sustain triple-digit growth. While the token may test $0.20 resistance, scaling beyond this demands a structural shift unlikely to materialize by 2025. Mutuum Finance presale momentum builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing attention as its third presale phase accelerates, having raised $4.5 million from 6,400 holders. Priced at $0.02, the token has already seen over half of Phase 3 allocations claimed ahead of a 25% hike to $0.025 in the next stage. Early participants stand to gain a 200% return at its $0.06 exchange listing, with post-launch projections eyeing $1.50—a 7,400% surge from the current tier. This growth trajectory stems from MUTM’s decentralized lending model, which generates consistent buy pressure through revenue-driven token redistribution. Unlike speculative assets, the platform enables users to borrow against collateralized assets, blending DeFi functionality with investor incentives. Sustainable mechanics drive demand Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself through mtTokens, which accrue value as interest-bearing deposits. By channeling a portion of platform fees into MUTM buybacks, the protocol ensures ongoing demand while rewarding long-term stakers. This mechanism, paired with an upcoming Certik audit, positions the project as a high-viability contender in volatile markets. The audit’s pending completion—announced soon via social channels—adds a layer of trust absent in many presale ventures. Timing the entry window With Phase 3 filling swiftly, the window for securing MUTM at $0.02 is narrowing. Investors entering now lock in a 25% gain before Phase 4 activates, alongside exponential post-launch potential. The project’s tokenomics avoid inflationary pitfalls by aligning supply with user engagement, a contrast to meme coins’ reliance on hype cycles. As Dogecoin grapples with scalability limits, Mutuum Finance’s structured approach offers a calculable alternative—merging DeFi utility with presale urgency. Market dynamics favor assets bridging innovation and investor returns. While Dogecoin’s community-driven rallies may persist, its ceiling remains tethered to speculative forces. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a pivot point, leveraging real-world applications to convert transient interest into sustained growth. Those bypassing this presale risk missing a 200% uplift at launch—and far higher gains as the platform’s adoption accelerates. Act before phase 3 concludes Mutuum Finance’s presale traction signals a turning point for pragmatic crypto investments. With the smart contract audit underway and exchange listings imminent, the project is transitioning from early-access opportunity to mainstream viability.

For the past 11 days, ADA has been fluctuating between $0.70 and $0.74, now testing the lower boundary of this range. ADA’s Current Price Momentum Besides this consolidation, ADA’s current price is also supported by an ascending trendline that has been intact since the beginning of March 2025. The asset is currently trading near $0.71 and has registered a modest price surge of over 0.50% in the past 24 hours. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Key Levels According to expert technical analysis, ADA is already forming a symmetrical triangle pattern alongside its ongoing consolidation. If the asset breaks out of this pattern and closes a four-hour candle above the $0.74 level, there is a strong possibility it could breach the consolidation and surge by 15% to reach the $0.85 mark. Source: Trading View As of now, the asset holds the potential to rise by 3%, meaning it could easily reach the $0.736 level. This prediction applies to a lower time frame. However, on a higher time frame, ADA’s daily chart suggests that a major rally will only begin once the asset closes a daily candle above the $0.85 level. With the ongoing bearish market sentiment and an unclear pattern, traders and investors seem to be participating less in ADA, resulting in a record drop in trading volume, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Santiment . Source: Santiment Data reveals that the asset’s trading volume is at its lowest since the beginning of 2025.

42207903,https://invezz.com/?p=2631836,1742730892,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,3 high-ROI altcoins that will beat Dogecoin (DOGE) and make you rich in the next 6 months,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/23/3-high-roi-altcoins-that-will-beat-dogecoin-doge-and-make-you-rich-in-the-next-6-months/,"Dogecoin’s (DOGE) volatility and reliance on social media hype have left investors exploring alternatives with stronger fundamentals. Three altcoins—Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe Coin (PEPE), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—are now emerging as high-ROI contenders. Analysts highlight SHIB’s technical patterns, PEPE’s bullish indicators, and MUTM’s presale momentum as catalysts for exponential gains. Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out, already raising $4.5 million in its presale and attracting 6,400 holders. With Phase 3 nearly 60% sold out and a 25% price hike imminent, MUTM’s trajectory suggests it could dominate the crypto market in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) eyes long-term breakout amid falling wedge formation Shiba Inu (SHIB) is navigating a prolonged bearish trend, down 62% from its November peak. Yet analysts identify a symmetrical triangle pattern on Shiba Inu (SHIB) monthly chart, hinting at a potential 17x surge for Shiba Inu (SHIB). A breakout could propel Shiba Inu (SHIB) from $0.00001260 to $0.0002141, though this might unfold over years. Short-term optimism stems from a falling wedge pattern on daily charts, signaling a possible 161% jump to $0.000033 for Shiba Inu (SHIB) if resistance breaks. Despite these signals, Shiba Inu (SHIB)reliance on broader market rebounds and ETF approvals leaves its near-term prospects uncertain. Pepe Coin’s inverse head and shoulders signals 40% rally Pepe Coin (PEPE) has rebounded 35% from yearly lows, trading at $0.000007181. Analysts observe an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, suggesting a 40% Pepe Coin (PEPE) rally toward $0.000010. Increased Pepe Coin (PEPE) exchange outflows—down 1.21% this week—signal investors are moving tokens to private wallets, reducing sell pressure. Futures open interest has surged 8% to $237.9 million, reflecting growing speculative interest. While Pepe Coin’s (PEPE) double-bottom formation and bullish divergence in RSI/MACD indicators strengthen its case, a drop below $0.0000053 could invalidate the uptrend, leaving its momentum fragile. Mutuum Finance presale surge fuels 200% pre-launch gains While Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) hinge on technical reversals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leveraging tangible demand. The project’s Phase 3 presale is advancing rapidly, with tokens priced at $0.02 and over 60% already sold. Investors securing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now will realize a 200% profit at its $0.06 exchange listing—a figure embedded in its tokenomics. Post-launch, analysts project a climb to $3.50, translating to a 17,400% ROI. This forecast stems from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) buy-and-distribute model, which uses platform revenue to repurchase tokens, creating sustained demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) infrastructure further differentiates it. The protocol enables decentralized lending via overcollateralized loans, minimizing default risks while offering dynamic interest rates. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) mtTokens system—where deposits like ETH convert into interest-bearing mtETH—provides passive income streams, appealing to long-term holders. Additionally, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is finalizing a Certik audit, with results to be announced on official channels, enhancing trust. Securing early access before phase 4 price hike Phase 3’s $0.02 entry window is closing swiftly, with the next stage set to increase prices by 25% to $0.025. Early Mutuum Finance (MUTM) participants not only lock in lower costs but also position themselves for compounded gains post-launch. Unlike meme coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) utility-driven model and audit-backed security offer stability amid the crypto market’s turbulence. Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin present speculative opportunities for investors seeking assets that blend innovation with ROI potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, merges DeFi utility with presale urgency, making it a calculated entry into high-growth crypto.

However, earlier market losses mean the altcoin experienced a 1.38% decline in the past seven days. Amid this volatile price action, renowned market expert Ali Martinez postulates the altcoin is in imminent danger of a major price fall. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Pounce On The Dip, Snag $236 Million In ETH Bearish Flag Forms On JUP Chart: Key Support To Watch In an X post on Saturday, Martinez reports the formation of a potential bearish flag on the JUP 4-hour chart. The bearish flag is a continuation pattern that hints at a sustained downtrend. It follows a prolonged price fall i.e. the flagpole which was seen in early March when prices of Jupiter fell from $0.83 to $0.48 in seven days. The bearish flag is a brief period of consolidation in an upward or sideways direction that comes after this price decline and is usually followed by a downward trend continuation. In the case of Jupiter, the flag is represented by prices moving between $0.56 (resistance) and $0.50 (support). Therefore, a decisive price fall below the $0.50 region would validate the bearish flag resulting in a substantial price decline. Based on the length of the initial flagpole, Martinez predicts JUP prices could slide as low as $0.41, suggesting a potential 21.15% decline from current market prices. On the other hand, a strong price breakout above the resistance at $0.56 could invalidate the bearish flag suggesting a a potential reversal. In this case, Jupiter could rise to around $0.83 at which lies the next significant price resistance. Related Reading: Global M2 Vs. Bitcoin Shows Bullishness As Analyst Sets ‘Blast Off’ Date, Here’s When JUP Price Outlook Amid a general crypto market correction, JUP has suffered a substantial price loss over the last month losing 30.15% of its value. This development has occurred despite efforts by the Jupiter exchange to manage the token’s supply by using 50% of protocol fees to implement a massive buy-back strategy. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the token’s daily chart shows a recent rebound from the oversold region indicating price reversal could be on the horizon. According to analysts from Coincodex, general sentiment in the JUP market remains bearish with the Fear & Greed Index of 32 suggesting investors are highly cautious about engaging the market at the moment. However, these analysts are strongly confident in JUP’s bullish potential, projecting a price gain of 227% in the next month. At press time, Jupiter continues to trade at $0.52 following a price increase of 3.50% as earlier stated. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume has increased by 21.78% and is valued at $42.57 million.

42207904,https://invezz.com/?p=2631846,1742731222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Solana killer Mutuum Finance (MUTM) set to skyrocket past SOL into the top 10 cryptos,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/23/solana-killer-mutuum-finance-mutm-set-to-skyrocket-past-sol-into-the-top-10-cryptos/,"Solana is a lading Layer 1 project currently ranked in the top 5 of the crypto ranking. SOL has had recent success reaching a new ATH of $295 in Jan, 2025. However, meme pump and dumps within the SOL ecosystem has led to investors fleeing and seeking an alternative to invest their money, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has surged past $4.5 million in presale fundraising, capturing attention as its third phase accelerates toward a sell-out. Over 6,400 holders have already secured tokens at $0.02, anticipating a 25% price jump to $0.025 in the next phase. With Phase 3 halfway filled, momentum builds for a project analysts now tip to challenge Solana (SOL), which also faces mounting headwinds amid weakening institutional demand and macroeconomic turbulence. As Solana’s price wobbles near $124—down 57% from January highs—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as a high-yield alternative, blending structured tokenomics with real-world DeFi utility. Presale frenzy as investors chase exponential gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters its third presale stage with urgency, offering tokens at $0.02 before a planned jump to $0.025. Early participants stand to lock in a 200% return at launch, where MUTM will list at $0.06. Beyond this baseline surge, projections place the token between $1.80 and $3.50 post-launch, driven by its buy-and-distribute mechanism that funnels platform revenue into token repurchases. This model creates sustained demand, countering volatility seen in rivals like Solana. While SOL struggles with fading CME futures interest and recession fears, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leverages its lending protocols to anchor growth. Over 50% of Phase 3 allocations have vanished in days, signaling a race to secure tokens before the next price hike. DeFi mechanics fuel optimism amid market uncertainty Unlike Solana’s speculative swings, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates tangible financial tools. Its mtTokens system—where deposits like ETH or DAI generate interest-bearing assets—provides passive income streams while maintaining liquidity. Borrowers access funds through overcollateralized loans, minimizing default risks and stabilizing the ecosystem. A peer-to-peer lending feature further diversifies utility, accommodating niche assets like meme coins. These mechanics contrast sharply with Solana’s recent 97% crash from 2021 peaks, a pattern now repeating as SOL flirts with $110 support. Should that level break, analysts warn of a slide toward $30—a 90% collapse from current prices. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), meanwhile, avoids such fragility via revenue-driven token burns and staker rewards, ensuring buy pressure outpaces sell-offs. Audits and roadmap cement credibility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) edges closer to finalizing a Certik audit, a milestone set to bolster investor confidence. Once completed, the audit’s results will surface across official channels, reinforcing transparency. This step follows rapid presale traction, where early backers have already positioned for triple-digit returns. With Phase 3 allocations dwindling, the project readies for exchange listings and ecosystem expansions, including an overcollateralized stablecoin. Such developments could propel MUTM into the crypto top 10, displacing faltering giants like Solana. As Solana grapples with macroeconomic headwinds and fading institutional interest, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a calculated pivot for investors seeking insulated growth. Its presale structure—offering entry at just $0.02 before a $0.06 debut—creates a rare low-risk, high-reward window. With Phase 3 nearing capacity and a Certik audit pending, the clock ticks for those aiming to capitalize before the next surge. Secure your position before the leap Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has transformed presale participation into a strategic advantage, blending DeFi innovation with investor-centric tokenomics. As Solana’s decline accelerates, this project charts a divergent path—one where utility and demand converge to fuel sustained gains.

42207513,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=698283,1742731225,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42207513.jpeg,Social Security chief walks back shutdown threat after D.O.G.E ruling,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/social-security-chief-after-d-o-g-e-ruling/,"Leland Dudek, the acting head of the Social Security Administration (SSA), backed off a threat to shut down the entire agency. His threat came right after a federal judge blocked staff tied to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) from getting into millions of Americans’ private data. Then the judge told him to relax. So, he did. Judge Ellen Hollander granted a request from union groups to stop what she called a “fishing expedition” by D.O.G.E staff. She said the agency had no good reason to search through people’s Social Security numbers, medical records, birth and marriage certificates, credit card details, bank info, and tax filings. Hollander said D.O.G.E didn’t offer even one valid reason to get full access to SSA systems. “They never identified or articulated even a single reason,” she said in court. Dudek threatens to lock out all SSA workers After that ruling, Dudek told Bloomberg News he was going to follow the judge’s order to the letter and kick everyone off the system. He said the court never made clear who counted as a D.O.G.E affiliate, so he’d assume it meant everybody. “My anti-fraud team would be D.O.G.E affiliates. My IT staff would be D.O.G.E affiliates,” he said. “As it stands, I will follow it exactly and terminate access by all SSA employees to our IT systems.” He went further: “Really, I want to turn it off and let the courts figure out how they want to run a federal agency.” So that was the mood on Thursday. By Friday, everything flipped. Judge Hollander came back with two letters calling Dudek’s interpretation “inaccurate.” She said her decision had “no bearing on ordinary operations at SSA.” She also clarified that only people directly working with D.O.G.E were affected. “A D.O.G.E Affiliate is defined in the Order as a person working on or implementing the D.O.G.E agenda,” she wrote. That same day, Dudek issued a statement walking it all back. “The Court issued clarifying guidance about the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) related to D.O.G.E employees and D.O.G.E activities at the Social Security Administration (SSA). Therefore, I am not shutting down the agency,” he said. “SSA employees and their work will continue under the TRO.” His threat came just weeks after former SSA Commissioner Michelle King stepped down. She quit after refusing to give D.O.G.E access to sensitive government data. That battle has been going on across the federal government. Judges block D.O.G.E moves at other agencies February saw a similar case. A federal judge stopped D.O.G.E staff from entering systems at the Treasury Department. That came after 19 state attorneys general filed a lawsuit, arguing D.O.G.E didn’t have the legal power to look through those records. Another D.O.G.E employee did manage to get partial access to anonymized taxpayer data at the IRS, but that was only after the agency and the staffer made a deal. So far, D.O.G.E has been aggressive. They’ve tried to cut agency budgets and staff, fast. The Internal Revenue Service is facing a proposed 20% staff cut by May 15, according to a CNN report published on March 13. On top of that, D.O.G.E tried to shut down the United States Institute of Peace, a nonprofit funded by Congress. The push has triggered backlash—especially around Tesla, where Elon Musk holds a big stake. The company is now the face of protests happening across the country. Tesla Takedown grows louder every week The “Tesla Takedown” movement is now in its fifth week. Nearly 90 Tesla showrooms across the country were hit with demonstrations Saturday. The message from the movement is simple: “Sell your Teslas” and “Dump your stock.” Musk’s control of D.O.G.E and his effort to tear down federal infrastructure has become the main reason behind the campaign. The movement was started by Alex Winter, a filmmaker and actor, and Joan Donovan, a journalism professor at Boston University. Now, there are organizers in 28 states and Washington, D.C. Protesters keep showing up with signs like “Sell your swasticar” and “Honk if you hate Elon.” Donovan told CNN, “There’s no walk of life that D.O.G.E doesn’t touch. That’s reflected in the diversity of people that come to these protests.” The crowd is growing too. One of the protests took place in Rockville, Maryland on Saturday at 11 a.m. ET. It drew over 400 people, matching last week’s turnout but showing a big jump from when the movement began. Karen Metchis, a 72-year-old who used to work at the Environmental Protection Agency, was there. She said this protest was much larger than the first one she went to. “It lets the public know that they’re not alone in their feelings,” Karen said. “Hopefully it builds a mass movement where it’s just not tenable for the Trump administration to continue doing what they’re doing.” Right now, D.O.G.E has pissed off more than just bureaucrats and union lawyers. From judges to retirees, from IRS staff to Tesla owners, the war over data and power is hitting every corner. No one’s buying that this is about “efficiency” anymore.

Bitcoin saw renewed ETF inflows and a minor purchase by MicroStrategy, while developments like PumpSwap’s DEX launch and Cosmos EVM open-sourcing marked key tech strides. Meanwhile, Bithumb was raided over alleged fund misuse, and new ETF filings for Solana, Avalanche, and SUI signaled growing institutional interest in altcoins. Bitcoin Michael Saylor's Strategy has acquired 130 additional Bitcoin worth $10.7 million—its smallest BTC purchase to date—funded through preferred stock sale amid its broader $42 billion capital raise plan. After the worst period of persistent net outflows for the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs since they were launched in January 2024, a 4-day run of net inflows has potentially started to reverse this trend. DeFi Solana-based memecoin platform Pump.fun has launched its own decentralized exchange, PumpSwap , aiming to streamline token trading and reduce user friction while intensifying competition with Raydium. Technology The Interchain Foundation has funded the open-sourcing of evmOS—now branded Cosmos EVM —as the standard Ethereum Virtual Machine framework for the Cosmos ecosystem. Business South Korean prosecutors have raided Bithumb’s offices over allegations that former CEO Kim Dae-sik misused company funds for personal real estate, adding further complications to the exchange’s IPO ambitions. Volatility Shares has launched the first Solana futures-based ETFs in the U.S., offering traditional investors exposure to the sixth-largest cryptocurrency amid growing institutional interest. Former and current Trump Media & Technology Group executives are launching a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) to raise $179 million to purchase a US-based cryptocurrency or blockchain firm. Investment manager VanEck registered a trust company for an Avalanche (AVAX) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Delaware. Canary Capital has submitted an S-1 filing with the SEC to launch the first spot ETF tracking the SUI token, marking a key development in the push for altcoin-backed investment products. Security Microsoft has uncovered a stealthy remote access trojan, StilachiRAT , engineered to steal cryptocurrency credentials and sensitive system data using advanced evasion and persistence techniques. Regulation The United States Treasury Department has lifted the sanctions imposed on Tornado Cash and removed it from its global blacklist after sanctioning the crypto mixing tool for money laundering in 2022.

Per our technical indicators, ALGO’s bear run is slowing, with the fear and greed index showing a fear sentiment among investors. Data analysis shows that activity on decentralized finance applications is dropping, with the charts showing it is now in a consolidation phase. Why is ALGO down? ALGO is dropping from previous highs set in the last quarter of 2024, the drop could be attributed to the crypto market’s correction, which saw Bitcoin drop below $99,000. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can algo reach $100 dollars? At $100, Algorand’s market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorancd is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025? For the last month of 2025, ALGO’s price will range between $0.2960 and $0.4313. The average price for the period will be $0.3900. Is ALGO a good investment?

Algorand historic price sentiment Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million, while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to Coinmarketcap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It now trades at $0.13. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January, $0.35 in February, and $0.21 in March.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-23 12:20:00

Bitcoin's ( BTC ) price may see more downside next week unless it manages to close the week above the $85,000 psychological mark, according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. “Bitcoin’s relief rally after the FOMC meeting and lower CPI readings has analysts eyeing a weekly close above $85,000, as critical for resuming upside momentum,” Lee told Cointelegraph, adding: “A close above this level could prevent a drop to $76,000 and signal strength, while $87,000 would provide even clearer bullish confirmation.

Instead of short-term fluctuations, investors should pay attention to long-term Bitcoin holder accumulation to gauge BTC’s trend, the analyst told Cointelegraph, adding: “Long-term holders continue to stack, as we’ve seen in on-chain data, the accumulation by these holders, quietly building since the dip is what we should be paying attention to.” Long-term holders resumed their Bitcoin accumulation at the beginning of February, buying over $21 billion worth of Bitcoin since.

According to CoinMarketCap data, PancakeSwap ( CAKE ) has seen an impressive 58.04% increase in activity over the past week. The BNB ( BNB ) Chain-based DEX now accounts for 29.18% of all decentralized exchange trading, with a weekly volume of $14.168 billion and a daily trading volume (TVL) of $1.67 billion. PancakeSwap flipped Uniswap to become the top DEX, fueled by lower fees, an easy interface, and memecoin hype on BSC. Recent stats: PancakeSwap hit $213.6M daily volume vs. Uniswap's $43.7M. This leap underscores PancakeSwap's knack for pulling in users and boosting engagement.… — Alva (@AlvaApp) March 23, 2025 This surge in activity has helped PancakeSwap to overtake Ethereum ( ETH )-based Uniswap ( UNI ), which experienced a 50.56% decline in weekly trading activity. The trading volume has dropped to $8.611 billion despite maintaining a higher TVL of $3.93 billion. Solana-based Raydium saw a 24.75% drop While PancakeSwap gained trading volume, other major platforms experienced substantial declines. Raydium saw a 24.75% decrease in weekly activity, while Meteora and Fluid dropped by 33.03% and 52.76% respectively. PancakeSwap’s success could be because of multiple factors, including BNB Chain’s lower transaction fees compared to Ethereum, faster confirmation times, and the platform’s user-friendly interface. The exchange has particularly benefited from surging interest in BNB Chain-based meme coins. You might also like: Will TRX follow Bitcoin?

New crypto disrupting decentralized finance through DeFi lending,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/23/can-mutuum-finance-mutm-soar-45x-by-mid-2025-new-crypto-disrupting-decentralized-finance-through-defi-lending/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has ignited fervent speculation across the crypto market as its presale races toward Phase 4. Over $4.5 million has flooded into the project since its presale launch, with 6,400 investors securing tokens at $0.02 during Phase 3—a price point poised to jump 25% to $0.025 once the next stage begins. More than 60% of Phase 3 tokens have already been claimed, reflecting surging confidence in a protocol blending decentralized lending with mechanisms designed to amplify token value. Analysts now question whether MUTM could skyrocket 45-fold by mid-2025, fueled by a lending model generating organic demand and a buyback system curbing sell pressure. Presale Momentum Builds Investor Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capitalizing on a presale structure that rewards early participation. Investors purchasing at the current $0.02 price stand to gain an immediate 25% return once Phase 4 begins, with the token slated to list at $0.06—tripling initial Phase 3 investments. However, projections stretch far beyond launch. The platform’s unique tokenomics, including revenue-driven buybacks and staking rewards, have led experts to forecast a post-launch surge to $3.50 within months. Such a leap would translate to a 17,400% gain from the current presale price, eclipsing returns from most DeFi tokens launched this year. This momentum stems partly from Mutuum Finance’s operational framework. Unlike speculative peers, the protocol enables decentralized lending and borrowing, with users depositing assets like ETH or stablecoins to earn interest. Borrowers access liquidity by locking collateral exceeding loan values—a model minimizing defaults while stabilizing the ecosystem. Each deposit generates mtTokens, which accrue value over time and can be traded or staked elsewhere, weaving MUTM deeper into DeFi’s infrastructure. Tokenomics fueling long-term growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself through a self-reinforcing economic cycle. A portion of platform fees funds continuous MUTM buybacks, with repurchased tokens distributed to mtToken stakers. This mechanism not only incentivizes long-term holding but also creates relentless buy pressure—a contrast to projects reliant solely on hype. Meanwhile, the presale’s phased structure accelerates urgency: each sold-out stage triggers a price hike, compressing the window for discounted entry. The protocol’s recent $100,000 giveaway has further galvanized participation, offering 10 investors $10,000 each for early contributions. Such strategies amplify visibility while anchoring a loyal user base ahead of exchange listings. With only 40% of Phase 3 tokens remaining, the project is nearing a liquidity inflection point. Once listed, the shift from presale scarcity to open-market trading could propel MUTM into a higher valuation tier, particularly as staking rewards and lending activity compound demand. Strategic mechanisms ensure sustained demand While many DeFi tokens struggle with post-launch volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) embeds safeguards against abrupt sell-offs. The buy-and-distribute system ensures a steady stream of tokens flows back to committed stakeholders, aligning investor incentives with platform growth. Additionally, plans for an overcollateralized stablecoin—backed by user-deposited assets—promise to deepen utility, offering a decentralized alternative to entities like Tether or USDC. Security remains a priority, with Mutuum Finance finalizing a smart contract audit by Certik. Results, expected soon, will verify the protocol’s resilience against exploits—a critical step in attracting institutional liquidity. Once confirmed, the audit will be announced via official channels, likely triggering another wave of presale acquisitions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not merely riding DeFi trends; it’s redefining them. By tethering token value to real-world financial utility and systematic buy pressure, the project positions itself for exponential growth. With Phase 3 nearing capacity and a 25% price increase looming, the opportunity for early gains narrows daily. Investors eyeing a 45x surge by mid-2025 are rapidly converting curiosity into action, betting on MUTM’s potential to disrupt decentralized finance permanently. Time to act before phase 3 closes As the clock ticks on Mutuum Finance’s presale, the calculus for investors grows urgent. Current pricing offers a finite window for entry before exchange listings and audit approvals reshape the risk-reward balance. For those seeking assets grounded in utility rather than speculation, MUTM’s blend of innovation and incentives presents a rare convergence.

His firm, Strategy, plans to raise $711 million through a Series A Perpetual STRF offering to boost its BTC reserves. The company already holds 246,000 BTC and now aims to accumulate up to 500,000 BTC—roughly 2.4% of Bitcoin’s total supply. The offering, originally set at 5 million shares, was expanded to 8.5 million due to strong investor demand, with shares priced at $85. Backed by major financial players like Morgan Stanley and Barclays, the move underscores institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value.

Leading the pack was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which added 6,342 BTC—valued at $535.5 million. Fidelity and VanEck followed suit, contributing to rising institutional exposure. On Friday alone, IBIT gained 1,250 BTC ($105.5 million), while Grayscale’s GBTC saw outflows of 260 BTC. Ethereum funds moved in the opposite direction, with $102.9 million in outflows—indicating capital rotation toward Bitcoin. The inflows also coincided with a large transaction of 2,999 BTC worth over $250 million, prompting speculation in crypto circles. However, despite these bullish signals, Bitcoin’s price has remained muted, possibly due to profit-taking and short-term market hesitation.

Bitcoin Consolidates Near $85K as Breakout Looms Technically, Bitcoin is trading just under $84,660, consolidating inside a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart. The $84,000 level has flipped between support and resistance, closely aligned with the 50-period EMA at $84,090. With price action narrowing, BTC appears poised for a breakout. A clean move above $85,800 could trigger a rally toward $87,400 and $89,000. However, repeated failures near the triangle’s top may invite short-term selling.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Dogecoin nears a bottom with indicators pointing to a rally next, Rexas Finance is gaining traction ahead of its exchange debut. Table of Contents Dogecoin price action: Is the bottom finally in? Rexas Finance: The latest trend in asset management Final thoughts Dogecoin (DOGE) has plummeted nearly 77% from its all-time high (ATH). The memecoin has struggled due to market-wide selling pressure, but hints of a possible bottom are developing. A crypto trader feels that DOGE is possibly at its lowest position, with whales accumulating and technical indicators showing bullish signals. On the other hand, Rexas Finance (RXS), a popular $0.20 utility token, is also gaining traction. It provides investors with another option for potentially significant gains in 2025. Dogecoin price action: Is the bottom finally in? Following a prolonged sell-off and falling network activity, Dogecoin has shown notable volatility, currently trading around $0.171. Despite a near 77% dip from its all-time high of $0.7376, Dogecoin has shown some resiliency. The memecoin has risen 2.22% in the past week, indicating that selling pressure may be easing. Moreover, market sentiment toward DOGE has improved. On-chain data shows that whales recently amassed more than 1.7 billion DOGE ($298 million) in just 72 hours. Historically, large-scale buying from whales has frequently indicated the conclusion of a slump. Technical analysts have also identified an oversold Relative Strength Index (RSI). This condition has previously indicated large bottoms for DOGE, implying a possible price rebound. How high can DOGE go from here? The combination of whale accumulation, technical support, and improved sentiment offers a compelling case for a probable bottom. While Dogecoin may experience additional volatility, many traders feel the next massive breakout is coming. According to crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade, DOGE is retesting a crucial resistance trendline at $0.17. A conclusive breach over the resistance zone might propel Dogecoin to $2.80, with a symmetrical triangle breakout pattern having some traders aiming for $5.

The platform enables users to digitize and fractionalize high-value assets such as real estate, private equity, and commodities. Investors who previously required millions of dollars to access elite financial markets can join with minimal investments. RXS presale: No VC dumping and strong retail demand The Rexas Finance presale has reached its last level (level 12), and demand is increasing. 91% of the tokens available for this stage have already been sold. The RXS price rose from $0.03 in Stage 1 to $0.20 in Stage 12, a 566% increase. The total amount raised is $47.3 million, and over 456 million RXS tokens have been sold as of this writing. Rexas Finance declined venture capital (VC) funding to minimize the risk of large-scale token dumping. Unlike many VC-backed enterprises that experience price drops after launch, Rexas Finance offers a more stable market structure for long-term investors. Adoption surges as holders pass 50,000 Rexas Finance has experienced a quick surge in active holders, currently exceeding 50,000. This increase demonstrates the growing confidence and excitement about the initiative. Rexas Finance’s various applications have attracted investors. Beyond tokenization, RXS allows for passive income through staking and yield farming. Token holders can also participate in governance, which enables them to influence platform choices. Rexas Finance operates with a token supply cap of 1 billion, assuring long-term scarcity. Its deflationary mechanism steadily reduces the circulating supply to ensure price stability and long-term value.

The listing price has been confirmed at $0.25. The exchange listings will potentially boost liquidity, market exposure, and adoption. Following the pattern of prior high-profile listings, analysts project that RXS could jump by 100,000% post-launch. With significant presale demand, increasing adoption, and major exchange support, Rexas Finance has positioned itself as one of the top new altcoins of 2025. Final thoughts Dogecoin has been on a long-term decline but may have found the bottom. Whale accumulation and major technical indicators suggest a possible breakout in the coming weeks. A return to earlier highs is possible if DOGE sustains crucial support levels. Rexas Finance is gaining traction for investors seeking the next big opportunity. The presale is nearing completion, and the exchange launch is scheduled for June 19. With excellent fundamentals and great investor interest, Rexas Finance could surge significantly post-launch.

While XRP remains a key player in cross-border payments, Lightchain AI’s rise is capturing attention as a strong contender for future gains. XRP faces market shifts XRP has faced a turbulent journey, battling lawsuits, market forces, and rising competition. In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP sales on secondary markets were not securities, sparking a market frenzy. However, Ripple’s direct institutional sales were still classified as unregistered securities, keeping regulatory pressure intact. Policy shifts continue to shape XRP’s trajectory. A 35% rally followed President Trump’s proposal to include XRP in national reserves, but investor enthusiasm waned after limitations on purchases were revealed. Despite new challengers in the $190 trillion payments industry, XRP has proven its resilience, recently surging to $2.56 after a dip below $2.

Table of Contents XYZVerse could be crypto’s next 100x memecoin Solana: Eyeing key support and resistance levels Conclusion A little-known cryptocurrency is gaining attention for its potential to deliver massive returns. This emerging digital asset could outperform even the most impressive market surges seen in recent years. With whispers of a significant rally on the horizon, investors and enthusiasts are watching closely. XYZVerse could be crypto’s next 100x memecoin The excitement around XYZVerse is undeniable. As the first memecoin dedicated entirely to sports, it uniquely appeals to both sports enthusiasts and crypto investors, creating a powerful crossover community. With an impressive presale and growing investor interest, XYZVerse is rapidly gaining momentum. Not just another meme token Unlike typical memecoins that solely ride social media hype, XYZVerse offers substance behind its appeal. By combining the energetic passion of sports with meme culture’s viral potential, it stands apart from competitors. The presale has seen remarkable progress, offering early adopters tokens at significantly lower prices compared to anticipated valuations. Token prices have surged from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of its $15 million fundraising target already met. Early investors have secured significant discounts, and with the final presale price set at $0.1, it’s attracting considerable attention. Bullish sentiment on XYZ The XYZ token is already listed on CoinMarketCap, where 95% of voters express bullish sentiment for its future. Prominent crypto influencer DanjoCapitalMaster, with nearly 800,000 followers, recently endorsed XYZVerse as a potential “moonshot.” While no investment is guaranteed in crypto, the enthusiasm surrounding XYZVerse speaks volumes.

However, over the past month, the coin has declined by 25.29%, and it’s down 7.96% over six months. While there’s short-term improvement, SOL is still recovering from recent declines. The price is hovering around the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, both near $128. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 43.61 shows SOL is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.6828, hinting at a bearish trend. However, the stochastic at 49.13 suggests potential for upward movement. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is $149. If SOL breaks through this point, it could target the second resistance at $174, an increase of about 35%. On the downside, the nearest support is $100.76. A drop below this could see SOL testing the second support at $76.42, a decline of roughly 32%. Traders are watching these levels to gauge SOL’s next move. Conclusion Though coins like SOL have performed well, XYZVerse could challenge them with its unique sports-meme concept, aiming for massive growth and becoming a community-driven cultural movement.

42210556,https://timestabloid.com/?p=61329,1742733629,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Explains Reason Behind XRP’s Price Stagnation,https://timestabloid.com/expert-explains-reason-behind-xrps-price-stagnation/,"Concerns over XRP’s lack of significant price movement have led to speculation that institutional players may be deliberately suppressing its value. However, market analyst and software engineer Vincent Van Code has dismissed these claims, attributing XRP’s limited growth to market dynamics rather than a hidden agenda. Following Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s recent announcement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had dropped its appeal in the company’s long-standing lawsuit, XRP’s price rose only slightly, from $2.28 to $2.60. Many investors had expected the legal battle’s conclusion to drive a stronger rally , with some anticipating a break above the $3 mark. The lack of a substantial price surge has fueled speculation about potential external influences suppressing XRP’s value. Market Manipulation and Trading Activity Van Code addressed these concerns on social media platform X, explaining that market forces – including automated trading, arbitrage, and large-scale investments – drive price movements, rather than individual actions. He emphasized that XRP’s stagnant price is not the result of a coordinated effort by institutions but rather the typical behavior seen in cryptocurrency markets. If you're wondering why #XRP price isn't pumping, remember when volumes are low, it's easy to manipulate price. I have seen over 500 order (just with naked eye) below 6 XRP. This is not manipulation. I will run a histogram of a full days transaction tomorrow I guarantee it's… pic.twitter.com/IzHNpzV6wP — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) March 20, 2025 One key factor he identified was the impact of low trading volume, which makes it easier for large traders to manipulate price movements. He pointed to numerous small transactions—some involving less than 6 XRP—which he attributed to a practice known as “trade dusting.” This tactic artificially increases trading volume, creating an illusion of liquidity while allowing price control by those placing the orders. Van Code also noted that XRP’s price was influenced by broader market conditions, particularly fluctuations in Bitcoin and Ethereum. He reassured investors that these manipulations were temporary and did not reflect XRP’s long-term potential. Dismissing Claims of Institutional Suppression Amid speculation that institutions influence XRP’s price downward to accumulate more tokens at lower prices, Van Code rejected the theory outright. He explained that the observed price fluctuations were not part of a strategic suppression effort but were driven by trading strategies intended to generate profit. Responding to investor concerns, Van Code highlighted the role of high-frequency trading (HFT) bots, particularly those operated by Binance VIP customers. These traders, he claimed, have access to advanced trading data, allowing them to execute orders faster than retail investors. This advantage enables them to manipulate price movements, engaging in rapid buy-and-sell cycles that raise or depress prices. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, Van Code alleged that most cryptocurrency exchanges rely on Binance for liquidity, further amplifying the influence of its trading practices. While he did not accuse Binance of direct manipulation, he argued that the exchange creates an environment where such activities can thrive. He also pointed out that Binance benefits financially from these market conditions, profiting from trading fees, liquidity incentives, and arbitrage opportunities. The Case for Long-Term Investment Van Code warned that retail investors are unlikely to succeed in short-term trading against high-frequency trading firms due to their significant advantages. Instead, he recommended a long-term holding strategy as the best approach for investors seeking to navigate these market conditions. He explained that when trading volumes are low, market makers receive substantial incentives to provide liquidity, which can make price movements more erratic. As a result, he suggested that holding onto assets over the long term is a more viable strategy, as it minimizes the impact of short-term fluctuations caused by high-frequency trading. While XRP’s price action has not met some investors’ expectations , market analysts emphasize that the asset’s long-term performance will be shaped by broader adoption and ecosystem growth rather than temporary market fluctuations.

42209257,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=698288,1742733637,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42209257.jpeg,"Meta agreed to share revenue with Llama AI model hosts, filing reveals",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meta-revenue-llama-ai-model-hosts-filing/,"A new court filing has revealed that Meta agreed with the hosts of its Llama AI model to share revenue. The filing was submitted by the attorneys of the plaintiff in the company’s ongoing Kadrey v. Meta copyright lawsuit where it was accused of using pirated books to train its artificial intelligence models. The attorneys of the plaintiff have gone a step further to show that Meta shares a percentage of its revenue with the companies hosting its Llama models. The filing also revealed that the company shares a percentage from the funds that the hosting platforms generate from the users of the models. This revelation is coming off the back of a blog post in July 2024, where Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned that the company is not looking at selling access to Meta’s openly available Llama AI models as a business model. However, that is not the case as the company does make some money from Llama using a revenue-sharing formulary, at least according to the unredacted copy of the court filing. Court filing shows Meta’s revenue-sharing arrangement with hosts According to reports, the filing did not discuss specifically the hosts that have the revenue-sharing model with Meta, but the company has a number of high-profile host partners. They include AWS, Databricks, Groq, Dell, Azure, Google Cloud, Nvidia, IBM, Intel, AMD, and Snowflake. Developers are not required to use the Llama models through a host partner, but these models can be downloaded, fine-tuned, and run on a range of different hardwares. However, the hosts provide additional services and tools that ensure that the Llama models are simpler and easier while working. During a previous earnings call in April 2024, Zuckerberg had pitched the possibility of licensing access to Llama models, adding that the company could also monetize the model in other ways. He mentioned avenues like business messaging services and ads in AI interactions but failed to give out any clear specifics. In a recent report, Mark Zuckerberg mentioned that most of the value Meta gets from Llama comes from the improvements that are done on the model from the AI research community. Meta uses the models to also power many products across its platforms and properties, including the Meta AI assistant, Meta AI. “If you’re someone like Microsoft or Amazon or Google and you’re going to be reselling these services, that’s something that we think we should get some portion of the revenue for,” Zuckerberg said. He added that these are the types of deals that the company is now focused on making, adding that steps are being taken in that direction already. In its Q3 2024 earnings call, Zuckerberg also mentioned that he thinks it’s good business if the company goes about it openly. “It makes our products better rather than if we were just on an island building a model that no one was kind of standardizing around in the industry,” he added. Meta continues to battle infringement lawsuit In the argument of the attorney representing the plaintiffs, the fact that Meta may generate revenue in a rather direct way from its Llama models is important because it shows that the firm also facilitated infringement by seeding or uploading their works. The plaintiffs argue that Meta used hidden methods to obtain the e-books in a torrent fashion for training. They also claimed that due to the way torrenting works, it shared the e-books with other torrenters. Meta has been planning to increase its capital expenditure this year, thanks in part to the increase in AI investments. In January, the company announced that it was planning to spend about $60 to $80 billion on CapEx in 2025, doubling the amount that it spent on CapEx in 2024. The funds will primarily go to data centers and growing the AI development team of the company. There are also reports that the company is considering launching a subscription service for Meta AI that will add more capabilities that are still yet to be specified to the assistant.

He thinks BTC prices are about to move faster than ever. Lara Trump Interviews Kevin O’Leary (ABC Network) Ms. Trump, the wife of Trump’s family political scion, Eric Trump, only recently returned to Fox News in February after taking a hiatus while her father-in-law was running for president. Below are five money quotes from the interview, which took place at Pubkey, a crypto bar in New York City. Watch the interview here: 1. The ‘Crypto Cowboy’ Era Is Over “We’re coming out of the cowboy era of cryptocurrency.” O’Leary’s commentary about Bitcoin in 2025 and beyond covered the good, the bad, and the ugly— starting with the ugly. “We’re coming out of the cowboy era of cryptocurrency,” the Shark Tank investor said. “Now all the crypto cowboys are in jail or out of business.” He’s referring to a gaggle of crypto entrepreneurs who ran afoul of the law and got prosecuted by the US government. Alex Mashinsky, Celsius That includes, for example, Alex Mashinsky, the co-founder and former CEO of Celsius Network. He admitted guilt to defrauding investors with assurances of regulatory approvals he did not have and claimed that he was not selling his CEL tokens when he was. Mashinsky could spend 30 years in prison for these convictions. Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of the FTX exchange and its FTT tokens, is serving a 25-year sentence for several counts of fraud. His parents are exploring how to petition President Donald Trump for a pardon or commutation of Bankman-Fried’s sentence. SBF, as he is known online, is still breaking the rules in prison. The administrators reportedly threw him into solitary confinement in March after sneaking a surprise, unapproved interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Changpeng Zhao, Binance In addition to these two convicted fraudsters, Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao finished serving a four-month jail stint in September last year after settling with the DOJ on charges of violating anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. The Wall Street Journal this March alleged that Trump may pardon Zhao for his past compliance flubs, which would allow the software engineer and crypto exchange founder to take a leadership role again at Binance. With the US government established over cryptocurrency, O’Leary predicts that the crypto-friendly administration with Donald Trump at the helm will help make the industry an official new sector of the economy. 2. Crypto Is The Economy’s New ‘12th Sector’ “We have 11 sectors. I believe crypto will be the 12th. There’s a new tone that Trump is putting forward,” O’Leary said. “They’re going to provide regulations.” As a result, “It’s going to become a part of all of the sectors of our economy. We have 11 sectors,” O’Leary added. “I believe crypto will be the 12th.” The 11 market sectors are from the Global Industry Classification Standard by Morgan Stanley and Standard & Poor’s. At this time, the sectors are: IT, Financials, Health care, Consumer staples, Consumer extras, Communications, Industrials, Energy, Utilities, Materials, and Real Estate Generally, many business people, software developers, investment analysts, and commentators say crypto has the potential to disrupt and revolutionize all these segments directly and indirectly. 3. Trump Bitcoin Policies Are Hastening Adoption “This will be the first administration that’s going to say this sector belongs in America.” O’Leary hailed the second Trump term’s possibilities for hastening the adoption and development of the blockchain industry. “This will be the first administration that’s going to say this sector belongs in America,” the Shark Tank investor told Lara Trump in the New York City tech pub. “The development should be here. The technology should be mastered here. We should lead the world in it.” The ABC television shark has been talking for about adoption for years. He has long anticipated the mainstreaming of Bitcoin technology and cryptocurrency platforms. Back in 2021, O’Leary told CryptoPotato institutional investors wanted to play with the blockchain, but were waiting on the regulatory environment to update. With the Trump government stepping in broadly, however, to embrace Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, meanwhile resolving a series of high-profile SEC, DOJ, and CFTC cases against dozens of counterparties in the crypto industry— the US got that update O’Leary was waiting on four years ago. 4. Holding Bitcoin Yourself Is Risky For Newbies “To make it safe, go to an accredited exchange like Coinbase.” To help avoid losses as a result of stolen passwords, forgotten passwords, lost wallets, and other Web3 hazards, O’Leary recommends sticking with a regulated crypto exchange. “If you try and do this on your own in a decentralized wallet,” the investor warned, “Someone will hack you, most likely because you don’t know what you’re doing.” “To make it safe, go to an accredited exchange like Coinbase,” he suggested. “Something that is regulated but also that you can see every day on your phone that has millions of accounts, so it has a real structure.” Intermediate and advanced crypto investors who custory some of their own coins for various reasons take extra steps to secure their crypto wallets and computer networks. 5. ‘Start Small’ And Learn Before Making Big Moves Finally, O’Leary warned Fox News viewers of the investing class to start small when new to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Instead of putting all of your assets or portfolio into Web3 assets, the ABC Network investor extraordinaire suggested starting small, buying a third of a Bitcoin, and giving it time to weather crypto markets’ volatile churn through the financial cycle. “The great thing about digital is that you can put it on your phone.” “Start small,” O’Leary said. “Buy a third of a Bitcoin. Treat it as an investment long term. It’s a new asset form. Think about it as digital gold.” “That’s the way I look at it,” he added. “The great thing about digital is that you can put it on your phone. You can actually see it every day. Watch the price go up and down.” As a parting shot, O’Leary admonished, “It’s learning in small increments and not risking too much.” The post ‘Shark Tank’ Mastermind Has 5 Warnings for the Crypto Curious About Bitcoin appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Kevin O'Leary,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-03-23 12:42:59

Analysts now predict Solana could hit the highly anticipated $1,000 mark by Q4 2025, fueled by growing institutional interest, expanding DeFi ecosystems, and continued blockchain efficiency upgrades. However, Mutuum Finance is stealing the spotlight. MUTM presale is in Phase 3, following the rapid sellout of Phase 2 ahead of schedule. So far, over $4.5 million has been raised, with more than 6400 investors securing their share. Less than 40% of phase 3 is remaining meaning investors have less time to join. The current price sits at $0.02, but demand is rising fast, as Phase 4 will see an increase to $0.025. Early buyers stand to gain 200% when the token launches at $0.06. MUTM could hit $2 with projection after launch. Mutuum Finance presale gains momentum Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending with its innovative dual-lending model, fueling rapid adoption. The project has already attracted over 6400 investors, raising $4.5 million during its presale. Currently priced at $0.02 in Phase 3, the token is set to increase by 25% in Phase 4, presenting a prime opportunity for investors. With strong market demand and unique lending mechanics, analysts consider MUTM one of the most undervalued yet promising DeFi projects, with the potential to exceed $2 post-launch. Mutuum Finance stands out as it supports both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models of lending. The P2C model provides passive income in USDT liquidity pools through smart contract lending and automatic lending. The P2P model provides intermediary-free direct transactions, where users have full control over assets. The hybrid model ensures maximum security, efficiency, and decentralization, positioning Mutuum Finance as a better alternative for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. Establishing a secure and resilient ecosystem As part of stability reinforcement Mutuum Finance will introduce a secured stablecoin tied to US dollars on Ethereum blockchain. The asset uses excess collateral to establish long-term reliability since it goes above the minimum required threshold. The framework includes audited smart contracts alongside an open financial architecture which builds investor confidence as it solves key problems from previous DeFi projects. Incentivizing early investors and strengthening the community Mutuum Finance is actively expanding its community through attractive incentives. A $1 million giveaway will reward 10 participants with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each, while a referral program encourages users to bring in new investors. Additionally, early adopters gain access to exclusive staking pools, governance rights, and VIP updates, fostering long-term engagement with the platform. Sustainable tokenomics for lasting growth The project’s tokenomics strategy is designed with regulated supply and perpetual value increase. By limiting token distribution throughout presale and the incorporation of deflationary components, Mutuum Finance incentivizes scarcity, which can accelerate price appreciation. Its staking model offers higher rewards, driving participation and ensuring the token’s long-term sustainability in the ecosystem. Investors are looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto market, with Solana (SOL) projected to reach $1,000 by Q4 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has quickly emerged as a promising contender, raising over $4.5 million from 6,400+ investors. The Phase 3 presale is selling out fast at $0.02, with Phase 4 bringing a price jump to $0.025. With its groundbreaking dual-lending model and a projected $2 price post-launch, early adopters stand to gain significantly. Don’t miss out, secure your MUTM tokens now before the next price increase. Join the Mutuum Finance presale today.

33767162,[object Object],1742734281,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Best Crypto Presales of 2025 That Could Follow Orca’s 170% Surge,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-presales-of-2025-that-could-follow-orcas-170-surge/,"The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to dramatic surges, but Orca’s ($ORCA) recent 170% rally following its listing on Upbit has turned heads across the crypto community. This impressive ascent underscores the impact that centralized exchange (CEX) listings can have on a token’s visibility and price. And in the middle of a new wave of meme coin and altcoin excitement, it raises a big question: if $ORCA can pump this hard after a listing, what’s stopping other promising tokens from doing the same? Let’s take a look at three of the best crypto presales that might just be next: BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) Mind of Pepe ($MIND) Qubetics ($TICS) Why Listings Matter – And Why Now $ORCA didn’t rally in a vacuum. It climbed nearly 170% in just days after it landed on Upbit, one of South Korea’s largest crypto exchanges. This is a classic pattern in crypto – tokens often surge after being listed on major exchanges, where they gain more attention, liquidity, and access to a broader audience. Combine that with the recent comeback of meme coins, renewed interest in altcoins , and a generally bullish vibe across the markets, and we’ve got the perfect storm for presale tokens to explode when they go live. It’s all about timing – and for these next projects, that time might be soon. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Turning Bitcoin Milestones Into Crypto Rewards BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the few meme coins with real teeth – and real Bitcoin. Built on Ethereum, it’s designed to reward holders not just with speculative hype, but with actual $BTC and $BTCBULL airdrops triggered by Bitcoin’s price milestones. Here’s the core idea: as Bitcoin’s price climbs, BTC Bull Token celebrates by giving back to its holders. When $BTC hits $150K and $200K, holders receive real Bitcoin airdrops. When BTC reaches $250K, there’s a final airdrop – but this time in $BTCBULL tokens. But remember that you need to buy $BTCBULL and hold it in Best Wallet in order to qualify. Between those airdrops, the token undergoes major supply burns at the $125K, $175K, and $225K levels – removing tokens from circulation and creating a deflationary effect. The project kicked off its presale with Bitcoin’s journey to $100K in mind – meaning if you’re getting in now, you’re early. The token price is currently $0.002425, and it has already raised nearly $4M from investors who believe Bitcoin’s next run could be epic. You can buy $BTCBULL using $ETH, $USDT, or $BNB, and integration with Best Wallet makes it easy to track and receive airdrops. There’s also staking with generous APYs for those who prefer a passive earning approach. In short, BTC Bull Token isn’t just about memes – it’s a bullish ride that literally throws BTC at you when Bitcoin breaks new ground. And when it hits CEXs and DEXs? It could charge ahead like a real bull in a bear-battered market. 2. Mind of Pepe ($MIND) – The Meme Coin Powered by AI Intelligence Mind of Pepe ($MIND) is a uniquely positioned AI-powered meme coin that fuses viral internet culture with advanced artificial intelligence – creating what it calls an ‘evolving AI agent .’ And yes, it’s just as wild as it sounds. At its core, $MIND is designed to help investors stay ahead of the crypto curve. Its built-in AI constantly scans influencers, social trends, and meme culture across platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and TikTok. The goal? To uncover emerging tokens and hot narratives before they explode. Think of it as a meme-loving Sherlock Holmes, but with super-fast internet and a mission to make you money. Each holder benefits from real-time insights and updates generated by the project’s AI, giving them a strategic edge in a space where timing is everything. On top of that, the token has strong meme appeal, supported by a satirical narrative that positions Pepe as a misunderstood genius leading a digital revolution. With $7.5M raised in presale and each token priced at $0.0035803, Mind of Pepe is already attracting major attention. As it eyes a CEX or DEX listing, $MIND is positioned to go viral fast – because when memes meet machines, things don’t just move – they explode. 3. Qubetics ($TICS) – Building the Backbone for a Smarter Web3 Qubetics ($TICS) is more than just a token – it’s the foundation for a next-gen Web3 ecosystem. Designed as a Layer 1 blockchain with multi-chain aggregation, Qubetics aims to bring seamless connectivity across fragmented blockchain networks. In plain terms? It wants to be the all-in-one hub where users can access DeFi, NFTs, real-world assets, and more, without bouncing between a dozen different platforms. At its core, Qubetics solves two major problems: blockchain fragmentation and real-world utility. The project does this by integrating multiple chains into a unified ecosystem while also offering features like tokenization of physical assets, a Web3 VPN, and even AI-powered trading analytics. The token fueling this machine is $TICS, which is currently in presale at $0.11819679. So far, Qubetics has raised over $15.3M, making it one of the hottest early-stage projects of 2025. The presale offers a chance to get in before this multi-chain powerhouse hits major exchanges. With use cases stretching from DeFi to digital identity, Qubetics isn’t just promising the future – it’s building it. Once $TICS goes live on CEXs and DEXs, it could rally hard, following the same kind of explosive path we’ve just seen with $ORCA. The Next $ORCA? These Presales Could Be Ready to Pop Orca’s incredible rally shows just how powerful a CEX listing can be – especially during a bullish market full of meme coin and altcoin hype. Presales like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , Mind of Pepe ($MIND), and Qubetics ($TICS) aren’t just hopeful new crypto projects – they’ve raised millions, built interesting tech, and have momentum on their side. Once these new cryptocurrencies land on major exchanges, we might be looking at the next $ORCA-style breakout. As always, don’t forget to do your own research – crypto investments are risky and past performance doesn’t guarantee future results.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-23 12:51:21

According to blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, the whale has moved over $250 million worth of Bitcoin. The transactions were executed within the last 16 hours and show that the value of the holdings has appreciated from approximately $3 million in early 2017 to over $250 million today. Before yesterday’s transfers, the wallet had maintained its Bitcoin ( BTC ) in a single address for more than eight years. $250M BITCOIN WHALE WAKES UP AFTER 8 YEARS A Bitcoin Whale that has held BTC since late 2016 has just moved over $250M in BTC last night. His Bitcoin stack went from $3M in early 2017 to over $250M today – and he’s held Bitcoin on one address for over 8 years. pic.twitter.com/RF1aewYVgy — Arkham (@arkham) March 22, 2025 The transactions, visible on Arkham’s monitoring dashboard, show the funds moving between several wallets labeled as “250M BTC Whale” addresses. Specifically, the transactions took place in two batches about 14-16 hours ago, with each transfer involving approximately 3,000 BTC worth roughly $252 million per transfer. Whale purchased Bitcoin when it was around $1,000 According to the transaction history, the Bitcoin was originally purchased around 2016, when BTC traded at approximately $1,000 or lower. Before these recent movements, the last transactions from these wallets occurred around 8 years ago, as shown by the timestamps in Arkham’s data—the early transactions from 2016 show the accumulation of Bitcoin when the cryptocurrency was less valuable.

In a couple of halvings, they will have a negligible effect on supply,” Greif noted. He suggests that while historical patterns may continue as a “self-fulfilling prophecy,” the fundamental impact of halvings on Bitcoin’s supply disappears with each cycle. Greif emphasized that halvings will continue to affect Bitcoin mining economics regardless of market cycles.

Analyst Aylo, a researcher for blockchain platform Alpha Please, criticized XRP, arguing that the asset’s market capitalization of approximately $140 billion does not reflect its real-world utility. His primary concern stemmed from the relatively low volume recorded on the XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange (DEX). I think XRP is the biggest financial scam the world has ever seen. There has never been something which has produced less value that has reached this market cap ($140B). The XRP ledger did $44k in volume in the last 24h, according to DefiLlama. pic.twitter.com/i6crwO6NL4 — Aylo (@alpha_pls) March 21, 2025 Ripple CTO Addresses Concerns Over XRP DEX Volume Aylo pointed to data from DeFiLlama indicating that the XRPL’s DEX saw only $44,000 in trading activity over 24 hours. He argued that this was uncharacteristic for a cryptocurrency with XRP’s market size and questioned its overall value. Additionally, he highlighted that the XRPL’s total value locked (TVL) was just $80.63 million—significantly lower than blockchain networks with well-established decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. In response, David Schwartz addressed Aylo’s concerns, stating that the reported trading volume likely only considered Automated Market Maker (AMM) transactions, which represent only a fraction of XRPL’s activity. He clarified that AMM functionality was only recently integrated into the XRPL in March 2024, making it an emerging feature rather than a defining aspect of the network. Validator Disputes Low Volume Claim with Higher Figures Following Schwartz’s response, Vet, a validator on XRPL’s dUNL (decentralized Unique Node List), contested Aylo’s assessment by presenting alternative volume figures. He stated that XRPL’s actual 24-hour DEX volume was closer to $9 million, significantly higher than the $44,000 cited in Aylo’s argument. Vet further noted that DeFiLlama’s data might not fully capture XRPL’s trading activity. He revealed that he and Orchestra Finance had collaborated with DeFiLlama’s team to improve data integration, ensuring that both AMM and Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) transactions were accounted for. When combined, these figures reflect a more accurate representation of XRPL’s trading volume. Why Is XRPL’s DEX Volume Relatively Low? Despite the revised estimate of $9 million in DEX volume, XRPL still lags behind other major blockchains, including Ethereum ($1.44 billion), Solana ($1.087 billion), and Binance Smart Chain ($2.61 billion). However, analysts attribute this discrepancy to XRPL’s historical focus on cross-border payments rather than DeFi. Unlike networks that have prioritized DeFi development for years, XRPL only recently introduced DeFi-related features such as AMMs, NFTs, and stablecoins. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, some industry observers argue that DEX volume alone is not an accurate measure of a blockchain’s overall legitimacy or success. Bitcoin, for instance, has a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion, yet DeFiLlama reports that its 24-hour DEX volume is only $238,740. This suggests that a blockchain’s value cannot be assessed solely based on DEX activity. Misinterpretation of the Token’s Trading Volume The debate over the token’s trading volume also led to some confusion, with certain individuals mistaking Aylo’s argument as a criticism of XRP’s total trading activity rather than its DEX volume specifically. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP’s global 24-hour trading volume stands at approximately $3.14 billion, a figure more aligned with its market capitalization. While discussions surrounding XRP’s utility and adoption continue, the recent exchange highlights the complexities involved in evaluating a cryptocurrency’s value based on DEX metrics alone. As XRPL expands its DeFi ecosystem, its trading volume on decentralized platforms may grow over time. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

For this reason, the country’s economic affairs minister, Guy Parmelin, has emphasized Switzerland’s positive impact on the US economy. Last week, a Swiss delegation visited Washington. This was after the US announced it was looking into countries for unfair trade practices. Switzerland also made it to this list. According to a Reuters report , Guy Parmelin said it’s not clear whether Switzerland will dodge U.S. reciprocal tariffs, which will be announced on April 2nd regardless of Swiss officials’ explanation of their position. Parmelin told Swiss Public Radio (SRF) on Saturday “We have signaled we are ready to discuss and to show we have benefits for the US.” He emphasized that Switzerland is the 6th largest foreign investor in the US. Moreover, companies in Switzerland have a workforce of around 400,000 US citizens. They are also offered high salary packages. He said, “We are a strong investor and we want to invest more.” However, it remains unclear if this was enough for the US to exempt Switzerland from its future tariffs. This is because Switzerland is not abolishing its own sales taxes. Parmelin said it’s difficult to convince Trump as he objects to other countries charging sales taxes from the US. Switzerland still awaits the April 2nd announcement. Parmelin said, “The high-level political discussions will come afterward.” Switzerland has limited options to retaliate against US tariffs The country has also previously shared concerns over Trump’s tariff. Last year, in November, a spokesman for the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs told Reuters that “Switzerland is concerned about Donald Trump’s announcement to impose additional tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S.” SECO spokesman said that the country strongly opposes US tariffs because such tariffs would violate the rules-based international trading system, which Switzerland relies on for its economy. Moreover, Switzerland’s options to retaliate against US tariffs are limited. Parmelin shared that Switzerland has “abolished industrial tariffs” on the US. This has benefited the US as 99% of goods come to Switzerland without customs duties. Parmelin added, “Probably other countries don’t have that.” Switzerland has already made its market highly accessible to U.S. goods, so the Swiss government has little leverage left. Therefore it is looking into “sensible responses” to Trump’s tariff threats. They are also trying to initiate discussions with U.S. authorities and important trading partners in Germany, France, Italy, and the EU to form a collaborative approach or negotiate terms. Experts suggest that the Swiss economy, heavily reliant on exports, could face serious challenges if the U.S. imposes additional tariffs, as the United States is Switzerland’s largest trading partner. Analysts predict that if severe repercussions such as a trade war occur or companies begin relocating to evade tariffs, Switzerland’s economic output could decline by around 1%.

Recent Price Performance ADA’s monthly closing prices highlight its fluctuating trajectory: March 2025 – Projected to close at $0.74 February 2025 – $0.63 January 2025 – $0.94 December 2024 – $0.84 November 2024 – $1.08 October 2024 – $0.34 The price action shows ADA’s strong rally between October 2024 and January 2025, reaching a peak of $1.08 in November before entering a correction phase. The drop from $0.94 in January to $0.63 in February signaled a cooling period, but March has seen stabilization around $0.71. April 2025 Price Outlook Several factors will influence ADA’s price movement next month: Market Momentum – If Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) show strength, ADA could follow with a recovery. Cardano Network Growth – Developments in scalability, DeFi adoption, and partnerships could drive renewed investor interest. Investor Sentiment – Positive sentiment could push ADA toward key resistance levels.

In its memo, the court mentioned that the criminals have been forging counterfeit arrest warrants, targeting people in the region. According to reports, the scammers have targeted several individuals, accusing them of missing jury duties. The criminals convince their victims and end up offering them a way out, which is usually a payment in Bitcoin or gift cards. To achieve this, they make use of realistic court style documents and urgent threats to exploit their victims. West Virginia court issues public warning over rising scams According to reports, after their victims have agreed to pay the penalty for missing jury duty, the criminals then guide them on how to pay using Bitcoin and other methods. “The scammers demand payment by Bitcoin, gift cards, or bank account information to resolve the issue,” the statement reads. A copy of the fake arrest warrant used by the scammers. Source: United States District Court of the Western District of Virginia. The West Virginia court also urged individuals not to fall for these scams as the court won’t issue arrest warrants for missing jury duty unless they have been previously summoned and missed it. “Please be advised that the United States District Courts do not issue arrest warrants for failing to appear for jury duty unless you have been summoned for jury duty and fail to appear,” the statement continued. The West Virginia court also urged individuals to clarify if the calls are genuine if they are contacted for failing to show up for jury duty. It also asked those who have received suspicious messages to pay using Bitcoin, gift cards, and other methods to contact them. “If you receive an arrest warrant or other document purportedly from the United States District Courts that demands money, particularly Bitcoin and gift cards with payment by phone, please contact the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia,” the statement said. Bitcoin ATM-related fraud continues to grow unchecked in the US This case is not isolated as other states in the country have witnessed a rise in these kinds of scams. For instance, a previous report mentioned the rise in the activities of con artists targeting elderly people in Pima County in Arizona. These criminals pretend to be officers from the Pima County Sheriff’s Department (PCSD) to carry out several evil activities. Financial Crimes Detective in PCSD Michael Wilson mentioned that the rate of these crimes has ticked up these past few days. He mentioned that the criminals employed the same tactics of threatening elderly ones of not showing up and noting that they have a warrant for their arrest. “They will say: Hey you unfortunately didn’t show up for jury duty and as a result, you have a warrant for your arrest,” Wilson said. Wilson mentioned that PCSD has been trying to sensitize the general public about these issues. He noted that they have begun hanging signs on top of these ATMs to dissuade people from sending funds to criminal elements under the guise of missing jury duty. The rise in Bitcoin ATMs have been on the rise in America over the last few months, with such activities going unchecked. In a report from September 2024, several Senators wrote to Bitcoin ATM operators to check the increase in scams being carried out using their machines. The report mentioned that the criminals were targeting elderly people. While things have been expected to change, it looks like the situation continues to go from bad to worse.

Revealing 2025 Bullish Price Potential",https://bitzo.com/2025/03/xrp-to-25-cardano-to-5-revealing-2025-bullish-price-potential,"Could major cryptocurrencies be poised for dramatic gains by 2025? The potential for XRP to hit $25 and Cardano to reach $5 is gaining attention in the crypto community. This article delves into the bullish price forecasts for these digital assets and examines the factors driving their growth. Discover which coins might be ready for the next big leap. XRP: Cautious Correction Amid Six-Month Gains XRP slipped by around 11% in the past month while gaining nearly 309% over the last six months. The coin faced a minor pullback recently, despite its significant long-term growth, indicating a market that has favored XRP. Short-term price movements show limited action as traders appear to be managing volatility and taking profits, even as the overall trend has been positive over a longer period. XRP is currently trading between a support level of about $1.06 and resistance near $3.61, staying within a range of $1.60 to $2.88. The lack of a clear trend is confirmed by neutral RSI and oscillators. Traders may look to buy near support levels and consider selling as the price approaches resistance, maintaining a cautious strategy amidst the current price action. Cardano's Mixed Journey: Sharp Rally With Recent Pullbacks Cardano experienced an 11.80% drop over the past month while recording a notable 95.05% surge over the last six months. A one-week decline of 4.95% highlights recent weakness amid its longer-term strength. Price movements have been volatile, showing a mix of short-term losses against a substantial half-year rally, as traders navigate both bearish and bullish signals. The coin currently trades between $0.444 and $0.889, with key support at $0.26 and resistance at $1.15. Bears seem to dominate the market due to negative oscillators and an RSI below the midpoint. Traders are watching for a potential bounce near support before attempting to challenge the resistance level. Conclusion XRP and Cardano (ADA) show strong potential for significant price increases by 2025. XRP aims to revolutionize cross-border payments, while Cardano focuses on building a secure and scalable blockchain. Investors may find these coins attractive due to their ambitious projects and growth. Reaching $25 for XRP and $5 for ADA are ambitious targets, but achievable if current trends continue.

The Jasmy Coin ( JASMY ) token has crashed because of the cryptocurrency market’s ongoing performance. Bitcoin and most altcoins have also plunged in this period. Still, the coin is likely to bounce back in the coming weeks. On-chain data shows that the number of active addresses has risen in the past few days. There were 897 active addresses on March 23, the highest level since March 10. An increase in active addresses is often seen as a positive catalyst for a coin. Jasmy on-chain stats | Source: Santiment The rising active addresses have coincided with the 365-day Mean Dollar Invested Age rally. The MDIA soared to 146 from this month’s low of 138. A rising MDIA indicator is often a bullish catalyst for a coin. You might also like: Cardano price flashing bullish signal as MDIA indicator soars The other potential catalyst for Jasmy is that it has become a highly undervalued coin. One of the best ways to look at this is using the z score of market value to realized value, or MVRV indicator. This indicator compares a coin’s current market value to the total value of all coins in the network at the point they were last moved. Jasmy’s MVRV-Z score has dropped to minus 1.8 from last year’s high of 5.2. It has moved to the lowest level since April last year, a sign that it has become highly undervalued. Further, the total balances of JASMY on exchanges has continued falling this year. Data by CoinGlass below shows that these balances have moved to 8.47 billion tokens from the November high of 10.4 billion. JASMY balances on exchanges | Source: CoinGlass Jasmy price technical analysis JASMY chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the JASMY price has crashed in the past few months. It has dropped from $0.059 in November to $0.01. Most recently, it crashed below the key support level at $0.0160, its lowest level in March, May, August, and November last year. Jasmy has remained below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, a sign that bears have prevailed. On the positive side, Jasmy price has formed a falling wedge pattern, pointing to a rebound. A wedge is made up of two falling and converging trendlines. In most cases, a rebound usually happens when the two trendlines near their confluence. Therefore, the coin is likely to surge soon. If it rises above the key resistance at $0.016, more upside will be confirmed. Such a move will point to further gains, potentially to the key point at $0.025, the highest swing on Sep. 28 last year. Jasmy roots JasmyCoin, often dubbed “Japan’s Bitcoin,” was originally designed to give individuals control over their personal data. Founded in 2016 by former Sony executives Kazumasa Sato and Kunitake Ando, Jasmy aims to empower users to manage and monetize their information securely rather than handing it to corporations for free. JASMY, the project’s native token, facilitates data transactions, rewards users for sharing information, and powers payments within the ecosystem. With Japan’s strict data protection laws and growing interest in Web3, Jasmy has positioned itself as a leader in data democratization. Recently, JasmyCoin shifted its focus on becoming a prominent player in the artificial intelligence sector.

At the same time, investors are increasingly turning their attention to emerging altcoins with high-growth potential—one of the most talked-about being Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has quietly raised over $4.5 million during its presale. As capital begins to rotate from top-heavy assets into early-stage projects, a shift in momentum appears to be forming. Why Bitcoin may struggle to break past $87K Bitcoin’s recent attempts to push past $87K have consistently faced strong resistance. Analysts point to visible liquidity clusters and large-scale sell walls that are actively capping upward movement. While Bitcoin has managed to reclaim key support levels in the $84K–$85K range, bullish momentum seems limited without a clear breakout above the $87,000 threshold. This ongoing price suppression, possibly fueled by large-volume traders managing order books on centralized exchanges, has created uncertainty for short-term BTC upside. On top of that, despite broader market optimism, Bitcoin remains vulnerable to consolidation. Price action continues to reflect a tug-of-war between bulls trying to reclaim new highs and sellers defending key resistance. While long-term sentiment remains positive, the current structure points to a period of sideways trading unless a significant catalyst—such as a shift in macroeconomic policy or institutional demand—reignites momentum. In this context, many investors are now exploring newer opportunities outside of Bitcoin’s immediate range. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) One such opportunity is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has been gaining notable traction among early-stage investors and whales alike. The project’s presale has already brought in over $4.5 million, with more than 6,300 holders joining in. As of now, over 62% of Phase 3 has been completed, with the token currently priced at $0.02. With the next presale phase set to increase the price by 25%, FOMO is beginning to build as buyers aim to secure their allocations before the next jump. Mutuum Finance is more than just a new token—it’s building a decentralized ecosystem focused on secure lending and borrowing. The platform allows users to supply digital assets and earn passive income or borrow funds without selling their holdings. All transactions are conducted through smart contracts, offering full transparency and trustless execution. The team is currently working with CertiK to audit the smart contracts, ensuring the infrastructure is safe and reliable before launch. Another component fueling interest is Mutuum’s upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will be minted directly within the lending protocol, allowing users to generate liquidity without exiting their positions. It adds an extra layer of utility to the ecosystem, reinforcing user engagement and long-term demand for the token. To support the value of MUTM, the protocol also employs a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of the fees collected from platform activity is used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken holders. This creates consistent buying pressure while incentivizing users who participate in the platform’s liquidity pools. As activity scales, this mechanism is expected to become a key driver for token appreciation. In summary, while Bitcoin may be nearing a short-term ceiling, projects like Mutuum Finance are capturing the attention of investors looking for strong fundamentals and early entry potential. With a structured presale, growing holder base, and real DeFi utility, MUTM is positioning itself as one of the standout tokens to watch as new capital flows into the next generation of decentralized finance.

However, is too much positive sentiment around a volatile cryptocurrency necessary good news for it? Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez outlined earlier today the substantial change in the number of long positions for XRP on the world’s largest exchange. As the graph below demonstrates, the longs have grown significantly within the span of just a day and currently represent more than 72% of all futures positions on Binance. 72.28% of traders with open $XRP positions on Binance Futures are leaning bullish! pic.twitter.com/yFOxjTEnd1 — Ali (@ali_charts) March 23, 2025 As with all things in life, this data could be reviewed from both sides. First, we can speculate that perhaps a portion of these investors could know something we don’t or anticipate a big development on the horizon. Such could be a potential approval of an XRP ETF in the States, which might have an immediate positive impact on the asset’s price. Or, maybe they expect XRP’s value to rise sharply after Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced earlier this week that the case against the SEC has concluded with a favorable ending for the company. This indeed had an immediate but brief impact on XRP’s price, which jumped from $2.3 to $2.6 but then retraced to the current $2.4. Additionally, it brought debates about whether it was another classic ‘ sell-the-news ‘ event. The second perspective we can discuss from the growing number of longs on Binance Futures is much more bearish. After all, remember Warren Buffett’s wise words: buy when others are fearful and sell when they are greedy. The crypto analytics platform Santiment has also warned multiple times in the past that cryptocurrencies tend to do the opposite of what the crowd expects. Consequently, XRP could actually go for a correction soon, which would have an even more profound and painful effect if it leads to a cascade of liquidated long positions.

AI agents gain traction in the crypto and social media space, backed by a Franklin Templeton report that points to a future where autonomous entities will reshape the digital landscape. Table of Contents What exactly are AI agents and what’s their role in social media? Antix: AI-powered digital agents for the future of social media AiXBT: An AI-powered crypto X bot Anita AI: A virtual AI content creator Conclusion: the future is now Asset manager giant Franklin Templeton released a report in early 2025 discussing the growing role of artificial intelligence agents. This refers to sophisticated software entities designed to autonomously perform basic and complex tasks using artificial intelligence. According to the report, AI agents are the result of combining artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. AI agents are already being deployed across platforms like Solana ( SOL ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). The industry remains in its very early stages, indicating significant opportunities for early investors. “We can envision a future where AI agents revolutionize content generation on social media and play an integral role across various industries and platforms. Like today’s human influencers, these agents could launch their own brands, products, music, movies, and more, driving significant economic value to their ecosystems.” – Franklin Templeton Essentially, the report argues the line that separates human from AI content is starting to blur, ushering in a new era full of opportunities. What exactly are AI agents and what’s their role in social media? AI agents, also known as agentic AI, can be defined as AI systems designed to act without human intervention on behalf of a user, an organization, a company, or another entity. Unlike static algorithms, these digital agents can analyze data, pursue objectives, and adapt their strategies in real time. One area where AI agents are having an immediate impact is in social media. AI agents are transforming how content is created, distributed, and consumed. These bots can be designed to manage influencer accounts, engage with audiences, and generate media content at a scale that no human can match. For example, AI-powered digital influencers can curate and post updates, respond to every comment within seconds, and even host live sessions. The need for constant human oversight is no longer a requirement as AI agents follow specific instructions without deviation. Beyond content creation, AI agents seamlessly integrate with blockchain networks, allowing them to own digital assets, execute transactions, and verify content authenticity. This capability is driving a new era of decentralized AI-driven media platforms where companies of all sizes can take advantage of digital influencers, brand ambassadors, and personas.

But, it faces many challenges ranging from rising content production costs, inconsistent engagement, and perhaps most notably, fatigue among users. Companies typically invest hundreds of thousands of dollars and dedicate weeks of work to creating human avatars. Antix presents a disruptive alternative. By leveraging AIGE, Antix’s proprietary AI technology, brands can launch AI-powered digital humans within hours and at a fraction of the cost, starting at $100 per avatar. Also, these digital humans require no costly production cycles or ongoing management, allowing companies to scale content creation at a rapid pace while maintaining consistent engagement with their audiences. This way, Antix helps users design AI agents to: Create content: Automatically generate and post videos, social media updates, and live streams based on assigned themes. Engage audiences: Respond to comments, host Q&A sessions, and interact with users in a way that mimics human influencers and best represents the brand. Promote brands: Act as a brand ambassador for companies by launching products, conducting virtual events, and featuring in digital ad campaigns. Monetize engagement: Earn revenue through NFT sales, tokenized promotions, and partnerships. However, Antix’s hyper-realistic human avatars are not limited to social media but can be applied across various industries, especially the content industry, entertainment, marketing, education, healthcare, and customer support. Antix’s experts have applied their diverse skills and creative vision to major projects like Game of Thrones and World of Tanks. Their work in AI and digital humans has also attracted the attention of globally recognized brands, including Warner Bros, EA Sports, and HBO. Fully customizable with support across multiple languages, Antix’s digital personas operate 24/7 without traditional challenges associated with humans. Rather, they are entirely scalable, and under full control of the brands or individuals using them. Another major component of Antix’s disruptive model is its blockchain-powered token economy. Currently in its early distribution phase, the ANTIX token’s current price is $0.087, reflecting a 38% discount compared to the upcoming Token Generation Event price of $0.14. A total of 7.429 million out of 7.69 million tokens have been sold, implying early adopters have acted quickly to acquire ANTIX tokens at the reduced rate . The token is designed to facilitate transactions, interactions, and governance within the platform. This is to ensure AI agents aren’t just digital entities but assets with real value. The ANTIX token is essential for securing complete control and ownership over digital creations. Antix’s digital humans come with an NFT-backed identity system, where every avatar is linked to an NFT passport that serves as a certificate of authenticity and ownership. This guarantees creators are given full intellectual property rights so they can buy, sell, license, or rent out AI characters in a secure and verifiable way. By integrating tokenized ownership, Antix enables a decentralized marketplace where brands, creators, and audiences can trade their avatars as productivity tools or valuable digital assets. Additionally, ANTIX tokens can be used for character upgrades, allowing users to improve various aspects of their digital humans. These upgrades can focus on improving appearance, voice modulation, animation quality, and new interactive capabilities. The token is also used for subscription plans, marketplace transactions, promotional boosts, and NFT auctions. Additionally, Antix supports staking, with multiple staking tiers offered, so ANTIX holders can multiply their earnings over time. AiXBT: An AI-powered crypto X bot AiXBT is an AI-driven social media account with a specialization in crypto market analysis. The bot operates as an automated content aggregator but falls short of earning the title of a traditional influencer. It is built on the Virtuals Protocol and scans posts from influential and trustworthy crypto-focused accounts on X and republishes its findings in the form of market insights, price updates, and industry news. AiXBT still serves as an example of the potential reach of AI bots, as it pumped out more than 100,000 posts on X within its first few months. The topics range from Bitcoin price movements to obscure token launches. The range of topics yielded impressive results as it won over 430,000 followers. AiXBT is powered through its AIXBT token which quickly reached a market capitalization of more than $500 million. However, selling pressure and a concerning security breach pushed the token to its current market cap of around $85 million. The plunge in value coincided with a broader market selloff although it may also be due to hype of stronger projects. Notably, AiXBT doesn’t create original insights or engage in in-depth discussions. Instead, it merely aggregates existing narratives. Anita AI: A virtual AI content creator Anita AI is a virtual influencer gaining traction for its interactive social media presence and unique governance model. Anita AI is a scripted AI social media personality designed to engage with followers and generate content. Anita mostly functions as a pre-programmed AI assistant, responding to prompts on X, Instagram, and podcasts. Unlike rival AI bots, her engagement is purely algorithm-driven, meaning content is predefined by a set of patterns rather than personal insight or experience. Anita AI’s content range is broad, featuring Instagram posts focusing on generic lifestyle content, motivational quotes, and AI-generated selfies to simulate influencer behavior. As such, Anita AI represents a basic integration of AI into influencer marketing rather than a game-changing shift in social media engagement. The ANITA token is integrated into a governance model where Anita acts as a symbolic AI figurehead. It was launched on the Solana blockchain and modeled after a basic DAO, where AI and human participants can influence the project’s direction. Conclusion: the future is now The rise of AI agents represents a clear sign of the upcoming large-scale shift in how we experience social media and digital life. As Franklin Templeton’s analysis suggests, these AI-driven agents are poised to reshape content creation since complete autonomy and unlimited scalability are a reality: “Although these agents are not yet fully autonomous and have little utility in their current state, this emerging sector may hold significant promise and is worth watching closely as it evolves and matures.” Social media feeds are already a mix of human and artificial content. As AI technology continues to advance, distinguishing between the two may become nearly impossible.

The launch date? May 30th. If regulators approve it, the fund will be one of the first on-chain money market funds from a traditional asset manager of this size. The firm is registering a new OnChain share class for its Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX). It holds cash and U.S. Treasury securities, and it went live late last year. Now they want to take it on-chain using Ethereum, with blockchain acting as the transfer agent. Other blockchains could follow. This move isn’t coming out of nowhere. The total tokenized U.S. Treasury market is now sitting at $4.77 billion, up nearly 500% in a year, according to rwa.xyz. Everyone’s trying to cram traditional assets onto blockchain rails. It’s not just hype this time. The filing said the fund’s Ethereum-based share class is pending approval and will become effective May 30th, if nothing derails it. Fidelity targets tokenized Treasuries with Ethereum-based FYHXX Fidelity, which manages $5.8 trillion in assets, is clearly trying to catch up in the tokenized Treasury space. Right now, BlackRock leads the race. Their fund, BUIDL, launched last March in partnership with Securitize. It now holds $1.5 billion in assets, per rwa.xyz data. Then there’s Franklin Templeton, the OG of tokenized funds. Their on-chain money market product has collected $689 million since dropping in 2021. The entire idea is simple: put old-school financial products like bonds, credit, and funds on a blockchain. Why? Quicker settlements, non-stop trading, and cutting out middlemen. That’s the pitch. FYHXX is joining that pack, with Ethereum as the base. Blockchain becomes the new transfer agent. Real-world assets (RWAs) now get tokenized, and Fidelity wants in. Tokenization isn’t new. But for years, it barely moved. Other than stablecoins, which acted like dollar stand-ins, most tokenized assets never took off. Only about 67,530 wallets, mostly institutions, actually hold tokenized assets that aren’t stablecoins. That’s just 0.003% of the world’s total asset value. According to research firm Opimas, many companies working on these projects are close to shutting down. That’s how slow it’s been. “Now they felt like they are able to do something and sped up their timeline a lot, whereas previously they were just watching,” said Charlie You, co-founder of rwa.xyz. So now firms are rushing in. Tokenization market heats up as institutions return The U.S. regulatory mess didn’t help. For years, regulators warned banks to stay far away from anything crypto. Even though tokenized securities follow the same rules as traditional ones, they still got lumped in with crypto and were seen as risky. As a result, big firms backed off. Most turned their focus to AI instead. But now that Donald Trump is back and pushing pro-crypto policies, the tone has changed fast. After BlackRock’s BUIDL fund launched, the whole industry felt a shift. It gave everyone cover to try again. Fidelity clearly saw the green light and accelerated its plan. It’s not just them. In October, Visa launched a platform for banks to issue fiat-based tokens. In November, Tether dropped its own tokenization platform. That same month, Mastercard linked its token network with JPMorgan Chase to settle B2B payments over the Kinexys blockchain. Kinexys handles about $2 billion in daily transactions, JPMorgan said. Raj Dhamodharan, EVP of blockchain and digital assets at Mastercard, said , “That’s a clear trend that will continue to evolve and unlock a lot of new business models. That trend is here to stay.” That’s not all. The Boston Consulting Group thinks tokenized fund assets could hit $600 billion by 2030. Today it’s about $2 billion. That’s a huge jump. Even the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is looking at new guidelines. They’re exploring how tokenized assets could be used as collateral in future trades. Some argue tokenization brings benefits like more liquidity, faster trades, and lower costs. Rob Krugman, Chief Digital Officer at Broadridge, said his firm has already tokenized trillions of dollars in repos. “By tokenizing those assets, it enables natural efficiency,” he said. “It may even be bigger than the internet. It’s fundamentally rethinking the way the markets work.” Industry still worries about bad assets and dumb risks But there’s no shortage of criticism. Some in the industry think tokenization is getting out of hand. Nathan Allman, CEO of Ondo Finance, said: “You sort of end up with a lot of poorly priced assets being sold to not so sophisticated investors.” He added, “Outside of Treasuries, I think there’s almost no value in tokenized public securities. Really, no one has done public securities well. The majority of projects in this space are unfortunately trying to distribute low quality, poorly priced assets.” Even insiders aren’t sold. Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, doesn’t see value in tokenizing real estate. Noelle Acheson, writer of Crypto is Macro Now, isn’t buying the hype around private equity tokenization either. She said it “feels a little more to me as a solution looking for a problem.” Her point? Private equity isn’t meant to be sold freely. Same with tokenizing a Picasso — you own it, but you don’t get to see it. So what’s the point? Some benefits do exist though. Automation can lower counterparty risk. For example, putting assets in escrow that only unlock when goods are delivered. That’s what Charlie You pointed out. There’s also potential to upgrade payment systems. Capco analysts say legacy systems are outdated. Adding programmable money could improve things, but it’s going to take time. “There are lot of opportunities, we don’t disagree with that, but there is still a lot of work to be done,” said Ervinas Janavicius, managing principal at Capco. Meanwhile, Fidelity is already neck-deep in crypto. Its spot Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) holds $16.5 billion, and its ether ETF (FETH) has around $780 million, according to SoSoValue.
