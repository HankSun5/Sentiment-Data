Keiser argued that gold is more trusted than the US dollar globally, and said governments of foreign nations with an adversarial relationship to the United States would not accept dollar-pegged stablecoins. The BTC maximalist added: ""Russia, China, and Iran are not going to accept a US dollar stablecoin. I predict they will counter the USD stablecoin with a Gold one.

The Power Division is under way to conduct consultations for drafting competitive, un-subsidized charges, which will attract crypto miners to pay a decent percentage of what they earn towards power. Since miners end up using 60–70% of their spending on power, Pakistan’s surplus generation could save humongous amounts of costs. The move is also in line with the government’s broader vision of turning liabilities into economic drivers. Power Minister Awais Leghari has recently met with Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the newly formed Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), to consider this prospect. Shortly thereafter, the council had its inaugural official meeting, which was chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and featured prominent regulators in attendance. Regulatory Framework in the Works PCC session focused on how Pakistan would benefit from the unexploited potential of crypto within the nation. Saqib outlined a vision of transforming surplus electricity into value through Bitcoin mining, with regulatory clarity. The council resolved that local business models and regulations will be defined by embracing international best practices. Main discussions included legislation, consumer protection, blockchain mining policies, and a national blockchain strategy. Global Context: Learning from Other Nations Countries have reacted differently towards crypto mining. China prohibited it due to environmental and energy concerns. Kazakhstan initially welcomed it but charged higher tariffs during shortages. Potential miners in El Salvador, on the other hand, take advantage of affordable geothermal energy from volcanoes to fuel their equipment.

He posted on social media, “This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.” However, this statement is worrying winemakers in California. According to a recent CNN report , grape growers and winemakers have a huge share in US wine production. Trump’s recent proposal of 200% tariffs on wine products has spread unease among the state’s wine producers. Some winemakers take his threat with caution, but they still feel positive about the revival of interest in locally made Californian wine. Others are worried that this will cause severe damage to the industry, which is already facing difficulties due to recent crop destruction from the wildfires and droughts in California. Moreover, the demand for California-made wines is also low. John Williams, who runs a winery in California’s Napa Valley, says, “Even though we’re a farming family business, there’s a global link.” He added, “This is not good for our industry in general.” EU data shows that alcoholic beverages are among the major exports to the United States. In case Trum’s threat changes and becomes a reality, European wine, including other alcoholic beverages, will become way expensive for an average-class American ordering at a restaurant or buying it in a liquor shop. Trump has also officially imposed a 25% tariff on European metals, specifically steel and aluminum. In a retaliatory move, Europe is imposing a 50% tariff on US whiskey starting from April. Some Canadian stores are no longer selling American alcohol brands Williams has been in the wine business for 45 years. He worries that the tariff war will create difficulties for wine distributors, who buy wine from producers and sell it to restaurants and retailers. He said, “We all rely on the same distributors. The health of those businesses is important to wineries all over the world”. He also sold wine to Canada. The country is also on Trump’s tariff blacklist. As tariffs have escalated tensions between US neighbors, some Canadian stores are no longer displaying American alcohol brands on their shelves. William says, “We need to sell all the cases we can. We don’t need business interruption right now.” Overall, the demand for wine has been on a decline According to a recent report by Silicon Valley Bank, younger generations are consuming less alcohol than baby boomers. This has caused wine demand to decline. The estimates in the report say that in 2025 the sales in the wine category in total would fall between minus 3% and minus 1%. John Duarte, a former Republican Congressman blames this decline for the damage in smaller wineries and farms owned by families in California. Duarte also runs a family farm and grapewine nursery. Larger alcohol companies involved in both importing and exporting wine are less likely to be affected by tariffs on EU wines compared to smaller businesses, Duarte explained. This is because the U.S. Customs and Border Protection provides refunds for certain duties, taxes, and fees paid on imported products as long as the company exports similar goods. According to Duarte, these tariffs could unintentionally encourage big alcohol brands to import more European alcohol, even at higher prices, to increase the refunds they receive when exporting similar items. “At first, you want to be thankful that President Trump is standing up for the domestic wine industry. That should be a good thing,” Duarte said. However, imposing a 200% tariff on top of existing excise taxes and other tariffs already in place gives a massive advantage to global wine companies that both import and export from the United States. While Duarte acknowledged that some aspects of trade between the United States and the EU are unfair, he emphasized that the issue needs to be addressed “much more carefully.” Not all California winemakers think that Trump’s tariffs will be entirely harmful to their business Bruce Lundquist, co-founder of Rack & Riddle, the largest sparkling wine producer in the United States, remains optimistic that the tariffs could spark greater interest in his company’s products. According to Comité Champagne, an industry trade association, France shipped nearly 27 million bottles of Champagne to the United States in 2023, making the U.S. the top market for its sparkling wine exports. However, a 200% tariff on Champagne imports, along with the inevitable price increase, would likely be a major setback for that market, Lundquist noted.

Bitcoin’s Steady Rise and Gala’s Web3 Expansion Make Headlines,https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-highest-roi-crypto-right-now-bitcoins-steady-rise-and-galas-web3-expansion-make-headlines/,"Crypto markets are shifting fast, and the search for the highest ROI crypto in 2025 is leading many toward high-growth projects. Bitcoin remains the anchor of the market, holding strong at key support levels as institutional demand fuels its stability. Meanwhile, Gala is making major moves in the Web3 gaming space, expanding its ecosystem and proving that blockchain-based entertainment is far from a fading trend. But the real shockwave in the market? Qubetics, a next-gen blockchain aggregator, is revolutionizing interoperability while its presale rockets past $15.3 million. While Bitcoin remains the go-to asset for security and Gala drives the future of gaming, Qubetics is solving the biggest problem in crypto—seamless, cross-chain transactions without the need for risky third-party bridges. With a mainnet launch set for Q2 2025 and massive upside potential, Qubetics is shaping up to be the highest ROI crypto this year. Qubetics ($TICS) – The Future of Cross-Chain Transactions Blockchain technology has come a long way, but users are still stuck dealing with siloed ecosystems. Want to move assets from Ethereum to Solana? That means using centralized exchanges or risky third-party bridges prone to hacks. Qubetics eliminates these problems with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, allowing seamless asset movement across major blockchains without intermediaries. For example, imagine a business accepting payments in multiple cryptocurrencies. With Qubetics, they can receive and manage BTC, ETH, SOL, and BNB—all in one secure wallet. No more conversion headaches or juggling multiple platforms. Retail users, businesses, and developers all benefit from Qubetics’ unified system, making it a game-changer for Web3 adoption. Qubetics Presale – The Window to Buy at a Low Price is Closing The Qubetics presale is catching fire, and early participants are piling in. With over $15.3 million already raised, 502 million $TICS tokens sold, and more than 23,500 token holders, it’s no wonder crypto circles are calling this one of the hottest opportunities of 2025. The pricing model is simple but powerful: each stage lasts just 7 days, and every Sunday at 12 AM, the token price jumps by 10%. Right now, we’re in Stage 26, with $TICS sitting at $0.1181. If you hop in now and $TICS hits $1, that’s a 746.04% return. If it climbs to $10 post-mainnet, you’re staring at an 8,360.26% ROI. A $100 buy today bags you 846 tokens. At $10, that’s $8,460. At $15? You’re holding $12,590.69. Time is ticking—this isn’t the moment to hesitate. Bitcoin (BTC) – The Market’s Most Reliable Anchor Despite volatility, Bitcoin continues to prove itself as the backbone of the crypto market. As of 2025, Bitcoin is holding strong at critical support levels, with large-scale accumulation from institutions keeping prices steady. Long-term holders are doubling down, with many betting that BTC’s limited supply will fuel its next surge. With global adoption increasing and ETFs providing easier access to traditional finance, Bitcoin remains a safe haven asset for long-term crypto participants. While other projects focus on innovation, BTC’s role as the “digital gold” of the market ensures it remains a staple in every serious portfolio. Market analysts are watching Bitcoin’s next move closely, with many predicting that a successful breakout could push BTC toward new all-time highs. If macroeconomic conditions remain favorable and institutional demand grows, Bitcoin’s dominance will likely continue into 2025 and beyond. Gala (GALA) – Leading the Web3 Gaming Revolution Gaming is one of the biggest industries in the world, and blockchain technology is transforming how players engage with in-game economies. Gala is leading this shift by offering fully decentralized, player-owned ecosystems where in-game assets have real-world value. Gala’s ecosystem allows players to earn, trade, and own digital assets without relying on centralized game publishers. This model is proving successful, with Gala continually expanding its gaming partnerships and strengthening its Web3 footprint. As blockchain gaming adoption increases, Gala remains one of the top projects driving the sector forward. Its model of player-owned economies and decentralized gaming is gaining momentum, and as Web3 adoption grows, Gala’s position as a leader in blockchain gaming will only strengthen. Conclusion – Qubetics is the Highest ROI Crypto to Watch Bitcoin remains the market’s safest bet, and Gala is paving the way for the future of blockchain gaming, but when it comes to groundbreaking innovation and massive upside potential, Qubetics is leading the charge. With $15.3 million already raised, a 10% price increase happening every week, and a Q2 2025 mainnet launch on the horizon, the window to buy $TICS at a low price is closing fast. If Qubetics reaches $10 post-launch, that’s an 8,360% ROI—making it one of the highest ROI cryptos in 2025. For those looking to secure their spot before the next price increase, now is the time to act. Don’t miss out on one of the most innovative projects in Web3.

Monero Trades at $213 In the last 12 months, market observers have spotted that it outperformed major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). According to CoinMarketCap data, XMR is trading at $213.66 , following a 0.62% price increase within the last 24 hours. Before finally resting at this level, the coin climbed to $216.3, representing a 110% spike from its lowest level in 2024. XMR went from trading at a low of $102 in February 2025 to hitting $215. The coin has remained above the 50-week Exponential Moving Average, a sign that bulls are in control. Some technical indicators, including Stochastic RSI and Momentum, are pointed upwards, suggesting an incoming bull season. This trend will likely continue in the coming weeks and probably get the coin to hit $290, like it did in April 2022. Markedly, the positive momentum in the Monero ecosystem is catalyzed by several factors, including Tornado Cash’s woes. Tornado Cash and OFAC Sanction In 2022, the crypto mixer was sanctioned by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, for its role in laundering over $7 billion in crypto from illicit activities. This case also put privacy-focused coins under the radar of the US authorities. However, the case took a different turn in 2024 when a judge ruled that OFAC had erred when it implemented sanctions on the company. The judge cited Tornado Cash’s autonomy and smart contracts, stating that these make it illegible to the purview of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In the long run, the US Treasury Department was forced to lift the sanction , making the crypto mixer service available to US residents. This singular act triggered Monero’s rise to stardom. Woes Faced by Privacy-centered Cryptocurrencies The situation with Tornado Cash and the United States Treasury Department has negatively impacted this category of digital assets. Exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, and HTX even delisted Monero from their platforms. As a result, it was left with trading on small exchanges like Bitifinex, MEX, and KuCoin. With the reinstatement of Tornade Cash , most of these popular crypto exchanges may decide to relist XMR, although no announcement has been made. Dash (DASH), Zcash (ZEC), and Horizen (ZEN) may also be impacted.

It was reported that Tether is currently subject to quarterly reports but not a full independent annual audit, which is much more extensive and provides more assurance to investors and regulators.

Analysts predict DOGE, currently trading around $0.17, could finally reach the $1 mark. Meanwhile, PEPE, now at $0.0000076, is expected to surge to $0.0001, driven by meme coin hype. However, the biggest potential gain lies with MUTM, priced at $0.02 in the third phase of its presale, which is projected to soar past $3, marking a 150x increase. The initiative has managed to gather 6300 owners who helped raise $4.4 million so far. Investors currently take advantage of the $0.02 price point because phase 4 will push the value up to $0.025. Over 50% of the presale has been sold out making this the perfect time for investors to get in before the phase closes. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance keeps attracting users swiftly because its innovative dual-lending model innovates traditional decentralized lending protocols. The confidence level rises as 6300 individuals from various parties spend $4.4 million through the presale funding stage. Investors will benefit from major earning potential when Phase 4 price rises 25% from $0.02 due to upcoming projections. The presale of MUTM received support from 6300 investors because they recognized both its distinctive financial structure and powerful market potential which multiple analysts believe will result in this DeFi project surpassing $5 when it is launched. Mutuum Finance is special in the sense that it blends both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. The P2C model allows users to accrue passive income through USDT liquidity pools, enjoying the fruits of automated smart contract-based lending. Meanwhile, the P2P model provides direct transactions without intermediaries, giving users full control over their funds. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. Building a Secure and Stable Ecosystem Users can find evidence of Mutuum Finance’s stability through its issuance of a completely backed stablecoin using Ethereum network resources. The token achieves trustworthiness over an extended timespan because its overcollateralized design cuts down potential risks contrary to algorithmic stablecoins that face insolvency challenges. Open financial architectures and audited smart contracts alongside this architecture deliver higher investor trust by solving the major issues of past DeFi projects. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance continues to grow its community foundation by providing attractive benefits to users. The Mutuum Finance giveaway offers $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens to ten winners among participants entering the million-dollar contest. Additionally the innovative referral system provides rewards for new investor acquisitions. The platform provides early adopters with special staking pools as well as governance advantages and VIP communication which enhances their continued investment in the platform. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Scarcity in Mutuum Finance derives from supply control during presales together with built-in asset deflation which increases token value. Through staking activities active users gain desirable benefits because stake programs ensure network sustainability in the long run. Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been the face of meme coins. Pepe (PEPE), another meme token riding the wave of viral success, is predicted to hit $0.0001, capitalizing on market enthusiasm. While both coins rely heavily on community hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a fundamentally stronger case for long-term growth. The dual-lending DeFi platform has already attracted 6,300 investors, raising $4.4 million in presale funding. Currently priced at $0.02, MUTM is set to climb to $0.025 in the next phase and could skyrocket past $3, offering a staggering 150x return. Get in today before the presale completes.

According to reports, Binance exchange has emerged the leading CEX by download, beating apps like OKX, Bitget, Coinbase, and Bybit. According to an X post by @crypto_rand, Binance has almost 60 million monthly visits, supports more than 400 coins and saw about 4.83 million downloads in February alone. That number is more than double the amount of downloads OKX, which came in second place, had. Binance leads crypto exchange apps in terms of downloads this month. Source: Sensor Tower As for DEXs, Trust Wallet leads the group in activity and downloads as volume pushes hard. According to an X post from @Axel_bitblaze69 and reposted by Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Trust Wallet beat all other DEXs in the number of wallet downloads it has racked up so far this month. Trust Wallet reportedly got downloaded about 35% more times than other apps like MetaMask, Phantom, Coinbase and Bitget. Trust Wallet retains its popularity among BNB Smart Chain users. Source: Sensor Tower In his X post, Axel highlighted how much Trust Wallet has grown in the past couple of years, claiming that he first downloaded the app in 2021 “for the $BNB memeseason,” and has been using it ever since. Since then, he noted that the wallet has become one of the most widely used with milestones like 200M+ downloads, 2.5M monthly new users and 35% of captured market share with 100+ chain integrations. Axel also called attention to the Trust Wallet zero swap fees campaign, which allows zero swaps for all token pairs on the BNB Smart Chain and will be live until March 27. The campaign was reportedly sponsored by OxProject and 1inch. Building together with the buddy @BNBCHAIN ⚒️ pic.twitter.com/6QMN1cRO3A — Trust Wallet (@TrustWallet) March 21, 2025 “With BSC flipping Solana in DEX volume lately and Trust Wallet still the OG for most BNB on-chain players, those numbers are only getting bigger from here imo,” he concluded his post. In the comment section, there were many who agreed that Trust Wallet is a great innovation, with some claiming they had never encountered any issues while using the app. However, there were also those with complaints about the app. Is it really BNB season? While the BNB token has been showing some strength, rumors of a BNB season are still just that for now, but the excitement is building. The coin is definitely showing solid momentum. It owes much of it to the growing meme coin activity on the chain and technical signals that signal short-term bullishness. Analysts on X have highlighted resistance levels around $640-$665, but if it clears that, they see a potential run to $875. The BNB Chain recently beat out Solana in weekly DEX volume, and it has contributed to the growing euphoria about a possible BNB season. Binance wallet has also promoted 0% trading fees until September which could encourage more trading activity. Overall, many analysts are looking forward to a parabolic move from BNB soon, with some even going as far as tagging the token a silent winner as it weathers the current market volatility. The volatility is one of the threats to the potential BNB season. Bitcoin has not been doing too well and altcoins historically follow its trend so there is skepticism about BNB pumping especially if BTC doesn’t change its downward trajectory. Even if BNB season does happen, some X users have warned that it may not last long. @fishermancrypt0 in a post cautioned that the “BNB season” might fizzle by the weekend if Solana, known for its memes, steals the spotlight. BNB got on the Trump train… briefly Binance’s BNB token has been doing relatively well in the past couple of days. On March 13, the token jumped by 4% after Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump family has been in talks to secure a financial interest in the U.S. arm of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. However, CZ quickly denied any discussions about a deal for Binance.US or conversations about seeking a pardon from the president. “Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong,” he wrot e . “I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with… well, anyone.” 4. Sorry to disappoint. The WSJ article got the facts wrong.

LTC Market Cap Declines & Bitget PAWS Trading Gains Attention,https://thecoinrise.com/traders-are-flocking-to-blockdags-xp-page-for-big-rewards-ltc-market-cap-declines-bitget-paws-trading-gains-attention/,"Imagine a platform where every action earns rewards, not just for holding coins but for active engagement. That’s exactly what BlockDAG (BDAG) delivers, rewarding participation with BDAG instead of just tracking price movements. On the other hand, Litecoin’s recent 11.05% decline pushed its market cap down to $6.5 billion, while Bitget PAWS trading began its pre-market phase. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is setting new records. Being part of BlockDAG is about more than just acquiring BDAG—it’s about earning XP, unlocking significant rewards, and rising up the leaderboard. Unlike Litecoin’s price fluctuations and PAWS’ early-stage appeal, BlockDAG’s 2,380% rise since batch 1 and $205 million raised in presale funding show clear momentum. With fresh achievements released weekly, users keep accumulating BDAG, proving that in crypto, active participants reap the most rewards. Litecoin (LTC) Market Cap Declines Following 11.05% Price Drop On March 12, 2025, Litecoin (LTC) recorded an 11.05% price dip, bringing its value down to $89.11. This decline significantly impacted the Litecoin market cap, reducing it to $6.5 billion. The drop followed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s postponement of several cryptocurrency ETF approvals, including one tied to Litecoin. This regulatory delay led to increased selling pressure, driving the price down further. Although market analysts have mixed opinions about Litecoin’s next move, some remain hopeful about future recovery. However, market watchers are keeping a close eye on the Litecoin market cap and price shifts as uncertainty persists. Bitget PAWS Trading Begins Early Access for Millions of Users Bitget has introduced pre-market trading for PAWS, allowing users to engage in transactions before its official launch. The pre-market phase lets traders buy and sell PAWS ahead of its full listing, using Bitget’s over-the-counter system for early-stage access. PAWS, a Telegram-based mini-game, rewards users with PAWS tokens for completing in-app activities. Developed by the same team behind Notcoin and Dogs, PAWS has grown rapidly, now attracting over 32 million users. By adding PAWS, Bitget continues its push to introduce tokens with strong community backing and widespread user engagement. BlockDAG’s Achievement Page Turns Engagement Into Profits! BlockDAG’s Achievement Page changes how crypto participation works. Instead of simply holding BDAG, users accumulate XP (Experience Points) through their interactions, unlocking special rewards in the process. This approach motivates continued engagement while offering real returns. XP is earned by completing tasks like purchasing BDAG and taking part in exclusive bonus programs. The more XP collected, the greater the rewards, which include special perks and leaderboard recognition. With new achievements introduced every week, earning opportunities remain high, ensuring active users benefit the most. Currently valued at $0.0248 in Batch 27, BlockDAG has soared 2,380% since its presale launch, accumulating over $205 million. The XP system enhances this momentum, offering a structured pathway for users to earn additional BDAG. With XP playing a key role in the ecosystem, participation goes beyond passive holding—it creates a direct path to higher earnings. BlockDAG’s reward system does more than acknowledge engagement; it provides a competitive advantage to those maximizing their involvement. More XP means more BDAG payouts, making every interaction worthwhile. Top Crypto Coins 2025— Final Remarks! The crypto market is no longer just about price trends—it’s about long-term development and utility. Litecoin’s market cap dropped to $6.5 billion after an 11.05% decline, largely due to ETF delays. Meanwhile, Bitget’s PAWS trading is attracting early traders, aiming to transform its Telegram mini-game into a major crypto asset. While these two face their respective challenges, BlockDAG is changing the way crypto works by making engagement profitable. With a 2,380% price surge and $205 million secured in its crypto presale , BlockDAG is more than just a digital asset—it’s an active ecosystem where participation turns into real value. The XP system ensures users benefit at every stage, rewarding involvement with direct BDAG earnings.

Bitcoin Shows Bullishness As Analyst Sets ‘Blast Off’ Date, Here’s When",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/global-m2-vs-bitcoin-bullishness/,"A recent analysis comparing Bitcoin’s price movement and the Global M2 money supply has added another data point to the growing argument for a bullish phase ahead for the cryptocurrency. Colin, a crypto analyst known on social media platform X as “The M2 Guy,” recently shared an update suggesting that Bitcoin may be on the verge of a significant upward move, and the expected timeline might continue to test the patience of Bitcoin traders. Bitcoin’s Incoming Rally May Mirror M2’s Explosive Growth Colin, a crypto analyst known on X as “The M2 Guy,” has continued to build his case around the correlation between Bitcoin and macro liquidity trends. His outlook on Bitcoin, which is currently bullish, is based on an offset correlation between the cryptocurrency’s price action on the daily candlestick chart and the global M2 money supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin Vs. Global M2 Money Supply Shows A Big Move Coming, Here’s The Target In a previous analysis, the analyst noted that Bitcoin’s price action on the daily candlestick chart has the best correlations on the 70-day and 107-day offsets. The most recent update from the analyst focuses on the 107-day offset, which he termed “the most likely scenario.” Analysis of Bitcoin’s 107-day offset with the global M2 money supply shows that Bitcoin is about to go on a blast-off spike. However, this isn’t just about a one-day spike. Colin projects the rally could last for two months based on the sharp vertical trend of the global M2 supply. As for the timing, the 107-day offset suggests that the blast-off spike is expected to kick off around April 30 based on a mathematically strong correlation. If the M2 line continues its upward surge, the rally could last even longer. Focus On The Macro, Not Just The Day Although April 30 is a focal point in his projection, Colin cautioned followers not to become overly fixated on the exact date. “Don’t get caught up in the weeds,” he advised. The larger narrative is more important, reflected in the soaring global M2 levels, which should create an environment ripe for Bitcoin and other crypto assets to benefit from increased liquidity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Net Position Turns Green For The First Time In 2025 In terms of a price target, the current trajectory of the global M2 money supply points to a rally above $140,000. However, interesting predictions have suggested that the Bitcoin price has a chance of doubling before the end of 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $84,310, having spent the last 24 hours trading in a range between $83,700 and $84,300. Based on this analysis of correlation with the global M2 money, bullish Bitcoin investors might need to wait for at least another month before any significant movement. This delay might pose challenges for short-term traders depending on their positioning and risk tolerance. On the other hand, it gives long-term holders the opportunity to accumulate more bitcoins at the current low price before the predicted rally.

AAVE is on the edge of a significant squeeze, while Stacks faces a crucial resistance level. The market's next move could determine the future path for both coins. Investors are watching closely, eager to see if these assets will break out or break down. Aave Market Trends: Past Movements and Key Levels Analysis Last month Aave saw a notable decline of 28.64%, contrasting with a six-month gain of 11.15% that signals recovery and resilience. Price behavior over these periods reflects significant volatility with a temporary dip that has given way to a moderate rebound across a broader timeline. Current price action is trading between $136 and $290.80 with support around $79.81 and resistance near $389.26, while a second resistance appears at $543.99. Indicators show mixed pressure with a slightly negative summary recommendation and moving averages, indicating rivalry between bulls and bears. Traders may consider opportunities around these levels, potentially buying near support and targeting the initial resistance. Stacks Slump Hints at Bearish Pressure and Key Price Barriers Last month STX showed a notable drop of nearly 29%, while the half-year performance displayed a decline of roughly 64%. Price behavior indicated a strong downward movement that negatively impacted investor sentiment and led to a decline in momentum. The overall trend during these periods strongly leaned toward lower values, with negative indicators highlighting ongoing pressure on the coin. Current prices range from approximately $0.58 to $1.21, with immediate resistance around $1.60 and support near $0.32. Bears dominate the market, as evidenced by the negative momentum and a sub-50 RSI. Traders might look for a potential bounce from the support level before testing resistance, although a clear uptrend has not yet developed. Conclusion AAVE and STX are at critical points. AAVE is under strong pressure and must find stability. STX faces a key resistance level that could determine its path. Decisions made now will shape their futures. Market trends and investor reactions will be crucial. Watching these developments closely is essential for understanding their next moves.

Report shows that banks still hesitate to work with crypto companies, making it difficult to open accounts, process payments, and run their businesses smoothly. Many believe this is part of “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” While President Donald Trump has shown support for the crypto industry , experts believe that the problem of debanking is yet over. DeBanking Issues Persists Amid Crypto-Friendly Policies The issue of debanking has been ongoing for years, but it got worse in early 2023 when many crypto-friendly banks started to collapse . This made people worry that the government was trying to stop crypto investors from using traditional banks, calling this situation “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” In 2025, President Trump took several steps in favor of cryptocurrency. He recently ordered that Bitcoin seized from criminal cases be used to create a national reserve. However, despite these efforts, crypto firms continue to struggle with banking access. The Federal Reserve Is Still Against Crypto Banking In a recent interview, Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank , stated that the Federal Reserve remains a major obstacle. She pointed out that two crypto-friendly banks are currently under close examination by the Fed. Some regulatory officials have allegedly pressured certain banks to halt digital asset operations, citing regulatory uncertainty. Long believes this is part of a larger strategy to regulate how banks engage with cryptocurrency tightly. Even though some regulators have relaxed their rules on crypto, the Federal Reserve has not changed its stance. Many in the industry are concerned since the agency is still led by officials appointed before Trump’s latest moves. They fear the restrictions will persist until new leadership takes over. A Global Problem for Crypto Firms Crypto companies outside the U.S. are also facing similar challenges. In Europe, many crypto firms have had their bank accounts shut down multiple times in recent years. Some companies have been forced to move their operations from one country to another to find banks working with them. Crypto businesses have lost time and money trying to work with banks. Many spend years and millions searching for a bank, only to face rejection. Even those following all the rules still struggle for basic services. While 2024 was a better year for some European crypto firms, the issue has not been fully solved. Regardless, many hope that the situation will improve. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently announced a more relaxed approach to how banks can work with crypto businesses. This decision came just hours after President Trump promised to end the crackdown on crypto firms’ banking access. During the White House Crypto Summit, the president assured industry leaders that he was ending Operation Chokepoint 2.0. Despite these promises, many in the industry remain cautious.

Messari’s latest analysis revealed that the figure rose from $51.2 million to $79.5 million. Market Participation Plummets Despite this growth, both the average daily sellers and buyers declined significantly, with daily sellers dropping 43.0% from approximately 1,500 to 880, and daily buyers falling 38.1% from about 1,300 to 800. This suggests a shift toward higher average transaction values amid fewer market participants. The sales surge was primarily driven by strong demand for Guild of Guardians Heroes and Avatars NFTs, which accounted for more than 99% of the total NFT trading volume in the quarter. Most of the sales occurred on Immutable zkEVM, where Guild of Guardians NFTs are traded. Immutable zkEVM also saw a substantial 73.3% rise in average daily NFT sales volume, growing from around $484,000 in Q3 to $839,000 in Q4, boosting its share of total sales volume to over 97% across both chains. During the same period, Immutable zkEVM saw a decline in user engagement following record highs in Q3. In fact, average daily transactions decreased by 21.1% quarter-over-quarter, from approximately 595,000 in Q3 to around 469,000 in Q4. Similarly, average daily active addresses dropped 23.8%, from about 267,000 to 204,000, and average daily new addresses fell 29.8% to roughly 32,000 by the end of the quarter. This decline in activity mirrored broader trends in the GameFi market, which according to Messari, likely reflects a cooldown after the surge in Q3 driven by popular game releases like Guild of Guardians, Immortal Rising 2, and Illuvium. Throughout last year, Immutable progressively expanded developer access to zkEVM. In October, the platform removed its deployer allowlist which allowed for permissionless deployment of smart contracts and applications. This move lowers entry barriers for developers, positioning Immutable zkEVM for increased developer activity in the coming months. In Q4 2024, average daily transaction fees on Immutable zkEVM fell by 17.0% quarter-over-quarter, from approximately 574 IMX to 477 IMX. Messari attributed this decline to reduced network congestion, which was a result of lower transaction activity during the period. To improve the user experience, Immutable has implemented a policy where it covers all gas fees for Immutable Passport holders, removing the need for players to pay gas fees and thereby reducing friction in the transaction process. By the end of 2024, the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) on Immutable decreased to $13.8 million. This decline was likely due to a quarter-over-quarter drop in the price of the IMX token, which reduced the USD value of locked assets. However, TVL measured in IMX showed a positive trend, increasing by almost 17% quarter-over-quarter to 10.33 million IMX, which suggests that the rise could have been driven by capital inflows despite the decrease in USD value. Immutable’s SEC Trouble On November 1, 2024, Immutable announced that it had received a Wells notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – an enforcement action concerning its 2021 IMX token sales. Immutable expressed concerns over the notice and released a statement saying that it was issued with limited prior communication and minimal details. The company had then highlighted that the notice was delivered shortly after its first direct interaction with the securities regulators which raised questions about the timing and transparency of the process. Fast forward to 2025, the SEC has closed several of its crypto investigations, with no enforcement charges resulting from probes into OpenSea , Gemini , Robinhood Crypto, and Uniswap . However, investigations into Immutable, and other platforms such as Crypto.com, and Unicoin are still ongoing.

According to recent technical analysis, this resistance zone has triggered past reversals, and analysts caution that another failure to break above could lead to a downward correction. The altcoin is trading within a descending channel, a pattern typically associated with bearish trends. While some analysts remain optimistic about a potential rebound, others warn that the next move could push ETH price lower, targeting a key support of $1,700. Analysts Warn of Ethereum Price Potential Fall to $1,700 According to a recent analysis, Ethereum price is nearing a resistance zone at $2,200. This level coincides with the upper boundary of a Descending Channel. Technical analysts consider this pattern bearish. Price movements within the channel have shown lower highs and lower lows, indicating downward pressure. Crypto analyst MadWhale shared a chart showing Ethereum trading close to this critical resistance. Previous interactions with this level have led to downward reversals. The analyst suggests that failure to break this zone may trigger a 13% decline. The projected target is $1,700, a level that has previously served as support. Source: TradingView More so, another recent analysis shows that ETH/BTC is currently testing a critical support zone last seen in late 2020, raising the possibility of a trend reversal after years of decline. This technical setup, combined with record-high futures open interest of 10.23M ETH, signals a rising potential for a rebound. Technical Indicators Support a Bearish Outlook The Ethereum price chart also shows weakening bullish momentum. A rounded top pattern is forming near the resistance. This technical formation suggests that buying pressure is declining. Volume analysis reveals that trading activity is inconsistent, with low participation during recent gains and higher volume during declines. Lower highs on the daily chart further support a potential downward continuation. These are typical in bearish trends. Traders are advised to monitor for signs of increased selling pressure. Confirmation of a rejection, such as a bearish candlestick pattern or rising sell volume, could strengthen the case for a decline toward $1,700. According to the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), ETH is currently showing signs of waning bearish momentum as the MACD line is approaching a bullish crossover with the signal line. If this crossover occurs and is supported by increasing histogram bars, it could indicate a potential price rebound for the top altcoin. Alternate Scenario: Analyst Forecasts Bullish Targets While bearish indicators persist, some market observers maintain a positive view. Analyst Patron has outlined three possible bullish price targets. According to his analysis, if the top altcoin holds support near $1,980, a short-term rally could occur. His initial target is $2,296, reflecting a potential increase of over 15%. Source: X Further upside targets include $2,913 and $4,000. These projections assume that current support holds and momentum shifts in favor of buyers. The analyst’s outlook is based on Ethereum price recovering from recent lows and reclaiming previous highs. This scenario would challenge the bearish narrative if confirmed by increased volume. At press time, the crypto is trading at $1,999.75, marking a 1.20% gain over the past 24 hours. Despite the price uptick, trading volume has dropped sharply by 37.37%, indicating a possible divergence.

The whale, who first acquired Bitcoin in late 2016, had been holdings in a single address for nearly a decade. In early 2017, the whale’s BTC holdings were worth around $3 million. Today, the same assets are worth over $250 million due to Bitcoin’s massive price increase over the years. The sudden movement at this long-inactive address has led to speculation about the whale’s intentions. Such movements typically precede market changes, as large holders may be either preparing to sell or reallocating funds for other purposes.

42176232,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=698164,1742685372,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42176232.jpeg,"Trump’s economic policies put $5,000 DOGE dividend checks on hold",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-delays-5000-doge-checks/,"The $5,000 DOGE dividend checks sit in limbo as stock markets quiver and inflation fears grow. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plans and revived pleas for the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates complicate the economic landscape. Despite growing anticipation, taxpayers remain in the dark about the direct payment stimulus checks. Trump has maintained that the economic toll from tariffs is a necessary “detox” for the US economy. Yet his administration’s hesitance to issue direct payments — despite its initial backing of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — points to a move away from immediate financial relief toward more systemic economic restructuring. As Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues its effort to gut the government, the idea has been floated that savings could end up in checks mailed to taxpayers . Trump had embraced the notion before, describing it as a “20% dividend” from less waste and inefficiency. Analysts had estimated that the amount to each taxpaying household could approach $5,000, but economic turmoil has placed the proposal on the back burner. “If you can save the government $2 trillion, that’s $5,000 per household. Even if we save only half that, it’s still $2,500,” James Fishback, the CEO of an investment firm, said in an interview. “That’s real money.” However, leading economists caution that flooding the economy with large sums could stoke inflation rather than ease financial hardship. America finds it difficult to walk a thin line between headline inflation and stimulus MDRN Capital CEO Aaron Cirksena warned that stimulus checks threaten to ignite the already blistering-hot economy. Cirksena cautioned that putting $5,000 into the economy per household sounds nice but can be inflationary. He estimated that spending would create demand and inflation, and saving or investing would push it out but leave a hole in the future. Another Trump aide, Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, defended the plan and dismissed worries about inflation. The notion that the checks would cause inflation was not rooted in actual economics, he said, and if tax cuts are spent in the long term by returning money to taxpayers, then the cuts will finance themselves. Since the administration has previously expressed interest in DOGE dividends, it will value tax reductions, infrastructure spending, and tariffs over direct payments. Cirksena also elaborated that Trump’s approach seems more investment-oriented in the industry than in cash payments to people. Cirksena likened direct cash stimulus to an adrenaline injection, which was swift but fleeting. He also referred to infrastructure investment as a strength program that, although slower to come together, lasted longer. Jonathan Ernest, a Case Western Reserve University professor, was also concerned about the same issue; he reasoned that stimulus checks would counteract the Federal Reserve’s move to lower inflation. Since inflation is still in excess, the addition of stimulus now would be contrary to monetary policy currently, DOGE dividend’s future is uncertain Alice Kassens, the Center for Economic Freedom director and a professor of economics at Roanoke College said that much depends on how recipients spend the payout. The plan was designed to give dividends only to net payers of income taxes, she noted, hoping that, unlike pandemic-era stimulus checks (meant to maintain consumption), the money would be saved by households that save more. The $5,000 DOGE dividend is currently in limbo. Trump has not fully eliminated it, but the economy’s current state and changes in policy priorities suggest that the initiative is on indefinite hold. Ernest pointed out the irony that if Trump’s tariffs and job cuts destabilized the economy enough, a stimulus payment may become necessary. The administration may reconsider the idea if economic pressures build, with national debts now topping $36 trillion and midterm elections coming up. Until then, a taxpayer hunting for DOGE dividends will have to wait. Besides, the DOGE dividends have been met with skepticism as to whether achieving the big savings required is feasible. Experts and lawmakers said it was impractical to find such significant waste within the federal budget. The proposal would also exclude some low-income people, retirees, and certain families; DOGE checks would only go to tax-paying households. The plan is also difficult to implement because it requires Congress’ approval, and there was skepticism over whether the suggested savings would be realized.

The unfolding market dynamics suggest that these two digital currencies may be gearing up for notable movement. Discover which coins are poised for potential growth amidst these developments. Solana Price Insights: Recent Trends and Key Levels SOL dropped nearly 23% over the past month and about 10% over the last six months, with a slight 3% decline in the past week. Price movements have been uneven, marking a period of volatility and mixed momentum. Technical swings have highlighted both sharp corrections and brief recoveries, indicating ongoing uncertainty in past performance. Currently, SOL trades between $104 and $213.04, facing immediate resistance at $277.85 and further overhead at $386.39 while support stands near $60.77.

Ethereum Price Trends: Key Levels & Recent Market Movements Monthly drop of 26.77% and a half-year decline of 22.93% mark the recent performance. A one-week gain of 3.95% hints at fleeting recovery amid overall weakness and volatility. Price adjustments over these periods reflect investor caution and a challenging environment for the coin.

While the premier cryptocurrency recorded a price breakout on March 20 to reclaim the $87,000 price zone, selling pressure soon forced a return to below $84,700, resuming a sideways movement. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price action over the past few months has created a bullish pattern hinting at a substantial price breakout. Related Reading: Is It Time To Buy The Bitcoin Dip? Analysts Share Insights On Current Market Conditions Bitcoin Falling Wedge Signals Another Major Rally- How High Can BTC Fly? In a recent post on X, a digital asset market analyst with the username Mister Crypto provided some bullish insights on the Bitcoin market based on a continuation chart pattern and historical price data. According to Mister Crypto, Bitcoin’s price appears to be forming a falling wedge suggesting a possible price surge could occur upon breakout. The falling wedge is a familiar bullish pattern in technical analysis formed by two converging trend lines due to price action forming lower highs and lower lows. It usually indicates that bearish momentum is weakening and Bitcoin could embark on a sustained uptrend following a breakout from the upper trend line. Interestingly, Mister Crypto notes that Bitcoin has consistently experienced strong price rallies following previous formations of a falling wedge as indicated in the chart above. Notably, there have been three distinct cases in the past two years during which the premier cryptocurrency has surged for an average of 54 days producing an average gain of 67.5%. Looking at the previous periods and the gradual rise in price gain, Bitcoin could rise by an estimated 77% upon a confirmed breakout from its current falling wedge suggesting a strong bullish market in the majority of Q2 2025.

This development is strongly bullish as it indicates growing market confidence in price appreciation as investors are opting to keep their assets rather than sell. At the time of trading, Bitcoin trades at $84,309 reflecting a price loss of 0.14% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the flagship crypto asset is down by 0.39% on the 7-day chart as consolidation continues. BTC must decisively break above $84,700, avoiding any retrace to confirm any intent of an uptrend.

The lending option will target long-term Bitcoin holders who might need access to cash but don't want to sell their digital assets. Many crypto holders choose to sit on their investments by holding them in secure Bitcoin wallets . While the best crypto wallets will facilitate easy access and use, there are still many consumers who see crypto as an investment opportunity and choose to sit on it rather than use it as an active digital currency. How the Loans Will Work Xapo Bank now offers US Dollar loans of up to £1 million to customers and their product differs from previous crypto-backed loan products. They offer no collateral re-usage on BTC assets and store the collateral in their purpose-built crypto-vault which uses MPC (multiparty computation custody. The product offers flexible terms with repayment schedules available from just 30 days, up to 90, 180, and 365 days. Customers will also benefit from there being no penalties attached to early repayments. Eligibility As with any financial product, eligibility factors will come into who can apply for these loans. Consumers will be pre-approved for the loans based on eligibility criteria established by XapoBank. The most significant factor that will affect eligibility is how much Bitcoin holdings the consumer has and how long they have held it for. Long-term holdings will be preferred, with the product being made available to global investors, excluding the United States. Could this Signal a Return to Crypto Lending This is not the first time crypto lending products have been offered to consumers, but it has taken 3 years for the industry to recover from the bear market in 2022 which led to the collapse of lenders including BlockFi and Celsius. The collapse of the crypto lending industry resulted in a loss of trust that Xapo Bank is working hard to restore. By offering a product that removes asset rehypothecation and providing customers with a variety of risk management tools and protection against automatic liquidation, Xapo Bank is beginning to gain the trust of consumers. The Current Crypto Climate The end of 2024 and the beginning of 2025 saw cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin in particular, enjoy record-breaking valuations. This came as a result of political backing, particularly in the US. Plans for America to implement a transparent regulatory framework for crypto businesses have seen renewed confidence in digital currencies. While recent values have dropped, they still remain relatively high across the board and this has seen greater adoption across consumers and businesses. With more businesses around the world beginning to accept cryptocurrencies because of the countless benefits to international transactions, the industry is starting to appeal to those who might have previously seen it as a fad. Speculation about the US Federal Reserve stepping in to stabilize markets and rumours of the White House planning to invest heavily in Bitcoin has experts predicting another Bitcoin price boom, which could be great news for lenders and consumers.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-03-22 23:36:38

The temporary delay will give ByteDance time to sell its well-known social media platform. However, if it does not find a buyer for TikTok’s U.S. operations, then the ban passed by Congress will take effect on April 5. Oracle moves forward, becoming the centre of focus in the TikTok deal Vice President JD Vance told reporters that it was almost certain that a high-level agreement would address U.S. national security issues by early April. In addition, President Trump said last weekend that four bidders had shown up, but he did not name them. Names proposed earlier by Trump and others included Microsoft (MSFT), AI startup Perplexity, a coalition of billionaire investors, and even the U.S. government. However, Oracle’s name kept coming up. Notably, Oracle previously attempted to acquire TikTok in 2020 during Trump’s first term but failed. Despite this, the company remains deeply involved with TikTok as its primary cloud provider. In 2022, Tiktok began directing its U.S. traffic through Oracle’s cloud as part of a “Project Texas” overhaul to comply with U.S. regulations on domestic data storage. A report published last week revealed that Oracle recently became a top candidate to help TikTok escape its current situation. However, the executives of ByteDance are said to want to continue to be actively involved in TikTok’s business operations in any such agreement. Bloomberg separately reported that the White House is considering a deal with Oracle to give the tech giant a stake in the company in exchange for protecting American data on TikTok while leaving ByteDance control of the app’s algorithm. On the other hand, TikTok and its CEO, Shou Zi Chew, have repeatedly resisted sharing the app’s proprietary algorithm. A request for comment from Oracle and TikTok was not answered. On Friday, Reuters presented another Oracle scenario stating that while Oracle safeguarded U.S. user data to prevent China from accessing it, the largest non-Chinese investors in ByteDance may increase their current holdings and purchase TikTok’s U.S. operations as part of a new company. In this case, Chinese ownership in the new company would drop under the crucial 20% level to avoid the U.S. ban. Among these investors are General Atlantic, owned by Bill Ford, and Susquehanna International Group, owned by Jeff Yass. Vice President JD Vance remains optimistic that an agreement on TikTok will be reached Although Politico reported earlier that Oracle is “accelerating talks” with the White House on TikTok and that company representatives were scheduled to visit Capitol Hill last week to meet with lawmakers regarding the negotiations, reports indicated that no deal had yet been finalized on the platform. In an interview with NBC on Friday, Vance said that although an agreement on TikTok would probably be reached by April 5, it was still unclear whether the deal would be finalized by then. He highlighted that similar deals, which were much smaller and required less capital, took months to close. “I think that the outlines of this thing will be very clear by April 5,” Vance said. “The question is whether we can get all the paper done.” Since the Chinese government needed to approve any measure in which ByteDance divests from TikTok, one significant issue that was reportedly still up for debate was whether or not it would approve any final TikTok deal. However, China has recently become less aggressive, stating that such business deals should be determined independently per market principles. The Chinese government and ByteDance have long opposed any attempts to sell TikTok. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Bitcoin’s meteoric rise created fortunes overnight, but its window of opportunity has already closed. Now, the focus has shifted to finding the next top-rated crypto that could follow a similar explosive path. With dozens of contenders, five names are grabbing attention for all the right reasons: Solana (SOL), Aave (AAVE), Ethereum (ETH), BlockDAG (BDAG), and Thorchain (RUNE). These projects are not just surviving—they’re building momentum. If you”re wondering where the next big opportunity lies, now is the time to take a closer look before prices move beyond reach. 1. BlockDAG: Could Be the Top-Rated Crypto Soon BlockDAG (BDAG) is catching the eye of serious buyers. With its advanced hybrid blockchain tech, BDAG delivers faster transaction speeds and superior scalability through its DAG-based model. This approach gives BlockDAG a clear advantage over traditional blockchains bogged down by slow processing and high fees. What’s driving BlockDAG’s appeal? Its presale numbers are setting records. The project has already raised over $205 million, with its price sitting at $0.0248 in batch 27. Early buyers are enjoying a 2,380% return, drawing even more interest as word spreads. The excitement suggests another price surge may be just around the corner. Right now, BlockDAG is offering its most generous bonus yet—400% extra coins with the BDAG800 code. For anyone eyeing the next top-rated crypto, BDAG offers a window of opportunity that may not stay open for long. 2. Aave (AAVE): DeFi Lending That’s Gaining Ground Aave (AAVE) has earned its place in the DeFi space by making crypto lending and borrowing seamless and accessible. Users can deposit their digital assets, earn interest, and borrow funds through Aave’s smart contracts—all without middlemen. Its liquidity pools support major assets like Tether (USDT) and DAI, giving it a key role in DeFi. What sets Aave apart is its push into real-world assets through its partnership with Centrifuge. This move bridges traditional finance with blockchain, expanding its use cases. As DeFi grows, AAVE could prove to be the top-rated crypto for those betting on decentralized finance. 3. Solana (SOL): Speed & Low Fees Keep It in the Spotlight Solana (SOL) continues to impress with its lightning-fast transactions and affordable fees. It emerged as one of the strongest alternatives to Ethereum, thanks to a growing community of developers launching DeFi projects, NFT marketplaces, and more on its blockchain. Despite facing major challenges in 2022 and 2023, Solana has staged an impressive comeback in 2024. It’s already delivered significant returns, but analysts believe there’s still upside potential left. With its network efficiency and expanding ecosystem, Solana remains a top-rated crypto worth watching. 4. Ethereum (ETH): The Original Smart Contract Powerhouse Ethereum (ETH) remains a leader in blockchain innovation. It pioneered smart contracts and built the foundation for thousands of decentralized applications (dApps). As the second-largest crypto by market cap, Ethereum continues to anchor DeFi, NFTs, and countless blockchain projects. Its 2022 shift to proof-of-stake dramatically cut energy usage by over 99.9%. In July 2024, the SEC approved Ethereum ETFs, boosting its reputation and reach. While competitors are emerging, Ethereum’s long-established dominance and mainstream adoption keep it in the conversation as a top-rated crypto. 5. Thorchain (RUNE): The Decentralized Exchange Gaining Momentum Thorchain (RUNE) offers a compelling alternative to centralized exchanges. As a decentralized exchange (DEX), it allows users to trade over 5,500 cryptocurrencies directly from their wallets without relying on middlemen. Its automated market maker (AMM) model guarantees liquidity, making transactions simple and secure. Following the collapse of centralized platforms like FTX in 2022, many traders are turning to decentralized solutions. Thorchain gives users full control of their funds, establishing itself as the top-rated crypto for those prioritizing security and decentralization in their trading experience. Which Project Will Earn the Title of Top-Rated Crypto? Still weighing your options for the top-rated crypto? Aave’s expansion into real-world lending gives it an edge in DeFi. Thorchain appeals to those seeking decentralized, self-custodial trading platforms. Solana and Ethereum remain key players, but their past highs and continued market swings make them riskier bets for cautious investors. BlockDAG, however, is just beginning its rise. Currently priced at $0.0248 in its presale, BDAG holds enormous growth potential. With more than $205 million raised and early buyers seeing 2,380% gains, BlockDAG is making its case as the next top-rated crypto to buy now.

42178917,https://thecoinrise.com/heres-why-miners-are-leaving-pi-network-for-blockdags-x1-mining-app/,1742688008,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/42178917.jpeg,Here’s Why Miners Are Leaving Pi Network for BlockDAG’s X1 Mining App,https://thecoinrise.com/heres-why-miners-are-leaving-pi-network-for-blockdags-x1-mining-app/,"Crypto mining has undergone a major transformation. Gone are the days when high-cost hardware and huge energy demands were the only way in. Mobile mining has opened up the process to millions, and for a time, Pi Network led the charge, offering a free and straightforward method to earn crypto. But times have changed. Pi Network has seen its price fall by 23% in just one week, and confidence among its user base is fading. In response, many miners are shifting their focus to BlockDAG X1 App, now recognized by many as the best crypto mining app in the market. With over 500,000 users mining BDAG daily, the X1 App is reshaping mobile mining. While Pi Network struggles to hold attention and value, BlockDAG’s growing ecosystem, robust presale, and pathway to major exchanges stand out. Here’s why so many are making the move to BlockDAG—and why mining BDAG now could pay off if its value reaches the projected $1 mark. Pi Network’s Struggles Are Pushing Miners to New Opportunities Pi Network was once seen as a leader in mobile crypto mining. However, delays in its mainnet launch, liquidity concerns, and falling prices have raised serious doubts about its future. Its price has dropped 23% in just seven days, down to $1.38. Meanwhile, investor withdrawals continue to climb. If this negative trend persists, Pi Network may not hold its $1.19 support level, with further declines toward $1.00 likely. These ongoing issues are prompting miners to seek out more promising alternatives. BlockDAG’s X1 App has quickly gained traction as a trusted solution. Its stable platform and efficient mining process offer users a better opportunity to earn BDAG coins without the uncertainty. Why BlockDAG’s X1 Miner Is Emerging as the Best Crypto Mining App 1. Easy and Accessible—Mining BDAG Is Simple for Everyone BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App stands apart from traditional mining methods. Instead of investing in expensive equipment or facing high energy costs, users can mine BDAG with a single tap each day. The app works on both iOS and Android, making it accessible to anyone, regardless of their technical skills. No costly hardware required—just a smartphone. No rising electricity bills—mobile mining remains energy-efficient. One-tap simplicity—just open the app daily to earn BDAG. 2. BlockDAG’s Ecosystem Is Expanding Fast BlockDAG’s presale has made headlines, raising over $205 million and selling 18.8 billion BDAG coins at a current price of $0.0248 in Batch 27. This success inspires confidence among early miners and suggests that BDAG could become a valuable asset once listed on exchanges. Unlike Pi Network, which still faces challenges securing exchange listings, BlockDAG has already confirmed plans for over 10 major centralized exchange listings after its presale. The BDAG coins being mined today are expected to be tradable soon, potentially increasing their worth substantially. 3. Real Earnings—Earn 20 BDAG Per Day with Significant Upside One of the key advantages of using the X1 App is the potential to accumulate BDAG without spending money upfront. The earnings breakdown looks like this: Daily reward: 20 BDAG Monthly total: 600 BDAG (20 BDAG x 30 days) Annual total: 7,200 BDAG (20 BDAG x 365 days) At BDAG’s current price of $0.0248, this annual total is worth $178.56. If BDAG achieves its $1 target post-listing, those same coins could be valued at $7,200—a staggering 3,932% increase from current mining rewards. Why Mining BDAG with BlockDAG’s X1 App Makes Sense Now 1. Major Growth Potential—BDAG Could Hit $1 BlockDAG’s adoption is accelerating, and its DAG-based parallel processing technology gives it a real edge over older blockchains. As exchange listings approach, demand for BDAG could surge. Those who mine early through the X1 App might secure life-changing gains if BDAG hits the predicted $1 value. 2. Zero-Cost Passive Income Mining with BlockDAG’s X1 App is entirely free, removing the financial risks typically tied to traditional mining. Users collect BDAG daily, without worrying about hardware investments or energy consumption, while waiting for potential price increases. 3. BlockDAG’s Ecosystem Continues to Grow Beyond mining, BlockDAG is building a complete blockchain ecosystem. Notable initiatives include: A $30 million Developer Grants Program designed to attract DeFi, NFT, and dApp projects. A partnership with HackerEarth to host global hackathons, driving innovation within the network. Collaboration with SpaceDev to provide technical expertise and enhance BlockDAG’s infrastructure. These developments show that BDAG isn’t just another token—it’s a long-term player with increasing adoption and utility. What’s Next for Mobile Mining? While Pi Network’s future remains uncertain, BlockDAG has stepped up as the best crypto mining app of 2025. Its easy-to-use X1 Miner, record-setting presale, and soon-to-launch CEX listings make it an attractive option for miners seeking strong potential returns with zero upfront investment. Miners who start collecting BDAG today could see their holdings grow dramatically if BDAG hits $1. With over 500,000 users already mining through the X1 App, the opportunity to get in early won’t last forever.

Binance Launchpool, which lets users stake coins to farm new assets, says its 65th project will be Nillion (NIL), a secure computation network that decentralizes trust for high-value and private data. Explains the project, “Nillion is Humanity’s First Blind Computer – a whole new category of decentralized network designed for AI and the future of the Internet. Nillion makes new applications possible by providing storage and computation on high-value, encrypted data without ever seeing it. Whether a user, an app, or an enterprise, your data stays yours – always.” Between March 21st and 24th, Binance users can lock their BNB , the crypto exchange platform’s native asset, as well as the stablecoins First Digital USD ( FDUSD ) and USDC , to receive NIL airdrops. The top global crypto exchange then plans to list the asset on March 24th. Binance will attach a seed tag to NIL, which the exchange applies to lower-liquidity projects that may exhibit higher volatility compared to other listed tokens. Binance requires users who own assets with seed tags to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they’re aware of the risks before trading the tokens.

Ethereum (ETH) Bulls Defending $2,000 Support After Profit-Taking Phase Ethereum (ETH) ended the week on a strong note signaling enhanced optimism ahead of the impending Pectra mainnet update . Hoodi network update deployment. Following former U.S. President Donald Trump’s appearance at Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit, ETH price surged to a weekly high above $2,070. Ethereum price action | March 23 However, amid the rally, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to pause interest rate hikes boosted risk-on sentiment across crypto markets. This led traders to take early profits on large ETH and BTC holdings, shifting capital toward low-cap altcoins with high-growth potential. As the market rotation cools, ETH price has shown signs of active buy-side pressure. As of March 23, Ethereum price continues to consolidate well above key support levels. Investors Deposit $220M into Ethereum 2.0 Staking Contracts in 48 Hours When Ethereum price dropped below $2,000 on Friday, many expected cascading liquidations to drive prices lower. However, 48 hours later, ETH has remained resilient above the $1,950 mark. On-chain data trends suggest increased staking among investors has helped stabilize prices. Official Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain contracts show a significant surge in ETH deposits within the last 48 hours. Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain Staking Deposits as of March 23, 2025 | Source: Beaconcha.in Investors held 33.72 million ETH staked on March 20. That figure has now risen by 110,000 ETH, reaching 33.83 million at press time. Valued at current prices, this indicates that investors have staked over $220 million worth of ETH in just two days, coinciding with Ethereum’s consolidation phase around the $2,000 level. Ethereum Price Outlook Today: $1,950 Stop-loss Intact if Current Staking surge persists Ethereum price consolidation around $2,000 has coincide with in significant 110,000 ETH staking deposits in the last 48 hours. This suggests that Ethereum’s declining trading volume is not entirely due to investor disinterest or a shift toward low-cap assets. Instead, some investors are also reallocating assets into staking contracts to mitigate downside risks and earn yield income. By pulling 110,000 ETH from short-term supply, this has reduced sell-side pressure, forcing buyers to bid higher in a market with fewer available tokens, which supports a mildly bullish outlook for ETH price to consolidate above the $1950 support for the coming trading sessions. Ethereum Technical Price Analysis Today: $2,100 Resistance to Limits Short-term profits Ethereum price forecast signals are swinging positive, amid the ongoing consolidation phase. As investors weigh recent staking inflows against macroeconomic uncertainties, ETH is currently trades at $1,979, holding above critical support at $1,950. The bullish scenario suggests that sustained staking demand and the Bollinger Bands indicator tightening could precede a breakout. Notably, ETH price is testing the middle Bollinger Band (~$2,005), which, if breached, may open the door to a rally toward $2,100. Additionally, the MACD remains in positive momentum, hinting at potential buyer re-entry. Ethereum Technical Price Analysis Today: On the bearish side, failure to reclaim $2,000 may invite sellers back into the market. The lower Bollinger Band ($1,768) serves as a key downside target if Ethereum loses the $1,950 support. Declining trading volumes also indicate weakening demand, reinforcing the possibility of a breakdown. Traders should watch for a decisive move above $2,005 or below $1,950 to confirm ETH’s next major direction.

However, one crypto expert has waded in to explain the delay behind a potential listing, citing a dire lack of transparency by the Pi Core Team. Pi Network Needs A High Level Of Transparency Pseudonymous crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin has explained the reason behind Pi Network’s absence on top cryptocurrency exchanges. According to a post on X, Dr Altcoin noted that the reason may be a lack of transparency by the Pi Core Team. Dr Altcoin noted that the transparency issue revolves around Pi Network’s tokenomics. Per the analyst, information on the locking mechanism for Pi Network remains shrouded in mystery. “It is likely that the Pi Core Team has not been transparent enough about the locking and burning mechanism involving the billions of Pi coins currently owned by the PCT,” read the post. At the moment, Pi Network is not listed on centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Coinbase. While whispers of an imminent listing are growing louder, Binance excluded the asset from its Vote To List program. Decreasing Circulating Supply Leaves Community Scratching Their Heads A closer look at Pi Network’s tokenomics reveals a decline in its circulating supply to 6.77 billion. The Pi Core Team removed 10 million coins from circulating in what Dr. Altcoin described as an attempt at price control ahead of a token unlock . “Without transparency, this could easily be misconstrued as potential plans for market manipulation, as we have seen indications of this in recent days,” said Dr Altcoin. A previous token unlock sent prices cascading to new lows but a burn roadmap is in development for the network. Experts say burning Pi Network tokens will prevent a steep drop in prices. However, some community members disagree with Dr Altcoin’s theory of a lack of transparency behind Pi Network’s listing delays. The cross-section of community members says the delay stems from the Pi Core Team refusing to pay exchanges for a listing. They argue that the Pi Core Team is seeking a free listing from exchanges, taking the longer route. Pi is trading at $1 and is down 66% from its all-time high of $2.98 that it set in February.

The potential for a price rebound is creating a stir in the crypto market. Investors are keen to discover if these coins are poised for growth. Dive into the latest analysis to see what could be on the horizon for ADA and XLM. Cardano’s 6-Month Surge Amid Short-Term Adjustments Cardano climbed over 100% in the past six months, alongside a 7.88% monthly dip and a 3.39% decline last week. This performance highlights strong long-term growth balanced by recent short-term corrections, likely due to profit-taking. Despite these pullbacks, Cardano has maintained a notable upward trend over the last half-year, indicating resilience in its price movement. Current prices trade between$ 0.44 and $0.88, with resistance testing at $1.15 and another hurdle at $1.59, while support remains at $0.26. Slightly negative indicators and an RSI around 46 suggest a selling bias in the market. Traders might look for entries near support or wait for a clear break above resistance, given the uncertainty in the trend. Stellar Price Dynamics: Short-Term Dip, Long-Term Rise Stellar has faced an 18.65% decline in the past month, which stands in stark contrast to its impressive 189.83% gain over the last six months. The recent trading sessions have exhibited notable volatility, with a slight increase of 0.964% over the past week providing a glimmer of hope amid short-term setbacks. This price activity indicates that Stellar's recent struggles are set against its stronger, longer-term performance, characterized by both sharp declines and substantial recoveries over half a year. Stellar is currently trading between $0.2193 and $0.3871, with immediate resistance at $0.4877 and support at $0.1521. Although bears are currently dominant, the absence of a clear trend presents traders with chances to buy near support levels and sell around resistance. Maintaining tight positions could prove beneficial for a potential breakout in either direction. Conclusion ADA and XLM have shown promising buy signals. This presents a good opportunity for a potential price bounce. Both coins have key strengths that could attract attention. The market conditions appear favorable for these tokens. Investors might consider this as a moment to observe their performance closely. While no guarantees exist, the current indicators suggest possible gains ahead.

Why ADA Has Fallen 70% Since Its 2021 Peak and the Best Competitor Crypto For 2025 Gains,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-cardano-ada-ever-cross-3-again-why-ada-has-fallen-70-since-its-2021-peak-and-the-best-competitor-crypto-for-2025-gains/,"Cardano (ADA) investors are wondering whether the token will ever reclaim the $3 mark after falling nearly 70% from its 2021 peak of $3.10. Currently trading around $0.73, ADA has struggled due to slower-than-expected adoption and increased competition from other blockchain networks. While some believe a market-wide rally could push ADA higher, others are looking for stronger alternatives. One standout competitor is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gained momentum. The project is emerging as a high-growth performer in its recently launched presale. The presale is now in phase 3 after selling out more than 50%. Over $4.4 million has been raised, attracting more than 6300 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.02 before the price jumps 25% to $0.025 in phase 4. Investors have limited time to join the presale as it nears conclusion. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows The evolution of decentralized lending through Mutuum Finance proved its dual-lending model as a key factor in achieving its triple-digit customer growth. A remarkable number of investors has backed the project through its presale by supplying $4.4 million from over 6300 contributors. Customers can seize major profit potential by buying MUTM during Phase 3 for $0.02 since the token price will surge to $0.025 in Phase 4. Experts regard MUTM as one of the most undervalued yet promising DeFi protocols because it unites strong market demand with distinctive lending features which they believe could reach above $2 after the launch. Mutuum Finance is special in the sense that it blends both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. The P2C model allows users to accrue passive income through USDT liquidity pools, enjoying the fruits of automated smart contract-based lending. Meanwhile, the P2P model provides direct transactions without intermediaries, giving users full control over their funds. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. Building a Secure and Stable Ecosystem Users can find evidence of Mutuum Finance’s stability through its issuance of a completely backed stablecoin using Ethereum network resources. The token achieves trustworthiness over an extended timespan because its overcollateralized design cuts down potential risks contrary to algorithmic stablecoins that face insolvency challenges. Open financial architectures and audited smart contracts alongside this architecture deliver higher investor trust by solving the major issues of past DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance works to build a growing community by providing attractive benefits to its members. The platform will provide $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens through a million-dollar giveaway that benefits ten lucky participants while also having an innovative referral program designed to reward user-driven new investor acquisitions. The platform provides early adopters with separate staking pools and governance access and VIP updates that enhance their loyalty and continued support. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth The project’s tokenomics strategy ensures controlled supply and sustained value growth.By restricting token supply during presale and imposing deflationary pressures, Mutuum Finance creates scarcity, which can lead to price appreciation. Staking rewards along with its usage mechanism help users gain advantages that drive sustainable usage over time within the network ecosystem. Cardano (ADA) faces uncertainty in reclaiming $3 due to slow adoption and rising competition. Once a top Ethereum rival, its momentum has faded, pushing investors toward stronger alternatives. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction with its dual-lending DeFi model, raising $4.4 million from 6,300+ investors. Its presale price will soon rise from $0.02 to $0.025, offering early investors a promising opportunity amid ADA’s struggles.

Meanwhile, whales view the altcoin’s price dip as an opportunity that they must seize by increasing their holdings while the price is down, leading to large investors buying a huge volume of Ethereum in the last three days. Related Reading: 1 Million Bitcoin In New Whale Hands—A Mega BTC Rally On The Horizon? ETH Trading Below $2,000 Analysts said that Ethereum’s price continues to fall as the broader cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a challenging situation. Data showed that the world’s largest altcoin struggles to gain an upward momentum and continue to stumble below $2,000. As of writing, Ethereum is traded at $1,988 per coin, with a market cap of nearly $240 billion. According to CoinGecko, since ETH hit $3,640 per coin on January 6, the crypto has been steadily decreasing in value with its first major dip happening on January 14, after hitting $3,007. On February 3, the coin slid further reaching $2,460 and dropped to $2,100 on February 28. Ethereum hit below $2,000 for the first time on March 11. Since then, ETH has been having trouble keeping itself above $2,000.

Ethereum struggling to maintain itself at the $2,000 level might worry many crypto traders, but large-scale investors saw an opportunity in the price dip. Whales used this situation to buy more ETH and further increase their holdings. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez commented in a post that ETH price decline attracted large investors to increase their buying activity. “Whales bought over 120,000 #Ethereum $ETH in the last 72 hours,” Martinez said. The analyst presented a chart that showed a spike in the whale ETH accumulation coinciding with the coin’s price decline, adding that Ethereum’s retreat allowed whales to acquire more than 120,000 ETH tokens with a value of about $236 million and they only did that in three days. “That’s a significant move by the whales! Their accumulation often indicates confidence in the market. It’s fascinating to see how these big players can influence price trajectories,’ Agent Snek commented on Martinez’s post. Whale Buys Over 7,000 ETH Meanwhile, data analytics platform Lookonchain tracked a whale who added nearly $14 million worth of ETH. “A whale bought 7,074 $ETH($13.8M) today! The whale withdrew 4,511 $ETH($8.81M) from #OKX 3 hours ago and deposited it into #Aave,” Lookonchain said in a post.

By March 22, the 12 Bitcoin ETFs collectively held $94.35 billion worth of BTC, accounting for approximately 5.65% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. On March 21 alone, the 12 ETFs tracked, Blackrock’s IBIT accrued close to $105 million. Like the inflow count, IBIT contributed the most to the rise in trading volume, which settled at $1.3 billion by the same date. Overall, Bitcoin ETFs performed fairly well this week, drawing in more than $785 million in the last six days, including about $83 million on March 21. IBIT pulled in over $104 million in inflows on March 21 According to Sosovalue, cumulative net ETF inflows stood at $36.05 billion as of March 21, with institutional investor interest in Bitcoin picking up. Blackrock’s IBIT contributed the most to the net inflows count, having accumulated over $104.99 million on the 21st, bringing its total net inflows to almost $40 billion. Fidelity Capital comes second to IBIT with total net inflows of $11.48 billion, though it had no inflows on March 21. The other ten funds showed little or no change over the past six inflow sessions. However, by March 22, the 12 funds collectively held $94.35 billion worth of BTC. According to Farside Investors, the Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $785 million in the last week, with BlackRock IBIT accumulating over $486 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC saw $70 million in inflows, while Ark Invest’s ARKB accumulated just over $100 million in inflows during this period. However, on Friday, U.S. spot ether ETFs witnessed outflows of about $18.63 million. Analysts pointed out the outflows were caused by Blackrock’s ETHA and Grayscale’s ETH Mini Trust, which recorded losses of $11.94 million and $6.69 million, respectively. Bitcoin is seeing rising institutional demand The institutional demand for Bitcoin has grown quickly, with BTC demand at its highest levels since the collapse of the FTX exchange in 2022. Since February 23 this year, new investors have bought over 172,705 BTC. Crypto analyst Trader T even expects investors to pull in funds from US pension funds and Target Date Funds (TDFs). According to Grok’s analysis, the analyst believes that these sources will flow about $103 to 122 billion into the US equity market. He even claimed that people could allocate 5% to 10% of this amount, roughly $1 to $2 billion, to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This presents a bullish outlook for the meme coin’s price, which is currently eyeing a rally to $4.5. Dogecoin Whales Accumulate As Price Eyes Rally To $4.5 In an X post , Martinez revealed that Dogecoin whales have bought over 120 million DOGE this past week, as they continue to actively accumulate despite the market downtrend. This provides a bullish outlook for the meme coin, which is currently eyeing a rally to $4.5. In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade noted that DOGE’s 20 Simple Moving Average (SMA) highlights various phases in DOGE’s history. His accompanying chart showed that the top meme coin is just about to enter its parabolic phase in this bull run and could rally to as high as $4.5 when that happens. Crypto analyst Crypto Elites also asserted that a Dogecoin price rally to $5 is coming soon. These price predictions indicate that the foremost meme coin could still surpass its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.73. Crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL recently provided an ultra-bullish outlook for Dogecoin, predicting that the meme coin could rally to as high as $80. The analyst alluded to historical trends as to why DOGE could reach such an ambitious price target. DOGE Needs To Continue To Hold The Line In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital noted that Dogecoin, on the weekly candle, received a weekly demand candle last week at the ‘last line of bull market support.’ He remarked that it is crucial that DOGE holds this level at $0.139 while it resets higher time frame indicators like the 3-day MACD, weekly Stochastic RSI, and 2-week Stochastic RSI, which are getting very close to being fully reset. Kevin opined that this price level continues to be a spot where the risk-reward ratio on DOGE is “absolutely phenomenal,” considering that if the meme coin loses that level on weekly closes, market participants could easily cut their trades and losses. He added that the upside potential outweighs the downside risk by miles. From a holder perspective, the analyst remarked that market participants simply have to hold this $0.139 level while these higher frame indicators reset and prepare for the next big move. Kevin stated that the 1-week Stochastic RSI has fully reset, the 3-day MACD is getting closer to fully resetting, and the 2-week Stochastic RSI is also close to a full reset. The analyst indicated that the Dogecoin price boasts a bullish outlook as long as the Bitcoin price holds these levels and does not drop below $70,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) Consolidation Despite Trading Volume Decline Signals Whale Buying the Dip Bitcoin (BTC) opened trading at the $84,000 level on Sunday, March 23, extending its consolidation phase for three days. Looking at the chart below, Bitcoin trading volumes have declined from 22,900 BTC traded on Binance on March 20 to just 5,420 BTC at the close of Saturday, March 22. When an asset’s price consolidates at a critical support level despite a persistent decline in trading volume, it often signals bullish undertones. Bitcoin price today | March 23, 2025 | Source: TradingView Firstly, this suggests that large Bitcoin investors have been executing significant transactions, counteracting the impact of retail traders’ inactivity. Beyond that, high-frequency traders typically prefer volatile conditions, and Bitcoin’s flat price action within a narrow 1% range does not offer wide profit margins. As a result, this low-volatility market environment allows whales to sidestep OTC fees and execute large-volume buys on BTC spot markets without causing significant price fluctuations. These factors explain why BTC has held steady around $84,000 despite a 75% decline in Bitcoin trading volumes over the past few days. $51.9 Billion Open Interest Suggests Bottom Formation for BTC Price Action Bitcoin derivatives market data shows that open interest has dipped 1.77% to $51.98 billion, while options open interest has also declined slightly by 0.54% to $33.51 billion. Across all major metrics, Coinglass data highlights a prevailing bearish sentiment, with a significant 79.28% drop in options volume, indicating reduced speculative activity. Despite this, the long-short ratio remains near neutral at 0.9589 for the past 24 hours, with Binance and OKX showing a higher tilt toward long positions. This suggests that while open interest has declined, existing traders are still positioning for potential upward movement. Bitcoin Open Interest Dips Below $52 billion, March 23, 2025 | Source: Coinglass Liquidations data further supports the bottom formation narrative. Over the last 12 hours, $4.63 million in liquidations have occurred, with shorts accounting for $806.59K—significantly more than long liquidations. This indicates that downward momentum is being absorbed by bullish traders. The current environment suggests that BTC price may be nearing a local bottom after three days in retreat. A decisive move above $85,000 would validate the bullish thesis, while failure to hold $83,500 could invite further downside exploration. Traders should watch derivatives volume recovery and long-short ratio fluctuations for confirmation of the next major move. Bitcoin Technical Analysis Today: BTC to Remain Range Bound Within $88,000 – $83,265 Bitcoin price forecast chart below shows BTC remains trapped in a tight range between $83,265 and $88,000, as conflicting signals from spot and derivatives markets suggest a prolonged consolidation phase. However, sustained consolidation could also indicate a period of market indecision. Bitcoin price requires a decisive breakout from the $88,000 to $83,900 range before a clear directional trend emerges. Bitcoin Technical Analysis The Fibonacci retracement levels indicate immediate support at $83,265, while resistance looms at $86,363.22. A break above this level could see BTC retest the $88,866.76 resistance, signaling a bullish continuation. However, waning trading volume, as seen in the lower histogram bars, suggests weakening momentum, raising the risk of a bearish breakdown. If sellers take control, Bitcoin could dip below $83,265, exposing the next key support at $78,258.52. The red-shaded liquidity zones above $91,000 highlight potential supply zones where selling pressure could intensify. Until a decisive breakout occurs, Bitcoin’s sideways movement suggests traders remain cautious, awaiting confirmation of a trend shift.

According to Keiser, gold is more trusted than the U.S. dollar globally, and said governments of foreign nations with an adversarial relationship with the United States would not accept dollar-pegged stablecoins. The BTC maximalist added: Russia, China, and Iran are not going to accept a U.S. dollar stablecoin. I predict they will counter the USD stablecoin with a Gold one. China and Russia have a combined 50,000 tonnes of Gold — more than what is reported. Max Keiser Tether’s alloy and the rise of gold-backed digital assets The emergence of gold-backed stablecoins may jeopardize U.S. legislators’ attempts to secure dollar supremacy via stablecoin integration, potentially transforming the world finance system. This was followed in June 2024 with stablecoin issuer Tether announcing Alloy (aUSD₮), a gold-backed stablecoin collateralized by Tether’s XAU₮ token, a paper claim on physical gold. Gabor Gurbacs, the founder of Tether’s Gold and a former VanEck executive, noted that Tether Gold is what the dollar was before 1971. “XAU₮ is up 15.7% year-to-date, while the broad crypto market is in the red. Foundations and businesses should hedge their holdings with XAU₮,” the executive wrote in a March 19 X post . U.S. pushes for dollar supremacy through stablecoin regulations U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that dollar-pegged stablecoins would be a priority for the Trump administration. The administration was intent on protecting the dollar’s status as a reserve currency and U.S. dominance in finance. While speaking at the Crypto Summit at the White House on March 7, Bessent reiterated that incorporating stablecoins into the financial system would be a critical policy priority. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller expressed similar views on Tuesday, promoting stablecoins to strengthen the U.S. dollar’s global standing ahead of Bessent’s comments at the summit. In the meantime, U.S. legislators have filed various stablecoin legislation, including the Stable Act of 2025 and a GENIUS stablecoin bill, to establish a regulatory framework for fiat tokens.

The West African nation has described the recent clashes with the world’s largest exchange as efforts to strengthen its regulatory environment. Binance Crackdown Necessary To Curb Crime, Uphold Regulatory Standards: Nigerian Minister In a recent interview with media outlet Semafor , Nigeria’s Minister of Information Mohammed Idris suggested the nation remains crypto-friendly amid pending lawsuits against Binance. Since 2024, the Nigerian government has acted against Binance operations within its borders citing multiple reasons. Notably in March 2024, the leaders of Africa’s most populous nation demanded compensation of $10 billion from Binance for allegedly manipulating the foreign exchange rate resulting in a 70% devaluation of the Nigerian Naira. These statements came amid the detention of Binance executive Tigran Gambrayan over allegations of money laundering activities on the crypto platform which eventually lasted for over eight months.Most recently in February 2025, the Nigerian government sued Binance again for $79.5 million, citing economic losses due to the exchange’s alleged illegal operations in the country. Nigerian officials have previously suggested that Binance processed over $26.5 billion in Nigerian transactions despite being an unregistered identity. The Nigerian Minister of Information explained that the crackdown on Binance was in fear of these cryptocurrency transactions supporting illicit activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, and terrorism financing. Therefore, the legal action was solely aimed at maintaining regulatory integrity and preventing crime.Mohammed Idris said: This is part of the effort to strengthen our laws, not to cripple anybody. We are ensuring that no one comes and operates without regulation. This is part of the effort to strengthen our laws, not to cripple anybody. We are ensuring that no one comes and operates without regulation. The Minister further added: It is not just Nigeria. Internationally it’s also important to address illicit financial flows. You can’t have a huge amount of transactions that do not meet the operations of financial dealers. Amidst this heightened regulatory scrutiny, Binance has since closed down its Nigerian market halting all transactions involving the Naira. However, the Nigerian government emphasizes its commitment to a blossoming crypto industry in accordance with operational and regulatory standards.

Ethereum is grappling to maintain the $2,000 mark amid growing bearish forces, and Hedera is seeing a downturn in interest, hitting a yearly low. On the flip side, BlockDAG (BDAG) is on an upward trajectory, breaking presale records with over $205 million accumulated and 18.8 billion coins sold. Cementing a strategic partnership with SpaceDev, BlockDAG is transcending its status as a mere Layer 1 blockchain by aiming for widespread use, backed by a $30 million grants program and plans for listings on 10 top exchanges. While Ethereum and Hedera are bogged down by negative trends, BlockDAG’s focus on scalability and drawing institutional interest positions it as the cryptocurrency to keep an eye on in 2025. The pressing question now is: will you catch BDAG before its value soars? BlockDAG and SpaceDev Join Forces to Elevate Blockchain Technology BlockDAG, a pioneering Layer 1 blockchain, has allied with SpaceDev , experts in blockchain consulting and software development, to boost the adoption of decentralized solutions. This partnership marries BlockDAG’s cutting-edge Proof-of-Work and Directed Acyclic Graph technology with SpaceDev’s extensive blockchain development know-how, promising a more scalable, secure, and efficient blockchain environment. BlockDAG’s CEO, Antony Turner, highlights the partnership’s importance, saying, “SpaceDev’s technical expertise is a perfect match for our vision to develop a robust blockchain that surpasses traditional network limitations.” The collaboration is set to expand BlockDAG’s community through worldwide hackathons, ambassador programs, and events. SpaceDev will also lend technical assistance to BlockDAG’s $30 million grants program, which supports developers in creating and expanding projects on the network. Furthermore, joint marketing initiatives will boost visibility. With BlockDAG’s presale now exceeding $205 million and 18.8 billion coins sold at $0.0248 each in the latest batch, confidence among buyers is strengthening. The project’s swift progress, the anticipation of listings on 10 exchanges, and a beta test net launch in March 2025 are pivotal for its projected growth spurt. This strategic partnership with SpaceDev solidifies BlockDAG’s position, preparing it to emerge as a leader in blockchain innovation as it transitions to mainnet. Is Ethereum on the Brink of Breaking Below $2,000? Ethereum has tumbled 13% over the past week, now at a new low of $1,997 since December 2023. The crypto faces ongoing selling pressure, with the possibility of dipping beneath the pivotal $2,000 mark. Positioned below the Ichimoku Cloud, resistance levels at $2,346 and $2,742 hint at potential further declines. Now, 50% of Ethereum holders are seeing losses, reduced from 82% in January, which might trigger more selling. Should the downward trend intensify, Ethereum could fall to $1,924. Conversely, a shift in sentiment might lift its price to $2,224, and possibly to $2,500 if it establishes new support. Market watchers should keep an eye on Ethereum’s next moves as its stability is tested. Hedera Struggles to Maintain $0.25 as Interest Wanes—What Lies Ahead? In the last week, Hedera has seen a 17% decrease, now priced at $0.21. With open interest plummeting to a yearly low of $149 million, confidence seems to be waning, pointing to potential further losses unless there’s a resurgence of buying. Currently, Hedera is back in a downward trending channel, a bearish sign that has dominated its movements from January through March. The Parabolic SAR indicates continued bearish momentum, with Hedera below essential resistance levels. A further drop to $0.16 could occur if demand stays low. However, a resurgence in buying could push prices up to $0.24. Traders should look for signs of momentum shifts as they navigate Hedera’s volatile market landscape. Crypto Momentum: Who’s Up and Who’s Down? The divide between a faltering coin and a thriving one is defined by its momentum. Ethereum grapples with technical challenges, with half its holders in the red and resistance pushing prices lower. Hedera contends with negative sentiment, worsened by diminishing trading interest, signaling a drift of focus away from it. Meanwhile, BlockDAG bucks the market downturn, nearing its $600 million presale goal. With technical support from SpaceDev, BlockDAG’s ecosystem is evolving into a hub for development, enhancing its appeal. The impending March 2025 beta test net and upcoming exchange listings further bolster its position, distinguishing BlockDAG as a formidable Layer 1 innovator. As the crypto presale window narrows, while Ethereum and Hedera face uncertainties, BlockDAG’s path forward looks promising. The real question shifts from if to when BlockDAG will surge significantly.

It feels like just yesterday everyone was buzzing about the rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum, but fast forward to 2025, and the crypto market has leveled up in ways people didn’t expect. It’s not just about the big players anymore—newer coins are making waves, and some are set to explode. If you’re keeping an eye on the Top Cryptos to Buy for 2025, it’s time to start looking beyond the usual suspects and explore the next big thing. But while everyone is talking about new coins, some missed opportunities are still fresh in the minds of those who didn’t act fast enough. One coin that has a lot of people kicking themselves is HNT (Helium). It had potential, but by the time it started to hit its stride, the window closed for many. But don’t worry, there’s still hope. One crypto, in particular, is showing a ton of promise— Qubetics ($TICS), and it’s got people excited for all the right reasons. Stick around, because if you haven’t heard about Qubetics yet, you’ll want to pay attention. This could be one of the most talked-about coins of 2025. HNT Coin: A Missed Opportunity HNT was one of those coins that seemed like it was on the brink of something big, especially back when it first started. People were hyped about its innovative approach to decentralizing wireless networks. It was marketed as a game-changer, and for a while, it looked like it could be the next big thing in the crypto world. Unfortunately, by the time most people caught on, the coin had already hit its peak. As a project, Helium did a lot of things right. Its vision to allow anyone to build a decentralized wireless network and earn HNT for doing so was pretty unique. The idea of creating a global, decentralized internet is certainly a cool one—especially in areas where traditional internet infrastructure isn’t strong. For a time, it felt like it was going to be a revolution. But here’s the thing: timing is everything. Helium didn’t scale as quickly as expected, and the market shifted towards other emerging technologies, leaving HNT in the dust. Looking back, the missed opportunity with HNT can’t be ignored. Many hoped for a steady rise, but the lack of adoption and scalability ultimately led to its fall from grace. So, if you’re kicking yourself for not jumping on the HNT train, don’t worry—it’s part of the game. However, now is the time to look for the next big thing that could fill the gap. Enter Qubetics. Qubetics: Still a Hot Ticket for 2025 While HNT might be a coin that many regret overlooking, Qubetics ($TICS) is still very much on the rise—and there’s no sign of it slowing down. The key to Qubetics’ appeal lies in its revolutionary Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, which is setting it apart from other projects.

After the presale, analysts are predicting a $1 price for $TICS—imagine a 746% ROI. And if Qubetics hits $5 after its mainnet launch? That’s a jaw-dropping 4130% ROI. But it’s not just about the numbers. The real appeal of Qubetics lies in its usability and potential to serve everyday people. Whether you’re a small business owner, a freelancer, or just someone who’s been looking for a way to simplify crypto management, Qubetics has you covered.

42184582,https://timestabloid.com/?p=61265,1742696134,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,10 Cryptos Making Moves—Why This Coin is the Best Crypto to Buy in March 2025,https://timestabloid.com/10-cryptos-making-moves-why-this-coin-is-the-best-crypto/,"The crypto market is moving fast in March 2025, with several projects making significant strides. From Layer-1 powerhouses expanding their ecosystems to DeFi protocols integrating real-world assets, the competition is fierce. Some of the most anticipated crypto presales are also gaining traction, with community members jumping in before the next price surge. With so many options, picking the best crypto to buy in March 2025 can feel overwhelming. But one project is standing out above the rest—Qubetics ($TICS). With its cross-border transaction solutions, seamless interoperability, and record-breaking presale, Qubetics is shaping up to be the biggest crypto opportunity of the year. Below, we’ll explore 10 cryptos making big moves this month and why Qubetics is leading the pack. 1. Qubetics ($TICS) – The Best Crypto to Buy in March 2025 Qubetics is shaking up the blockchain world by introducing a next-gen cross-border transaction platform, leveraging AI and interoperability to connect blockchains seamlessly. Unlike traditional payment systems that struggle with slow speeds, high fees, and limited connectivity, Qubetics enables ultra-fast transactions across multiple networks while maintaining security and privacy. For businesses, Qubetics opens up a new era of borderless payments, where companies can send and receive stablecoins, crypto assets, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) without the usual hurdles. Imagine a freelancer in Asia getting paid in USDC by a client in the U.S. instantly—no banks, no intermediaries, and no delays. Similarly, e-commerce businesses can integrate Qubetics’ blockchain-powered payment rails to settle transactions globally without high conversion fees. Let’s be real—this presale is on fire. Qubetics is in Stage 26, with $TICS priced at $0.1181, and every Sunday at midnight, the price jumps by 10%. Each presale stage lasts just 7 days, which means if you’re sitting on the fence, you’re literally losing money by the week. It’s no wonder early participants are scrambling to lock in their spots before the next price hike. Here’s what the buzz is all about: Qubetics has already raised $15.3 million, has 23,500+ holders, and more than 502 million tokens sold. But the real attention-grabber? The projected gains. If $TICS reaches $1, you’re looking at 746.04% ROI. Hit $10, and that jumps to 8,360.26%. And at $15, it’s a ridiculous 12,590.69%. A quick math check: drop $7,500 today and you’ll snag about 63,450 tokens. If $TICS hits $10, that’s a sweet $634,500. That’s not hype—that’s straight up potential. Blink, and the price goes up again. Your move. 2. AAVE – DeFi’s Powerhouse Expands with RWA Integration AAVE is pushing DeFi to new heights with its latest integration of Real-World Assets (RWAs). This move allows institutional players and everyday users to collateralize tokenized assets like real estate, commodities, and equities for DeFi lending. With institutional demand for RWAs growing, AAVE’s ecosystem could attract billions in new liquidity. The price of AAVE has shown strong momentum in recent weeks, reflecting optimism around the protocol’s expansion. Analysts believe that if DeFi continues to bridge TradFi with blockchain technology, AAVE could be among the biggest beneficiaries in 2025. 3. Astra – AI Meets Blockchain for an Intelligent Future Astra is making waves by integrating AI-powered smart contracts, allowing businesses and developers to automate transactions and optimize blockchain-based operations. The rise of AI-driven automation in DeFi, GameFi, and supply chain management is putting Astra at the center of the next crypto revolution. With AI playing a crucial role in Web3, Astra’s ability to combine predictive analytics with decentralized smart contracts makes it a strong contender for long-term growth. Its adoption could increase exponentially as blockchain companies look for smarter, self-learning protocols. 4. Algorand – The Green Blockchain is Back in the Spotlight Algorand continues to impress as one of the most energy-efficient and scalable Layer-1 blockchains in the industry. Recent upgrades have boosted TPS (transactions per second), making it a go-to blockchain for institutions looking for sustainability and efficiency. More importantly, Algorand is at the forefront of tokenized assets, with partnerships in government-backed stablecoins, green energy credits, and NFT marketplaces. As regulations around tokenization become clearer, Algorand could see massive institutional adoption in 2025. 5. Polygon (MATIC) – Scaling Ethereum Faster Than Ever Polygon remains Ethereum’s top Layer-2 scaling solution, but its ambitions go beyond reducing gas fees. With new ZK-Rollup advancements and integrations with major brands like Starbucks and Disney, Polygon is rapidly evolving into a multi-use blockchain powerhouse. The rise of enterprise adoption in Web3 has placed Polygon at the center of major discussions.

Avalanche – Blazing Fast Smart Contracts Avalanche’s subnet technology allows developers to launch customizable blockchain networks while maintaining ultra-fast speeds. With GameFi and institutional finance moving toward custom-built blockchains, Avalanche’s appeal is growing. The network recently announced several high-profile partnerships, expanding its influence in both DeFi and enterprise blockchain adoption.

Its latest upgrade has reduced transaction fees even further, making it a strong competitor to Solana and Ethereum. With more applications launching on Near, the network is poised for continued growth in 2025. 9. XRP – Big Developments in Global Payments XRP has been making headlines with ongoing legal battles, but its real-world use case in global payments remains unmatched. March 2025 is shaping up to be a crucial time for XRP, with speculation that new partnerships could fuel a major price rally. If XRP continues to expand its role in cross-border payments, it could be one of the best crypto to buy in March 2025 for those betting on utility-driven growth. 10. Binance Coin (BNB) – The Powerhouse of the Binance Ecosystem BNB continues to dominate as the utility token of the Binance Smart Chain, which powers countless DeFi projects, NFT marketplaces, and blockchain applications.

This prediction is based on the application of advanced technical tools, including Exponential Fibonacci models and Elliott Wave theory, which are often used to forecast long-term price trends in financial markets. According to the analyst, conventional linear models fail to capture the compounding nature of crypto price movements, especially during the upcoming altcoin rally. XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Says $77 Target Possible in Current Bull Cycle Crypto analyst Dark Defender revealed XRP price could climb to $77.7 during the current market cycle. The forecast is based on the use of Exponential Fibonacci levels, a method he claims is underused in crypto market analysis. He explains that standard linear projections do not reflect the actual growth patterns often observed during accelerated market conditions. Dark Defender outlines a five-wave impulse structure based on Elliott Wave theory. In his analysis, Wave 3 is positioned as the most explosive part of the cycle. He suggests that the top altcoin rally may first move between $5 and $8 during this wave. A further push toward $18 to $23 is anticipated before the final wave. Wave 5, the final leg in the structure, is projected to carry XRP price into three-digit levels. His analysis sets the upper range at approximately $77.7, based on the extended Fibonacci measurements. This would mark a substantial increase from current levels and surpass previous highs. Source: X Technical Indicators and Chart Patterns Supporting the Outlook Dark Defender’s projection includes a review of multiple technical indicators. He references Relative Strength Index (RSI) trends and momentum indicators as supporting factors in his analysis. These tools suggest continued bullish pressure, especially on higher time frames like the monthly chart. Volume clusters are another factor he incorporates. According to the chart data, strong accumulation zones have formed, typically supporting future crypto rallies. He also notes that current price movements mirror those of previous bull runs, reinforcing the idea of an upcoming altcoin rally. Chart structures from earlier cycles show similar formations that preceded large price expansions. These historical similarities, momentum signals, and volume behavior form the basis of his extended projection for the XRP price. Meanwhile, another more bullish analysis projects the Ripple token could cross $1,000 if the partnership with SWIFT leads to the global adoption of XRP for real-time liquidity in cross-border payments. Analysts suggest that such integration would require massive XRP reserves and institutional demand, which could drive the altcoin rally. Impact of Ripple Lawsuit and Legal Developments Additionally, analyst Egrag Crypto has also shared a bullish forecast for XRP price earlier on. He places initial targets between $5 and $6, with a possibility of reaching $10. His prediction is partly tied to the recent resolution of the Ripple lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which some believe could act as a catalyst for further gains. Egrag Crypto’s analysis also uses Fibonacci levels, identifying consistent full-body monthly candle closings above Fib 1.0. He states that this chart’s behavior reflects price strength and momentum. A potential altcoin rally to the Fib 1.618 level, targeting up to $10, remains a possibility according to his analysis.

Notably, this development resulted in a significant demand for XRP as the altcoin surged over 13% to briefly trade at $2.60 on March 20. However, XRP has since retraced over the last 24 hours and is now valued at around $2.39. Albeit, the altcoin still remains set for major bullish gains based on recent analysis by market expert Egrag Crypto. Related Reading: CMT-Certified Expert Explains Why Bitcoin May Not Reach Past Extremes On Indicators XRP Strong Monthly Close Indicates Major Upside Potential In an X post on March 21, Egrag Crypto shares an interesting bullish prediction on the XRP based on price action in recent months and the Fibonacci retracement levels. The analyst notes that XRP has consistently closed above Fib. 1.0 level over the past three months forming full body candles. This development demonstrates XRP’s resilience amidst an uncertain crypto market reinforcing the potential of bullish momentum. This is because full-body candles provide stronger confirmation of price movements compared to wick formations. With the altcoin maintaining such strong technical strength, Egrag predicts XRP could soon start gaining with its first price target at Fib 1.236. However, there is no serious resistance at this level suggesting a continuous surge to Fib Circle 5 and Fib 1.414 i.e. a price range of $5-$6. Based on the Fibonacci levels, XRP could then see major price extensions to Fib 1.618 hinting at a potential price target of $9-$10. However, it is worth noting that the timing of these events is quite consequential for XRP and the general crypto market. According to Egrag Crypto, if the projected price gains occur between now and May, a price correction is likely to follow hinting at a continuation of the bull run and higher price targets for XRP. However, if the anticipated price movements happen in the summer of 2025 or in Q4 2025, it could suggest a market top, marking the end of the current market cycle.

In addition, Garlinghouse expects US President Donald Trump to include XRP in the digital asset stockpile. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.38 reflecting a 1.43% price loss in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 31.64% indicating a decline in market interest despite a recent price surge.

Rogers said, unfortunately, the most straightforward scams work best because scammers rely on people making simple mistakes. “People give their 24-word phrases to people every day, so as long as that happens, then they are going to go for the low-cost tax,” he said, adding: “Anyone who asks for your 24 words is a criminal.” Rogers highlighted a common crypto scam where victims get tricked by replies under “any post on Twitter about crypto,” with messages like “DM me, and I’ll help you.” “You know that scammers are always asking you for your 24 words,” Rogers said. CertiK chief business officer Jason Jiang recently told Cointelegraph that being aware of phishing attacks on social media can drastically increase a user’s crypto security . Sometimes, scammers hijack the accounts of well-known industry figures to post malicious links, making it even harder for users to spot the scam. In September 2023, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s account was compromised , leading to a fake NFT giveaway that tricked followers into clicking — only to drain over $691,000 from their wallets. Source: CertiK Rogers emphasized that this will always be the case, just as bad actors aren’t limited to crypto — scams like fake emails from the “Nigerian president” have been around for years. “The cost of the attack is always commensurate with the size of the prize, right?” Rogers said. In 2024, crypto hacks jumped 15% from 2023, with over $3 billion stolen .

Pig butchering is a type of phishing scheme that involves prolonged and complex manipulation tactics to trick investors into willingly sending their assets to fraudulent crypto addresses.

Despite the broader market facing turbulence from ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and heightened trade war fears, ADA has managed to maintain stability—offering hope to investors watching for a breakout. While Bitcoin and other altcoins have struggled under selling pressure, Cardano’s current structure could be setting the stage for a strong recovery rally. Related Reading: Investors Withdraw 360,000 Ethereum From Exchanges In Just 48 Hours – Accumulation Trend? Bulls now face the task of reclaiming higher levels to confirm a bullish reversal and capitalize on this window of opportunity. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, Cardano has just flashed a buy signal on the TD Sequential indicator on the 4-hour chart—an early sign that momentum may shift in favor of the bulls. Historically, this technical pattern has been a reliable indicator for short- to mid-term price rebounds, especially during consolidation phases like the one ADA is currently experiencing. If this signal holds and buyers step in with strength, Cardano could soon challenge its next resistance zones and begin a new upward move. With sentiment across the market cautiously optimistic, ADA might be one of the first altcoins to lead the way in a broader recovery. TD Sequential Signal Sparks Hope For Cardano Cardano (ADA) has been standing out as one of the more resilient altcoins during a critical period of heightened selling pressure across the crypto market. While broader macroeconomic conditions—such as trade war fears and policy uncertainty—have pushed equities and crypto into volatile zones, ADA has managed to hold its ground above crucial support levels. This performance has caught the attention of investors and analysts who believe Cardano could lead the next leg up once the market finds its footing. Related Reading: XRP Active Addresses Hit Highest Level Since April 2023 – Will Price Follow? With the market beginning to form local lows and signs of a potential rebound emerging, sentiment is cautiously optimistic. Still, some experts warn that this could be a temporary pause in a larger corrective phase. The lack of clarity around global economic direction continues to cast a shadow over all risk assets, including crypto. For Cardano, however, a new technical development has sparked renewed hope. Martinez’s analysis on X reveals the TD Sequential indicator has just flashed a buy signal on ADA’s 4-hour chart. Historically, this signal is known for predicting potential reversals or short-term trend changes, especially during periods of consolidation. If the pattern plays out, Cardano could be preparing for a breakout move, positioning itself ahead of many other altcoins. A successful rebound would require ADA to reclaim higher resistance levels and confirm bullish momentum. But with a technical buy signal in place and market-wide signs of stabilization, the stage could be set for Cardano to initiate a recovery in the days ahead. ADA Struggles Below $0.73 Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.71 after several days of struggling to reclaim the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) near $0.73. Despite the resistance, ADA has held firmly above the 200-day simple moving average (MA) around $0.70, a level acting as key demand support in recent sessions. This tight range between the 200-day MA and EMA reflects growing pressure on bulls and bears as ADA approaches a critical decision point. For bulls to regain control and shift momentum in their favor, a decisive push above the $0.85 level is essential. Reclaiming this price zone would confirm a breakout from the current consolidation and potentially trigger a recovery rally toward higher resistance levels. Such a move would signal renewed bullish sentiment and open the door for ADA to revisit early 2024 highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Trades At A Critical Level – Major Reclaim Or Steep Drop Ahead? On the downside, failure to hold the $0.70 level could spell trouble. If ADA drops below this support, a sharp move toward $0.60—or even lower—could follow, especially amid broader market weakness. A break below $0.60 would mark a significant technical breakdown, potentially wiping out recent gains and resetting ADA’s bullish structure. As price action tightens, the next few days will be critical for determining Cardano’s short-term direction.

Notably, the cryptocurrency has been trading within a descending trendline, but a decisive move above this resistance could ignite a long-awaited rally to a new all-time high. XRP Price Eyes Breakout To $4 According to pseudonymous TradingView crypto analyst ONE1iMPACT, the XRP price has been making lower highs, forming a descending trendline on the 8-hour chart. The analyst’s chart analysis highlights key technical indicators based on price action that suggest that the XRP price may be gearing up for a possible rally to $4. Related Reading: XRP Price Face Major Resistance At $2.9, Why This Analyst Believes $20 Is Still Possible XRP’s projected surge to a $4 ATH is dependent on how it reacts to the descending trendline, which acts as a critical resistance area. With this in mind, a breakout and close above this trendline with higher-than-average volume signals bullish momentum for the XRP price. Interestingly, the analyst disclosed that the market is currently hovering near or just below a key Moving Average (MA), indicated by the blue line in the chart. If XRP’s price can reclaim and hold above this MA, it would reinforce its bullish position and solidify the analyst’s optimistic price target. On the flip side, if it remains below this MA, the TradingView expert believes that it would put a barrier to its upside potential. Moving forward, the analyst has shared key technical areas that could determine XRP’s next price movements. He revealed that if the cryptocurrency breaks above the descending trendline, the next major resistance area is the horizontal level around $3.40. Furthermore, a confirmed breakout could send its price toward $3.9 – $4.00, aligning with the target shown by the grey arrow in the chart. The TradingView crypto expert warned investors and traders to pay attention to the volume and momentum of XRP as it aims for a descending trendline breakout. He explained that a low volume push above the trendline is a clear indication of a possible fakeout, where traders could be lured into entering long positions, only for the price to trace quickly. On the other hand, a high volume surge confirms the conviction of XRP’s bullish potential, leading to a sustained upward momentum and increasing prices. The analyst also added that oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) could help traders gauge whether XRP’s momentum is building or fading as its price approaches the descending trendline resistance. Possible Downside Target If Resistance Fails In his analysis, ‘ONE1iMPACT’ also shared a bearish outlook for the XRP price if it fails to break and close above the descending trendline resistance. The TradingView analyst revealed that a rejection at this trendline could trigger further consolidation and decline for XRP. Related Reading: XRP Price Retraces Gains From Sunday Rally, This Important Support Level Could Be The Defining Factor He has shared several important support levels that could help prevent an even deeper correction in the XRP price. The $2.0 and $2.1 region, marked by the pink and gray box on the chart, acts as a strong support area for XRP, where buyers have stepped in before. If the XRP price loses this zone, the analyst predicts a major breakdown toward $1.8 – $1.77. Another decline below this price low could result in a much larger correction.

Cardano Dips 18% While XRP News Reveal Network Expansion,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-cmo-hosts-blockbuster-6th-ama-cardano-dips-18-while-xrp-news-reveal-network-expansion/,"Crypto trends can shift quickly, but the debate between adoption strategy and price action is heating up. This week, Cardano’s decline and a major surge in XRP wallet numbers have stirred fresh market signals. While ADA sees falling volume and no major updates, XRP is gaining traction through broader usage and network expansion. Amid this, BlockDAG (BDAG) is catching attention for taking a real-world approach to visibility. Rather than sticking to threads or community chats, BlockDAG’s marketing roadmap reflects large-scale planning. From football stadiums to international tech events, the goal is widespread awareness. As presale momentum builds with over $205 million raised, BlockDAG positions itself for long-term relevance well beyond online hype. XRP News: Wallet Surge Signals Steady Growth A major update from the XRP Ledger confirms it has reached 6.87 million unique wallet addresses. This increase reflects broader use by both institutional players and everyday users. With Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity platform supporting real-world applications like cross-border payments, the XRP network continues to build genuine utility. In addition to financial services, the XRP ecosystem is expanding with more developers and features. Smart contracts through Hooks and ongoing DeFi development are making XRP more than just a payment tool. Backed by legal wins and regulatory clarity in regions like Japan and the UAE, XRP is regaining traction. Those following XRP news can see a strong foundation forming behind the scenes. Cardano Price Fall Raises Doubts Over Its Momentum Cardano (ADA) has declined to $0.7119, down from $0.7177, marking a 0.80% drop in 24 hours. Trading volume has also dropped 7.22%, settling at $1.18 billion. With an 18.53% slide over the last week, ADA’s market cap now stands at $25 billion. This continued downtrend suggests weakening short-term momentum. What makes this more concerning is the absence of any major update or catalyst. As attention moves toward projects with better outreach or practical usage, Cardano might struggle to stay relevant based on network stability alone. Other altcoins are now drawing attention with stronger real-world activity. BlockDAG Focuses on Global Growth, Not Just Short-Term Hype Stepping beyond crypto-only channels, BlockDAG’s 2025 outreach plan aims to make a lasting global impact. During a recent AMA, CMO Nicolaas David van den Bergh confirmed the strategy, spotlighting brand visibility at Inter Milan stadiums and appearances at global events like ETHPanama and Token2049. This isn’t casual PR—it’s a planned approach to build consistent worldwide awareness. While others focus on short-term buzz, BlockDAG targets meaningful global placements. The approach centers on direct audience reach across both crypto and non-crypto spaces. This change of direction shows BlockDAG is thinking bigger, not just louder. For those looking at 2025 growth, this project stands out for its clear execution and long-term potential. Its growing popularity is backed by numbers. Over $205 million has already been raised in the crypto presale , with 18.8 billion coins sold. BDAG is now priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, showing a rise of 2,380% from its initial value. With the testnet launch approaching and marketing plans unfolding, BlockDAG is being talked about as one of the best crypto picks for 2025. Final Say Latest XRP news points to growth, with wallet numbers climbing to 6.87 million and adoption increasing across user groups. On the other hand, Cardano’s falling price and volume, without any positive updates, reflect limited short-term strength. That’s why attention is turning toward projects aiming for broader presence. BlockDAG is a key name here. With confirmed appearances at Inter Milan matches and global events like ETHPanama and Token2049, the project is pushing for visibility that extends beyond crypto circles. The presale is already in batch 27 at $0.0248, after crossing $205 million. This could be a ideal time to watch closely before the momentum drives it further.

In the past 24 hours, Pi’s value has fallen by 2%, and over the past week, it has seen a massive decline of 31%. Many are now asking what caused this drop—Is it just another dip in the crypto market or is there more going on? While Pi had been stable at around $1.50 for a while, it has now fallen sharply. This price drop isn’t just a Pi-specific issue; the entire cryptocurrency market is seeing declines, with major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum also losing value. The broader market is affected by factors like rising inflation, higher interest rates, and ongoing global financial uncertainty. Moreover, Pi Network faces challenges such as limited exchange listings, slowing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, and uncertainty about its circulating supply. These issues have contributed to price instability and investor concerns. Pi Network has climbed back above the $1 mark after dropping to $0.86. It is currently trading at $1.01.. Despite recent gains, Pi faces resistance at $1.20. If it breaks through, it could target $1.35, a key milestone. However, reaching this level may be tough due to Pi’s volatility. If it manages to go above $1.90, analysts predict it could rally towards $3. However, there is hope for Pi’s future. The upcoming launch of its open mainnet could provide a much-needed boost. If the mainnet launch is successful and Pi can secure partnerships for real-world use, it could gain more demand and stability. Additionally, regulatory clarity and major exchange listings would increase liquidity and make Pi more accessible to investors.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-23 04:52:25

This technical strength has sparked speculation about whether PEPE is gearing up for a bullish continuation, potentially reigniting its upward momentum. With traders closely monitoring price action, a breakout above nearby resistance could confirm a bullish continuation, setting the stage for further gains. However, failure to maintain support may shift momentum in favor of the bears as PEPE hovers at this critical juncture. PEPE Recent Price Action: A Snapshot PEPE has been displaying steady price movement, holding above a key support level and maintaining bullish momentum. After bouncing from recent lows, the meme coin has managed to stay above a crucial moving average. This stability suggests that buyers are still in control, preventing a deeper pullback and keeping the uptrend intact. Related Reading: Analyst Says PEPE Price Must Break This Resistance Level For 150% Surge Toward ATHs Technical indicators continue to support a bullish outlook for PEPE. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains in positive territory, reflecting sustained buying momentum. If the RSI holds its current course, it can strengthen the case for more upside, suggesting that the uptrend has room to extend. Trading volume has remained consistent, indicating sustained interest from market participants. However, resistance levels ahead will play a crucial role in determining whether PEPE can extend its rally or face a temporary slowdown. If bullish momentum strengthens, the price could push toward the $0.00000766 resistance level. A decisive breakout above this level serves as a strong bullish confirmation, paving the way for further upside. Should buying pressure intensify, PEPE may rally toward the next significant resistance, attracting more traders looking to capitalize on the upward trend. Bearish Scenario: Key Support Levels If Momentum Shifts While PEPE remains in bullish territory, a shift in momentum will open the door for a potential pullback. If selling pressure increases, the first key support to watch is the moving average level that has been acting as a price floor. A break below this level could weaken bullish confidence and trigger a deeper decline. Related Reading: PEPE Struggles Against Strong Resistance, Bearish Pressure Intensify Further downside raises the risk of a decline toward secondary support zones such as $0.00000589 and $0.00000398, where buyers may attempt to regain control. Failure of the bulls to defend these levels will open the door for other support levels to be tested. Additionally, declining volume and a bearish crossover in momentum indicators such as the MACD or RSI could further confirm a shift in sentiment. For now, the uptrend remains intact, but traders should remain cautious of any signs of weakness. Holding above these key support zones will be crucial in determining whether bulls can maintain control or if bears will take over.

Despite the data, misleading narratives persist,” CryptoQuant contributor “onchained,” said in a March 22 market report. “Such claims often lack onchain validation and are driven by sensationalist market sentiment rather than objective analysis,” the analyst said, adding: “Trust data, not noise, verify sources and cross-check onchain metrics.” Onchained pointed to the recent movements of Bitcoin ( BTC ) long-term holders (LTH) — those holding for over 155 days — as an example of false narratives clashing with real data. The analyst pointed out that while some narratives claim Bitcoin long-term holders are “capitulating,” the data shows they’re remaining consistent. “The data leaves no room for speculation,” Onchained said. The Inactive Supply Shift Index (ISSI) — which measures the degree to which long-dormant Bitcoin supply is shifting — “shows no meaningful LTH selling pressure, reinforcing a narrative of structural demand outpacing supply,” Onchained said. Narratives are always being challenged Crypto analytics platform Glassnode recently made a similar observation based on data, saying, “Long-Term Holder activity remains largely subdued, with a notable decline in their sell-side pressure.” Crypto market narratives are constantly changing and being challenged. One long-standing crypto narrative under debate is the relevance of the 4-year cycle theory, which suggests that Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable pattern tied to its halving event every four years. Source: Tomas Greif MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe said in a March 22 X post, “I assume that we can erase the entire 4-year cycle theory and that we’re in a longer cycle for Altcoins.” Related: Crypto markets will be pressured by trade wars until April: Analyst Echoing a similar sentiment, Bitwise Invest chief investment officer Matt Hougan recently said that “the traditional four-year cycle is over in crypto” due to the recent change in the US government’s stance. “Crypto has moved in four-year cycles since its earliest days. But the change in DC introduces a new wave that will play out over a decade,” Hougan said. Alongside this, some analysts are even debating whether the entire Bitcoin bull market is over . CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju said in a March 17 X post, “Bitcoin bull cycle is over, expecting 6-12 months of bearish or sideways price action.” Ju said all Bitcoin onchain metrics indicate a bear market. “With fresh liquidity drying up, new whales are selling Bitcoin at lower prices,” Ju said.

After a long legal battle, the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple, which has left the industry buzzing with excitement.. This decision marks a huge shift in how regulators will handle digital assets in the U.S., and it could set an important precedent for future cases. Jeremy Hogan, a legal expert, provided a detailed breakdown of the current situation, explaining that while the SEC has dropped its appeal, it’s still unclear if Ripple has agreed to the same. He said that the judgment from Judge Torres, which includes a $125 million penalty and an injunction, is the worst case scenario for Ripple. Here’s what could happen next: Ripple could continue appealing, seeking a court ruling on whether investment contracts require formal agreements. Ripple might agree to drop its appeal, returning the case to the trial court where both sides could try to amend the judgment. Ripple could drop its appeal and come to a private agreement with the SEC without modifying the judgment. Ripple might just pay the $125 million and move on without further legal action. This outcome could have lasting effects on the crypto industry, as the SEC’s decision to back off from its aggressive stance signals a potential shift toward more clear and balanced regulatory guidelines The legal victory clears a major roadblock for Ripple and sets the stage for the company to continue its mission of revolutionizing cross-border payments. It also suggests a future where digital assets may be regulated under clearer rules, creating opportunities for growth in the industry.

The Small Business Confidence Index has collapsed nearly 60% in just a few months. That’s not a typo. Even at the lowest point of the 2008 financial crisis, confidence was 10 points higher than it is now. Things are falling apart. And no one’s even bothering to sugarcoat it. Confidence is crashing faster than it did during the March 2020 lockdowns. By early 2025, small business sentiment had already started slipping. But once the trade war with the U.S. kicked off, it dropped to 25—the lowest reading ever recorded. Nothing else comes close. Source: The Kobeissi Letter on X Consumer confidence collapses as inflation and housing kill demand Meanwhile, Consumer sentiment in Canada just hit a new all-time low. In the U.S., consumer confidence is bad too—but Americans are still three times more optimistic than they were in 2008. In Canada, it’s 15 points below where it was during that global meltdown. It’s a record low. And it’s dragging everything else down with it. The economic chaos is starting to flip Canadian politics upside down. On February 16, the Liberal Party had about a 1% chance of winning the most seats in Parliament. That’s not an exaggeration. But now? They’ve got an 89% chance of taking the lead. That’s one of the biggest electoral reversals ever seen. Just two months ago, the Liberals were projected to grab 35 seats. The Conservatives were on track to grab 236. Now, the numbers show the Liberals with 178, and the Conservatives with just 131. A total reversal. Blame the economy. The trade war is ripping into what little confidence was left. Tariffs are brutal for Canada, and everyone knows it. Imports from Canada only make up 14% of what the U.S. buys. But on the flip side, the U.S. takes 78% of Canada’s exports. That’s not a trade relationship. That’s dependence. In 2023, Canada exported CAD$700 billion to the U.S. Meanwhile, interprovincial trade was only CAD$532 billion. Canada trades more with one foreign country than with itself. No surprise that tariffs are wrecking things. But confidence was already falling before tariffs showed up. Since 2020, Canada’s population grew by over 9%, but real GDP per worker dropped by 2%. At the same time, housing prices have gone up 300% since 2000. Tariffs didn’t cause this mess—but they might be the final blow. Canada’s housing shortage is so bad that people aren’t even hoping for price drops anymore. The country is running a structural deficit of 250,000 housing units every quarter. That’s a full-on crisis. Housing starts have been falling since 2021, while demand has doubled. People literally don’t know where they’re supposed to live. Inflation rebounds while businesses cut spending and jobs The U.S. inflation outlook isn’t helping. Americans now expect inflation to hit 6.0% over the next year. That’s the highest since May 2023. Long-term inflation expectations in the U.S. just hit 3.9%, the highest in 30 years. And Canada’s not immune. In February, Canadian CPI jumped from 1.9% to 2.6%, or 1.1% month-over-month. The forecast was 2.2% year-over-year and 0.6% month-over-month. Reality came in way worse. And those numbers don’t even include the full impact of the retaliatory tariffs yet. Give it a few more weeks and Canada’s inflation could easily blow past 3%. All this is happening while wages are flat, housing is unaffordable, and businesses are slamming the brakes on everything. According to the Bank of Canada, “the threat of tariffs is already affecting financial markets and business decisions.” The January Monetary Policy Report ran multiple scenarios. Under the baseline case—25% U.S. tariffs, with Canada retaliating—Canada’s GDP is expected to shrink by 2.5 percentage points in year one, 1.5 points in year two, and stay flat in year three. That’s three years of economic zero growth or worse. Another Bank of Canada report looked at how workers and businesses are reacting to trade tensions. People are planning to spend less because they’re worried about their jobs and financial health. Sectors like oil, mining, manufacturing, and agriculture are getting hit hardest. Those jobs are directly tied to exports and sensitive to tariffs. Workers in those industries are bracing for layoffs. Released on March 12, that report also showed businesses are preparing to cut hiring, reduce investments, and raise prices in response to the tariffs. In plain English: less work, less growth, more inflation. The report also said : “Inflation expectations are on the rise.” No surprise. Meanwhile, Canada’s canola industry is walking straight into a buzzsaw. Starting March 20, China hit Canadian canola oil and meal with 100% tariffs. On top of that, the U.S. might slap a 25% tariff on Canadian canola beginning April 2. This is on top of Trump’s new wave of aggressive trade policies. Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba have been begging the federal government for help, especially for farmers. But so far? Nothing. No assistance. No relief. Just tariffs and silence. So let’s run the full list: record low consumer confidence, a massive trade war, a housing shortage no one’s fixing, GDP per worker going down, inflation bouncing back hard, and a government trying to figure out how the hell it’s suddenly winning an election. “People are scared to spend, worried about their jobs, and businesses are reacting with layoffs and price hikes,” one Bank of Canada researcher said. “We’re watching real economic activity fall apart.” The confidence numbers don’t lie. The inflation numbers don’t lie. The trade numbers don’t lie. This isn’t a soft landing. It’s a crash. Canada is deep in it. Whether they call it a recession or not.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/anodos-co-founder-says-xrp-was-not-created-for-banks-heres-why/,"Panos Mekras, co-founder of Anodos Finance, recently took to social media to address what he describes as a widespread misconception about XRP. He stated , “XRP was not created for banks, and Ripple with their founders actually hated institutions and middlemen.” He went on to outline the history of XRP, its intended use case, and how the narrative surrounding it has changed over time. XRP was not created for banks, and Ripple with their founders actually hated institutions and middlemen. Here is the full story: Many people (within and outside the XRP community) still believe that XRP was created for banks and cross-border payments. It's a common… pic.twitter.com/iD2QkRfozl — Panos {X} (@panosmek) March 20, 2025 XRP’s Intended Purpose and Early History Mekras explained that many people, inside and outside the XRP community, believe that XRP was created for banks and cross-border payments. He asserted that this is incorrect and originated from narratives pushed by “Bitcoin maxis.” According to Mekras, “XRP was created for the opposite purpose – to destroy the banks’ monopoly and disintermediate them.” He described XRP as a more efficient alternative to Bitcoin with additional functionalities, such as a decentralized exchange (DEX) and tokenized assets. The goal, he stated, was to serve individuals and businesses rather than banks or institutions. He then provided a historical account of XRP’s development, stating that it was built by three developers—David Schwartz, Arthur Britto, and Jed McCaleb. By June 2012, the XRP Ledger was live, but at that time, Ripple did not exist. Later, Chris Larsen joined the project, and Ripple Labs Inc. was established under the name OpenCoin. Mekras emphasized that the supply of 100 billion XRP was created from the start, with no mechanism to create more. Ripple’s Early Vision and Shift in Focus According to Mekras, Ripple Labs initially had no interest in working with banks or facilitating cross-border payments. He cited their original vision, stating they wanted to “enable people to break free of the ‘walled gardens’ of financial networks like credit cards, banks, PayPal and other institutions that restrict access with fees, charges for currency exchanges and processing delays.” He claimed that the founders of Ripple disliked banks and aimed to develop an open payments system and peer-to-peer credit network on the XRP Ledger. However, Mekras stated that Ripple changed its approach in 2014, pivoting toward payments and engaging with the banking system . He explained that their goal was to “create a level playing field for the smaller banks and destroy the SWIFT’s cartel owned by the big ones.” He also mentioned that David Schwartz was inspired to work on the XRP Ledger partly because of a ban from PayPal, reinforcing the idea that the system was designed to free users from centralized financial intermediaries. XRP’s Role in Decentralized Finance In his concluding remarks, Mekras reiterated that the XRP Ledger was built for decentralized finance and was primarily meant for individuals and businesses that wanted alternatives to traditional banking. He argued that XRP was designed to address high fees, transaction delays, and censorship imposed by centralized entities. He concluded, “Anyone who tells you otherwise, is either clueless or deliberately lying to you for his interest. Power to the people.” Mekras’s statement challenges the perception that XRP was created as a tool for banks and cross-border payments, instead asserting that it was originally designed as a decentralized solution to disrupt traditional financial structures.

COIN shares plunged to a low of $176 this month, down by almost 50% from the year-to-date high. Its market cap has dropped from $86 billion to $48 billion, leading to a $38 billion wipeout. Coinbase news: to acquire Deribit Coinbase, the biggest crypto exchange in the US, made headlines this month. A key Coinbase news was the decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to end a case that has been going on for a while. Under Gary Gensler, the agency accused Coinbase of offering unregistered securities on its platform. The SEC has also ended other similar lawsuits against other top players in the crypto industry like Uniswap, Ripple Labs, Kraken, and OpenSea, the NFT giant. Another top Coinbase news came from Bloomberg, which reported that the company was considering making a bid for Deribit, a top crypto derivatives company. This would be a big move as it would transition it into the biggest derivatives player in the crypto industry. Estimates are that the deal will value Deribit at about $5 billion. There are signs that crypto companies are considering making large purchases this year. Just this week, Kraken acquired NinjaTrader in a $1.5 billion deal. These actions are happening at a time when the crypto industry is going through major challenges. Bitcoin price remains in a correction after falling from an all-time high of $109,300 to $84,000 today. Ethereum price has plunged from $4,080 to $1,800, while most altcoins have imploded. Also, crypto ETFs have lost substantial assets this year. Coinbase is also battling heightened competition from the likes of Binance, MEXC, Kraken, OKX, HTX, and other top crypto exchanges. COIN growth to slow this year The most recent financial results showed that Coinbase’s business did well in the fourth quarter as crypto prices surged. Its quarterly revenue rose from $904 million in Q4’23 to $1.128 billion in Q4’24. The most important detail in its report was that it has almost balanced its transaction revenue with that of its subscriptions. Its transaction revenue rose to $572 million, while the subscription and services segment made $641 million. The subscription revenues come from different areas. Most of it comes from stablecoins, while the rest comes from blockchain rewards, interest and finance fees, custodial fees, and other services. This division has higher margins, and its business is more stable. Wall Street analysts expect that Coinbase’s business will slow down in the coming months as crypto prices ease. The average estimate is that its revenue will be $2.23 billion this quarter, up by 35% from the same period last year. It will then make $8.12 billion this year. However, this growth will depend on the performance of the crypto market. Coinbase stock price analysis COIN chart by TradingView The daily chart shows that the COIN share price has crashed in the past few months, falling from a high of $350 to $190. It is about to form a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) have formed a bearish crossover pattern. The stock has also formed a bearish pennant pattern, a characterized by a long vertical line and a triangle pattern. Therefore, the Coinbase stock price will likely have a strong bearish breakdown in the coming days. The next key support level to watch will be at $150, down by 20% from the current level.

42192782,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=698197,1742709285,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42192782.jpeg,Elon Musk says he wants to use X to control the entire global financial system,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musk-x-entire-global-financial-system/,"Elon Musk wants X to run your whole financial life. Not just payments. Not just messages. Everything. That’s the plan. He says the rebrand from Twitter to X wasn’t just a facelift. It’s the start of something bigger. “Comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world,” Elon said in an interview. No more switching apps. No more banks. Just X. Elon also said it would be the most efficient money database ever built. He promised real-time processing, low fraud, and a system so big, it could become “half the global financial system.” His words , not ours: “I don’t know, maybe half the global financial system. Or some big number. I’m not sure what the number is, but pretty big. It would be by far the biggest financial institution.” Musk ignores past [and current] failures and wants to build the next WeChat Elon wants X to beat WeChat, the Chinese app that’s used for texting, shopping, sending money, paying bills, and even borrowing cash, which over a billion people use. But here’s the problem for the golden boy. Other tech giants already tried this, and they all failed. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg had Libra, and it was supposed to be this big cross-border payments project, but it got killed by regulators and Facebook’s own users. Google had a financial tool lined up with 11 banks that never launched. Amazon had talks with JPMorgan Chase to build a checking account, and nothing happened. Microsoft worked with BlackRock on retirement planning, and that plan disappeared too. Only Apple got something off the ground when it launched the Apple Card with Goldman Sachs in 2019. But hilariously enough, now Goldman wants out because the product is simply not profitable enough. So yeah—there’s a track record here. And it’s not great. Elon is already facing heat from regulators. The SEC just hit him with a lawsuit for not disclosing his stock purchases in Twitter before trying to buy the company in 2022. A court filing says a process server showed up at SpaceX in Brownsville, Texas on March 14 to serve the papers. But three guards refused to take the documents. One even told the guy he was trespassing. So the server left the paperwork on the ground. The guards snapped pictures of him and his car while he walked off. According to the court, Elon was supposed to file a disclosure within 10 days of owning more than 5% of Twitter. He didn’t. He waited longer. The SEC says that delay let him underpay by at least $150 million for the shares he grabbed after the deadline. The case was filed in Washington, D.C., and Elon has to respond by April 4. He can also file to dismiss it. This isn’t his first dance with the SEC either. Back in the Tesla days, he got hit with civil fraud charges. That time, he paid $20 million, Tesla paid $20 million, and he had to step down as chairman of Tesla’s board. X raises money, recovers valuation, and pulls in earnings Despite all this, X is raising money and pulling in numbers. A Bloomberg report says the platform raised nearly $1 billion in new funds. That deal puts X’s value at $32 billion. Yes, that’s lower than what Elon paid for it, but still a huge rebound. Remember—Fidelity said in September the company was worth under $10 billion. That’s a big jump in a few months. The Financial Times also dropped some numbers. They say X made $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings in 2024. That’s before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. And yeah, it’s roughly the same amount the platform made before Elon bought it. So even though ad revenue dropped and users left, somehow the earnings stayed up. That same report from the Financial Times puts X’s valuation back at $44 billion, matching what Elon paid for it back in 2022. Two different valuations—$32 billion from Bloomberg, $44 billion from FT—but either way, it’s clear the company made a big recovery. And yes, Elon helped fund that $1 billion raise himself. Not just outside investors. His own money went in. Meanwhile, Elon is busy in Washington. After taking over Twitter, he used the platform to back president Donald Trump and other Republican politicians. According to filings, he spent $290 million to help Trump get back into office. Now, he’s a top advisor inside the Trump administration. That new role might help explain what’s going on at the SEC. Trump’s White House just cut the agency’s budget and staff. Employees were offered $50,000 buyouts to leave or retire by March 21. That’s right around the same time the SEC filed the civil complaint against Elon. Trump also changed a long-standing SEC rule. For the past 15 years, the agency’s enforcement director could issue investigation orders directly. That power is gone now. All formal investigations have to go through the commissioners and get a vote. That slows everything down. Including cases like the one targeting Elon. So while X raises cash and posts numbers, its owner is knee-deep in court dates, politics, lawsuits, and a powerful affair with the leader of the free world. And through all of it, he’s still pushing to turn X into the main hub for global money. From texts to transfers. From tweets to loans. It’s no wonder Elon has backtracked on his crypto support.

While the Ripple community rejoiced in light of the U.S. SEC lawsuit end, the Fed Reserve kept interest rates unchanged. Simultaneously, Pi Network fluxed around the $1 mark this week, triggering a wave of speculation among investors. Other developments like a SUI ETF filing followed, stirring market optimism globally. Mentioned below are some of the top market updates reported by CoinGape over the past week. US FOMC Sparks Crypto Market Speculations With Unchanged Interest Rates The crypto market saw the latest US FOMC in play, with the Federal Reserve deciding to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25 to 4.5% this week. Nevertheless, speculations of a dovish stance as the year longs persist across the market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the inflation outlook is transitory with the Donald Trump-induced tariff in North America. Notably, the Fed appears to be gauging the impact of recent macro dynamics before making a rate cut decision. BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes further took the stage amid the FOMC decision, stating he believes a rate cut is looming for April 1. In turn, the CEO also anticipated a BTC rally to follow, given that the feat happens. Bitcoin closed the week at the $84K price level, whereas major altcoins mainly prevented downturns. XRP Lawsuit End: Affirms Ripple CEO Simultaneously, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse proclaimed that the U.S. SEC has agreed to drop the XRP lawsuit this week. While this news offered the Ripple community immense relief, a butterfly effect occurred in the crypto market. The SEC’s stance on cryptocurrencies saw a loosened grip under Trump’s presidency. Meanwhile, CLO Stuart Alderoty revealed the next steps following the U.S. SEC’s declaration of an appeal drop in the lawsuit. In the interim, XRP price closed this week considerably above the $2 level, although the weekly chart showed a dip of 2%. Pi Network: What’s The Buzz? Pi Network stole the broader market’s attention, showcasing a highly fluxing action over the past week. CoinGape reported that this volatility came attributed to nearly 129 million Pi Coins ready for an unlock, worth about $175 million, set to be added to the supply this month. On the other hand, the crypto saw rising adoption in the Asian landscape this week. Vietnam-based Pi enthusiast Cryptoleakvn recently shared an update on X, highlighting a surge in Pi-accepting regions across the country. However, the Pi token faced investor selloff concerns amid its turbulent price action this week. The lack of major announcements by the crypto team has added to market concerns about future movements. In conclusion, mentioned above were some of the top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape over the past week. It’s also worth mentioning that Canary Capital filed for SUI ETF approval with the U.S. SEC this week.

After a steep correction from recent highs, DOGE is now consolidating in a tight range between $0.16 and $0.18. This zone has become a critical battleground for bulls and bears alike as investors wait for a clear breakout or breakdown. Related Reading: Investors Withdraw 360,000 Ethereum From Exchanges In Just 48 Hours – Accumulation Trend? For bulls, reclaiming levels above $0.18 is essential to kickstart a recovery and restore confidence in the asset’s short-term outlook. If DOGE can break above this resistance, momentum could quickly build toward higher price targets. However, continued weakness below $0.16 could signal a deeper correction ahead. Despite the recent struggles, on-chain data paints a more optimistic picture. According to Santiment, whales have accumulated over 120 million DOGE in the past week, suggesting that large holders are positioning for a potential rebound. This increase in whale activity is often seen as a bullish signal, especially during periods of consolidation. Whether Dogecoin can capitalize on this support remains to be seen, but for now, the groundwork for a breakout is being laid. Dogecoin Consolidates Ahead Of Potential Breakout Dogecoin has remained in a tight consolidation range since March 11, trading between $0.16 and $0.18 with no clear breakout in sight. This prolonged period of sideways movement has left investors on edge, as the entire crypto market awaits a decisive catalyst to determine the next major direction. Market conditions remain highly uncertain, driven by global macroeconomic instability, aggressive monetary policies, and ongoing trade tensions. As a result, traders are preparing for increased volatility. Meme coins like Dogecoin are typically among the most volatile assets during both bull and bear phases. In bear markets, they tend to be hit the hardest due to their speculative nature and lack of strong fundamentals compared to large-cap projects. With analysts split on whether this is a correction within a larger bull cycle or the beginning of a full-fledged bear market, Dogecoin’s next move could be pivotal. Despite the fear in the market, on-chain metrics suggest that large holders may be positioning for a move higher. According to data shared by top analyst Ali Martinez on X, whales have bought over 120 million DOGE in the past week alone. This accumulation by major players could signal growing confidence in a potential rebound, especially if Dogecoin can break above the $0.18 resistance zone. For now, the market continues to watch closely. A breakout from this range could lead to a rapid move, either up or down, with whale activity hinting that bulls may be preparing to take control. Whether Dogecoin rallies or retreats will depend on the broader market’s next move—but all eyes are on the meme coin leader. Related Reading: XRP Active Addresses Hit Highest Level Since April 2023 – Will Price Follow? Price Holds Key Support But Faces Crucial Resistance Ahead Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.16 after several days of consolidation between the $0.15 support and the $0.17 resistance level. This narrow range reflects the uncertainty dominating the broader crypto market, with meme coins like DOGE experiencing low volatility and cautious trading activity. Despite holding above $0.15—a critical support zone—bulls have been unable to generate enough momentum to push prices toward the $0.20 level. Reclaiming $0.20 is essential, as it would likely signal the start of a recovery phase and potentially trigger bullish sentiment across the Dogecoin community. That level could serve as a launchpad for a new rally, especially if broader market conditions stabilize and BTC leads a move upward. However, if DOGE fails to hold the $0.15 support, the risk of a deeper correction increases significantly. A breakdown below this level could send the price into lower demand zones, potentially testing the $0.13 or even $0.12 levels in a more bearish scenario. Related Reading: Ethereum Trades At A Critical Level – Major Reclaim Or Steep Drop Ahead? For now, the price remains range-bound, but pressure is building. Bulls must act soon to reclaim higher ground, or bears may seize control and drive DOGE into deeper losses. The coming days will be critical for determining short-term momentum.
