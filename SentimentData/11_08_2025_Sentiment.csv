During his tenure, Hines oversaw key policy initiatives, including the administration’s push for dedicated crypto regulations and the passage of the GENIUS Act, which established a framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins. Bo Hines Steps Aside The former college football player was appointed by President Donald Trump in December 2024 to lead the newly formed White House Crypto Council. The appointment followed Trump’s early-term executive order to establish the council as part of a broader plan to overhaul US digital asset policy. He also helped direct the release of a comprehensive digital asset regulatory roadmap and worked on implementing Trump’s executive order creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve. The reserve’s growth has been limited by rules requiring “budget-neutral” acquisition methods – meaning the government can only add BTC through asset seizures or other cost-free channels. In March, Hines suggested revaluing US gold holdings to free funds for Bitcoin purchases without adding to the federal budget. He also met with more than 150 industry representatives in his first three months. Patrick Witt to Replace Hines As for now, he will continue as a special government employee to assist with AI initiatives alongside AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks. Confirming the development, Hines tweeted , “Serving in President Trump’s administration and working alongside our brilliant AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks as Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council has been the honor of a lifetime. Together, we have positioned America as the crypto capital of the world. I’m deeply grateful to the industry for its unwavering support – I love this community and all we’ve built together.” Hines’ deputy, Patrick Witt, is expected to replace him. Witt happens to be a former Yale quarterback and Pentagon official and has experience in defense-related technology investment, but no direct background in the crypto sector. His political career includes a congressional run in Georgia and service as acting director of the Office of Strategic Capital.

At the forefront is Cold Wallet, now in presale below $0.01, already listed on CoinMarketCap, and offering real cashback rewards to users. Some analysts are hinting at a possible 100x rise, and early participants are watching closely. Yet Cold Wallet is not the only one drawing interest. ADA, POL, and ARB are also becoming strong talking points. For those following the top crypto gainers, these names are taking center stage. 1. Cold Wallet (CWT): Sub-$0.01 Presale, CMC Listed, and Building Buzz Cold Wallet is quickly getting noticed. With a presale price of $0.00998 in stage 17 out of 150, it stands out as one of the few early-stage projects already listed on CoinMarketCap. This visibility is helping it gain traction across crypto channels. What fuels further attention is the project’s structure, which some believe could lead to a 100x gain after launch. The wallet rewards users for their activity. Every gas fee, swap, or on/off-ramp transaction gives a portion back in $CWT, its native asset. The more it is used and the more CWT is held, the higher the cashback tier becomes. There is no staking and no lockup, just a consistent use-and-earn cycle. A recent $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, which brought in over 2 million users within seven months, adds to its growth story by instantly expanding its network reach. With $5.8 million already raised in presale and a launch price fixed at $0.3517, Cold Wallet is positioning itself among the top crypto gainers, especially while it remains priced under $0.01. 2. Cardano (ADA): Building Steady Growth Through Developer Focus Cardano continues to rank high in developer activity, a key metric for those who look at long-term strength. As more smart contracts and dApps go live on the network, its advantage comes from consistent technical delivery and research-based upgrades. While ADA is not new to the market, its careful and steady progress has led to a rising TVL and an expanding DeFi presence. Recent discussions on YouTube and Twitter connect Cardano’s upcoming update cycle with fresh interest from institutional players who value scalability and reliability over hype. Even with earlier concerns about speed, ADA still sees steady accumulation from buyers. Analysts now view it as one of the top crypto gainers, not for sudden short-term jumps, but for patient holders aiming for growth backed by the ecosystem. 3. Polygon (POL): Rebrand Signals New Phase of Expansion Polygon’s move from MATIC to POL is more than just a name change. It marks a bigger plan to bring together its growing zk-based scaling options. As the project shifts toward a modular multi-chain design, its role as Ethereum’s scaling layer is finding more attention in both DeFi and gaming sectors. Crypto Twitter influencers have noted POL’s developer-friendly tools, increasing gas use, and rising network revenue, all signs of a system moving into maturity. Its partnerships with major brands and new integrations in L2 infrastructure have landed POL on many lists of top crypto gainers to watch. With the rebrand still in its early stages and prices holding steady, POL’s position among the top crypto gainers could strengthen if its toolset adoption continues. While it is no longer at the earliest stage, it is still early in this rebrand, leaving room for further growth. 4. Arbitrum (ARB): Strong Layer 2 Activity and Growing Developer Base Arbitrum is one of Ethereum’s busiest Layer 2 solutions, often leading in both daily transactions and total value locked. Its appeal now also comes from a rise in DAO activity, funding programs, and governance votes linked to long-term incentives for the network. Although ARB’s price has been volatile, developer and builder interest stays high. It often trends in research updates and discussions on Ethereum scaling and liquidity bridging. Analysts watching large-scale bridging flows are starting to point to Arbitrum as a center for new projects, especially after the Dencun update. With ongoing support for grants and a governance plan that shapes the network’s direction, ARB has earned a place among the top crypto gainers in ecosystem growth. Its value is not only in speed but in who builds on it and how active the network remains. Closing View The biggest gains ahead might not come from sudden hype but from projects that keep adding value and adoption. Cold Wallet is making its mark with a cashback-based system, presale pricing under $0.01, and a CoinMarketCap listing before launch. At the same time, established names like ADA, POL, and ARB continue to show strength through developer engagement, adoption, and infrastructure upgrades. As more analysts and insiders highlight these projects, the chance for early positioning grows smaller. For those tracking the top crypto gainers , these four deserve close watch before their next major move.

ATOM’s recent climb has held firmly above key support, while Tron’s performance reflects growing on-chain engagement and heightened participation from larger holders. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) Network’s $0.0016 offer, available despite batch 29 being priced at $0.0276, gives late-stage buyers a chance to secure returns comparable to early participants without the risk of early presale entry. With over $368 million raised and 24.9 billion coins sold, it stands apart as one of the few decentralized projects offering this kind of value so deep into a presale. Final $0.0016 Window Delivers Early-Stage ROI Advantage BlockDAG’s special pricing at $0.0016 offers latecomers an opportunity to lock in near-origin level returns. While the presale’s live batch price sits at $0.0276, this discount equals roughly 94% off the current rate, creating one of the most favorable entries across any large-scale presale. Early buyers at $0.001 have already seen 2,660% growth in their holdings since batch 1, and this window gives newcomers similar potential without waiting for post-launch dips. This calculated pricing strategy strengthens BlockDAG’s position among top decentralized networks by avoiding exclusion at higher tiers and instead encouraging broader participation. It also boosts market confidence while expanding community size, setting the stage for robust liquidity after launch. For those focused on cost efficiency and precise timing, this moment is critical. Once the presale advances, this low entry will close, leaving no comparable pricing in sight. The combination of immediate value and significant upside potential makes BlockDAG’s $0.0016 entry one of the most strategic presale moves currently available. Cosmos ATOM Price Recovery Shows Renewed Strength The recent rebound in ATOM price has gained attention, with the asset bouncing from $4.18 to $4.30, marking a solid 3% lift from strong support levels. This move established a fresh range between $4.27 and $4.29, supported by sustained buying activity from larger market players. Additionally, ATOM’s climb from $4.13 to $4.24 came alongside trading volumes exceeding one million units, driven partly by news of a Cosmos-linked project being added to the Coinbase listing roadmap. These factors point toward improving sentiment and rising demand. If recent lows continue to serve as a firm base, the potential for further price gains remains open. Strong volume, a supportive technical setup, and renewed market interest position ATOM for possible upside extensions in the near term. Tron TRX Price Performance Signals Accumulation Tron’s price action has shown resilience despite being pushed back from the $0.334 resistance level. Support holds near the 20-day simple moving average at about $0.30, suggesting a stable foundation. On-chain data reinforces this outlook, with over 1.1 billion TRX burned in August, reducing circulating supply. Large holder activity has also surged, with whale transactions increasing more than 1,200%, signaling accumulation. Even with some profit-taking, trading volume climbed 26% to $931 million, underlining ongoing interest. Should TRX reclaim $0.334, resistance targets at $0.355 and potentially $0.38 become realistic. This combination of network activity, reduced supply, and consistent demand provides a case for strategic entry before a possible breakout, giving TRX an attractive setup for value-focused participants. Final Take While ATOM and TRX both present technical conditions that could lead to short-term price advances, their performance depends heavily on favorable market momentum. BlockDAG, on the other hand, offers a defined pricing advantage that does not require speculation on broader trends. The $0.0016 offer, set against a live batch price of $0.0276, creates a rare late-stage chance to capture early-stage ROI. With over $368 million raised and strong participation, BlockDAG gives those entering now a pricing advantage not typically available this far into a presale. For those seeking strategic entry and long-term growth potential, BlockDAG’s limited offer is a standout choice among leading decentralized projects today.

I Told You This Was Coming,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-they-want-your-xrp-i-told-you-this-was-coming/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld has issued a direct warning to cryptocurrency holders, particularly those invested in XRP, claiming that institutions are seeking to acquire retail investors’ holdings at undervalued prices. In a recent video shared alongside his tweet, Rietveld stated that the goal is not to acquire small amounts of XRP but to encourage holders to sell their entire positions. He linked this to tactics involving market manipulation, especially through the use of tariffs, which he says can trigger panic selling. Rietveld pointed to past instances where tariff-related news significantly impacted XRP’s price, noting that it has previously lost almost half its value overnight due to such developments. He referenced recent geopolitical tensions, citing President Donald Trump’s move to double tariffs on India over its purchase of Russian oil. India’s response, according to Rietveld, included deepening ties with Russia and exploring new trade agreements with Brazil and other nations rather than conceding to U.S. tariff pressure. He suggested that this could escalate further, potentially resulting in tariffs as high as 100%, which he believes may temporarily depress cryptocurrency prices before a recovery. THEY WANT YOUR XRP! I TOLD YOU THIS WAS COMING!!! #XRP pic.twitter.com/FfcBOyLkn4 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 8, 2025 Institutional Accumulation in the Current Bull Run Beyond tariff concerns, Rietveld emphasized the scale of institutional cryptocurrency accumulation in the current bull market compared to the 2020–2021 cycle. He cited examples from the previous cycle, such as MicroStrategy’s acquisition of over 70,000 Bitcoin by April 2021, Tesla’s $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase, and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust peaking at $40 billion in assets. He contrasted this with current trends, stating that institutional demand has grown significantly due to the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which by July 2025 had seen net inflows of over $50 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF reportedly recorded $370.2 million in inflows in a single day, while Ethereum ETFs saw $850 million in inflows within one week. Corporate and national holdings have also expanded, with MicroStrategy now holding over 226,000 Bitcoin and nations like Bhutan and El Salvador accumulating significant reserves. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP ETF Prospects and Market Impact Rietveld predicted that XRP will be a key focus of institutional accumulation moving forward, highlighting the launch of the ProShares Ultra XRP Futures ETF in July, which coincided with a surge to an all-time high of $3.66. Proposed spot XRP ETFs from Canary Capital, Grayscale, 21Shares, and WisdomTree reportedly have a 93% likelihood of approval, which he believes could lead to billions in inflows similar to what has been observed with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. He claimed that the accumulation of XRP in the 2024–2025 cycle has already increased by three to five times compared to the last bull run, and that the approval of spot ETFs could further accelerate this growth. In his view, selling XRP before such developments would be a significant mistake for holders, as institutions would benefit from acquiring assets at a discount before the anticipated price appreciation. Digital Assets as a Tariff-Resistant Store of Value Rietveld also referenced comments from Michael Saylor comparing Bitcoin to gold in the context of tariffs. Saylor argued that digital assets, such as Bitcoin, are immune to tariffs, unlike physical commodities, including gold. Rietveld agreed, stating that tariffs on gold could drive capital toward cryptocurrencies, which can be traded globally without additional tax burdens. He argued that this quality, combined with upcoming catalysts such as ETF approvals and potential interest rate cuts in the U.S., makes XRP particularly well-positioned for future growth. He concluded by reiterating that institutions are motivated by profit and will seek to buy assets during periods of fear and market downturns. According to Rietveld, retail investors selling XRP in such conditions are allowing these institutions to acquire the asset at discounted prices before significant market catalysts unfold.

The LayerZero Foundation (ZRO) has recently unveiled a groundbreaking proposal: the LayerZero Stargate acquisition . This potential merger aims to integrate Stargate (STG), a leading omnichain-native asset bridge, into the LayerZero ecosystem. This move could reshape how digital assets flow across various blockchains, making it a pivotal moment for interoperability and the broader DeFi landscape. What’s the LayerZero Stargate Acquisition All About? In a recent announcement made on X, the LayerZero Foundation laid out its ambitious plan. The core of this proposal involves a direct swap of Stargate (STG) tokens for LayerZero (ZRO) tokens. This isn’t just a simple buy-out; it’s a strategic integration designed to enhance the capabilities of both projects and solidify LayerZero’s position in the cross-chain space. The proposed exchange rate is set at 1 STG for 0.08634 ZRO. This rate applies to all circulating STG, whether it’s staked, actively voting, or held in wallets. Furthermore, the proposal includes an interesting mechanism for future revenue. Any additional income generated by Stargate post-acquisition would be channeled back into buying ZRO tokens. This process aims to reduce the overall supply of ZRO, potentially increasing its value over time. Understanding the Stargate (STG) Proposal Details The specifics of the Stargate (STG) proposal are now open for public review.

It is steadily increasing in user engagement, as evidenced by certain metrics. Shiny New Wallet In a press release shared with CryptoPotato, Flare announced the launch of its seedless, non‑custodial wallet Luminite. Turnkey’s embedded wallet technology was used to create Luminite, which allows users to set up their wallet using familiar sign-in methods such as passkeys, biometrics, or email, without needing to write down and store a seed phrase. Funds can be added via built-in fiat on‑ramp partners (including Topper) to purchase FLR, XRP, and other assets. “Luminite was built with one goal in mind: to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 users. By removing complex barriers to entry, we’re enabling anyone—from first-time users to seasoned crypto holders—to access the full power of the Flare ecosystem.This is about making DeFi approachable, not just for the crypto-native, but for the next wave of users discovering blockchain through real utility,” said Steve Chadwick, Co-founder of Luminite. Apart from onboarding, Luminite will also be a direct access point to Flare’s growing portfolio of DeFi protocols. Patrons will be able to delegate the native token, FLR, to FTSO (Flare Time Series Oracle) data providers. Additionally, it will be possible to mint FXRP tokens (tokenized version of XRP) via FAssets (non-smart contract assets bridged with full custody retained). Moreover, it will be possible to swap tokens within the wallet, bridge assets through the liquidity transport protocol Stargate, and engage in liquid staking by minting sFLR on Sceptre, the protocol for staking, all within the wallet Luminite interface. Flare has also unveiled plans for a future Learn & Earn program with Revolut, which will incentivize new users to explore the ecosystem through education and rewards based on engagement. FLR So Far The blockchain recently celebrated 3 years since its launch on June 25, 2022. Full operation started around 2-3 weeks following, in “observation mode”, where the Flare Foundation ran all validators. This phase lasted approximately 8 weeks, after which a token generation event (TGE) took place, during which 15% of the total FLR supply (~12 billion tokens) was released to the public via the Flare Improvement Proposal process. The native token has been up for the majority of the year, marking considerable gains during July, and the blockchain itself has locked in over $150 million in DeFi volume, according to data taken at the time of printing from DefiLlama.

Leadership changes within such influential advisory bodies often precede shifts in strategic focus or policy priorities. For investors, innovators, and policymakers alike, understanding these transitions is key. The ongoing dialogue about crypto regulation remains a top concern. As the political landscape evolves, so too will the approaches to governing cryptocurrencies. The work of the Trump crypto council , regardless of who leads it, plays a significant role in shaping the narrative and potential legislative actions should Trump return to office. This ongoing evolution underscores the dynamic nature of US crypto policy . Furthermore, the move by Bo Hines to the private sector might also highlight the increasing demand for crypto expertise outside of government. It suggests a growing recognition of digital assets as a legitimate and expanding economic sector, drawing talent from various fields. In conclusion, the transition of leadership within the Trump crypto council is more than just a personnel change. It represents an evolving approach to digital assets and crypto regulation within a potential future administration.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant institutional interest, many wonder about the next big step. A spot XRP ETF is a hot topic, particularly regarding financial giants like BlackRock. Despite the fervent hope from the XRP community, BlackRock maintains a remarkably cautious stance. Why is one of the world’s largest asset managers not rushing into a spot XRP ETF application? Limited Client Demand for XRP Investment? One primary reason BlackRock remains reserved is the current landscape of client demand. BlackRock operates on a data-driven approach, and their internal metrics reveal a clear preference. Bitcoin and Ethereum Dominance: Institutional clients primarily express demand for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) products. These cryptocurrencies hold established market positions and clearer regulatory paths in some jurisdictions. Niche Interest: While some clients inquire about other digital assets, the broad, consistent demand seen for BTC and ETH is not yet present for XRP. This makes a significant XRP investment product less of an immediate priority for the firm. Without robust client interest, the immediate business case for a new, complex product like a BlackRock XRP ETF becomes less compelling. Navigating Regulatory Hurdles for a Cryptocurrency ETF Regulatory uncertainty presents a significant challenge for any new cryptocurrency ETF . XRP’s situation is particularly complex. Ongoing legal battles surrounding XRP’s classification create an unpredictable environment that large institutions typically avoid. Legal Clarity Needed: BlackRock prefers clear and unambiguous regulatory frameworks before launching new products. The uncertainty around XRP’s status as a security or a commodity directly impacts the feasibility and risk profile of an ETF. Precedent Matters: The firm likely observes how existing regulatory decisions and potential future rulings could affect the broader digital asset market. They aim to ensure any new offering meets stringent compliance standards. Until definitive regulatory clarity emerges, the path for a spot XRP ETF remains fraught with potential legal and compliance risks BlackRock is keen to avoid. Is the Market Already Crowded for New Digital Asset Products? The race for crypto ETFs is intensifying, and the market for digital asset products is becoming increasingly competitive. BlackRock might perceive the current environment as already saturated with applications, making a rushed entry less strategic. Numerous Applications: At least seven other firms have already filed applications for a spot XRP ETF. This indicates a crowded field. Observing Competition: BlackRock may prefer to wait and observe how these initial applications fare with regulators and how the market responds. This allows them to learn from others’ experiences without incurring the initial risks. Entering a crowded market demands a unique selling proposition or a clear advantage, which may not be apparent for an XRP ETF at this juncture. The Data-Driven Disconnect: XRP’s Market Share and Operational Costs While the XRP community expresses immense enthusiasm, BlackRock’s decisions are rooted in hard data and financial viability. There appears to be a disconnect between community hype and the firm’s analytical approach. Smaller Market Share: Compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP holds a significantly smaller market share. This translates to less liquidity and potentially higher volatility, complicating ETF management. Higher Operational Costs: Managing an ETF for a less liquid or more volatile asset can incur higher operational costs, including custody, trading, and compliance. These costs might not be justified by potential revenue given XRP’s current market position. BlackRock’s rigorous due diligence ensures any new product is viable and aligns with their long-term financial objectives, which a spot XRP ETF may not currently meet. BlackRock’s Global Strategy and Regional XRP Demand BlackRock operates on a global scale, and its product launches often align with its broader international strategy. This perspective reveals another factor influencing their cautious approach to an XRP investment product. Weaker Demand in Key Regions: While XRP sees considerable trading volume in Asia, BlackRock’s primary focus for new product launches might be in regions where XRP demand is comparatively weaker or where regulatory clarity is still evolving. Strategic Alignment: The firm prioritizes products that can achieve widespread adoption across its core markets. If XRP’s institutional demand is concentrated in specific, non-priority regions, it lessens the immediate incentive for a global firm like BlackRock to launch a dedicated ETF. Ultimately, BlackRock’s strategic priorities play a crucial role in determining which digital asset products they pursue and when. Concluding Thoughts: A Measured Approach to XRP BlackRock’s measured approach to a spot XRP ETF is not a rejection of XRP itself, but rather a reflection of its meticulous, data-driven strategy. The firm prioritizes client demand, regulatory clarity, market conditions, and operational efficiency before diving into new investment vehicles. While the XRP community eagerly awaits, BlackRock continues to assess the landscape, ensuring any future moves are strategically sound and beneficial for its vast client base. This cautious stance underscores the complexities of launching new cryptocurrency products in an evolving financial ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a spot XRP ETF? A spot XRP ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds XRP, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself. Q2: Why is BlackRock being cautious about a spot XRP ETF? BlackRock’s caution stems from several factors, including limited institutional client demand beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP, a crowded market with many existing applications, and considerations regarding XRP’s market share and operational costs. Q3: How does regulatory uncertainty affect a BlackRock XRP ETF? Regulatory uncertainty, particularly the unresolved legal status of XRP in the US, creates significant risks for financial institutions. BlackRock prefers clear regulatory frameworks to ensure compliance and minimize legal liabilities for any new cryptocurrency ETF . Q4: Does BlackRock’s caution mean they will never launch an XRP ETF? Not necessarily. BlackRock’s approach is strategic and data-driven. If client demand increases, regulatory clarity emerges, and market conditions become more favorable, BlackRock could reconsider a spot XRP ETF in the future. Their current stance is about timing and risk management. Q5: What are ‘digital asset products’ in this context? In this context, ‘digital asset products’ refer to various investment vehicles that provide exposure to cryptocurrencies, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), trusts, or other structured products designed for institutional and retail investors.

Expert Says Next Week Will Shock the World,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-ready-for-a-huge-breakout-expert-says-next-week-will-shock-the-world/,"Crypto commentator Bark has stated that $XRP is positioned for a significant upward move, setting a price target of $15. In a post on X, Bark wrote, “XRP is ready for a huge breakout. Target is $15. Next week will SHOCK the world.” The projection was shared alongside a detailed chart analysis indicating the technical basis for this forecast. Technical Analysis Presented in the Chart Bark’s attached chart shows a clear bullish continuation pattern, identified as a flag formation. The structure consists of a steep rise, labeled the “Flag Pole,” followed by a period of consolidation within parallel trendlines, labeled the “Flag Formation.” The chart indicates a breakout from this consolidation phase, with a “Flag Breakout Target” positioned at approximately $15.35562. At the time of the analysis, $XRP is shown trading around $2.95905, with a highlighted support base between $2.42493 and $2.67066. Fibonacci retracement levels of 0.382 and 0.5 are overlaid in this zone, suggesting potential areas where price could stabilize before continuing higher. The chart projects a strong upward trajectory from current levels toward the $15 target, implying a multi-fold price increase if achieved. $XRP is ready for a huge breakout. Target is $15. Next week will SHOCK the world. pic.twitter.com/BqFIXQ8hBL — Bark (@barkmeta) August 9, 2025 Legal Resolution Between Ripple and the SEC The bullish outlook is being shared in the context of a major legal resolution. Both Ripple and the SEC have withdrawn their respective appeals in the long-running lawsuit, formally bringing the case to a close. This follows years of litigation that began in December 2020, when the SEC filed its initial complaint. The withdrawal of appeals means that prior rulings, including the determination that XRP sales on public exchanges do not constitute securities transactions, remain in place. Market participants have interpreted this conclusion as removing a significant regulatory uncertainty that has weighed on the asset since the start of the legal proceedings. Market Implications The XRP community is closely watching Bark’s projection and the legal conclusion. The charted target of $15 represents a substantial potential upside from current levels, and some traders see the resolution of the SEC case as a catalyst for increased institutional and retail interest. While Bark’s analysis focuses on the technical setup and provides a clear price target, market conditions can shift rapidly, and achieving such levels would depend on continued bullish momentum and broader market support. Nonetheless, the combination of a completed bullish chart pattern and the removal of a major legal overhang has reinforced optimism among certain XRP supporters.

At the same time, one project is drawing even more focus. BlockDAG (BDAG) has already raised $368 million in its presale and is projecting a potential 3,025% ROI before launch. Stellar (XLM) Breakout Signals a Shift in Trend Stellar (XLM) is showing renewed strength after an extended period of decline.

Speaking in Washington on August 7, Bessent described the qualities he believes the position demands. “It’s someone who has to have the confidence of the markets, the ability to analyze complex economic data,” he told the Japan’s Nikkei . He added that the next chair should be focused on future trends rather than relying too heavily on historical patterns. According to Reuters , Bessent is leading efforts to choose a successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May. The candidate list now includes an experienced economic adviser and a onetime head of a regional Federal Reserve Bank. When asked about President Donald Trump’s repeated public calls for lower interest rates, Bessent said the president makes his position known, but stressed that “at the end of the day, the Fed is independent.” Bessent outlines broader meaning of “strong dollar” policy Regarding currency strategy, Bessent explained that his administration’s concept of a “strong dollar” isn’t linked to a specific number shown on markets, but to the dollar’s comparative position against other currencies. “The strong dollar policy is to have policies that continue to keep the U.S. dollar the reserve currency,” he said. “And if we have good economic policies, then the dollar will naturally be strong.” Bessent has previously held talks on exchange rates with Japan’s Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato. In May, during a G7 meeting, they concluded the dollar-yen exchange rate at that moment aligned with underlying fundamentals. In June, the Treasury Department informed Congress that the Bank of Japan should maintain its course of policy tightening, which it argued would help “normalize” the yen’s weakness. Bessent said he believes that as long as the BOJ focuses on fundamentals such as inflation and growth, exchange rates will adjust on their own. He said Governor Kazuo Ueda and the BOJ board are aiming for an inflation target rather than a currency level. The BOJ last year wrapped up a decade of large-scale stimulus and raised short-term interest rates to 0.5% in January, concluding that Japan was close to sustainably reaching its 2% inflation goal. Since then, policymakers have been cautious about further hikes. Analysts point to this gradual pace as one factor behind the yen’s weak performance against major currencies. While inflation has stayed above the 2% target for more than three years, Ueda has urged careful review of how U.S. tariffs might affect Japan’s fragile economy. List of potential Powell successors grows There are now about 10 possible replacements for Powell. Among them are former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, now dean of Purdue University’s business school, and Marc Sumerlin, who served as an economic adviser to President George W. Bush. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and current Fed Governor Christopher Waller are also being considered. Trump has made clear he wants a chair willing to cut rates. Hassett, Warsh, and Waller have all indicated openness to lowering borrowing costs. Bullard said in May he believed the Fed could reduce rates by September. Sumerlin’s recent stances on monetary policy are not publicly known. The president moved quickly to fill another Fed Board position this week after Governor Adriana Kugler resigned. Stephen Miran from the Council of Economic Advisers will finish her term, which ends January 31. Trump is also continuing his search for a nominee to fill the upcoming 14-year term starting February 1. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Alena Vranova, founder of hardware wallet maker SatoshiLabs, sounded the alarm at the Baltic Honeybadger 2025 conference in Riga, Latvia. She told the audience that these crimes—known as “wrench attacks”—involve kidnappings, physical assaults, and extortion, all aimed at forcing victims to hand over their private keys. Vranova said that every week , at least one Bitcoiner somewhere in the world is kidnapped, tortured, extorted, or subjected to even worse crimes. She added that, contrary to the common belief that such attacks only target wealthy “Bitcoin OGs,” cases have been recorded involving kidnappings over as little as $6,000 worth of cryptocurrency and murders for $50,000 in crypto. Industry data shows 2025 could be the most dangerous year yet. Chainalysis reports that the number of wrench attacks so far has nearly matched the worst year on record, and could double by year’s end if the trend continues. Data leaks supercharge criminal targeting One of the biggest drivers of the spike in violent attacks against crypto holders is the massive wave of personal data breaches from centralized services. Alena Vranova, founder of SatoshiLabs, told the Baltic Honeybadger 2025 audience that the scale of the problem is staggering: more than 80 million crypto user identities are currently exposed online, with 2.2 million of them revealing home addresses. Most of these leaks stem from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet service providers bound by the Know Your Customer (KYC) legislation. Although adopted to prevent money laundering and other financial crimes, these rules oblige the platforms to store sensitive information such as name, telephone number, official identification, and residence address. This, in turn, is a “shopping list” for criminals who may wish to either steal or distribute the data once stolen. The consequences are not purely academic. U.S. exchange Coinbase confirmed in May 2025 that a hack had occurred involving some customers’ names and personal informatio n, including addresses. A month later, cybersecurity publication Cybernews discovered various databases exposing over 16 billion stolen credentials from large tech companies such as Apple, Facebook, and Google. The records contain passwords, geo locations, and personal information like the names of people who share email accounts that can be used to identify cryptocurrency investors. Stolen personal information is now being combined with blockchain analysis tools so criminals can identify anyone with a lot of Bitcoin or other digital currencies. Once these victims are identified, targeted phishing schemes or SIM-swapping attacks can be carried out, or in the worst-case scenario, physical violence is used to pressure victims into providing their private keys. As the bull market attracts newer and often less operationally secure investors, it also leads to action by criminal organizations who view this heightened attention as a means to increase their bottom lines through theft or extortion, she said. The growing concern is that should the cycle we have seen above repeat in unison with stronger data protection and better privacy practices, the leaking of KYC databases combined with increasing crypto valuations will hypercharge an environment where Bitcoiners are under threat worldwide. Crypto holders step up security amid rising attacks The cryptocurrency community is responding to the spike in violence with a new focus on physical and operational security. High-profile Bitcoiners hire private security, reinforce home protections, and use privacy tools to obscure their holdings. In some cases, even everyday retail investors are beginning to take precautions. Industry safety advocates recommend reducing one’s public crypto profile, using non-custodial wallets, splitting holdings across multiple secure locations, and avoiding public discussion of investment size or strategy. Experts also stress the importance of “opsec” (operational security) hygiene: using unique passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, regularly checking if personal information has been exposed in data breaches, and staying alert for unusual contact attempts. If the current trend holds, 2025 will surpass but potentially double the previous record for violent physical attacks against crypto holders—a sobering milestone for a technology once hailed as “digital gold.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This incident casts a significant shadow over the digital asset space, raising critical questions about legal boundaries and the risks faced by those building the decentralized future. “Fede’s Intern,” a known Ethereum developer, was recently detained in Izmir, Turkey, facing allegations of aiding others in misusing the Ethereum network. While specific details remain scarce, this development sends a clear message about the increasing scrutiny on blockchain activities globally. What Led to the Ethereum Developer Detention in Turkey? According to reports from BeInCrypto, Turkish authorities apprehended the developer, accusing them of enabling illicit activities on the Ethereum network. The developer himself confirmed the allegations in a post on X, indicating that the authorities believe he facilitated misuse. This situation underscores the complex legal landscape surrounding blockchain technology, where the lines between facilitating innovation and enabling misuse can become blurred. Allegations: Helping others misuse the Ethereum network. Location: Izmir, Turkey. Source: BeInCrypto, developer’s X post. Echoes of Past Crypto Legal Issues: A Troubling Trend? This incident eerily mirrors the case of Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan, who was detained in Nigeria for nearly eight months on money laundering charges. Both cases highlight a growing trend where individuals associated with prominent blockchain platforms face severe legal challenges in various jurisdictions. The detention of an Ethereum developer like “Fede’s Intern” suggests that regulatory bodies are intensifying their efforts to control and investigate digital asset activities, regardless of the individual’s direct involvement in illicit transactions. The parallels are striking: High-profile individuals in the crypto space. Detention by national authorities. Allegations related to financial misconduct or network misuse. Unclear or evolving legal frameworks. These events contribute to a climate of uncertainty, particularly concerning crypto legal issues Turkey and other nations are grappling with as they navigate the complexities of blockchain technology. Navigating the Challenges of Ethereum Network Misuse The core accusation against the developer revolves around Ethereum network misuse . This term can encompass a wide range of activities, from facilitating scams and illicit financing to enabling unauthorized transactions. Developers, while building open-source protocols, often find themselves in a precarious position. They create tools that can be used for good, but also for nefarious purposes by bad actors. The challenge lies in defining the extent of a developer’s responsibility for how their creations are ultimately used by others. As the Ethereum network continues to grow and decentralize, the responsibility for monitoring and preventing misuse becomes increasingly distributed and complex. This incident could prompt deeper discussions within the Ethereum community about: Enhanced security measures for users. Better educational resources on responsible network use. Collaborative efforts with law enforcement, where appropriate. What Does This Mean for Global Blockchain Regulation? The detention of an Ethereum developer in Turkey underscores the urgent need for clearer, more harmonized blockchain regulation worldwide. Currently, many countries are still developing their legal frameworks for digital assets, leading to a patchwork of rules that can create significant compliance challenges for individuals and companies operating across borders. This lack of clarity can inadvertently expose even well-intentioned participants to legal risks. For the broader crypto ecosystem, such incidents could: Deter developers from contributing to open-source projects. Increase legal and operational costs for crypto businesses. Push innovation into less regulated, potentially riskier, jurisdictions. It highlights the critical importance of robust legal counsel and proactive engagement with regulatory bodies to understand and comply with evolving laws regarding digital assets. Digital Asset Legal Challenges: A Call for Clarity The “Fede’s Intern” case is a stark reminder of the significant digital asset legal challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry. As blockchain technology becomes more integrated into global finance and daily life, governments are keen to assert control and prevent its exploitation for illegal activities. However, the methods and scope of this control are still being defined, often resulting in ambiguous interpretations and potentially harsh consequences for individuals. It is imperative for the crypto community, policymakers, and legal experts to collaborate on developing sensible and clear regulations that: Protect users from fraud and illicit activities. Foster innovation and technological advancement. Provide legal certainty for developers and businesses. Without such clarity, incidents like the Ethereum developer detention will likely become more frequent, creating a chilling effect on an industry striving for decentralization and transparency. Conclusion: Navigating a Shifting Landscape The detention of the Ethereum developer in Turkey serves as a potent reminder of the escalating legal and regulatory pressures within the global cryptocurrency space. While the specifics of “Fede’s Intern’s” case remain to be fully disclosed, it undeniably highlights the increasing risks for individuals operating in the decentralized ecosystem. As governments worldwide grapple with defining the boundaries of digital assets, proactive engagement, robust legal understanding, and a commitment to responsible innovation become paramount. The future of blockchain depends on finding a balance between fostering technological progress and ensuring legal compliance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

This strong lead has, surprisingly, prevented the typical altcoin season from unfolding, a phenomenon noted in the Bybit x Block Scholes Quarterly Report. Historically, post-halving rallies saw traders quickly shift funds into altcoins, seeking higher risk and potentially greater returns. However, this cycle feels distinctly different; altcoins have only delivered modest gains so far, prompting many to question the traditional market rotation. Why is Bitcoin Dominance So High? Unpacking Institutional Crypto Investment The primary driver behind Bitcoin’s sustained dominance is the increasing influence of institutional crypto investment . These large entities, including hedge funds, asset managers, and sovereign wealth funds, approach the crypto market with a different strategy than individual retail investors. They prioritize stability, liquidity, and regulatory compliance. A key vehicle for this institutional interest is the advent of regulated products like spot Bitcoin ETFs . These exchange-traded funds provide a straightforward, secure, and compliant way for institutions to gain exposure to BTC without the complexities of direct asset management or custody. Consequently, significant capital inflows have been directed primarily into Bitcoin, bolstering its market share. This institutional preference means capital often flows into Bitcoin first and tends to stay there for the long term, rather than rotating into smaller, more volatile altcoins. The traditional “trickle-down” effect, where Bitcoin’s gains eventually fuel broader altcoin rallies, is significantly muted in this cycle due to this fundamental shift in investor demographics. Is the Altcoin Season Delayed, or Fundamentally Changed? While the broad altcoin season we’ve seen in previous cycles might be delayed, it’s more accurate to say the market structure is fundamentally changing. Ethereum (ETH), often considered a bellwether for altcoin performance, still holds a lower market share compared to prior altseasons. This indicates a broader lack of widespread enthusiasm for the general altcoin market, unlike the speculative frenzy of 2017 or 2021. The current environment highlights a preference for established, larger-cap assets. Investors, particularly institutions, are less inclined to take on the higher risks associated with smaller altcoins. Instead, they seek out projects with proven track records and strong fundamentals. This discernment is a hallmark of a maturing market. Could Ethereum ETFs Spark a Selective Altcoin Season? The narrative could indeed change, albeit selectively. The potential approval of staking-enabled Ethereum ETFs could be a significant catalyst. Such a development would open doors for more institutional capital to flow into ETH, offering not just price exposure but also staking yield, which is highly attractive to long-term holders. If approved, these Ethereum ETFs could spark a more discerning and selective altseason. This would likely benefit only higher-quality, established altcoins with robust ecosystems, strong development teams, and clear utility. Projects that can demonstrate real-world applications and sustainable growth models are more likely to attract the attention of sophisticated investors. What does this mean for investors? Due Diligence is Key: Thoroughly research projects beyond mere hype. Focus on Fundamentals: Look for strong use cases, active development, and clear value propositions. Risk Management: Understand that not all altcoins will perform equally, and many may not see significant gains. Long-Term View: Institutional influence encourages a longer-term investment horizon. Navigating the New Crypto Landscape: What to Watch Understanding this profound shift is crucial for all investors. The market is maturing, moving beyond speculative retail-driven pumps towards more fundamental, institutionally-backed growth. This means traditional metrics and past cycle patterns may not apply as directly as before. The sustained Bitcoin dominance is a clear indicator of this new era, driven by significant institutional crypto investment . The era of easy, broad altcoin gains might be behind us, replaced by a more discerning environment. Keep a close eye on regulatory developments, especially concerning new crypto ETFs like potential Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs , as these will continue to dictate the flow of institutional capital and, by extension, the market’s overall direction. This evolving landscape will define future investment opportunities. In summary: Bitcoin’s continued dominance is a direct result of significant institutional crypto investment , primarily through Bitcoin ETFs . This dynamic is delaying the traditional altcoin season . While a broad altseason seems unlikely soon, the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs could trigger a more selective altcoin rally, favoring strong, established projects. The crypto market is evolving, and understanding these institutional forces is vital for navigating future trends and identifying where true value lies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Bitcoin dominance, and why is it important? Bitcoin dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. It is important because it indicates Bitcoin’s strength relative to altcoins and often signals market sentiment and potential shifts in capital flow. 2. Why isn’t there a typical altcoin season this cycle? The current cycle’s altcoin season is delayed primarily due to the increased influence of institutional investors who prefer to hold larger, more stable assets like Bitcoin, often through ETFs, rather than rotating funds into smaller, more volatile altcoins. 3. How are institutional investors influencing Bitcoin’s market share? Institutional investors are directing substantial capital into Bitcoin, particularly via regulated products like Bitcoin ETFs. This large-scale, long-term investment preference keeps capital concentrated in BTC, boosting its market share and reducing the liquidity available for a broad altcoin rally. 4. What impact do Bitcoin ETFs have on the market? Bitcoin ETFs provide a regulated and accessible avenue for institutional and traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. They bring significant capital inflows, enhance market legitimacy, and contribute to Bitcoin’s price stability and sustained market dominance. 5. Could Ethereum ETFs trigger a new altcoin rally? The potential approval of staking-enabled Ethereum ETFs could attract substantial institutional capital to ETH. This might spark a more selective altcoin rally, benefiting high-quality, established altcoins with strong fundamentals rather than a broad market surge. 6. What should investors do in this new market landscape? Investors should prioritize due diligence, focus on altcoins with strong fundamentals and real-world utility, manage risk carefully, and adopt a longer-term investment perspective, understanding that institutional influence is reshaping traditional market cycles.

A score of 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’, while 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed’. A higher score, like the current 70, suggests that investors are feeling confident and highly optimistic. This index helps market participants gauge whether the crypto market is becoming overly bullish or bearish. Historically, extreme fear can signal a potential buying opportunity, while extreme greed might indicate that a market correction is on the horizon. How is Crypto Market Sentiment Measured? The index compiles data from six distinct factors to calculate the overall crypto market sentiment . Each factor contributes a specific weight to the final score, providing a comprehensive view of investor behavior and market conditions: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current price fluctuations and drawdowns of Bitcoin, assessing the stability or instability of the market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): It analyzes the current trading volume and the strength of the market, indicating the level of buying and selling pressure. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and sentiments, gauging public interest and emotional trends. Surveys (15%): Although currently paused, this factor previously gathered direct investor opinions to understand their future expectations. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, which can reveal shifts in investor preference between Bitcoin and altcoins. Google Trends (10%): It assesses search interest for various crypto-related terms, reflecting general public curiosity and engagement. What Does ‘Greed’ Mean for Your Investments? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index enters the ‘Greed’ zone, it often signifies that cryptocurrency prices have experienced significant upward movement. Investors might be feeling overly confident, potentially leading to irrational exuberance and speculative buying. This heightened enthusiasm can sometimes precede a market pullback or consolidation. However, a ‘Greed’ reading also indicates strong buying pressure and a generally positive investor outlook. Traders often look for signs of overbought conditions during these periods of high greed. Understanding crypto volatility is particularly important here. While greed can certainly drive prices higher, it also increases the risk of sharp corrections as the market becomes overheated. Always exercise caution and consider your risk tolerance. Navigating Market Momentum and Potential Pitfalls The current market momentum , clearly reflected in the index’s high score, suggests a strong upward trend is in play. This can be an exciting time for investors who are holding assets, as their portfolios may see significant gains. However, it is essential to remember that markets are cyclical. Historical data consistently shows that extreme greed phases can be challenging to navigate. They often precede a period of consolidation, or even a downturn, as profits are taken. Therefore, it is crucial to consider your personal risk tolerance and investment strategy. Do not let FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) dictate your financial decisions. A high index score is a powerful signal, but it is not a guarantee of continued gains. The Influence of Bitcoin Dominance on Sentiment Bitcoin dominance plays a noteworthy role in the overall index calculation. When Bitcoin’s market share increases, it can sometimes indicate a ‘flight to safety’ within the crypto space, where investors prioritize the largest and most established cryptocurrency. Conversely, a decrease in Bitcoin dominance might suggest that an ‘altcoin season’ is brewing, with funds flowing into smaller, more speculative assets. Currently, Bitcoin’s relative stability contributes significantly to the general positive sentiment observed in the index. Its performance often sets the overarching tone for the broader cryptocurrency market, influencing how investors perceive risk and opportunity across the entire ecosystem. Conclusion: Stay Informed, Stay Strategic The recent rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 70 undeniably signifies a robust ‘Greed’ phase in the market. This reflects heightened optimism and a strong positive crypto market sentiment among participants. While such periods can be exhilarating, it is vital to remain strategic and grounded in your investment approach. Use this index as a valuable tool for insight, not as a definitive crystal ball. Combine its signals with your own thorough research, technical analysis, and robust risk management strategies. In the dynamic and fast-paced crypto landscape, informed decisions are always the most beneficial decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: It’s a tool by Alternative.me that measures current crypto market sentiment, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). It helps gauge investor emotions. Q2: How is the index calculated? A: It uses six factors: volatility (25%), market momentum/volume (25%), social media (15%), surveys (15% – currently paused), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google Trends (10%). Q3: What does a score of 70, like the current one, mean? A: A score of 70 indicates the market is in a “Greed” phase. This suggests strong positive sentiment and high optimism among investors, often seen during price rallies. Q4: Should I buy or sell based solely on the index? A: No, the index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct buy/sell signal. While extreme fear can suggest a buying opportunity and extreme greed a potential correction, always combine its insights with thorough research and your personal risk strategy. Q5: How does Bitcoin dominance affect the index? A: Bitcoin dominance reflects Bitcoin’s market share. Its movements can influence overall market sentiment. A rising dominance might indicate a flight to safety, while a falling one could signal an altcoin season, both impacting the index’s calculation. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Why do these crypto token unlocks matter so much for the cryptocurrency market impact ? When a large number of previously locked tokens enter circulation, it increases the total supply available. This influx can lead to selling pressure, especially if early investors or team members decide to take profits immediately. However, it’s not always a bearish event. Sometimes, a well-anticipated unlock is already priced into the market, or the project’s fundamentals are strong enough to absorb the new supply without significant negative effects. Understanding the context of each digital asset release is key. Navigating Digital Asset Releases: What Should Investors Consider? For investors, understanding the comprehensive token unlock schedule is crucial. It allows you to anticipate potential market movements and adjust your strategy accordingly. Don’t just look at the raw numbers; consider the percentage of circulating supply being unlocked. If a significant portion of the circulating supply is released, it might warrant closer attention. Conversely, a smaller percentage might have a negligible effect. Before the ARB token unlock or any other major release, conduct thorough research into the project’s long-term vision, development activity, and community sentiment. Diversifying your portfolio also helps mitigate risks associated with single-asset volatility. In summary, this week’s crypto token unlocks present both opportunities and challenges for market participants. By staying informed about the token unlock schedule and understanding its potential cryptocurrency market impact , you can make more informed decisions. Always remember to do your own research and invest wisely in the dynamic world of digital asset releases . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a token unlock in cryptocurrency? A token unlock refers to the scheduled release of previously restricted cryptocurrency tokens into the circulating supply. These tokens are typically held by project teams, early investors, or advisors and are locked up for a set period to prevent immediate sell-offs and support long-term project stability. 2. Why do crypto projects implement token lock-ups? Projects implement token lock-ups to ensure the long-term commitment of core contributors and early investors, prevent market manipulation from large token dumps, and create a controlled supply release that aligns with project development milestones. 3. How do token unlocks affect crypto prices? Token unlocks can increase the circulating supply of a cryptocurrency, which, if not met with increased demand, can lead to selling pressure and potential price drops. The actual cryptocurrency market impact depends on the unlocked amount, market sentiment, and the project’s fundamentals. 4. Which major tokens are featured in this week’s token unlock schedule? This week’s token unlock schedule includes significant releases for MOCA, APT, LAYER, IO, PUMP, BB, STRK, CYBER, ARB, ZBCN, VANA, ERA, APE, and ZK, among others, according to DropsTab data. 5.

While a substantial sum, it represents 1.82% of the circulating supply, making it important for investors to monitor its potential effects. 6. What should investors do to prepare for crypto token unlocks? Investors should research the specific project, understand the percentage of circulating supply being unlocked, assess the project’s long-term viability, and consider diversifying their portfolio to mitigate risks associated with these crypto token unlocks .

This strategic move highlights how major players navigate the volatile digital asset landscape to secure impressive gains. What Triggered the Significant ETH and 1INCH Sale? Recently, the investment fund associated with the 1inch team executed a substantial ETH and 1INCH sale , totaling approximately $22.87 million. According to insights from the reputable on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, this wasn’t just a random transaction but a calculated maneuver. The fund sold 5,000 ETH, converting it into $21.07 million in USDC. Additionally, 6.45 million 1INCH tokens were offloaded for $1.8 million in USDC. These actions demonstrate active portfolio management within the dynamic decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Understanding the Gains: A Smart Crypto Investment Fund Strategy One of the most compelling aspects of this transaction is the impressive profit realized by the 1inch fund. The ETH was initially acquired in February, while the 1INCH tokens were purchased in July. Holding these assets for a strategic period allowed the fund to capitalize on market appreciation. This particular crypto investment fund netted an astounding $8.36 million in realized gains from these sales. This figure underscores the potential for significant returns when investments are timed judiciously and based on thorough market understanding. The Power of On-Chain Analysis in Today’s Market How do we know about these intricate details? This is where on-chain analysis becomes invaluable. Tools and experts like @EmberCN monitor public blockchain data, providing transparency into large-scale transactions that might otherwise go unnoticed. For investors, following such analyses offers: Early Insights: Understanding major fund movements before they become widely reported. Market Sentiment: Gauging whether large holders are accumulating or distributing assets. Strategic Learning: Observing how successful funds manage their portfolios. This level of transparency is a unique characteristic of the blockchain space, offering a distinct advantage to those who leverage it. Implications for the Decentralized Finance Landscape The 1inch fund offloads of significant amounts of ETH and 1INCH also send ripples through the broader decentralized finance sector. While these sales represent profit-taking, they can also influence short-term market sentiment for the respective assets. For the 1inch protocol itself, such moves by its associated fund can be seen as a sign of financial health and strategic flexibility. The ability to realize substantial gains provides capital that can be reinvested into further development, liquidity provision, or other strategic initiatives that benefit the 1inch ecosystem and its users. Key Takeaways for Crypto Enthusiasts The 1inch fund’s recent activities offer several important lessons for anyone involved in cryptocurrencies: Patience Pays: Holding assets through market fluctuations can lead to substantial profits. Strategic Exits: Knowing when to take profits is as crucial as knowing when to enter. Data is Power: Leveraging on-chain analysis provides a competitive edge in understanding market dynamics. Ultimately, this event underscores the sophisticated strategies employed by professional crypto entities and the ongoing evolution of the digital asset market. The 1inch fund’s strategic offloading of ETH and 1INCH, yielding millions in profit, serves as a compelling case study in effective crypto portfolio management. It highlights the importance of timely acquisitions, astute market observation, and the invaluable insights provided by on-chain data. As the crypto market continues to mature, such calculated moves by significant players will remain a focal point for understanding broader trends and opportunities.

Then paying close attention to upcoming economic events is absolutely vital. These macroeconomic indicators, particularly those from the U.S., can significantly influence investor sentiment and trigger substantial crypto market impact . This week brings a series of key economic data releases and central bank commentaries that could set the tone for digital asset prices. Understanding these moments can help you make more informed decisions. What Key Economic Events Are Happening This Week? This week is packed with important announcements that could ripple through global markets, including cryptocurrencies. Here is a breakdown of the key U.S. economic events to watch closely, all times listed are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC): Tuesday, August 12: 12:30 UTC: U.S. Core CPI (YoY) (July) – The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures inflation, reflecting changes in the prices of goods and services purchased by consumers. The ‘Core’ CPI excludes volatile food and energy prices, providing a clearer picture of underlying inflation trends. A higher-than-expected CPI report can signal persistent inflation, potentially leading to a more hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates. This often creates uncertainty and can affect risk assets like cryptocurrencies. 14:00 UTC: U.S. FOMC Member Barkin Speaks – Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members often provide insights into the central bank’s economic outlook and monetary policy intentions. Remarks from Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin could offer clues on future interest rate decisions or quantitative tightening, which directly influences liquidity in financial markets. How Will Fed Speeches Influence Crypto Market Impact? Central bank communication is a powerful tool, and this week features multiple speeches from influential Federal Reserve officials. Their words can move markets as investors try to decipher the future direction of monetary policy. Wednesday, August 13: 17:00 UTC: U.S. Fed Goolsbee Speaks – Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee is another voice from the FOMC. His comments, especially on inflation or labor market conditions, can provide additional context to the Fed’s thinking. 17:30 UTC: U.S. FOMC Member Bostic Speaks – Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic’s remarks will also be under scrutiny. Collective insights from these FOMC speeches help shape market expectations for interest rates. Higher rates typically make traditional savings more attractive and can reduce the appeal of riskier assets like crypto. Navigating Potential Market Volatility with Key Data Thursday brings more crucial data points that will further inform the market’s perspective on the U.S. economy’s health and inflationary pressures. Understanding these can help you prepare for potential market volatility . Thursday, August 14: 12:30 UTC: U.S. Initial Jobless Claims – This weekly report indicates the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time. A rising number of claims suggests a weakening labor market, which could prompt the Fed to consider easing monetary policy. Conversely, strong employment figures might reinforce a hawkish stance. 12:30 UTC: U.S. Core PPI (YoY) (July) – The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. Like CPI, the ‘Core’ PPI excludes volatile items. It is an indicator of wholesale inflation, which can eventually filter down to consumer prices. A high PPI could signal future consumer inflation. 18:00 UTC: U.S. FOMC Member Barkin Speaks – Another opportunity for investors to hear directly from Barkin, potentially reinforcing or clarifying his earlier remarks, or reacting to the latest data releases. The cumulative effect of these economic events can lead to significant price swings in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin and altcoins often react sharply to U.S. macro data, as it influences the broader financial liquidity and risk appetite. For instance, a strong CPI report or hawkish FOMC speeches could lead to a ‘risk-off’ environment, impacting crypto negatively. Conversely, softer data or dovish remarks might signal a more favorable backdrop. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Stay Informed: Keep these dates and times marked in your calendar. Monitor Reactions: Observe how Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies react immediately after the data releases and speeches. Risk Management: Consider adjusting your portfolio or setting stop-loss orders if you anticipate high market volatility around these times. Long-Term View: While short-term fluctuations are possible, remember your long-term investment strategy. In conclusion, this week’s economic calendar is a crucial one for anyone invested in digital assets. From the all-important CPI report to multiple FOMC speeches and key labor/producer price data, each event carries the potential to trigger significant crypto market impact . By understanding these dynamics, you can better prepare for potential shifts and navigate the exciting, yet challenging, world of cryptocurrency investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why do U.S. economic events affect the global crypto market? A1: The U.S. dollar remains the world’s primary reserve currency, and U.S. monetary policy set by the Federal Reserve significantly influences global liquidity and investor sentiment. Changes in U.S. interest rates or inflation expectations often prompt shifts in investment flows worldwide, including into and out of risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Q2: What is the significance of the Core CPI report for crypto? A2: The Core CPI report indicates the underlying inflation rate, excluding volatile food and energy prices. If inflation is high and persistent, the Federal Reserve might continue or accelerate interest rate hikes, which can make traditional assets more attractive and reduce the appeal of cryptocurrencies as speculative investments, leading to a negative crypto market impact. Q3: How do FOMC speeches influence market volatility? A3: FOMC members’ speeches provide insights into the Federal Reserve’s economic outlook and future monetary policy decisions. Any hints about interest rate changes, quantitative tightening, or the overall health of the economy can cause significant market reactions, as investors adjust their positions based on anticipated policy shifts. This often leads to increased market volatility. Q4: What should crypto investors do during periods of high economic uncertainty? A4: During periods of high economic uncertainty, crypto investors should prioritize risk management. This includes staying informed about upcoming economic events, diversifying portfolios, considering smaller position sizes, and potentially using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Avoiding emotional trading and sticking to a well-researched investment strategy is also crucial. Q5: Besides CPI and FOMC speeches, what other economic data is important? A5: Other important economic data points include the Producer Price Index (PPI), which indicates wholesale inflation; Initial Jobless Claims, which signal labor market health; GDP reports, showing overall economic growth; and retail sales data, reflecting consumer spending. All these contribute to the broader economic picture that influences financial markets and crypto market impact. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Chronicle, the oracle infrastructure provider powering secure, scalable onchain financial data, has been named the exclusive partner to Grove Protocol, an institutional-grade credit platform with a $1 billion tokenized asset allocation strategy. Grove, part of the Sky ecosystem known as a 'Star', the name Sky uses for units in its network, launched in June with a $1 billion allocation to tokenized collateralized loan obligations such as the Janus Henderson Anemoy AAA CLO Strategy on Centrifuge, aiming to bridge DeFi and traditional credit markets by giving protocols and asset managers access to diversified, institutional-grade yields. Niklas Kunkel, Chronicle’s founder, said in an interview with CoinDesk that oracles have evolved beyond their early role as simple price feeds. “They started as general data distribution mechanisms and got really siloed into just prices for however many years, to the point where if you say Oracle to anyone in crypto, they immediately think of the thing that gives you a price,” he told CoinDesk. “It wasn’t until recently that that mold is finally being shed and people are starting to understand how important data and context can be and how that can be leveraged in a risk management type of way.” Kunkel sees tokenized assets as DeFi’s next major growth engine, describing them as a “multi-trillion dollar liquidity injection opportunity” as the sector looks beyond BTC and ETH. “RWAs are not crypto native, so the risk management around them needs to be much more scrutinized,"" he continued. ""Everything is not on chain, and so where oracles really fill that gap is to add that context back in, to bring that transparency back.” In Kunkel’s view, the regulatory potential of oracles is just beginning to be recognized. “In the real world, this is usually done through regulation where you need to make quarterly filings,” he said. “But in DeFi we expect finality in the span of blocks, and once regulators actually start understanding what oracles can do, they’re going to essentially become Oracle’s biggest adopters, because oracles essentially become like reg tech.” This partnership marks a step in Chronicle’s plan to dominate the tokenized asset oracle market, a position Kunkel believes will soon outgrow DeFi itself. Market Movers BTC: BTC is trading at $119K, up 2% in the last 24 hours. A recent JP Morgan note argued that a bullish S&P 500 outlook could lift BTC by boosting risk appetite and capital flows into speculative assets, given their historical positive correlation. ETH: ETH is trading above $4200. Bizantine Capital managing partner March Zheng said in a note to CoinDesk that the forced closure of so many ETH shorts during the past 72 hours as helped further accelerate the digital asset's rally. Gold: Gold is holding near record highs as weaker U.S. economic data, trade tensions, and a dovish Fed outlook boost demand, with upcoming inflation and retail sales data likely to shape its next move.

Currently, a key indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , stands at 36 as of 00:37 UTC on August 11. This specific reading signals a distinct period known as Bitcoin Season within the broader crypto market trends . What does this mean for your portfolio and how should you navigate these waters? What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), a leading cryptocurrency price data platform. It helps investors gauge the prevailing sentiment and capital flow within the digital asset space. This index meticulously compares the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies on CMC, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin. For a market to be in Altcoin Season , a significant majority—at least 75%—of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Conversely, Bitcoin Season occurs when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to surpass Bitcoin’s performance. The index itself ranges from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating stronger Altcoin Performance relative to Bitcoin. Navigating Bitcoin Season: What Does it Mean for Your Portfolio? With the Altcoin Season Index at 36, we are clearly in Bitcoin Season . This period often sees Bitcoin asserting its dominance, attracting a larger share of market capitalization and investor attention. For many altcoins, this can translate into slower growth or even price stagnation compared to Bitcoin. Understanding this dynamic is vital for effective digital asset analysis . During Bitcoin Season, investors often prioritize stability and the perceived safety of Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean altcoins are without opportunity, but their performance may be more subdued or require more selective investment strategies. Therefore, a careful assessment of individual altcoin projects becomes even more critical. Strategies for the Current Crypto Market Trends In a Bitcoin Season , your investment approach might need adjustment. While Bitcoin takes the lead, smart strategies can still yield results for your overall altcoin performance . Here are a few actionable insights: Focus on Bitcoin Strength: Consider increasing your exposure to Bitcoin if you believe its dominance will continue. Bitcoin often acts as a safe haven during uncertain periods in the broader crypto market. Selective Altcoin Investments: Instead of broad altcoin diversification, focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, and active development. These projects might be more resilient during Bitcoin’s reign. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue to invest fixed amounts regularly. This strategy helps mitigate volatility and can be particularly effective during periods of price consolidation for altcoins. Risk Management: Always prioritize risk management. Avoid over-leveraging and ensure your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance, especially when crypto market trends favor one asset over others. Thorough digital asset analysis is your best friend right now. Look beyond the immediate price action and delve into the long-term potential of projects. Conclusion: Adapting to Market Cycles The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 36 clearly signals a period of Bitcoin Season . This is a natural cycle within the dynamic cryptocurrency market, where dominance shifts between Bitcoin and various altcoins. By understanding these crypto market trends and conducting diligent digital asset analysis , investors can make informed decisions. Whether it’s prioritizing Bitcoin or strategically selecting resilient altcoins, adapting your approach to the prevailing market conditions is key to navigating the exciting world of digital assets and optimizing your altcoin performance . Stay informed, stay strategic! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does an Altcoin Season Index of 36 mean?

The Ethereum (ETH) update has been impressive, daily transactions are soaring to new highs, showing real usage growing beyond mere speculation! Meanwhile, the pepe coin (PEPE) update is all about meme‑coin bursts, upward rallies powered by social hype, but with shaky fundamentals. These dynamics illustrate the typical extremes in crypto: chain activity or meme mania. But there’s another way. Cold Wallet is building growth on real utility, returning value to users through cashback, but also offering 4,900% launch‑to‑presale ROI. When it comes to sustainable performance, it may just outclass current buzz altogether. In comparing network action, social hype, and use‑based adoption, a clearer picture forms. Cold Wallet combines practical utility with massive upside, making it a serious contender for long-term prominence among upcoming crypto coins. Ethereum (ETH) Update: On-Chain Activity Hits Record Highs Ethereum’s recent on‑chain data points to tangible growth, not just hype. Daily transactions recently reached 1.74 million, smashing previous records from the 2021 bull run. Unique address counts have surged as well, with hundreds of thousands of wallets joining the network. This reflects real demand across DeFi, NFTs, and institutional domains. Yet for all this activity, price performance remains capped, Ethereum is stuck in a consolidation zone despite strong usage numbers. Ethereum’s ability to support widespread application is clearly proven, but as a speculative vehicle, momentum is slower than usage suggests. The Ethereum (ETH) update points to strength, but investors looking for explosive upside may find better value elsewhere, especially among upcoming crypto coins that layer utility with aggressive presale gains. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Update: Meme Resurgence But Fragile Foundation Pepe Coin has recaptured the spotlight among meme enthusiasts, with a recent spike in whale accumulation and daily volumes creeping back up. Technical setups suggest potential short-term rallies to new highs if bullish momentum sustains. That’s the pulse of a classic pepe coin (PEPE) update, viral interest spurs quick gains. But meme coins live in volatile ecosystems. Downturns are often swift, and recovery depends heavily on social media cycles for survival. When comparing catalysts, PEPE’s momentum is top-down driven, valuable, but not grounded in real, everyday utility. For investors considering the top crypto to invest in, PEPE offers short-term thrills, but lacks sustainable growth mechanisms. Cold Wallet: Real Utility & 4,900% Launch Potential Cold Wallet transforms everyday usage into rewards. Instead of charging for every interaction, it reimburses users in CWT tokens when they pay gas, swap assets, or move funds. That means using the wallet makes you richer, not poorer. The presale is already drawing investor attention. With the current price at $0.00998 in Stage 17, Cold Wallet has sold 698.39M tokens, and raised a total of $5.9M. The launch price expectation of $0.50 gives early holders a 4,900% return, a level of upside unmatched by current hype leaders. These rewards are supported by sustainable tokenomics. Out of a 10B total supply, 40% is dedicated to early buyers, while 25% fuels the cashback incentives. This ensures the platform continues rewarding engagement well beyond launch. Cold Wallet’s referral structure further deepens its utility-based growth. Both referrer and referee receive bonuses vested over time, which aligns user growth with long-term retention. For anyone weighing the top crypto to invest in, Cold Wallet isn’t just rewarding speculation, it’s betting on daily usage and community expansion. The Future Outlook The Ethereum (ETH) update shows real adoption and technical growth through record transaction volumes, but price gains remain modest. The pepe coin (PEPE) update exhilarates with bursts of meme-fueled rallies, yet relies heavily on social hype and volatile sentiment. Cold Wallet sits at a different intersection, pairing genuine utility with extraordinary financial opportunity. Its cashback model turns crypto activity into rewards, and the presale’s 4,900% launch-potential ROI offers early investors a compelling growth trajectory. For long-term value without sacrificing upside, Cold Wallet emerges as a standout among upcoming crypto coins, one that may truly outperform speculative leaders in 2025 and beyond.

While whales shift their strategies, crypto traders are closely monitoring these developments for the next big opportunity. One such opportunity lies within the crypto betting world, where Spartans are quickly becoming a top platform for sports betting enthusiasts. With its focus on speed, efficiency, and tactical betting, Spartans is creating a new way for crypto holders to engage with sports. Spartans offers a dynamic betting experience with real-time stats, in-play odds, and quick bet placements. It’s designed to appeal to Cardano (ADA) holders by providing a live edge, as they can take advantage of combo bets with up to 8x odds and fast payouts after every match. Whether it’s basketball, soccer, or UFC, Spartans ensure that crypto bettors experience the same level of strategy and excitement as they would in a DeFi trade. Sports betting on Spartans is truly next-generation betting, fast and precise. Cardano Whale Moves Indicate A Bullish Future For ADA Recent activity from Cardano (ADA) whales has made a significant mark, with over 137 transactions exceeding $1 million each in just one day. This surge in high-value transactions comes at a crucial time, as ADA has risen sharply from its mid-June lows of around $0.50 to the current price range of $0.82–$0.88. This movement signals a renewed interest in ADA, with whales positioning themselves ahead of a potential breakout. Market analysts see $1.00 as the key resistance point, with projections for ADA to rise to as high as $1.30 if momentum continues. Technical indicators show that the RSI is strong, and ADA has regained key support zones, suggesting a positive outlook for the near future. With some analysts projecting ADA’s price could reach anywhere from $1.50 to $3.00 over the next year, Cardano remains one of the most closely watched assets in the market. For crypto traders, it’s a matter of timing their moves to align with large holders who are already preparing for what comes next in ADA’s journey. Celestia Price Outlook Driven By Strategic Buybacks The Celestia (TIA) price outlook has been relatively mixed, with the coin trading between $1.81 and $1.94 after bouncing from lows near $1.32. Some forecasts suggest that TIA could test support levels around $1.45. However, if buying pressure picks up, there’s potential for the price to reach $2.00. The Celestia Foundation’s recent $62.5 million buyback of 43.45 million tokens from Polychain has played a key role in supporting the token’s price by stabilizing the supply and reducing concerns of further sell-offs. Additionally, the foundation has updated its vesting schedule, starting mid-August, which has added confidence in the token’s short-term stability. Analysts are focusing on the $1.45 support level and predicting a range-bound market for TIA through the end of 2025. However, more optimistic projections indicate the possibility of TIA reaching $4–6 by 2026, especially if adoption grows alongside its modular blockchain. The upcoming Lotus upgrade, with staking rewards tied to vesting, is expected to be a major driver for price momentum. Investors are keeping a close eye on developments as they anticipate possible upward movement in the near term. Spartans: The Crypto Sportsbook Revolutionizing Betting Spartans stands out not just as a sportsbook but as an innovative platform tailored for crypto holders who want to bet with precision. By integrating live stats, dynamic in-play odds, and quick betslips, Spartans transform sports betting into a tactical experience similar to DeFi trading. Cardano holders, in particular, gain an edge with combo bets that offer up to 8x odds, increasing the potential for higher returns. Every bet is calculated, with real-time updates that allow users to adjust their strategies throughout a game. What sets Spartans apart from other crypto casinos is the ability to make sports betting feel as fast and tactical as cryptocurrency trading. By offering instant withdrawals, bettors no longer have to wait long after the final whistle. Winnings are quickly transferred to wallets, ensuring the excitement doesn’t stop. This feature has made Spartans a go-to platform for crypto enthusiasts who treat sports wagers as part of their investment strategy. Spartans’ focus on speed, real-time data, and instant withdrawals has earned it a reputation as one of the leading crypto casinos. With its variety of sports options and quick processing times, Spartans ensures that every bet feels like a calculated move rather than a gamble. The platform’s innovative approach to crypto sports betting has made it a favorite among users looking for a more advanced, efficient betting experience. Summing Up! Cardano (ADA) whale activity indicates that large holders are actively accumulating, signaling a potential price breakout as ADA approaches key resistance levels near $1.00. Meanwhile, the Celestia (TIA) outlook remains cautiously optimistic, with recent buybacks and the upcoming Lotus upgrade providing reasons for a more bullish long-term perspective. Traders and crypto holders alike are keeping a close watch on these developments as they seek their next profitable opportunity. For those looking for more than just price watching, Spartans offers an ideal solution. The platform not only allows users to place bets but also equips them with the tools to make informed, strategic decisions in real time. With its live stats, dynamic odds, and quick payouts, Spartans has emerged as one of the leading crypto casinos for those looking to combine sports betting with crypto strategy.

According to Sammie, Stellar has partnered with Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and Stripe’s stablecoin division within a single year. The post emphasizes the potential transactional volume such collaborations could bring to the Stellar network, referencing the possible scale of activity that could follow. Details of Sammie’s Statement In the post, Sammie said that the partnerships with these four payment industry leaders were all finalized within the same year. Sammie suggested that the cumulative effect of these collaborations could lead to an unprecedented amount of transaction volume being processed on the Stellar network . While the post did not specify the exact nature of each partnership, the mention of such globally recognized companies highlights the network’s growing integration into mainstream financial infrastructure. Sammie also included the ticker symbol for Stellar’s native asset, XLM, implying a possible correlation between increased network usage and potential interest in the asset. Stellar partnered with @Visa , @MasterCard , @PayPal , and @Stripe ( @Stablecoin ) all within a year. Imagine the insane amount of volume coming to the Stellar Network . $XLM pic.twitter.com/RmS8kotTLM — sammie (@lukinsisammie) August 8, 2025 XLM Community Reaction and Additional Insights Another X user, identified as DoubleAgent-XLM, replied to Sammie’s post with a more detailed perspective on the potential impact of these developments. The response noted that transaction velocity, which is the speed at which funds move across the network, would be a critical factor in scaling Stellar’s activity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to DoubleAgent-XLM, multiple use cases such as payroll systems, locked-up payments, and on-chain functionalities like Soroban smart contracts could be major drivers of network usage. They also referenced specific institutional integrations, such as DTCC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation) wallets and Salesforce wallets, as possible points of significant adoption. Potential Implications for the Stellar Network If the partnerships operate at scale, Stellar could see a sharp increase in the variety and volume of transactions. The involvement of companies like Visa and MasterCard , which process billions of transactions annually, suggests the possibility of Stellar becoming part of existing large-scale payment flows. PayPal’s and Stripe’s active roles in the digital payments and stablecoin sectors could further position Stellar within emerging financial technology ecosystems. The mention of Soroban, Stellar’s smart contract platform, indicates a potential expansion beyond payments into programmable financial services, adding another layer of network utility. Sammie’s post highlights a year of significant developments for the Stellar network , with partnerships involving some of the most influential players in global payments. The additional commentary from DoubleAgent-XLM adds context to how increased transaction velocity, institutional integrations, and broader utility could result in substantial network activity. While the full scale of these developments remains to be seen, the alignment of multiple high-profile collaborations in a short period signals an important phase in Stellar’s growth trajectory.

It’s about understanding how each project builds momentum and offers practical value. As competition intensifies in the presale space, only a few coins are offering tactical benefits that go beyond temporary hype. This article examines four notable projects, starting with BlockDAG, a presale that’s combining smart liquidity planning with long-term value. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Combining Market Strategy With Real-Time Utility BlockDAG ranks among the best crypto coins to buy because of its structured approach to building liquidity and engagement. Instead of pushing hype-based incentives, BlockDAG introduced a 10 BTC Auction as part of its final presale stage. This mechanism encourages volume-based participation, aligning buyer rewards with actual market depth, not giveaways. So far, BlockDAG has raised $368 million and sold over 24.8 billion coins. It’s currently priced at $0.0276 in batch 29, but a temporary rollback offers buyers access at just $0.0016, representing a 2,660% ROI opportunity compared to early batches. By merging a technical setup with real-world functionality and incentive-driven liquidity, BlockDAG offers more than a presale entry, it presents a calculated opportunity for those thinking ahead of the market. 2. SUBBD ($SUBBD): SocialFi Use Case With Influencer-Driven Adoption SUBBD enters the discussion as one of the best crypto coins to buy for those watching the SocialFi space. Built for content creators and communities, SUBBD makes it possible to monetize posts and interactions directly through blockchain, introducing rewards, tipping tools, and a native ad system into its protocol. What makes SUBBD notable is its early traction. Partnerships with niche creator communities and smaller influencers are already in place, and its staking model incentivizes both holding and platform activity. This dual reward structure ties token demand to real engagement, giving it measurable value even in early phases. For forward-looking buyers, SUBBD offers a clear application with room for network expansion. 3. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE): Merging Meme Trends With Tradable Structure Wall Street Pepe earns its place on the best crypto coins to buy list by blending cultural relevance with functional features. Built with strong visual branding that references both meme culture and financial themes, $WEPE extends its appeal to traders looking for assets that offer quick movement without sacrificing core structure. The token’s mechanics include deflationary controls and staking functions, tools that help sustain interest after initial listing. Early presale traction came from platforms like Reddit and X, and its post-launch performance has shown consistent liquidity on decentralized exchanges. For those seeking short-term flexibility with longer-term community interest, $WEPE offers a strategic balance between sentiment and usability. 4. Best Wallet Token ($BEST): Driving Token Utility Through On-Chain Cashback The Best Wallet Token, or $BEST, rounds out the list of best crypto coins to buy by focusing on practical utility. Unlike speculative coins, $BEST is integrated into a self-custody wallet that rewards users with cashback every time they complete a transaction, including swaps, bridges, or fiat conversions. As users increase their activity, they earn more $BEST, which fuels steady demand. Higher reward tiers unlock based on usage, mirroring traditional cashback systems but adapted for DeFi. With crypto wallets playing a more central role in user interaction and fund management, tokens like $BEST provide recurring value and long-term relevance, particularly for active users building sustainable portfolios. Strategic Selection Is Key for 2025 The best crypto coins to buy in 2025 are not defined by hype cycles alone. They are distinguished by smart mechanics, real use cases, and how they reward activity before and after launch. BlockDAG leads this list with its liquidity-driven auction and limited-time pricing window. Wall Street Pepe integrates community appeal with token structure. SUBBD supports content creators with tangible rewards, and $BEST reinforces utility with cashback tied to everyday crypto actions. In a market where timing, function, and foresight are more important than ever, these projects stand out not just for what they promise, but for what they already deliver.

A new report from KPMG and the Recruitment & Employment Confederation (REC) shows recruitment activity in July stayed close to its lowest point in two years. The permanent placements index crawled up to 40 from June’s 39.1, far from the 50 level that separates growth and contraction. Kate Shoesmith, REC’s deputy chief executive, said many employers, especially in low-wage sectors, were pausing recruitment because of cost pressures and uncertainty around employment law. She called for coordinated action between the government and the Bank of England (BoE) to help the job market recover. Hiring freeze looms as rising costs and weak demand stall UK job market A Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) survey found that only one in four employers plan to hire staff in the next three months. Just 16% expect to reduce headcount, and most of those cuts are likely to be cautious and measured. This is a slight diminishing of momentum, especially in the private sector. While a strong rebound in recruitment occurred late last year, there has been little movement since, and employers’ hiring intentions are hovering around COVID-19 pandemic lows. At the sharp end are the hospitality, retail, and social care sectors, where employers typically face low wage bills and temporarily employ workers coming to Britain in their hundreds of thousands Rising employment costs are a major factor. The April increase in employers’ national insurance contributions has hit labour-intensive businesses the hardest, adding to tight margins. For small businesses, these additional costs have left little room to take on new staff, forcing some to freeze recruitment or consider redundancies. Much of the pressure to conform is also driven by policy changes. Tax hikes have already squeezed labour budgets this year, according to a separate report by accountancy and business advisory firm BDO, which found that increases in the national minimum wage had been accompanied by real-time information confirming that millions of employees were now in work. Scores of other employers are now preparing for a fresh squeeze on their finances ahead of the government’s Autumn Statement, where extra fiscal measures are anticipated. The picture thus far: rising costs, weaker demand, and continued uncertainty have made for a tough environment for hiring managers. And economists warn that without targeted support or incentives, many businesses will postpone hiring plans well into 2025, which could drag down the broader economic recovery. Economists question jobs data as UK labour market sends mixed signals While surveys point to a cooling jobs market, the official data tells a mixed story. Payroll figures from HMRC show the number of employees has fallen slightly over the past year, though revisions have softened the decline. Meanwhile, the ONS data indicate that employment and unemployment are both on the rise, while economic inactivity is on a downward trend. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer recently used the latest statistics to show that the economy is bringing more people back to work under the government’s “back to work” scheme. However, several economists suggest that the ONS could be getting their counting wrong, and there was no sign of a substantial lift-off in employment. Last week, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey indicated that the demand for labour declined, but suggested it is an impossibly uncertain time given the terrible data.

U.S. officials said the revenue-sharing agreement was a condition for obtaining export licences to sell the chips in China. These licences were granted last week after months of delay. Nvidia did not deny the deal’s existence, stating it “follows rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.” AMD declined to comment. Financial analysts estimate the arrangement could funnel billions into U.S. coffers. Bernstein Research projects Nvidia could sell around 1.5 million H20 units in China in 2025, generating about $23 billion in revenue. Under the 15% deal, more than $3 billion from those sales would go directly to the U.S. government. Officials have not yet said how they plan to use the funds. Export-control specialists say the move is unprecedented. No U.S. company has previously agreed to hand over a share of its revenue as a condition for export approval. They compare it to earlier Trump administration tactics, in which companies were encouraged to make domestic investments or concessions to avoid tariffs. Officials approve licences after high-level talks The road to the agreement was complex. In April, the Trump administration said it would block H20 exports to China, citing concerns about AI technology transfer. The chip had already been designed to fit within Biden-era export limits on high-end AI processors. In June, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met President Donald Trump at the White House. Within days, the administration reversed its decision to block the H20. Even then, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), which enforces export controls, withheld licences for weeks. These were issued only last week — after the 15% revenue deal was finalised. AMD’s MI308 chip received approval under the same terms. Industry sources say the deal reflects Trump’s preference for transactional outcomes, blending trade, security, and economic policy. Security concerns clash with corporate strategy The arrangement has sparked sharp criticism from national security experts, and in a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, former deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger and 19 other officials urged the government not to issue H20 licences. They warned that the chip is a “potent accelerator” for China’s AI development and could ultimately aid its military. Some BIS officials reportedly shared these concerns, fearing the decision could weaken U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence. Nvidia rejected these claims, calling them “misguided” and insisting the H20 is unsuitable for military use. The company has argued that engaging in the Chinese market is crucial to maintaining U.S. technological competitiveness , warning against a repeat of the U.S. loss in the 5G race. The deal also came as Washington and Beijing held delicate trade talks. China is pressing the U.S. to relax export controls on high-bandwidth memory chips, a key component for advanced AI processors. Trump hopes these negotiations will pave the way for a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year. The revenue-sharing agreement now sits at the intersection of geopolitics, security, and corporate strategy. While it grants U.S. companies access to a lucrative market, it also opens a new chapter in how Washington uses export policy to restrict technology and generate revenue from it.
