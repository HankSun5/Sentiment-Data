During his tenure, Hines oversaw key policy initiatives, including the administration’s push for dedicated crypto regulations and the passage of the GENIUS Act, which established a framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins. Bo Hines Steps Aside The former college football player was appointed by President Donald Trump in December 2024 to lead the newly formed White House Crypto Council. The appointment followed Trump’s early-term executive order to establish the council as part of a broader plan to overhaul US digital asset policy. He also helped direct the release of a comprehensive digital asset regulatory roadmap and worked on implementing Trump’s executive order creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve. The reserve’s growth has been limited by rules requiring “budget-neutral” acquisition methods – meaning the government can only add BTC through asset seizures or other cost-free channels. In March, Hines suggested revaluing US gold holdings to free funds for Bitcoin purchases without adding to the federal budget. He also met with more than 150 industry representatives in his first three months. Patrick Witt to Replace Hines As for now, he will continue as a special government employee to assist with AI initiatives alongside AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks. Confirming the development, Hines tweeted , “Serving in President Trump’s administration and working alongside our brilliant AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks as Executive Director of the White House Crypto Council has been the honor of a lifetime. Together, we have positioned America as the crypto capital of the world. I’m deeply grateful to the industry for its unwavering support – I love this community and all we’ve built together.” Hines’ deputy, Patrick Witt, is expected to replace him. Witt happens to be a former Yale quarterback and Pentagon official and has experience in defense-related technology investment, but no direct background in the crypto sector. His political career includes a congressional run in Georgia and service as acting director of the Office of Strategic Capital.

At the forefront is Cold Wallet, now in presale below $0.01, already listed on CoinMarketCap, and offering real cashback rewards to users. Some analysts are hinting at a possible 100x rise, and early participants are watching closely. Yet Cold Wallet is not the only one drawing interest. ADA, POL, and ARB are also becoming strong talking points. For those following the top crypto gainers, these names are taking center stage. 1. Cold Wallet (CWT): Sub-$0.01 Presale, CMC Listed, and Building Buzz Cold Wallet is quickly getting noticed. With a presale price of $0.00998 in stage 17 out of 150, it stands out as one of the few early-stage projects already listed on CoinMarketCap. This visibility is helping it gain traction across crypto channels. What fuels further attention is the project’s structure, which some believe could lead to a 100x gain after launch. The wallet rewards users for their activity. Every gas fee, swap, or on/off-ramp transaction gives a portion back in $CWT, its native asset. The more it is used and the more CWT is held, the higher the cashback tier becomes. There is no staking and no lockup, just a consistent use-and-earn cycle. A recent $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, which brought in over 2 million users within seven months, adds to its growth story by instantly expanding its network reach. With $5.8 million already raised in presale and a launch price fixed at $0.3517, Cold Wallet is positioning itself among the top crypto gainers, especially while it remains priced under $0.01. 2. Cardano (ADA): Building Steady Growth Through Developer Focus Cardano continues to rank high in developer activity, a key metric for those who look at long-term strength. As more smart contracts and dApps go live on the network, its advantage comes from consistent technical delivery and research-based upgrades. While ADA is not new to the market, its careful and steady progress has led to a rising TVL and an expanding DeFi presence. Recent discussions on YouTube and Twitter connect Cardano’s upcoming update cycle with fresh interest from institutional players who value scalability and reliability over hype. Even with earlier concerns about speed, ADA still sees steady accumulation from buyers. Analysts now view it as one of the top crypto gainers, not for sudden short-term jumps, but for patient holders aiming for growth backed by the ecosystem. 3. Polygon (POL): Rebrand Signals New Phase of Expansion Polygon’s move from MATIC to POL is more than just a name change. It marks a bigger plan to bring together its growing zk-based scaling options. As the project shifts toward a modular multi-chain design, its role as Ethereum’s scaling layer is finding more attention in both DeFi and gaming sectors. Crypto Twitter influencers have noted POL’s developer-friendly tools, increasing gas use, and rising network revenue, all signs of a system moving into maturity. Its partnerships with major brands and new integrations in L2 infrastructure have landed POL on many lists of top crypto gainers to watch. With the rebrand still in its early stages and prices holding steady, POL’s position among the top crypto gainers could strengthen if its toolset adoption continues. While it is no longer at the earliest stage, it is still early in this rebrand, leaving room for further growth. 4. Arbitrum (ARB): Strong Layer 2 Activity and Growing Developer Base Arbitrum is one of Ethereum’s busiest Layer 2 solutions, often leading in both daily transactions and total value locked. Its appeal now also comes from a rise in DAO activity, funding programs, and governance votes linked to long-term incentives for the network. Although ARB’s price has been volatile, developer and builder interest stays high. It often trends in research updates and discussions on Ethereum scaling and liquidity bridging. Analysts watching large-scale bridging flows are starting to point to Arbitrum as a center for new projects, especially after the Dencun update. With ongoing support for grants and a governance plan that shapes the network’s direction, ARB has earned a place among the top crypto gainers in ecosystem growth. Its value is not only in speed but in who builds on it and how active the network remains. Closing View The biggest gains ahead might not come from sudden hype but from projects that keep adding value and adoption. Cold Wallet is making its mark with a cashback-based system, presale pricing under $0.01, and a CoinMarketCap listing before launch. At the same time, established names like ADA, POL, and ARB continue to show strength through developer engagement, adoption, and infrastructure upgrades. As more analysts and insiders highlight these projects, the chance for early positioning grows smaller. For those tracking the top crypto gainers , these four deserve close watch before their next major move.

ATOM’s recent climb has held firmly above key support, while Tron’s performance reflects growing on-chain engagement and heightened participation from larger holders. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) Network’s $0.0016 offer, available despite batch 29 being priced at $0.0276, gives late-stage buyers a chance to secure returns comparable to early participants without the risk of early presale entry. With over $368 million raised and 24.9 billion coins sold, it stands apart as one of the few decentralized projects offering this kind of value so deep into a presale. Final $0.0016 Window Delivers Early-Stage ROI Advantage BlockDAG’s special pricing at $0.0016 offers latecomers an opportunity to lock in near-origin level returns. While the presale’s live batch price sits at $0.0276, this discount equals roughly 94% off the current rate, creating one of the most favorable entries across any large-scale presale. Early buyers at $0.001 have already seen 2,660% growth in their holdings since batch 1, and this window gives newcomers similar potential without waiting for post-launch dips. This calculated pricing strategy strengthens BlockDAG’s position among top decentralized networks by avoiding exclusion at higher tiers and instead encouraging broader participation. It also boosts market confidence while expanding community size, setting the stage for robust liquidity after launch. For those focused on cost efficiency and precise timing, this moment is critical. Once the presale advances, this low entry will close, leaving no comparable pricing in sight. The combination of immediate value and significant upside potential makes BlockDAG’s $0.0016 entry one of the most strategic presale moves currently available. Cosmos ATOM Price Recovery Shows Renewed Strength The recent rebound in ATOM price has gained attention, with the asset bouncing from $4.18 to $4.30, marking a solid 3% lift from strong support levels. This move established a fresh range between $4.27 and $4.29, supported by sustained buying activity from larger market players. Additionally, ATOM’s climb from $4.13 to $4.24 came alongside trading volumes exceeding one million units, driven partly by news of a Cosmos-linked project being added to the Coinbase listing roadmap. These factors point toward improving sentiment and rising demand. If recent lows continue to serve as a firm base, the potential for further price gains remains open. Strong volume, a supportive technical setup, and renewed market interest position ATOM for possible upside extensions in the near term. Tron TRX Price Performance Signals Accumulation Tron’s price action has shown resilience despite being pushed back from the $0.334 resistance level. Support holds near the 20-day simple moving average at about $0.30, suggesting a stable foundation. On-chain data reinforces this outlook, with over 1.1 billion TRX burned in August, reducing circulating supply. Large holder activity has also surged, with whale transactions increasing more than 1,200%, signaling accumulation. Even with some profit-taking, trading volume climbed 26% to $931 million, underlining ongoing interest. Should TRX reclaim $0.334, resistance targets at $0.355 and potentially $0.38 become realistic. This combination of network activity, reduced supply, and consistent demand provides a case for strategic entry before a possible breakout, giving TRX an attractive setup for value-focused participants. Final Take While ATOM and TRX both present technical conditions that could lead to short-term price advances, their performance depends heavily on favorable market momentum. BlockDAG, on the other hand, offers a defined pricing advantage that does not require speculation on broader trends. The $0.0016 offer, set against a live batch price of $0.0276, creates a rare late-stage chance to capture early-stage ROI. With over $368 million raised and strong participation, BlockDAG gives those entering now a pricing advantage not typically available this far into a presale. For those seeking strategic entry and long-term growth potential, BlockDAG’s limited offer is a standout choice among leading decentralized projects today.

I Told You This Was Coming,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-they-want-your-xrp-i-told-you-this-was-coming/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld has issued a direct warning to cryptocurrency holders, particularly those invested in XRP, claiming that institutions are seeking to acquire retail investors’ holdings at undervalued prices. In a recent video shared alongside his tweet, Rietveld stated that the goal is not to acquire small amounts of XRP but to encourage holders to sell their entire positions. He linked this to tactics involving market manipulation, especially through the use of tariffs, which he says can trigger panic selling. Rietveld pointed to past instances where tariff-related news significantly impacted XRP’s price, noting that it has previously lost almost half its value overnight due to such developments. He referenced recent geopolitical tensions, citing President Donald Trump’s move to double tariffs on India over its purchase of Russian oil. India’s response, according to Rietveld, included deepening ties with Russia and exploring new trade agreements with Brazil and other nations rather than conceding to U.S. tariff pressure. He suggested that this could escalate further, potentially resulting in tariffs as high as 100%, which he believes may temporarily depress cryptocurrency prices before a recovery. THEY WANT YOUR XRP! I TOLD YOU THIS WAS COMING!!! #XRP pic.twitter.com/FfcBOyLkn4 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 8, 2025 Institutional Accumulation in the Current Bull Run Beyond tariff concerns, Rietveld emphasized the scale of institutional cryptocurrency accumulation in the current bull market compared to the 2020–2021 cycle. He cited examples from the previous cycle, such as MicroStrategy’s acquisition of over 70,000 Bitcoin by April 2021, Tesla’s $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase, and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust peaking at $40 billion in assets. He contrasted this with current trends, stating that institutional demand has grown significantly due to the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which by July 2025 had seen net inflows of over $50 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF reportedly recorded $370.2 million in inflows in a single day, while Ethereum ETFs saw $850 million in inflows within one week. Corporate and national holdings have also expanded, with MicroStrategy now holding over 226,000 Bitcoin and nations like Bhutan and El Salvador accumulating significant reserves. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP ETF Prospects and Market Impact Rietveld predicted that XRP will be a key focus of institutional accumulation moving forward, highlighting the launch of the ProShares Ultra XRP Futures ETF in July, which coincided with a surge to an all-time high of $3.66. Proposed spot XRP ETFs from Canary Capital, Grayscale, 21Shares, and WisdomTree reportedly have a 93% likelihood of approval, which he believes could lead to billions in inflows similar to what has been observed with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. He claimed that the accumulation of XRP in the 2024–2025 cycle has already increased by three to five times compared to the last bull run, and that the approval of spot ETFs could further accelerate this growth. In his view, selling XRP before such developments would be a significant mistake for holders, as institutions would benefit from acquiring assets at a discount before the anticipated price appreciation. Digital Assets as a Tariff-Resistant Store of Value Rietveld also referenced comments from Michael Saylor comparing Bitcoin to gold in the context of tariffs. Saylor argued that digital assets, such as Bitcoin, are immune to tariffs, unlike physical commodities, including gold. Rietveld agreed, stating that tariffs on gold could drive capital toward cryptocurrencies, which can be traded globally without additional tax burdens. He argued that this quality, combined with upcoming catalysts such as ETF approvals and potential interest rate cuts in the U.S., makes XRP particularly well-positioned for future growth. He concluded by reiterating that institutions are motivated by profit and will seek to buy assets during periods of fear and market downturns. According to Rietveld, retail investors selling XRP in such conditions are allowing these institutions to acquire the asset at discounted prices before significant market catalysts unfold.

The LayerZero Foundation (ZRO) has recently unveiled a groundbreaking proposal: the LayerZero Stargate acquisition . This potential merger aims to integrate Stargate (STG), a leading omnichain-native asset bridge, into the LayerZero ecosystem. This move could reshape how digital assets flow across various blockchains, making it a pivotal moment for interoperability and the broader DeFi landscape. What’s the LayerZero Stargate Acquisition All About? In a recent announcement made on X, the LayerZero Foundation laid out its ambitious plan. The core of this proposal involves a direct swap of Stargate (STG) tokens for LayerZero (ZRO) tokens. This isn’t just a simple buy-out; it’s a strategic integration designed to enhance the capabilities of both projects and solidify LayerZero’s position in the cross-chain space. The proposed exchange rate is set at 1 STG for 0.08634 ZRO. This rate applies to all circulating STG, whether it’s staked, actively voting, or held in wallets. Furthermore, the proposal includes an interesting mechanism for future revenue. Any additional income generated by Stargate post-acquisition would be channeled back into buying ZRO tokens. This process aims to reduce the overall supply of ZRO, potentially increasing its value over time. Understanding the Stargate (STG) Proposal Details The specifics of the Stargate (STG) proposal are now open for public review.

It is steadily increasing in user engagement, as evidenced by certain metrics. Shiny New Wallet In a press release shared with CryptoPotato, Flare announced the launch of its seedless, non‑custodial wallet Luminite. Turnkey’s embedded wallet technology was used to create Luminite, which allows users to set up their wallet using familiar sign-in methods such as passkeys, biometrics, or email, without needing to write down and store a seed phrase. Funds can be added via built-in fiat on‑ramp partners (including Topper) to purchase FLR, XRP, and other assets. “Luminite was built with one goal in mind: to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 users. By removing complex barriers to entry, we’re enabling anyone—from first-time users to seasoned crypto holders—to access the full power of the Flare ecosystem.This is about making DeFi approachable, not just for the crypto-native, but for the next wave of users discovering blockchain through real utility,” said Steve Chadwick, Co-founder of Luminite. Apart from onboarding, Luminite will also be a direct access point to Flare’s growing portfolio of DeFi protocols. Patrons will be able to delegate the native token, FLR, to FTSO (Flare Time Series Oracle) data providers. Additionally, it will be possible to mint FXRP tokens (tokenized version of XRP) via FAssets (non-smart contract assets bridged with full custody retained). Moreover, it will be possible to swap tokens within the wallet, bridge assets through the liquidity transport protocol Stargate, and engage in liquid staking by minting sFLR on Sceptre, the protocol for staking, all within the wallet Luminite interface. Flare has also unveiled plans for a future Learn & Earn program with Revolut, which will incentivize new users to explore the ecosystem through education and rewards based on engagement. FLR So Far The blockchain recently celebrated 3 years since its launch on June 25, 2022. Full operation started around 2-3 weeks following, in “observation mode”, where the Flare Foundation ran all validators. This phase lasted approximately 8 weeks, after which a token generation event (TGE) took place, during which 15% of the total FLR supply (~12 billion tokens) was released to the public via the Flare Improvement Proposal process. The native token has been up for the majority of the year, marking considerable gains during July, and the blockchain itself has locked in over $150 million in DeFi volume, according to data taken at the time of printing from DefiLlama.

Leadership changes within such influential advisory bodies often precede shifts in strategic focus or policy priorities. For investors, innovators, and policymakers alike, understanding these transitions is key. The ongoing dialogue about crypto regulation remains a top concern. As the political landscape evolves, so too will the approaches to governing cryptocurrencies. The work of the Trump crypto council , regardless of who leads it, plays a significant role in shaping the narrative and potential legislative actions should Trump return to office. This ongoing evolution underscores the dynamic nature of US crypto policy . Furthermore, the move by Bo Hines to the private sector might also highlight the increasing demand for crypto expertise outside of government. It suggests a growing recognition of digital assets as a legitimate and expanding economic sector, drawing talent from various fields. In conclusion, the transition of leadership within the Trump crypto council is more than just a personnel change. It represents an evolving approach to digital assets and crypto regulation within a potential future administration.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant institutional interest, many wonder about the next big step. A spot XRP ETF is a hot topic, particularly regarding financial giants like BlackRock. Despite the fervent hope from the XRP community, BlackRock maintains a remarkably cautious stance. Why is one of the world’s largest asset managers not rushing into a spot XRP ETF application? Limited Client Demand for XRP Investment? One primary reason BlackRock remains reserved is the current landscape of client demand. BlackRock operates on a data-driven approach, and their internal metrics reveal a clear preference. Bitcoin and Ethereum Dominance: Institutional clients primarily express demand for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) products. These cryptocurrencies hold established market positions and clearer regulatory paths in some jurisdictions. Niche Interest: While some clients inquire about other digital assets, the broad, consistent demand seen for BTC and ETH is not yet present for XRP. This makes a significant XRP investment product less of an immediate priority for the firm. Without robust client interest, the immediate business case for a new, complex product like a BlackRock XRP ETF becomes less compelling. Navigating Regulatory Hurdles for a Cryptocurrency ETF Regulatory uncertainty presents a significant challenge for any new cryptocurrency ETF . XRP’s situation is particularly complex. Ongoing legal battles surrounding XRP’s classification create an unpredictable environment that large institutions typically avoid. Legal Clarity Needed: BlackRock prefers clear and unambiguous regulatory frameworks before launching new products. The uncertainty around XRP’s status as a security or a commodity directly impacts the feasibility and risk profile of an ETF. Precedent Matters: The firm likely observes how existing regulatory decisions and potential future rulings could affect the broader digital asset market. They aim to ensure any new offering meets stringent compliance standards. Until definitive regulatory clarity emerges, the path for a spot XRP ETF remains fraught with potential legal and compliance risks BlackRock is keen to avoid. Is the Market Already Crowded for New Digital Asset Products? The race for crypto ETFs is intensifying, and the market for digital asset products is becoming increasingly competitive. BlackRock might perceive the current environment as already saturated with applications, making a rushed entry less strategic. Numerous Applications: At least seven other firms have already filed applications for a spot XRP ETF. This indicates a crowded field. Observing Competition: BlackRock may prefer to wait and observe how these initial applications fare with regulators and how the market responds. This allows them to learn from others’ experiences without incurring the initial risks. Entering a crowded market demands a unique selling proposition or a clear advantage, which may not be apparent for an XRP ETF at this juncture. The Data-Driven Disconnect: XRP’s Market Share and Operational Costs While the XRP community expresses immense enthusiasm, BlackRock’s decisions are rooted in hard data and financial viability. There appears to be a disconnect between community hype and the firm’s analytical approach. Smaller Market Share: Compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP holds a significantly smaller market share. This translates to less liquidity and potentially higher volatility, complicating ETF management. Higher Operational Costs: Managing an ETF for a less liquid or more volatile asset can incur higher operational costs, including custody, trading, and compliance. These costs might not be justified by potential revenue given XRP’s current market position. BlackRock’s rigorous due diligence ensures any new product is viable and aligns with their long-term financial objectives, which a spot XRP ETF may not currently meet. BlackRock’s Global Strategy and Regional XRP Demand BlackRock operates on a global scale, and its product launches often align with its broader international strategy. This perspective reveals another factor influencing their cautious approach to an XRP investment product. Weaker Demand in Key Regions: While XRP sees considerable trading volume in Asia, BlackRock’s primary focus for new product launches might be in regions where XRP demand is comparatively weaker or where regulatory clarity is still evolving. Strategic Alignment: The firm prioritizes products that can achieve widespread adoption across its core markets. If XRP’s institutional demand is concentrated in specific, non-priority regions, it lessens the immediate incentive for a global firm like BlackRock to launch a dedicated ETF. Ultimately, BlackRock’s strategic priorities play a crucial role in determining which digital asset products they pursue and when. Concluding Thoughts: A Measured Approach to XRP BlackRock’s measured approach to a spot XRP ETF is not a rejection of XRP itself, but rather a reflection of its meticulous, data-driven strategy. The firm prioritizes client demand, regulatory clarity, market conditions, and operational efficiency before diving into new investment vehicles. While the XRP community eagerly awaits, BlackRock continues to assess the landscape, ensuring any future moves are strategically sound and beneficial for its vast client base. This cautious stance underscores the complexities of launching new cryptocurrency products in an evolving financial ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a spot XRP ETF? A spot XRP ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds XRP, allowing investors to gain exposure to XRP’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself. Q2: Why is BlackRock being cautious about a spot XRP ETF? BlackRock’s caution stems from several factors, including limited institutional client demand beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP, a crowded market with many existing applications, and considerations regarding XRP’s market share and operational costs. Q3: How does regulatory uncertainty affect a BlackRock XRP ETF? Regulatory uncertainty, particularly the unresolved legal status of XRP in the US, creates significant risks for financial institutions. BlackRock prefers clear regulatory frameworks to ensure compliance and minimize legal liabilities for any new cryptocurrency ETF . Q4: Does BlackRock’s caution mean they will never launch an XRP ETF? Not necessarily. BlackRock’s approach is strategic and data-driven. If client demand increases, regulatory clarity emerges, and market conditions become more favorable, BlackRock could reconsider a spot XRP ETF in the future. Their current stance is about timing and risk management. Q5: What are ‘digital asset products’ in this context? In this context, ‘digital asset products’ refer to various investment vehicles that provide exposure to cryptocurrencies, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), trusts, or other structured products designed for institutional and retail investors.

Expert Says Next Week Will Shock the World,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-ready-for-a-huge-breakout-expert-says-next-week-will-shock-the-world/,"Crypto commentator Bark has stated that $XRP is positioned for a significant upward move, setting a price target of $15. In a post on X, Bark wrote, “XRP is ready for a huge breakout. Target is $15. Next week will SHOCK the world.” The projection was shared alongside a detailed chart analysis indicating the technical basis for this forecast. Technical Analysis Presented in the Chart Bark’s attached chart shows a clear bullish continuation pattern, identified as a flag formation. The structure consists of a steep rise, labeled the “Flag Pole,” followed by a period of consolidation within parallel trendlines, labeled the “Flag Formation.” The chart indicates a breakout from this consolidation phase, with a “Flag Breakout Target” positioned at approximately $15.35562. At the time of the analysis, $XRP is shown trading around $2.95905, with a highlighted support base between $2.42493 and $2.67066. Fibonacci retracement levels of 0.382 and 0.5 are overlaid in this zone, suggesting potential areas where price could stabilize before continuing higher. The chart projects a strong upward trajectory from current levels toward the $15 target, implying a multi-fold price increase if achieved. $XRP is ready for a huge breakout. Target is $15. Next week will SHOCK the world. pic.twitter.com/BqFIXQ8hBL — Bark (@barkmeta) August 9, 2025 Legal Resolution Between Ripple and the SEC The bullish outlook is being shared in the context of a major legal resolution. Both Ripple and the SEC have withdrawn their respective appeals in the long-running lawsuit, formally bringing the case to a close. This follows years of litigation that began in December 2020, when the SEC filed its initial complaint. The withdrawal of appeals means that prior rulings, including the determination that XRP sales on public exchanges do not constitute securities transactions, remain in place. Market participants have interpreted this conclusion as removing a significant regulatory uncertainty that has weighed on the asset since the start of the legal proceedings. Market Implications The XRP community is closely watching Bark’s projection and the legal conclusion. The charted target of $15 represents a substantial potential upside from current levels, and some traders see the resolution of the SEC case as a catalyst for increased institutional and retail interest. While Bark’s analysis focuses on the technical setup and provides a clear price target, market conditions can shift rapidly, and achieving such levels would depend on continued bullish momentum and broader market support. Nonetheless, the combination of a completed bullish chart pattern and the removal of a major legal overhang has reinforced optimism among certain XRP supporters.

At the same time, one project is drawing even more focus. BlockDAG (BDAG) has already raised $368 million in its presale and is projecting a potential 3,025% ROI before launch. Stellar (XLM) Breakout Signals a Shift in Trend Stellar (XLM) is showing renewed strength after an extended period of decline.

Speaking in Washington on August 7, Bessent described the qualities he believes the position demands. “It’s someone who has to have the confidence of the markets, the ability to analyze complex economic data,” he told the Japan’s Nikkei . He added that the next chair should be focused on future trends rather than relying too heavily on historical patterns. According to Reuters , Bessent is leading efforts to choose a successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May. The candidate list now includes an experienced economic adviser and a onetime head of a regional Federal Reserve Bank. When asked about President Donald Trump’s repeated public calls for lower interest rates, Bessent said the president makes his position known, but stressed that “at the end of the day, the Fed is independent.” Bessent outlines broader meaning of “strong dollar” policy Regarding currency strategy, Bessent explained that his administration’s concept of a “strong dollar” isn’t linked to a specific number shown on markets, but to the dollar’s comparative position against other currencies. “The strong dollar policy is to have policies that continue to keep the U.S. dollar the reserve currency,” he said. “And if we have good economic policies, then the dollar will naturally be strong.” Bessent has previously held talks on exchange rates with Japan’s Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato. In May, during a G7 meeting, they concluded the dollar-yen exchange rate at that moment aligned with underlying fundamentals. In June, the Treasury Department informed Congress that the Bank of Japan should maintain its course of policy tightening, which it argued would help “normalize” the yen’s weakness. Bessent said he believes that as long as the BOJ focuses on fundamentals such as inflation and growth, exchange rates will adjust on their own. He said Governor Kazuo Ueda and the BOJ board are aiming for an inflation target rather than a currency level. The BOJ last year wrapped up a decade of large-scale stimulus and raised short-term interest rates to 0.5% in January, concluding that Japan was close to sustainably reaching its 2% inflation goal. Since then, policymakers have been cautious about further hikes. Analysts point to this gradual pace as one factor behind the yen’s weak performance against major currencies. While inflation has stayed above the 2% target for more than three years, Ueda has urged careful review of how U.S. tariffs might affect Japan’s fragile economy. List of potential Powell successors grows There are now about 10 possible replacements for Powell. Among them are former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, now dean of Purdue University’s business school, and Marc Sumerlin, who served as an economic adviser to President George W. Bush. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and current Fed Governor Christopher Waller are also being considered. Trump has made clear he wants a chair willing to cut rates. Hassett, Warsh, and Waller have all indicated openness to lowering borrowing costs. Bullard said in May he believed the Fed could reduce rates by September. Sumerlin’s recent stances on monetary policy are not publicly known. The president moved quickly to fill another Fed Board position this week after Governor Adriana Kugler resigned. Stephen Miran from the Council of Economic Advisers will finish her term, which ends January 31. Trump is also continuing his search for a nominee to fill the upcoming 14-year term starting February 1. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Alena Vranova, founder of hardware wallet maker SatoshiLabs, sounded the alarm at the Baltic Honeybadger 2025 conference in Riga, Latvia. She told the audience that these crimes—known as “wrench attacks”—involve kidnappings, physical assaults, and extortion, all aimed at forcing victims to hand over their private keys. Vranova said that every week , at least one Bitcoiner somewhere in the world is kidnapped, tortured, extorted, or subjected to even worse crimes. She added that, contrary to the common belief that such attacks only target wealthy “Bitcoin OGs,” cases have been recorded involving kidnappings over as little as $6,000 worth of cryptocurrency and murders for $50,000 in crypto. Industry data shows 2025 could be the most dangerous year yet. Chainalysis reports that the number of wrench attacks so far has nearly matched the worst year on record, and could double by year’s end if the trend continues. Data leaks supercharge criminal targeting One of the biggest drivers of the spike in violent attacks against crypto holders is the massive wave of personal data breaches from centralized services. Alena Vranova, founder of SatoshiLabs, told the Baltic Honeybadger 2025 audience that the scale of the problem is staggering: more than 80 million crypto user identities are currently exposed online, with 2.2 million of them revealing home addresses. Most of these leaks stem from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet service providers bound by the Know Your Customer (KYC) legislation. Although adopted to prevent money laundering and other financial crimes, these rules oblige the platforms to store sensitive information such as name, telephone number, official identification, and residence address. This, in turn, is a “shopping list” for criminals who may wish to either steal or distribute the data once stolen. The consequences are not purely academic. U.S. exchange Coinbase confirmed in May 2025 that a hack had occurred involving some customers’ names and personal informatio n, including addresses. A month later, cybersecurity publication Cybernews discovered various databases exposing over 16 billion stolen credentials from large tech companies such as Apple, Facebook, and Google. The records contain passwords, geo locations, and personal information like the names of people who share email accounts that can be used to identify cryptocurrency investors. Stolen personal information is now being combined with blockchain analysis tools so criminals can identify anyone with a lot of Bitcoin or other digital currencies. Once these victims are identified, targeted phishing schemes or SIM-swapping attacks can be carried out, or in the worst-case scenario, physical violence is used to pressure victims into providing their private keys. As the bull market attracts newer and often less operationally secure investors, it also leads to action by criminal organizations who view this heightened attention as a means to increase their bottom lines through theft or extortion, she said. The growing concern is that should the cycle we have seen above repeat in unison with stronger data protection and better privacy practices, the leaking of KYC databases combined with increasing crypto valuations will hypercharge an environment where Bitcoiners are under threat worldwide. Crypto holders step up security amid rising attacks The cryptocurrency community is responding to the spike in violence with a new focus on physical and operational security. High-profile Bitcoiners hire private security, reinforce home protections, and use privacy tools to obscure their holdings. In some cases, even everyday retail investors are beginning to take precautions. Industry safety advocates recommend reducing one’s public crypto profile, using non-custodial wallets, splitting holdings across multiple secure locations, and avoiding public discussion of investment size or strategy. Experts also stress the importance of “opsec” (operational security) hygiene: using unique passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, regularly checking if personal information has been exposed in data breaches, and staying alert for unusual contact attempts. If the current trend holds, 2025 will surpass but potentially double the previous record for violent physical attacks against crypto holders—a sobering milestone for a technology once hailed as “digital gold.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This incident casts a significant shadow over the digital asset space, raising critical questions about legal boundaries and the risks faced by those building the decentralized future. “Fede’s Intern,” a known Ethereum developer, was recently detained in Izmir, Turkey, facing allegations of aiding others in misusing the Ethereum network. While specific details remain scarce, this development sends a clear message about the increasing scrutiny on blockchain activities globally. What Led to the Ethereum Developer Detention in Turkey? According to reports from BeInCrypto, Turkish authorities apprehended the developer, accusing them of enabling illicit activities on the Ethereum network. The developer himself confirmed the allegations in a post on X, indicating that the authorities believe he facilitated misuse. This situation underscores the complex legal landscape surrounding blockchain technology, where the lines between facilitating innovation and enabling misuse can become blurred. Allegations: Helping others misuse the Ethereum network. Location: Izmir, Turkey. Source: BeInCrypto, developer’s X post. Echoes of Past Crypto Legal Issues: A Troubling Trend? This incident eerily mirrors the case of Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan, who was detained in Nigeria for nearly eight months on money laundering charges. Both cases highlight a growing trend where individuals associated with prominent blockchain platforms face severe legal challenges in various jurisdictions. The detention of an Ethereum developer like “Fede’s Intern” suggests that regulatory bodies are intensifying their efforts to control and investigate digital asset activities, regardless of the individual’s direct involvement in illicit transactions. The parallels are striking: High-profile individuals in the crypto space. Detention by national authorities. Allegations related to financial misconduct or network misuse. Unclear or evolving legal frameworks. These events contribute to a climate of uncertainty, particularly concerning crypto legal issues Turkey and other nations are grappling with as they navigate the complexities of blockchain technology. Navigating the Challenges of Ethereum Network Misuse The core accusation against the developer revolves around Ethereum network misuse . This term can encompass a wide range of activities, from facilitating scams and illicit financing to enabling unauthorized transactions. Developers, while building open-source protocols, often find themselves in a precarious position. They create tools that can be used for good, but also for nefarious purposes by bad actors. The challenge lies in defining the extent of a developer’s responsibility for how their creations are ultimately used by others. As the Ethereum network continues to grow and decentralize, the responsibility for monitoring and preventing misuse becomes increasingly distributed and complex. This incident could prompt deeper discussions within the Ethereum community about: Enhanced security measures for users. Better educational resources on responsible network use. Collaborative efforts with law enforcement, where appropriate. What Does This Mean for Global Blockchain Regulation? The detention of an Ethereum developer in Turkey underscores the urgent need for clearer, more harmonized blockchain regulation worldwide. Currently, many countries are still developing their legal frameworks for digital assets, leading to a patchwork of rules that can create significant compliance challenges for individuals and companies operating across borders. This lack of clarity can inadvertently expose even well-intentioned participants to legal risks. For the broader crypto ecosystem, such incidents could: Deter developers from contributing to open-source projects. Increase legal and operational costs for crypto businesses. Push innovation into less regulated, potentially riskier, jurisdictions. It highlights the critical importance of robust legal counsel and proactive engagement with regulatory bodies to understand and comply with evolving laws regarding digital assets. Digital Asset Legal Challenges: A Call for Clarity The “Fede’s Intern” case is a stark reminder of the significant digital asset legal challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry. As blockchain technology becomes more integrated into global finance and daily life, governments are keen to assert control and prevent its exploitation for illegal activities. However, the methods and scope of this control are still being defined, often resulting in ambiguous interpretations and potentially harsh consequences for individuals. It is imperative for the crypto community, policymakers, and legal experts to collaborate on developing sensible and clear regulations that: Protect users from fraud and illicit activities. Foster innovation and technological advancement. Provide legal certainty for developers and businesses. Without such clarity, incidents like the Ethereum developer detention will likely become more frequent, creating a chilling effect on an industry striving for decentralization and transparency. Conclusion: Navigating a Shifting Landscape The detention of the Ethereum developer in Turkey serves as a potent reminder of the escalating legal and regulatory pressures within the global cryptocurrency space. While the specifics of “Fede’s Intern’s” case remain to be fully disclosed, it undeniably highlights the increasing risks for individuals operating in the decentralized ecosystem. As governments worldwide grapple with defining the boundaries of digital assets, proactive engagement, robust legal understanding, and a commitment to responsible innovation become paramount. The future of blockchain depends on finding a balance between fostering technological progress and ensuring legal compliance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

This strong lead has, surprisingly, prevented the typical altcoin season from unfolding, a phenomenon noted in the Bybit x Block Scholes Quarterly Report. Historically, post-halving rallies saw traders quickly shift funds into altcoins, seeking higher risk and potentially greater returns. However, this cycle feels distinctly different; altcoins have only delivered modest gains so far, prompting many to question the traditional market rotation. Why is Bitcoin Dominance So High? Unpacking Institutional Crypto Investment The primary driver behind Bitcoin’s sustained dominance is the increasing influence of institutional crypto investment . These large entities, including hedge funds, asset managers, and sovereign wealth funds, approach the crypto market with a different strategy than individual retail investors. They prioritize stability, liquidity, and regulatory compliance. A key vehicle for this institutional interest is the advent of regulated products like spot Bitcoin ETFs . These exchange-traded funds provide a straightforward, secure, and compliant way for institutions to gain exposure to BTC without the complexities of direct asset management or custody. Consequently, significant capital inflows have been directed primarily into Bitcoin, bolstering its market share. This institutional preference means capital often flows into Bitcoin first and tends to stay there for the long term, rather than rotating into smaller, more volatile altcoins. The traditional “trickle-down” effect, where Bitcoin’s gains eventually fuel broader altcoin rallies, is significantly muted in this cycle due to this fundamental shift in investor demographics. Is the Altcoin Season Delayed, or Fundamentally Changed? While the broad altcoin season we’ve seen in previous cycles might be delayed, it’s more accurate to say the market structure is fundamentally changing. Ethereum (ETH), often considered a bellwether for altcoin performance, still holds a lower market share compared to prior altseasons. This indicates a broader lack of widespread enthusiasm for the general altcoin market, unlike the speculative frenzy of 2017 or 2021. The current environment highlights a preference for established, larger-cap assets. Investors, particularly institutions, are less inclined to take on the higher risks associated with smaller altcoins. Instead, they seek out projects with proven track records and strong fundamentals. This discernment is a hallmark of a maturing market. Could Ethereum ETFs Spark a Selective Altcoin Season? The narrative could indeed change, albeit selectively. The potential approval of staking-enabled Ethereum ETFs could be a significant catalyst. Such a development would open doors for more institutional capital to flow into ETH, offering not just price exposure but also staking yield, which is highly attractive to long-term holders. If approved, these Ethereum ETFs could spark a more discerning and selective altseason. This would likely benefit only higher-quality, established altcoins with robust ecosystems, strong development teams, and clear utility. Projects that can demonstrate real-world applications and sustainable growth models are more likely to attract the attention of sophisticated investors. What does this mean for investors? Due Diligence is Key: Thoroughly research projects beyond mere hype. Focus on Fundamentals: Look for strong use cases, active development, and clear value propositions. Risk Management: Understand that not all altcoins will perform equally, and many may not see significant gains. Long-Term View: Institutional influence encourages a longer-term investment horizon. Navigating the New Crypto Landscape: What to Watch Understanding this profound shift is crucial for all investors. The market is maturing, moving beyond speculative retail-driven pumps towards more fundamental, institutionally-backed growth. This means traditional metrics and past cycle patterns may not apply as directly as before. The sustained Bitcoin dominance is a clear indicator of this new era, driven by significant institutional crypto investment . The era of easy, broad altcoin gains might be behind us, replaced by a more discerning environment. Keep a close eye on regulatory developments, especially concerning new crypto ETFs like potential Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs , as these will continue to dictate the flow of institutional capital and, by extension, the market’s overall direction. This evolving landscape will define future investment opportunities. In summary: Bitcoin’s continued dominance is a direct result of significant institutional crypto investment , primarily through Bitcoin ETFs . This dynamic is delaying the traditional altcoin season . While a broad altseason seems unlikely soon, the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs could trigger a more selective altcoin rally, favoring strong, established projects. The crypto market is evolving, and understanding these institutional forces is vital for navigating future trends and identifying where true value lies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Bitcoin dominance, and why is it important? Bitcoin dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. It is important because it indicates Bitcoin’s strength relative to altcoins and often signals market sentiment and potential shifts in capital flow. 2. Why isn’t there a typical altcoin season this cycle? The current cycle’s altcoin season is delayed primarily due to the increased influence of institutional investors who prefer to hold larger, more stable assets like Bitcoin, often through ETFs, rather than rotating funds into smaller, more volatile altcoins. 3. How are institutional investors influencing Bitcoin’s market share? Institutional investors are directing substantial capital into Bitcoin, particularly via regulated products like Bitcoin ETFs. This large-scale, long-term investment preference keeps capital concentrated in BTC, boosting its market share and reducing the liquidity available for a broad altcoin rally. 4. What impact do Bitcoin ETFs have on the market? Bitcoin ETFs provide a regulated and accessible avenue for institutional and traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. They bring significant capital inflows, enhance market legitimacy, and contribute to Bitcoin’s price stability and sustained market dominance. 5. Could Ethereum ETFs trigger a new altcoin rally? The potential approval of staking-enabled Ethereum ETFs could attract substantial institutional capital to ETH. This might spark a more selective altcoin rally, benefiting high-quality, established altcoins with strong fundamentals rather than a broad market surge. 6. What should investors do in this new market landscape? Investors should prioritize due diligence, focus on altcoins with strong fundamentals and real-world utility, manage risk carefully, and adopt a longer-term investment perspective, understanding that institutional influence is reshaping traditional market cycles.

A score of 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’, while 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed’. A higher score, like the current 70, suggests that investors are feeling confident and highly optimistic. This index helps market participants gauge whether the crypto market is becoming overly bullish or bearish. Historically, extreme fear can signal a potential buying opportunity, while extreme greed might indicate that a market correction is on the horizon. How is Crypto Market Sentiment Measured? The index compiles data from six distinct factors to calculate the overall crypto market sentiment . Each factor contributes a specific weight to the final score, providing a comprehensive view of investor behavior and market conditions: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current price fluctuations and drawdowns of Bitcoin, assessing the stability or instability of the market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): It analyzes the current trading volume and the strength of the market, indicating the level of buying and selling pressure. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and sentiments, gauging public interest and emotional trends. Surveys (15%): Although currently paused, this factor previously gathered direct investor opinions to understand their future expectations. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, which can reveal shifts in investor preference between Bitcoin and altcoins. Google Trends (10%): It assesses search interest for various crypto-related terms, reflecting general public curiosity and engagement. What Does ‘Greed’ Mean for Your Investments? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index enters the ‘Greed’ zone, it often signifies that cryptocurrency prices have experienced significant upward movement. Investors might be feeling overly confident, potentially leading to irrational exuberance and speculative buying. This heightened enthusiasm can sometimes precede a market pullback or consolidation. However, a ‘Greed’ reading also indicates strong buying pressure and a generally positive investor outlook. Traders often look for signs of overbought conditions during these periods of high greed. Understanding crypto volatility is particularly important here. While greed can certainly drive prices higher, it also increases the risk of sharp corrections as the market becomes overheated. Always exercise caution and consider your risk tolerance. Navigating Market Momentum and Potential Pitfalls The current market momentum , clearly reflected in the index’s high score, suggests a strong upward trend is in play. This can be an exciting time for investors who are holding assets, as their portfolios may see significant gains. However, it is essential to remember that markets are cyclical. Historical data consistently shows that extreme greed phases can be challenging to navigate. They often precede a period of consolidation, or even a downturn, as profits are taken. Therefore, it is crucial to consider your personal risk tolerance and investment strategy. Do not let FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) dictate your financial decisions. A high index score is a powerful signal, but it is not a guarantee of continued gains. The Influence of Bitcoin Dominance on Sentiment Bitcoin dominance plays a noteworthy role in the overall index calculation. When Bitcoin’s market share increases, it can sometimes indicate a ‘flight to safety’ within the crypto space, where investors prioritize the largest and most established cryptocurrency. Conversely, a decrease in Bitcoin dominance might suggest that an ‘altcoin season’ is brewing, with funds flowing into smaller, more speculative assets. Currently, Bitcoin’s relative stability contributes significantly to the general positive sentiment observed in the index. Its performance often sets the overarching tone for the broader cryptocurrency market, influencing how investors perceive risk and opportunity across the entire ecosystem. Conclusion: Stay Informed, Stay Strategic The recent rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 70 undeniably signifies a robust ‘Greed’ phase in the market. This reflects heightened optimism and a strong positive crypto market sentiment among participants. While such periods can be exhilarating, it is vital to remain strategic and grounded in your investment approach. Use this index as a valuable tool for insight, not as a definitive crystal ball. Combine its signals with your own thorough research, technical analysis, and robust risk management strategies. In the dynamic and fast-paced crypto landscape, informed decisions are always the most beneficial decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: It’s a tool by Alternative.me that measures current crypto market sentiment, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). It helps gauge investor emotions. Q2: How is the index calculated? A: It uses six factors: volatility (25%), market momentum/volume (25%), social media (15%), surveys (15% – currently paused), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google Trends (10%). Q3: What does a score of 70, like the current one, mean? A: A score of 70 indicates the market is in a “Greed” phase. This suggests strong positive sentiment and high optimism among investors, often seen during price rallies. Q4: Should I buy or sell based solely on the index? A: No, the index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct buy/sell signal. While extreme fear can suggest a buying opportunity and extreme greed a potential correction, always combine its insights with thorough research and your personal risk strategy. Q5: How does Bitcoin dominance affect the index? A: Bitcoin dominance reflects Bitcoin’s market share. Its movements can influence overall market sentiment. A rising dominance might indicate a flight to safety, while a falling one could signal an altcoin season, both impacting the index’s calculation. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Why do these crypto token unlocks matter so much for the cryptocurrency market impact ? When a large number of previously locked tokens enter circulation, it increases the total supply available. This influx can lead to selling pressure, especially if early investors or team members decide to take profits immediately. However, it’s not always a bearish event. Sometimes, a well-anticipated unlock is already priced into the market, or the project’s fundamentals are strong enough to absorb the new supply without significant negative effects. Understanding the context of each digital asset release is key. Navigating Digital Asset Releases: What Should Investors Consider? For investors, understanding the comprehensive token unlock schedule is crucial. It allows you to anticipate potential market movements and adjust your strategy accordingly. Don’t just look at the raw numbers; consider the percentage of circulating supply being unlocked. If a significant portion of the circulating supply is released, it might warrant closer attention. Conversely, a smaller percentage might have a negligible effect. Before the ARB token unlock or any other major release, conduct thorough research into the project’s long-term vision, development activity, and community sentiment. Diversifying your portfolio also helps mitigate risks associated with single-asset volatility. In summary, this week’s crypto token unlocks present both opportunities and challenges for market participants. By staying informed about the token unlock schedule and understanding its potential cryptocurrency market impact , you can make more informed decisions. Always remember to do your own research and invest wisely in the dynamic world of digital asset releases . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a token unlock in cryptocurrency? A token unlock refers to the scheduled release of previously restricted cryptocurrency tokens into the circulating supply. These tokens are typically held by project teams, early investors, or advisors and are locked up for a set period to prevent immediate sell-offs and support long-term project stability. 2. Why do crypto projects implement token lock-ups? Projects implement token lock-ups to ensure the long-term commitment of core contributors and early investors, prevent market manipulation from large token dumps, and create a controlled supply release that aligns with project development milestones. 3. How do token unlocks affect crypto prices? Token unlocks can increase the circulating supply of a cryptocurrency, which, if not met with increased demand, can lead to selling pressure and potential price drops. The actual cryptocurrency market impact depends on the unlocked amount, market sentiment, and the project’s fundamentals. 4. Which major tokens are featured in this week’s token unlock schedule? This week’s token unlock schedule includes significant releases for MOCA, APT, LAYER, IO, PUMP, BB, STRK, CYBER, ARB, ZBCN, VANA, ERA, APE, and ZK, among others, according to DropsTab data. 5.

While a substantial sum, it represents 1.82% of the circulating supply, making it important for investors to monitor its potential effects. 6. What should investors do to prepare for crypto token unlocks? Investors should research the specific project, understand the percentage of circulating supply being unlocked, assess the project’s long-term viability, and consider diversifying their portfolio to mitigate risks associated with these crypto token unlocks .

This strategic move highlights how major players navigate the volatile digital asset landscape to secure impressive gains. What Triggered the Significant ETH and 1INCH Sale? Recently, the investment fund associated with the 1inch team executed a substantial ETH and 1INCH sale , totaling approximately $22.87 million. According to insights from the reputable on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, this wasn’t just a random transaction but a calculated maneuver. The fund sold 5,000 ETH, converting it into $21.07 million in USDC. Additionally, 6.45 million 1INCH tokens were offloaded for $1.8 million in USDC. These actions demonstrate active portfolio management within the dynamic decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Understanding the Gains: A Smart Crypto Investment Fund Strategy One of the most compelling aspects of this transaction is the impressive profit realized by the 1inch fund. The ETH was initially acquired in February, while the 1INCH tokens were purchased in July. Holding these assets for a strategic period allowed the fund to capitalize on market appreciation. This particular crypto investment fund netted an astounding $8.36 million in realized gains from these sales. This figure underscores the potential for significant returns when investments are timed judiciously and based on thorough market understanding. The Power of On-Chain Analysis in Today’s Market How do we know about these intricate details? This is where on-chain analysis becomes invaluable. Tools and experts like @EmberCN monitor public blockchain data, providing transparency into large-scale transactions that might otherwise go unnoticed. For investors, following such analyses offers: Early Insights: Understanding major fund movements before they become widely reported. Market Sentiment: Gauging whether large holders are accumulating or distributing assets. Strategic Learning: Observing how successful funds manage their portfolios. This level of transparency is a unique characteristic of the blockchain space, offering a distinct advantage to those who leverage it. Implications for the Decentralized Finance Landscape The 1inch fund offloads of significant amounts of ETH and 1INCH also send ripples through the broader decentralized finance sector. While these sales represent profit-taking, they can also influence short-term market sentiment for the respective assets. For the 1inch protocol itself, such moves by its associated fund can be seen as a sign of financial health and strategic flexibility. The ability to realize substantial gains provides capital that can be reinvested into further development, liquidity provision, or other strategic initiatives that benefit the 1inch ecosystem and its users. Key Takeaways for Crypto Enthusiasts The 1inch fund’s recent activities offer several important lessons for anyone involved in cryptocurrencies: Patience Pays: Holding assets through market fluctuations can lead to substantial profits. Strategic Exits: Knowing when to take profits is as crucial as knowing when to enter. Data is Power: Leveraging on-chain analysis provides a competitive edge in understanding market dynamics. Ultimately, this event underscores the sophisticated strategies employed by professional crypto entities and the ongoing evolution of the digital asset market. The 1inch fund’s strategic offloading of ETH and 1INCH, yielding millions in profit, serves as a compelling case study in effective crypto portfolio management. It highlights the importance of timely acquisitions, astute market observation, and the invaluable insights provided by on-chain data. As the crypto market continues to mature, such calculated moves by significant players will remain a focal point for understanding broader trends and opportunities.

Then paying close attention to upcoming economic events is absolutely vital. These macroeconomic indicators, particularly those from the U.S., can significantly influence investor sentiment and trigger substantial crypto market impact . This week brings a series of key economic data releases and central bank commentaries that could set the tone for digital asset prices. Understanding these moments can help you make more informed decisions. What Key Economic Events Are Happening This Week? This week is packed with important announcements that could ripple through global markets, including cryptocurrencies. Here is a breakdown of the key U.S. economic events to watch closely, all times listed are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC): Tuesday, August 12: 12:30 UTC: U.S. Core CPI (YoY) (July) – The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures inflation, reflecting changes in the prices of goods and services purchased by consumers. The ‘Core’ CPI excludes volatile food and energy prices, providing a clearer picture of underlying inflation trends. A higher-than-expected CPI report can signal persistent inflation, potentially leading to a more hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates. This often creates uncertainty and can affect risk assets like cryptocurrencies. 14:00 UTC: U.S. FOMC Member Barkin Speaks – Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members often provide insights into the central bank’s economic outlook and monetary policy intentions. Remarks from Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin could offer clues on future interest rate decisions or quantitative tightening, which directly influences liquidity in financial markets. How Will Fed Speeches Influence Crypto Market Impact? Central bank communication is a powerful tool, and this week features multiple speeches from influential Federal Reserve officials. Their words can move markets as investors try to decipher the future direction of monetary policy. Wednesday, August 13: 17:00 UTC: U.S. Fed Goolsbee Speaks – Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee is another voice from the FOMC. His comments, especially on inflation or labor market conditions, can provide additional context to the Fed’s thinking. 17:30 UTC: U.S. FOMC Member Bostic Speaks – Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic’s remarks will also be under scrutiny. Collective insights from these FOMC speeches help shape market expectations for interest rates. Higher rates typically make traditional savings more attractive and can reduce the appeal of riskier assets like crypto. Navigating Potential Market Volatility with Key Data Thursday brings more crucial data points that will further inform the market’s perspective on the U.S. economy’s health and inflationary pressures. Understanding these can help you prepare for potential market volatility . Thursday, August 14: 12:30 UTC: U.S. Initial Jobless Claims – This weekly report indicates the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time. A rising number of claims suggests a weakening labor market, which could prompt the Fed to consider easing monetary policy. Conversely, strong employment figures might reinforce a hawkish stance. 12:30 UTC: U.S. Core PPI (YoY) (July) – The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. Like CPI, the ‘Core’ PPI excludes volatile items. It is an indicator of wholesale inflation, which can eventually filter down to consumer prices. A high PPI could signal future consumer inflation. 18:00 UTC: U.S. FOMC Member Barkin Speaks – Another opportunity for investors to hear directly from Barkin, potentially reinforcing or clarifying his earlier remarks, or reacting to the latest data releases. The cumulative effect of these economic events can lead to significant price swings in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin and altcoins often react sharply to U.S. macro data, as it influences the broader financial liquidity and risk appetite. For instance, a strong CPI report or hawkish FOMC speeches could lead to a ‘risk-off’ environment, impacting crypto negatively. Conversely, softer data or dovish remarks might signal a more favorable backdrop. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Stay Informed: Keep these dates and times marked in your calendar. Monitor Reactions: Observe how Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies react immediately after the data releases and speeches. Risk Management: Consider adjusting your portfolio or setting stop-loss orders if you anticipate high market volatility around these times. Long-Term View: While short-term fluctuations are possible, remember your long-term investment strategy. In conclusion, this week’s economic calendar is a crucial one for anyone invested in digital assets. From the all-important CPI report to multiple FOMC speeches and key labor/producer price data, each event carries the potential to trigger significant crypto market impact . By understanding these dynamics, you can better prepare for potential shifts and navigate the exciting, yet challenging, world of cryptocurrency investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why do U.S. economic events affect the global crypto market? A1: The U.S. dollar remains the world’s primary reserve currency, and U.S. monetary policy set by the Federal Reserve significantly influences global liquidity and investor sentiment. Changes in U.S. interest rates or inflation expectations often prompt shifts in investment flows worldwide, including into and out of risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Q2: What is the significance of the Core CPI report for crypto? A2: The Core CPI report indicates the underlying inflation rate, excluding volatile food and energy prices. If inflation is high and persistent, the Federal Reserve might continue or accelerate interest rate hikes, which can make traditional assets more attractive and reduce the appeal of cryptocurrencies as speculative investments, leading to a negative crypto market impact. Q3: How do FOMC speeches influence market volatility? A3: FOMC members’ speeches provide insights into the Federal Reserve’s economic outlook and future monetary policy decisions. Any hints about interest rate changes, quantitative tightening, or the overall health of the economy can cause significant market reactions, as investors adjust their positions based on anticipated policy shifts. This often leads to increased market volatility. Q4: What should crypto investors do during periods of high economic uncertainty? A4: During periods of high economic uncertainty, crypto investors should prioritize risk management. This includes staying informed about upcoming economic events, diversifying portfolios, considering smaller position sizes, and potentially using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Avoiding emotional trading and sticking to a well-researched investment strategy is also crucial. Q5: Besides CPI and FOMC speeches, what other economic data is important? A5: Other important economic data points include the Producer Price Index (PPI), which indicates wholesale inflation; Initial Jobless Claims, which signal labor market health; GDP reports, showing overall economic growth; and retail sales data, reflecting consumer spending. All these contribute to the broader economic picture that influences financial markets and crypto market impact. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Chronicle, the oracle infrastructure provider powering secure, scalable onchain financial data, has been named the exclusive partner to Grove Protocol, an institutional-grade credit platform with a $1 billion tokenized asset allocation strategy. Grove, part of the Sky ecosystem known as a 'Star', the name Sky uses for units in its network, launched in June with a $1 billion allocation to tokenized collateralized loan obligations such as the Janus Henderson Anemoy AAA CLO Strategy on Centrifuge, aiming to bridge DeFi and traditional credit markets by giving protocols and asset managers access to diversified, institutional-grade yields. Niklas Kunkel, Chronicle’s founder, said in an interview with CoinDesk that oracles have evolved beyond their early role as simple price feeds. “They started as general data distribution mechanisms and got really siloed into just prices for however many years, to the point where if you say Oracle to anyone in crypto, they immediately think of the thing that gives you a price,” he told CoinDesk. “It wasn’t until recently that that mold is finally being shed and people are starting to understand how important data and context can be and how that can be leveraged in a risk management type of way.” Kunkel sees tokenized assets as DeFi’s next major growth engine, describing them as a “multi-trillion dollar liquidity injection opportunity” as the sector looks beyond BTC and ETH. “RWAs are not crypto native, so the risk management around them needs to be much more scrutinized,"" he continued. ""Everything is not on chain, and so where oracles really fill that gap is to add that context back in, to bring that transparency back.” In Kunkel’s view, the regulatory potential of oracles is just beginning to be recognized. “In the real world, this is usually done through regulation where you need to make quarterly filings,” he said. “But in DeFi we expect finality in the span of blocks, and once regulators actually start understanding what oracles can do, they’re going to essentially become Oracle’s biggest adopters, because oracles essentially become like reg tech.” This partnership marks a step in Chronicle’s plan to dominate the tokenized asset oracle market, a position Kunkel believes will soon outgrow DeFi itself. Market Movers BTC: BTC is trading at $119K, up 2% in the last 24 hours. A recent JP Morgan note argued that a bullish S&P 500 outlook could lift BTC by boosting risk appetite and capital flows into speculative assets, given their historical positive correlation. ETH: ETH is trading above $4200. Bizantine Capital managing partner March Zheng said in a note to CoinDesk that the forced closure of so many ETH shorts during the past 72 hours as helped further accelerate the digital asset's rally. Gold: Gold is holding near record highs as weaker U.S. economic data, trade tensions, and a dovish Fed outlook boost demand, with upcoming inflation and retail sales data likely to shape its next move.

Currently, a key indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , stands at 36 as of 00:37 UTC on August 11. This specific reading signals a distinct period known as Bitcoin Season within the broader crypto market trends . What does this mean for your portfolio and how should you navigate these waters? What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), a leading cryptocurrency price data platform. It helps investors gauge the prevailing sentiment and capital flow within the digital asset space. This index meticulously compares the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies on CMC, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin. For a market to be in Altcoin Season , a significant majority—at least 75%—of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Conversely, Bitcoin Season occurs when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to surpass Bitcoin’s performance. The index itself ranges from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating stronger Altcoin Performance relative to Bitcoin. Navigating Bitcoin Season: What Does it Mean for Your Portfolio? With the Altcoin Season Index at 36, we are clearly in Bitcoin Season . This period often sees Bitcoin asserting its dominance, attracting a larger share of market capitalization and investor attention. For many altcoins, this can translate into slower growth or even price stagnation compared to Bitcoin. Understanding this dynamic is vital for effective digital asset analysis . During Bitcoin Season, investors often prioritize stability and the perceived safety of Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean altcoins are without opportunity, but their performance may be more subdued or require more selective investment strategies. Therefore, a careful assessment of individual altcoin projects becomes even more critical. Strategies for the Current Crypto Market Trends In a Bitcoin Season , your investment approach might need adjustment. While Bitcoin takes the lead, smart strategies can still yield results for your overall altcoin performance . Here are a few actionable insights: Focus on Bitcoin Strength: Consider increasing your exposure to Bitcoin if you believe its dominance will continue. Bitcoin often acts as a safe haven during uncertain periods in the broader crypto market. Selective Altcoin Investments: Instead of broad altcoin diversification, focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, and active development. These projects might be more resilient during Bitcoin’s reign. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue to invest fixed amounts regularly. This strategy helps mitigate volatility and can be particularly effective during periods of price consolidation for altcoins. Risk Management: Always prioritize risk management. Avoid over-leveraging and ensure your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance, especially when crypto market trends favor one asset over others. Thorough digital asset analysis is your best friend right now. Look beyond the immediate price action and delve into the long-term potential of projects. Conclusion: Adapting to Market Cycles The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 36 clearly signals a period of Bitcoin Season . This is a natural cycle within the dynamic cryptocurrency market, where dominance shifts between Bitcoin and various altcoins. By understanding these crypto market trends and conducting diligent digital asset analysis , investors can make informed decisions. Whether it’s prioritizing Bitcoin or strategically selecting resilient altcoins, adapting your approach to the prevailing market conditions is key to navigating the exciting world of digital assets and optimizing your altcoin performance . Stay informed, stay strategic! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does an Altcoin Season Index of 36 mean?

The Ethereum (ETH) update has been impressive, daily transactions are soaring to new highs, showing real usage growing beyond mere speculation! Meanwhile, the pepe coin (PEPE) update is all about meme‑coin bursts, upward rallies powered by social hype, but with shaky fundamentals. These dynamics illustrate the typical extremes in crypto: chain activity or meme mania. But there’s another way. Cold Wallet is building growth on real utility, returning value to users through cashback, but also offering 4,900% launch‑to‑presale ROI. When it comes to sustainable performance, it may just outclass current buzz altogether. In comparing network action, social hype, and use‑based adoption, a clearer picture forms. Cold Wallet combines practical utility with massive upside, making it a serious contender for long-term prominence among upcoming crypto coins. Ethereum (ETH) Update: On-Chain Activity Hits Record Highs Ethereum’s recent on‑chain data points to tangible growth, not just hype. Daily transactions recently reached 1.74 million, smashing previous records from the 2021 bull run. Unique address counts have surged as well, with hundreds of thousands of wallets joining the network. This reflects real demand across DeFi, NFTs, and institutional domains. Yet for all this activity, price performance remains capped, Ethereum is stuck in a consolidation zone despite strong usage numbers. Ethereum’s ability to support widespread application is clearly proven, but as a speculative vehicle, momentum is slower than usage suggests. The Ethereum (ETH) update points to strength, but investors looking for explosive upside may find better value elsewhere, especially among upcoming crypto coins that layer utility with aggressive presale gains. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Update: Meme Resurgence But Fragile Foundation Pepe Coin has recaptured the spotlight among meme enthusiasts, with a recent spike in whale accumulation and daily volumes creeping back up. Technical setups suggest potential short-term rallies to new highs if bullish momentum sustains. That’s the pulse of a classic pepe coin (PEPE) update, viral interest spurs quick gains. But meme coins live in volatile ecosystems. Downturns are often swift, and recovery depends heavily on social media cycles for survival. When comparing catalysts, PEPE’s momentum is top-down driven, valuable, but not grounded in real, everyday utility. For investors considering the top crypto to invest in, PEPE offers short-term thrills, but lacks sustainable growth mechanisms. Cold Wallet: Real Utility & 4,900% Launch Potential Cold Wallet transforms everyday usage into rewards. Instead of charging for every interaction, it reimburses users in CWT tokens when they pay gas, swap assets, or move funds. That means using the wallet makes you richer, not poorer. The presale is already drawing investor attention. With the current price at $0.00998 in Stage 17, Cold Wallet has sold 698.39M tokens, and raised a total of $5.9M. The launch price expectation of $0.50 gives early holders a 4,900% return, a level of upside unmatched by current hype leaders. These rewards are supported by sustainable tokenomics. Out of a 10B total supply, 40% is dedicated to early buyers, while 25% fuels the cashback incentives. This ensures the platform continues rewarding engagement well beyond launch. Cold Wallet’s referral structure further deepens its utility-based growth. Both referrer and referee receive bonuses vested over time, which aligns user growth with long-term retention. For anyone weighing the top crypto to invest in, Cold Wallet isn’t just rewarding speculation, it’s betting on daily usage and community expansion. The Future Outlook The Ethereum (ETH) update shows real adoption and technical growth through record transaction volumes, but price gains remain modest. The pepe coin (PEPE) update exhilarates with bursts of meme-fueled rallies, yet relies heavily on social hype and volatile sentiment. Cold Wallet sits at a different intersection, pairing genuine utility with extraordinary financial opportunity. Its cashback model turns crypto activity into rewards, and the presale’s 4,900% launch-potential ROI offers early investors a compelling growth trajectory. For long-term value without sacrificing upside, Cold Wallet emerges as a standout among upcoming crypto coins, one that may truly outperform speculative leaders in 2025 and beyond.

While whales shift their strategies, crypto traders are closely monitoring these developments for the next big opportunity. One such opportunity lies within the crypto betting world, where Spartans are quickly becoming a top platform for sports betting enthusiasts. With its focus on speed, efficiency, and tactical betting, Spartans is creating a new way for crypto holders to engage with sports. Spartans offers a dynamic betting experience with real-time stats, in-play odds, and quick bet placements. It’s designed to appeal to Cardano (ADA) holders by providing a live edge, as they can take advantage of combo bets with up to 8x odds and fast payouts after every match. Whether it’s basketball, soccer, or UFC, Spartans ensure that crypto bettors experience the same level of strategy and excitement as they would in a DeFi trade. Sports betting on Spartans is truly next-generation betting, fast and precise. Cardano Whale Moves Indicate A Bullish Future For ADA Recent activity from Cardano (ADA) whales has made a significant mark, with over 137 transactions exceeding $1 million each in just one day. This surge in high-value transactions comes at a crucial time, as ADA has risen sharply from its mid-June lows of around $0.50 to the current price range of $0.82–$0.88. This movement signals a renewed interest in ADA, with whales positioning themselves ahead of a potential breakout. Market analysts see $1.00 as the key resistance point, with projections for ADA to rise to as high as $1.30 if momentum continues. Technical indicators show that the RSI is strong, and ADA has regained key support zones, suggesting a positive outlook for the near future. With some analysts projecting ADA’s price could reach anywhere from $1.50 to $3.00 over the next year, Cardano remains one of the most closely watched assets in the market. For crypto traders, it’s a matter of timing their moves to align with large holders who are already preparing for what comes next in ADA’s journey. Celestia Price Outlook Driven By Strategic Buybacks The Celestia (TIA) price outlook has been relatively mixed, with the coin trading between $1.81 and $1.94 after bouncing from lows near $1.32. Some forecasts suggest that TIA could test support levels around $1.45. However, if buying pressure picks up, there’s potential for the price to reach $2.00. The Celestia Foundation’s recent $62.5 million buyback of 43.45 million tokens from Polychain has played a key role in supporting the token’s price by stabilizing the supply and reducing concerns of further sell-offs. Additionally, the foundation has updated its vesting schedule, starting mid-August, which has added confidence in the token’s short-term stability. Analysts are focusing on the $1.45 support level and predicting a range-bound market for TIA through the end of 2025. However, more optimistic projections indicate the possibility of TIA reaching $4–6 by 2026, especially if adoption grows alongside its modular blockchain. The upcoming Lotus upgrade, with staking rewards tied to vesting, is expected to be a major driver for price momentum. Investors are keeping a close eye on developments as they anticipate possible upward movement in the near term. Spartans: The Crypto Sportsbook Revolutionizing Betting Spartans stands out not just as a sportsbook but as an innovative platform tailored for crypto holders who want to bet with precision. By integrating live stats, dynamic in-play odds, and quick betslips, Spartans transform sports betting into a tactical experience similar to DeFi trading. Cardano holders, in particular, gain an edge with combo bets that offer up to 8x odds, increasing the potential for higher returns. Every bet is calculated, with real-time updates that allow users to adjust their strategies throughout a game. What sets Spartans apart from other crypto casinos is the ability to make sports betting feel as fast and tactical as cryptocurrency trading. By offering instant withdrawals, bettors no longer have to wait long after the final whistle. Winnings are quickly transferred to wallets, ensuring the excitement doesn’t stop. This feature has made Spartans a go-to platform for crypto enthusiasts who treat sports wagers as part of their investment strategy. Spartans’ focus on speed, real-time data, and instant withdrawals has earned it a reputation as one of the leading crypto casinos. With its variety of sports options and quick processing times, Spartans ensures that every bet feels like a calculated move rather than a gamble. The platform’s innovative approach to crypto sports betting has made it a favorite among users looking for a more advanced, efficient betting experience. Summing Up! Cardano (ADA) whale activity indicates that large holders are actively accumulating, signaling a potential price breakout as ADA approaches key resistance levels near $1.00. Meanwhile, the Celestia (TIA) outlook remains cautiously optimistic, with recent buybacks and the upcoming Lotus upgrade providing reasons for a more bullish long-term perspective. Traders and crypto holders alike are keeping a close watch on these developments as they seek their next profitable opportunity. For those looking for more than just price watching, Spartans offers an ideal solution. The platform not only allows users to place bets but also equips them with the tools to make informed, strategic decisions in real time. With its live stats, dynamic odds, and quick payouts, Spartans has emerged as one of the leading crypto casinos for those looking to combine sports betting with crypto strategy.

According to Sammie, Stellar has partnered with Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and Stripe’s stablecoin division within a single year. The post emphasizes the potential transactional volume such collaborations could bring to the Stellar network, referencing the possible scale of activity that could follow. Details of Sammie’s Statement In the post, Sammie said that the partnerships with these four payment industry leaders were all finalized within the same year. Sammie suggested that the cumulative effect of these collaborations could lead to an unprecedented amount of transaction volume being processed on the Stellar network . While the post did not specify the exact nature of each partnership, the mention of such globally recognized companies highlights the network’s growing integration into mainstream financial infrastructure. Sammie also included the ticker symbol for Stellar’s native asset, XLM, implying a possible correlation between increased network usage and potential interest in the asset. Stellar partnered with @Visa , @MasterCard , @PayPal , and @Stripe ( @Stablecoin ) all within a year. Imagine the insane amount of volume coming to the Stellar Network . $XLM pic.twitter.com/RmS8kotTLM — sammie (@lukinsisammie) August 8, 2025 XLM Community Reaction and Additional Insights Another X user, identified as DoubleAgent-XLM, replied to Sammie’s post with a more detailed perspective on the potential impact of these developments. The response noted that transaction velocity, which is the speed at which funds move across the network, would be a critical factor in scaling Stellar’s activity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to DoubleAgent-XLM, multiple use cases such as payroll systems, locked-up payments, and on-chain functionalities like Soroban smart contracts could be major drivers of network usage. They also referenced specific institutional integrations, such as DTCC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation) wallets and Salesforce wallets, as possible points of significant adoption. Potential Implications for the Stellar Network If the partnerships operate at scale, Stellar could see a sharp increase in the variety and volume of transactions. The involvement of companies like Visa and MasterCard , which process billions of transactions annually, suggests the possibility of Stellar becoming part of existing large-scale payment flows. PayPal’s and Stripe’s active roles in the digital payments and stablecoin sectors could further position Stellar within emerging financial technology ecosystems. The mention of Soroban, Stellar’s smart contract platform, indicates a potential expansion beyond payments into programmable financial services, adding another layer of network utility. Sammie’s post highlights a year of significant developments for the Stellar network , with partnerships involving some of the most influential players in global payments. The additional commentary from DoubleAgent-XLM adds context to how increased transaction velocity, institutional integrations, and broader utility could result in substantial network activity. While the full scale of these developments remains to be seen, the alignment of multiple high-profile collaborations in a short period signals an important phase in Stellar’s growth trajectory.

It’s about understanding how each project builds momentum and offers practical value. As competition intensifies in the presale space, only a few coins are offering tactical benefits that go beyond temporary hype. This article examines four notable projects, starting with BlockDAG, a presale that’s combining smart liquidity planning with long-term value. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Combining Market Strategy With Real-Time Utility BlockDAG ranks among the best crypto coins to buy because of its structured approach to building liquidity and engagement. Instead of pushing hype-based incentives, BlockDAG introduced a 10 BTC Auction as part of its final presale stage. This mechanism encourages volume-based participation, aligning buyer rewards with actual market depth, not giveaways. So far, BlockDAG has raised $368 million and sold over 24.8 billion coins. It’s currently priced at $0.0276 in batch 29, but a temporary rollback offers buyers access at just $0.0016, representing a 2,660% ROI opportunity compared to early batches. By merging a technical setup with real-world functionality and incentive-driven liquidity, BlockDAG offers more than a presale entry, it presents a calculated opportunity for those thinking ahead of the market. 2. SUBBD ($SUBBD): SocialFi Use Case With Influencer-Driven Adoption SUBBD enters the discussion as one of the best crypto coins to buy for those watching the SocialFi space. Built for content creators and communities, SUBBD makes it possible to monetize posts and interactions directly through blockchain, introducing rewards, tipping tools, and a native ad system into its protocol. What makes SUBBD notable is its early traction. Partnerships with niche creator communities and smaller influencers are already in place, and its staking model incentivizes both holding and platform activity. This dual reward structure ties token demand to real engagement, giving it measurable value even in early phases. For forward-looking buyers, SUBBD offers a clear application with room for network expansion. 3. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE): Merging Meme Trends With Tradable Structure Wall Street Pepe earns its place on the best crypto coins to buy list by blending cultural relevance with functional features. Built with strong visual branding that references both meme culture and financial themes, $WEPE extends its appeal to traders looking for assets that offer quick movement without sacrificing core structure. The token’s mechanics include deflationary controls and staking functions, tools that help sustain interest after initial listing. Early presale traction came from platforms like Reddit and X, and its post-launch performance has shown consistent liquidity on decentralized exchanges. For those seeking short-term flexibility with longer-term community interest, $WEPE offers a strategic balance between sentiment and usability. 4. Best Wallet Token ($BEST): Driving Token Utility Through On-Chain Cashback The Best Wallet Token, or $BEST, rounds out the list of best crypto coins to buy by focusing on practical utility. Unlike speculative coins, $BEST is integrated into a self-custody wallet that rewards users with cashback every time they complete a transaction, including swaps, bridges, or fiat conversions. As users increase their activity, they earn more $BEST, which fuels steady demand. Higher reward tiers unlock based on usage, mirroring traditional cashback systems but adapted for DeFi. With crypto wallets playing a more central role in user interaction and fund management, tokens like $BEST provide recurring value and long-term relevance, particularly for active users building sustainable portfolios. Strategic Selection Is Key for 2025 The best crypto coins to buy in 2025 are not defined by hype cycles alone. They are distinguished by smart mechanics, real use cases, and how they reward activity before and after launch. BlockDAG leads this list with its liquidity-driven auction and limited-time pricing window. Wall Street Pepe integrates community appeal with token structure. SUBBD supports content creators with tangible rewards, and $BEST reinforces utility with cashback tied to everyday crypto actions. In a market where timing, function, and foresight are more important than ever, these projects stand out not just for what they promise, but for what they already deliver.

A new report from KPMG and the Recruitment & Employment Confederation (REC) shows recruitment activity in July stayed close to its lowest point in two years. The permanent placements index crawled up to 40 from June’s 39.1, far from the 50 level that separates growth and contraction. Kate Shoesmith, REC’s deputy chief executive, said many employers, especially in low-wage sectors, were pausing recruitment because of cost pressures and uncertainty around employment law. She called for coordinated action between the government and the Bank of England (BoE) to help the job market recover. Hiring freeze looms as rising costs and weak demand stall UK job market A Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) survey found that only one in four employers plan to hire staff in the next three months. Just 16% expect to reduce headcount, and most of those cuts are likely to be cautious and measured. This is a slight diminishing of momentum, especially in the private sector. While a strong rebound in recruitment occurred late last year, there has been little movement since, and employers’ hiring intentions are hovering around COVID-19 pandemic lows. At the sharp end are the hospitality, retail, and social care sectors, where employers typically face low wage bills and temporarily employ workers coming to Britain in their hundreds of thousands Rising employment costs are a major factor. The April increase in employers’ national insurance contributions has hit labour-intensive businesses the hardest, adding to tight margins. For small businesses, these additional costs have left little room to take on new staff, forcing some to freeze recruitment or consider redundancies. Much of the pressure to conform is also driven by policy changes. Tax hikes have already squeezed labour budgets this year, according to a separate report by accountancy and business advisory firm BDO, which found that increases in the national minimum wage had been accompanied by real-time information confirming that millions of employees were now in work. Scores of other employers are now preparing for a fresh squeeze on their finances ahead of the government’s Autumn Statement, where extra fiscal measures are anticipated. The picture thus far: rising costs, weaker demand, and continued uncertainty have made for a tough environment for hiring managers. And economists warn that without targeted support or incentives, many businesses will postpone hiring plans well into 2025, which could drag down the broader economic recovery. Economists question jobs data as UK labour market sends mixed signals While surveys point to a cooling jobs market, the official data tells a mixed story. Payroll figures from HMRC show the number of employees has fallen slightly over the past year, though revisions have softened the decline. Meanwhile, the ONS data indicate that employment and unemployment are both on the rise, while economic inactivity is on a downward trend. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer recently used the latest statistics to show that the economy is bringing more people back to work under the government’s “back to work” scheme. However, several economists suggest that the ONS could be getting their counting wrong, and there was no sign of a substantial lift-off in employment. Last week, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey indicated that the demand for labour declined, but suggested it is an impossibly uncertain time given the terrible data.

U.S. officials said the revenue-sharing agreement was a condition for obtaining export licences to sell the chips in China. These licences were granted last week after months of delay. Nvidia did not deny the deal’s existence, stating it “follows rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.” AMD declined to comment. Financial analysts estimate the arrangement could funnel billions into U.S. coffers. Bernstein Research projects Nvidia could sell around 1.5 million H20 units in China in 2025, generating about $23 billion in revenue. Under the 15% deal, more than $3 billion from those sales would go directly to the U.S. government. Officials have not yet said how they plan to use the funds. Export-control specialists say the move is unprecedented. No U.S. company has previously agreed to hand over a share of its revenue as a condition for export approval. They compare it to earlier Trump administration tactics, in which companies were encouraged to make domestic investments or concessions to avoid tariffs. Officials approve licences after high-level talks The road to the agreement was complex. In April, the Trump administration said it would block H20 exports to China, citing concerns about AI technology transfer. The chip had already been designed to fit within Biden-era export limits on high-end AI processors. In June, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met President Donald Trump at the White House. Within days, the administration reversed its decision to block the H20. Even then, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), which enforces export controls, withheld licences for weeks. These were issued only last week — after the 15% revenue deal was finalised. AMD’s MI308 chip received approval under the same terms. Industry sources say the deal reflects Trump’s preference for transactional outcomes, blending trade, security, and economic policy. Security concerns clash with corporate strategy The arrangement has sparked sharp criticism from national security experts, and in a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, former deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger and 19 other officials urged the government not to issue H20 licences. They warned that the chip is a “potent accelerator” for China’s AI development and could ultimately aid its military. Some BIS officials reportedly shared these concerns, fearing the decision could weaken U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence. Nvidia rejected these claims, calling them “misguided” and insisting the H20 is unsuitable for military use. The company has argued that engaging in the Chinese market is crucial to maintaining U.S. technological competitiveness , warning against a repeat of the U.S. loss in the 5G race. The deal also came as Washington and Beijing held delicate trade talks. China is pressing the U.S. to relax export controls on high-bandwidth memory chips, a key component for advanced AI processors. Trump hopes these negotiations will pave the way for a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year. The revenue-sharing agreement now sits at the intersection of geopolitics, security, and corporate strategy. While it grants U.S. companies access to a lucrative market, it also opens a new chapter in how Washington uses export policy to restrict technology and generate revenue from it.

This non-meme token might be the last real 2nd chance,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/11/missed-doge-or-shib-this-non-meme-token-might-be-the-last-real-2nd-chance/,"It’s the kind of regret that haunts crypto investors for years, watching Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) skyrocket from joke status to household names while sitting on the sidelines. Those who dismissed them as fads missed life-changing gains. But what’s more frustrating? When your second chance comes along, and you miss it again. This time, that second chance isn’t built on memes or social media hype—it’s called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , and it’s building on real financial infrastructure that crypto was always meant to deliver. This $0.035 presale token is currently flying under the radar, but whales have already started positioning. With its advanced dual lending model, upcoming Layer-2 scaling, stablecoin ecosystem, and clear roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving itself to be a serious altcoin contender with genuine long-term potential, not another meme. Real tools, not just hype What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart will be its two-pronged approach to DeFi lending. First, the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model allows users to lend or borrow bluechip assets like BTC and ETH through a smart contract. Lenders receive interest-bearing mtTokens in 1:1, which can be used as collateral or staked in the smart contracts for MUTM rewards. Borrowers deposit overcollateralized crypto to receive stablecoin liquidity. Interest rates adjust dynamically based on pool utilization, making the system both fair and efficient. But for those seeking higher risk and reward, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also building to offer Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending that caters directly to speculative assets, including the very tokens that defined the last bull cycle: DOGE, SHIB, FLOKI, TRUMP, and others. Here, lenders and borrowers negotiate their own terms, allowing for more flexibility and aggressive yield strategies. This opens up a whole new arena of memecoin-backed lending, but within a structured, audited, and secure platform. This dual lending system gives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) an edge. It combines the stability and predictability of institutional-grade lending with the speculative, high-yield power of community-driven tokens. That’s a real evolution from meme-based hype to actual utility—one that retail investors now have the chance to front-run. $0.035 entry could be the setup of the cycle With the presale now in Phase 6, the current price of $0.035 already reflects rising confidence. Over $14.15 million has been raised, and 15,000+ holders are already onboard. Just 12% of Phase 6 tokens remain, and with Phase 7 around the corner, the price is set to increase by 15% to $0.040. For those who missed getting in on DOGE at fractions of a cent or ignored SHIB before its explosive rally, this is a unique window to position early in a project with actual mechanics and institutional-grade design. A simple example: someone who entered during Phase 2 at $0.015 is already sitting on a more than 2x gain in presale value alone. With the projected listing price of $0.06, even Phase 6 participants stand to see significant returns before the token even goes live on exchanges. Unlike meme tokens driven by speculation alone, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible fundamentals that back up these numbers. Security also plays a huge role here. The project has been audited by CertiK, scoring 95/100 on token security and 78 on Skynet for on-chain behavior monitoring. Combined with a $50K Bug Bounty for white-hat hackers and a $100K community giveaway , Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows it’s committed to transparency and long-term development. Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch a decentralized stablecoin—fully overcollateralized, algorithmically stabilized, and only mintable by approved issuers under strict governance control. This isn’t just another DeFi token with buzzwords—it’s a full ecosystem under construction. The planned Layer-2 deployment will further reduce fees and increase speed, setting up the protocol to scale alongside user adoption. This time, the setup is different. There’s no mascot and no Elon tweet. Just a quiet system in process that serious crypto builders are watching closely. If you missed the memes, don’t miss the moment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) might be the last real second chance, with a structure designed to scale and a vision that extends far beyond hype.

A $500 investment turned into six figures for some, as SHIB skyrocketed over 40,000,000% in a matter of months. While many wrote it off as a fluke, the reality is simple: crypto doesn’t reward hesitation. In 2025, a new low-priced altcoin is catching eyes— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently holding steady at $0.035. With analysts calling for a potential 120x breakout, the echoes of SHIB’s early days are hard to ignore. SHIB’s legacy isn’t over Shiba Inu’s 2021 rise is a crypto legend. Born as a joke, it outperformed nearly every serious project in the market during its rally, drawing in millions of holders along the way. At its peak, SHIB minted millionaires from investments that started as loose change. Today, it trades around $0.0000129, showing renewed strength as Ethereum Layer 2 upgrades and the broader altcoin market bounce back. And while SHIB hasn’t returned to its all-time high yet, it’s still up over 300% from its multi-year lows. Projects like Shibarium and ShibaSwap continue to keep the community engaged, but SHIB’s explosive phase might already be behind it. That’s why many early-stage investors are now eyeing the next sub-$1 opportunity—and one token keeps coming up. MUTM at $0.035: built for bigger things Mutuum Finance (MUTM) powers a DeFi system grounded in real utility and platform logic. Priced at $0.035 during its sixth presale stage, MUTM has already drawn in more than 15,000 holders and secured $14.2 million in funding, with plans to debut on exchanges at $0.06, twice its current value. Mutuum Finance combines key DeFi building blocks—like lending pools, secured borrowing, and mtTokens that increase in redemption value over time when swapped for the underlying asset. On top of that, it uses an internal system designed to keep steady buying pressure on its native token. Here’s the twist: profits from protocol fees are used to buy MUTM on the open market, and those tokens are redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. This creates constant demand and rewards long-term holders. Why MUTM has the momentum to outperform SHIB SHIB exploded on the back of social sentiment. MUTM is turning heads thanks to its well-designed token model and growing user engagement with the actual product. Users on Mutuum Finance can lend assets and receive mtTokens (like mtETH or mtDAI), which increase in redemption value over time. Borrowers can access funding by locking up collateral, and they’re free to repay whenever they choose, so long as their collateral stays above the protocol’s minimum requirement. As usage grows, the platform generates more fees, which are funneled into buying MUTM on the open market. That’s where the potential compounding effect kicks in. If adoption rises, the buy-and-distribute cycle gets stronger, and the token’s demand keeps climbing. Same price point, different path At $0.035, MUTM’s price is drawing comparisons to where SHIB started during its early rise. But unlike SHIB, Mutuum Finance isn’t relying on community memes or celebrity tweets. It’s targeting actual DeFi users—lenders, borrowers, and yield chasers looking for a better option than the usual ETH staking or passive DAI farming. And it’s not just the mechanics or community growth that hint at a breakout. Analysts are already projecting that MUTM will hit $3 or higher by 2026, marking a 40x to 80x return from today’s level, even without factoring in speculative mania. At the top end of those projections, a $1,000 presale investment would be worth $80,000. SHIB showed that even the most unexpected tokens can deliver life-changing returns when timing and momentum align. But timing was everything, and most only heard about it after the rocket had launched. MUTM is still sitting on the launchpad, priced at $0.035, with a working model, a CertiK audit, and a growing user base. Is it the next SHIB? Not in structure, but in upside potential, it’s one of the few tokens in 2025 with similar early-stage dynamics. With exchange listings, feature rollouts, and redistribution mechanics ahead, Mutuum Finance is building momentum fast. For investors looking at what cryptocurrency to buy now, this might be the best answer—before everyone else wakes up to it.

In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving out a different path—a structured DeFi ecosystem with genuine utility designed to deliver sustainable growth. Instead of pure speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to offer users access to two unique lending systems. Through its Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending model, users will be able to leverage popular volatile tokens like DOGE or TRUMP as collateral to borrow stablecoins such as USDC or DAI, customizing loan terms directly with lenders. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending pools will concentrate on stable, blue-chip assets like ETH and LINK, where lenders will earn consistent returns ranging between 7.8% and 10.4% APY. This dual lending model will combine risk-adjusted yield with market flexibility, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a standout in a landscape dominated by speculative altcoins. Presale momentum and future growth drivers Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.035. This phase has attracted over 15,000 holders and raised more than $14.25 million, with 15% of available tokens already sold. The excitement is palpable as the next presale phase will see the price jump by 15% to $0.040, creating a prime entry point for investors who want to maximize upside before the price adjusts. Security and reliability have been reinforced through a rigorous CertiK audit, conducted and verified as recently as May 20, 2025. The platform scored an impressive 95 with a Skynet rating of 78, ensuring smart contract safety and bolstering investor confidence. Looking ahead, the path for Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s token price growth is clear and backed by multiple fundamental factors. First, the integration of Layer-2 technology promises faster transaction speeds and lower fees, a key advantage in DeFi environments. Second, the planned stablecoin launch will offer users an overcollateralized borrowing option, governed by adjustable interest rates to keep its value anchored at $1. This stablecoin will play a vital role in the ecosystem by enabling safer, liquid loans that reduce exposure to market swings. Moreover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s lending platform supports high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios on major assets like BTC and ETH, allowing borrowers to unlock greater capital efficiency. These features will become more attractive as the project progresses toward its beta launch and begins courting institutional adoption, potentially unlocking significant new capital inflows. An investment example clearly illustrates this growth potential. An investor who swapped $5,000 worth of ETH during Phase 1 at the $0.01 price point is now sitting on a solid 5x gain at the current $0.035 presale price. With the upcoming listing price targeted at $0.06, and conservative post-listing projections ranging from $0.12 to $0.18 by the end of 2025, this investor’s total return on investment could reach between 12x and 18x. These figures highlight the tangible upside for early buyers as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) matures. Why smart money is moving now Whales and traders who have ridden DOGE and TRUMP’s rollercoaster are increasingly shifting their attention toward real-yield projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The platform’s blend of stable returns from P2C lending and flexible, customizable P2P loans backed by high-demand volatile assets offers a compelling alternative. This migration signals growing recognition that sustainable DeFi protocols with audited security and clear roadmaps provide better risk-adjusted opportunities. The Phase 6 presale window is closing rapidly. With a scheduled 15% price increase looming in Phase 7 and a suite of impactful features like Layer-2 integration and stablecoin issuance on the horizon, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised for significant growth. Investors who want to position themselves ahead of this wave will need to act quickly before prices move beyond the current $0.035 level. In the crowded altcoin era, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a top pick that balances innovation, security, and promising returns. Its unique combination of lending options, institutional-ready technology, and strong community support is setting the stage for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to become a major player in decentralized finance. This is the moment for investors seeking a high-potential altcoin that still trades cheaper than DOGE and TRUMP but carries a far more compelling roadmap and utility.

This individual, responsible for a significant theft from the stablecoin neobank project Infini, recently made headlines again. They sold a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH) during a notable Ethereum price surge , raising questions about the management of stolen crypto and its broader market implications. What Exactly Happened with the Infini Hacker’s Latest Sale? On February 24, a hacker exploited the Infini project, making off with a staggering $49.5 million. Fast forward to the present, and this same Infini hacker has once again become active on the blockchain. According to data from blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, the hacker executed a significant transaction: They sold 1,771 ETH. This transaction yielded $7.44 million. The sale occurred when ETH was trading at approximately $4,202. This pattern of selling stolen crypto whenever Ethereum’s price experiences an upward trend is a calculated move, aiming to maximize illicit gains. Why Do Ethereum Price Surges Influence Stolen Crypto Dispersal? It’s not a coincidence that the Infini hacker chose this moment to offload a portion of their ill-gotten gains. When the market experiences an Ethereum price surge , the value of their holdings increases significantly. This presents a prime opportunity to convert a larger sum of digital assets into fiat currency or other less traceable cryptocurrencies. This strategy allows hackers to: Maximize the profit from their initial digital asset theft . Potentially liquidate funds more discreetly into a larger volume of legitimate transactions. While a single sale of this size might not drastically impact the entire market, it highlights the persistent challenge of tracking and recovering stolen funds in a volatile environment. Understanding the Broader Implications for Crypto Security The Infini incident and the subsequent sales by the Infini hacker underscore critical issues in crypto security . Despite advancements in blockchain technology, vulnerabilities remain. Projects, especially those handling significant user funds like stablecoin neobanks, become prime targets for sophisticated attackers. The continuous threat of digital asset theft necessitates a multi-layered approach to protection: Robust smart contract audits are essential before deployment. Implementing strong access controls and multi-signature requirements for large transactions. Regular security assessments and penetration testing. These measures are crucial for safeguarding user assets and maintaining trust in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Protecting Against Digital Asset Theft: What Can Be Done? For users and projects alike, vigilance is key in the face of ongoing threats. While the actions of the Infini hacker remind us of the risks, they also highlight the importance of proactive security measures. Enhancing crypto security is a collective responsibility. For individuals: Always use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA). Be wary of phishing attempts and suspicious links. Store significant amounts of crypto in hardware wallets (cold storage). For projects: Prioritize comprehensive security audits by reputable firms. Establish bug bounty programs to incentivize ethical hackers to find vulnerabilities. Implement real-time monitoring systems to detect unusual activity. These steps can significantly reduce the risk of digital asset theft and protect valuable holdings. Conclusion: A Continuous Battle for Crypto Security The actions of the Infini hacker serve as a stark reminder that the battle for crypto security is ongoing. As the crypto market matures and experiences an Ethereum price surge , so too do the methods of those seeking to exploit its vulnerabilities. The constant threat of stolen crypto and digital asset theft demands continuous innovation in security protocols and heightened awareness from all participants. By prioritizing robust security practices and fostering a culture of vigilance, we can collectively work towards a safer and more secure digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is the Infini hacker? The Infini hacker is an unidentified individual or group responsible for stealing $49.5 million from the stablecoin neobank project Infini on February 24. Q2: How much ETH did the Infini hacker recently sell? The Infini hacker recently sold 1,771 ETH, valued at $7.44 million at the time of the transaction, according to Lookonchain.

49889952,https://invezz.com/?p=2832911,1754876607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,3 reasons analysts expect Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to hit $3 by 2026,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/11/3-reasons-analysts-expect-mutuum-finance-mutm-to-hit-3-by-2026/,"Investor interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining momentum, fueled by its impressive presale performance and growing community support. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $14.25 million, with 15% of tokens already sold and more than 15,000 holders worldwide. At a discounted price of $0.035 per token, the window to buy in before the inevitable 15% price increase to $0.040 is closing quickly. This phase represents one of the last affordable entry points before MUTM enters global exchange listings, positioning itself for widespread adoption and significant price appreciation. Beta launch and real-world utility set to propel demand One of the strongest factors driving analyst confidence in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s future value is the upcoming beta launch of its platform, expected around the token listing phase. This launch will give users direct access to Mutuum’s innovative DeFi features, including staking of mtTokens, Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, and stablecoin borrowing. By allowing users to actively participate in these functions, the platform will transform MUTM from a speculative asset into a vital component of a functioning financial ecosystem. The beta release will ignite real-world utility by attracting diverse users seeking to earn competitive yields on Bitcoin (BTC) deposits through P2C lending at rates like 7.9% APY, or negotiating high-interest P2P loans denominated in stablecoins with flexible terms. As more participants engage with the platform’s lending and staking mechanics, demand for MUTM tokens will grow organically. Staking mtTokens in the smart contracts for dividend rewards in MUTM, linked to future protocol buybacks, further enhances token value, creating an ecosystem where usage directly supports price appreciation. Layer-2 integration will drive scalability and cost efficiency Another major catalyst for MUTM’s projected surge is the deployment of its Layer-2 blockchain solution. This upgrade is designed to solve the critical challenges that limit many Layer-1 platforms, namely, slow transactions and high fees. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Layer-2 integration will enable lightning-fast processing speeds and significantly lower costs for users conducting lending, borrowing, and staking activities. This improvement in scalability will make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) highly competitive, attracting users who otherwise might avoid DeFi due to excessive gas fees and sluggish performance on networks like Ethereum (ETH) mainnet. Increased platform usage naturally leads to more borrowing, lending, and staking activity, driving demand for MUTM tokens required to participate in the ecosystem. Layer-2’s efficiency will ensure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains accessible to a broad range of investors and borrowers, setting the stage for rapid adoption and token value growth. Roadmap progress and major exchange listings will boost visibility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has demonstrated consistent progress through its detailed roadmap, with the first phase largely complete and the second phase well underway. These achievements reflect the team’s commitment to delivering on promises, instilling confidence among investors and users alike. As the project advances, it is poised to gain listings on major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC. Listing on these top-tier platforms will expose MUTM to institutional investors and a global retail audience, vastly increasing liquidity and trading volume. This increased visibility will bolster trust in the token, as investors value projects that meet rigorous listing standards and offer secure, audited smart contracts. The recent CertiK audit, which awarded Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a high score of 95 on its token scan and 78 on the Skynet security system, further underscores the platform’s commitment to security and transparency. These factors combine to create a favorable environment for sustained price appreciation and long-term growth. Proven gains and massive upside potential The investment case for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already being validated by early participants. One investor who diversified from Bitcoin and Ethereum into MUTM during the initial Phase 1 presale at $0.01 has realized a 250% gain at the current Phase 6 price of $0.035. This example highlights how early strategic entry can multiply returns as the project advances. Looking ahead, analysts forecast a 10x price increase following the token’s listing on major exchanges, driven by expanding utility, Layer-2 efficiency, and growing user activity on the platform. This would bring MUTM’s value close to $3 by 2026—a monumental leap from current presale prices. With such strong fundamentals, robust security measures, and a clear roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to become one of the most profitable investments in the DeFi space. For investors who recognize the importance of timing, the current Phase 6 price point of $0.035 is a rare opportunity. The impending 15% price bump to $0.040 and the limited number of tokens available at this stage create a sense of urgency. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to hit key milestones, launch its beta, and expand exchange listings, MUTM’s growth trajectory is set to accelerate, making it an essential token to watch and acquire now.

The company, known for its strategic focus on Ethereum within its treasury, appears to have deployed the entirety of its recently raised $200 million funding into the leading altcoin over the past weekend. This bold Ethereum investment highlights a growing trend of corporate entities integrating digital assets into their financial strategies. Unpacking the SharpLink ETH Purchase: What the On-Chain Data Reveals? SharpLink Gaming, a prominent Nasdaq-listed company, recently completed a $200 million direct public offering on August 8. At the time, the company explicitly stated its intention to use the entire proceeds to acquire Ethereum. Over the past weekend, on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X (formerly Twitter) provided compelling evidence suggesting this commitment was fulfilled. A new wallet address reportedly withdrew 52,809 ETH, valued at approximately $220 million, from Coinbase Prime. This substantial sum was then distributed across eight different wallets. These wallets are reportedly designated for staking, indicating a long-term holding strategy. Crucially, one of these wallets is believed to be owned by SharpLink, aligning with their stated intent for a significant SharpLink ETH purchase . This on-chain activity provides a transparent look into how such large-scale corporate investments are executed in the digital asset space. Furthermore, it reinforces the growing confidence in Ethereum as a viable treasury asset. Why is Institutional Crypto Adoption on the Rise? The decision by SharpLink Gaming to funnel such a large sum into Ethereum is not an isolated incident. We are witnessing an accelerating trend of institutional crypto adoption as more companies explore the benefits of holding digital assets. Several factors contribute to this shift: Diversification: Companies seek to diversify their treasury holdings beyond traditional fiat currencies and bonds. Inflation Hedge: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, are increasingly viewed as potential hedges against inflation. Growth Potential: The long-term growth prospects of leading cryptocurrencies like Ethereum attract forward-thinking corporations. Technological Innovation: Investing in foundational blockchain assets aligns companies with future technological advancements. This embrace by publicly traded companies like SharpLink adds a layer of legitimacy and stability to the broader crypto market. It signals that digital assets are maturing beyond speculative instruments into legitimate components of corporate balance sheets. Exploring the Impact of Corporate ETH Treasury Strategy SharpLink’s move underscores a significant shift towards an active ETH treasury strategy among corporations. Rather than simply holding cash, companies are strategically allocating capital to assets that offer both potential appreciation and utility. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem, smart contract capabilities, and upcoming scalability enhancements, presents a compelling case for such strategies. The impact of increased corporate crypto holdings can be far-reaching: Market Stability: Large, long-term holdings by institutions can reduce volatility. Ecosystem Growth: Corporate investment can spur further development within the Ethereum ecosystem. Regulatory Clarity: As more institutions engage, it may encourage clearer regulatory frameworks. Investor Confidence: Such investments can boost confidence among retail and institutional investors alike. The deliberate and transparent nature of SharpLink’s acquisition provides a template for other companies considering similar ventures. It demonstrates a sophisticated approach to managing corporate assets in an evolving financial landscape. SharpLink Gaming’s estimated $200 million SharpLink ETH purchase over the weekend marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing narrative of institutional involvement in cryptocurrency. This significant Ethereum investment , confirmed by on-chain analysis, highlights a growing confidence among Nasdaq-listed companies in digital assets as a core component of their financial strategy. As institutional crypto adoption continues to expand, we can anticipate further shifts in corporate treasury management, cementing the role of digital currencies like Ethereum in the global financial ecosystem. This strategic move by SharpLink is a testament to the increasing mainstream acceptance and utility of blockchain technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is SharpLink Gaming?

The meeting follows a dramatic public demand by President Donald Trump last week for Tan’s immediate resignation. Trump accused the 65-year-old executive of being “highly conflicted” because of his deep investment ties to Chinese technology and manufacturing companies. Several of those firms, according to reports , have alleged links to China’s military sector . In remarks at a rally in Michigan, the president suggested that American technology firms must be led by — as he put it — “loyal Americans” who have “divided interests.” He cast the subject as a matter of national security, telling the crowd that Tan had “put America’s chip industry on notice” with his history in business. The rare direct rebuke from a sitting president rattled Wall Street. The comments saw Intel shares tumble more than 3% in just a few hours. According to analysts, it is one of the most forceful demonstrations of political pressure on a major American tech firm in recent years. Intel, once the undisputed leader in chipmaking, is already grappling with fierce competition from Taiwan’s TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung. The company’s challenges come as Washington intensifies its high-tech rivalry with Beijing, imposing strict export controls on cutting-edge semiconductors and AI chips. Tan counters and plans White House visit Tan, a Malaysian-born Chinese American, took over as Intel CEO earlier this year after a decades-long career in the semiconductor industry. He previously led Cadence Design Systems for 13 years and later served on Intel’s board before being appointed chief executive. Sources told The Wall Street Journal that Tan will use the meeting with Trump to defend his record and personal integrity. He plans to share details about his life story, his immigration to the U.S., and his belief in strengthening America’s technology base. The CEO will also outline Intel’s strategic role in the U.S. economy. That includes reopening domestic chip plants, boosting supply chains, and investing in advanced research hubs across the United States. Those briefed on the matter say Tan plans to suggest avenues for how Intel and the government can more closely cooperate, ranging from workforce training initiatives to collaborations in cutting-edge AI research. In a brief public statement last week, Tan said he shared the president’s commitment to U.S. national and economic security, and added that Intel would continue to serve as a trusted partner to the United States government. Intel strengthens national security commitments The pressure on Tan intensified after Reuters reported in April that he had invested more than $200 million in hundreds of Chinese advanced manufacturing and chip companies. Some of these firms were later linked to Chinese defense and military projects. Tan’s earlier leadership of Cadence Design Systems has also come under scrutiny. In 2021, the company was found to have sold software to a Chinese military university believed to be involved in simulating nuclear explosions. Last month, Cadence agreed to plead guilty and pay over $140 million to resolve U.S. criminal charges over those sales. Tan was not personally charged, but critics say the episode raises questions about his oversight and decision-making. Security analysts warn that the U.S. cannot afford to overlook potential risks in the semiconductor sector. Chips are essential to consumer electronics and vital for defense systems, satellites, and artificial intelligence applications. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Token 6900 & Bitcoin Hyper Gain Strengthen,https://thecoinrise.com/cold-wallets-presale-rockets-to-5-85m-in-record-time-token-6900-bitcoin-hyper-gain-strengthen/,"True ownership matters most when it brings real rewards. While MAXI Doge and Little Pepe deliver value through community rewards, staking systems, and cost-saving tools, their benefits remain in the growth phase. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, goes further by already operating with a live product that gives cashback on actual transactions. With every gas fee, swap, or fiat transfer, users receive CWT, the native currency of Cold Wallet , while referrals add both instant and long-term earnings. In a presale season filled with speculation, Cold Wallet distinguishes itself by tying its currency value directly to actions people already take, creating a setup where use brings measurable returns from day one. Cold Wallet Presale Proves Real Utility and ROI in the Crypto Presale 2025 Space In the current presale stage 17, Cold Wallet delivers something many projects cannot: a fully functioning platform that actively fuels demand for CWT through ongoing real-world use. While others rely on promises for the future, Cold Wallet’s system already works, rewarding holders for common crypto actions such as paying gas fees, making swaps, or moving funds between on-chain and off-chain accounts. These actions automatically earn cashback in CWT. The referral system is also live, paying in USDT now and in CWT during the presale, creating both short-term and long-term benefits for users. This is not a model on paper but a working structure where value is tied directly to product usage. As of now, Cold Wallet’s presale has secured over $5.85 million, with CWT priced at $0.00998 and a confirmed listing price of $0.3517. This sets up a potential ROI exceeding 3,600% based on the present price. Crucially, this gain potential is backed by a working self-custody wallet designed for repeated real use. Cold Wallet requires no staking, lock-ins, or complex rules. Simply holding and using the wallet creates value. As more users engage with it, demand for CWT rises, forming a steady loop between product use and growth potential. MAXI Doge’s Features Support Strong Growth and Price Forecast MAXI Doge builds credibility through its practical features, which help maintain value over time. Its staking system offers variable APYs up to 700%, encouraging longer holding periods and regular platform activity. Other benefits include weekly contests, leaderboard incentives, and future plans for futures trading and decentralized exchange integration. These features support ongoing engagement, making value growth an outcome of active participation rather than passive holding. In terms of projections, MAXI Doge’s price outlook is shaped by community use and feature releases. Estimates suggest the price could reach $0.0016 to $0.0033 by 2025 if adoption continues steadily, reflecting its structural strengths over market speculation. Little Pepe’s Capabilities Strengthen Price Expectations Little Pepe (LILpepe) focuses on delivering dependable features that encourage trust and consistent usage. Operating as a Layer-2 blockchain compatible with Ethereum, it provides low-cost transactions, quick processing, and a tax-free trading system. Added protections like anti-sniper tech, renounced ownership, and locked liquidity to boost credibility. These elements support LILpepe’s price potential, with forecasts suggesting a rise to between $0.0045 and $0.01 by late 2025 based on current adoption trends. Stronger projections, assuming further utility development and ecosystem activity, see the price possibly reaching $0.10 to $0.25. Final Say Sustained value comes from more than promises. Although MAXI Doge and Little Pepe offer features tied to usage, they are still in earlier stages. Cold Wallet operates today as a working self-custody system that rewards every gas fee, swap, and fiat move. With active CWT rewards and a clear referral system, Cold Wallet delivers immediate benefits while also ensuring future potential. In the crypto presale 2025 market, it stands out as a platform where the product functions now, the rewards are active, and the potential return is grounded in actual use.

Recently, a prominent Hyperliquid whale known as AguilaTrades experienced a notable event, highlighting the intense nature of high-stakes digital asset trading. This incident involved a substantial ETH short position , which led to a considerable setback, yet the larger narrative reveals a different story of resilience and profit. What Happened with the Hyperliquid Whale’s ETH Short Position? Early this morning, the crypto community observed a significant move from AguilaTrades, a known Hyperliquid whale . The trader nearly closed out a highly leveraged 25x ETH short position. This particular trade resulted in a staggering significant trading loss of $696,000 within a mere 24 hours. The position involved a 25x leverage, amplifying both potential gains and losses. The immediate impact was a reduction of their open positions to just $386,000. This event underscores the inherent risks associated with such high-leverage trades in volatile markets. Understanding Leveraged Crypto Trading Risks The case of AguilaTrades offers a compelling look into the world of leveraged crypto trading . Leveraging allows traders to control a large amount of cryptocurrency with a relatively small amount of capital. While this can magnify profits, it also exponentially increases the risk of a significant trading loss , as seen with the Hyperliquid whale’s ETH short. It is crucial for anyone engaging in leveraged trading to understand the mechanisms: Magnified Exposure: A small price movement can lead to large profits or losses. Liquidation Risk: If the market moves against a leveraged position significantly, the exchange can automatically close the position to prevent further losses, often resulting in total loss of collateral. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, making leveraged positions particularly risky. The Bigger Picture: Crypto Whale Profits vs. Losses Despite the recent $696,000 hit, it’s essential to put this significant trading loss into perspective. According to on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X, AguilaTrades had previously earned more than $11.3 million from earlier short trades. This substantial buffer of crypto whale profits allowed the trader to absorb the recent setback without catastrophic consequences. This situation illustrates a key aspect of professional trading: Successful traders often experience losses, but their overall strategy aims for net profitability. A large capital base provides the flexibility to withstand drawdowns. The ability to manage risk and recover from losses is paramount for long-term success. Even with this recent dip, the overall trajectory for this Hyperliquid whale remains firmly in the green, demonstrating a sophisticated approach to managing an ETH short position and other trades. Lessons from a Significant Trading Loss The experience of AguilaTrades, while dramatic, provides valuable lessons for all participants in the crypto market, especially concerning leveraged crypto trading . It reinforces the idea that even the most successful traders face downturns, but robust risk management and a diversified portfolio of strategies can mitigate the impact of a significant trading loss . Key takeaways include: Risk Management is King: Always understand your exposure, especially with leverage. Long-Term View: Individual losses are part of the game; focus on overall profitability. Capital Preservation: Ensure you have sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue trading. In conclusion, the recent $696,000 loss by the Hyperliquid whale AguilaTrades on an ETH short position serves as a stark reminder of crypto market volatility. However, the broader context of their multi-million dollar crypto whale profits underscores the strategic prowess required to navigate these waters successfully. It’s a testament to how even major setbacks can be absorbed when a strong financial foundation and smart trading strategies are in place, particularly in the realm of leveraged crypto trading . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a “Hyperliquid whale”? A “Hyperliquid whale” refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of cryptocurrency on the Hyperliquid exchange, enabling them to make significant trades that can influence market prices. AguilaTrades is an example of such a prominent trader. 2. What does an “ETH short position” mean? An ETH short position is a trading strategy where a trader borrows Ethereum (ETH) and sells it, expecting its price to fall. If the price drops, they buy it back at a lower price, return the borrowed ETH, and profit from the difference. If the price rises, they incur a loss. 3. How does 25x leveraged crypto trading work? 25x leveraged crypto trading means a trader can open a position 25 times larger than their initial capital. For example, with $1,000, they can control $25,000 worth of crypto. While this can amplify profits, it also means a small percentage move against the position can lead to a complete loss of the initial capital (liquidation). 4. How can a trader absorb a “significant trading loss” like $696,000? A trader can absorb a significant trading loss if they have a much larger overall capital base or have accumulated substantial profits from previous trades. In AguilaTrades’ case, their prior earnings of over $11.3 million provided a large buffer to cover the $696,000 loss, allowing them to remain highly profitable overall. 5. Are “crypto whale profits” common? Crypto whale profits can be substantial due to the large capital these traders deploy and their ability to influence market movements. However, they also face significant risks, and not all whale trades result in profits. Success often comes from sophisticated strategies, risk management, and deep market understanding.

ADA is moving back toward the $0.76 resistance zone, while HBAR edges closer to a potential breakout point. Still, the main spotlight is on BlockDAG (BDAG) . With its presale ending soon at $0.0016 ahead of a 17× price change, and live product showcases running, it is holding the top position for August. This mix of short-term ADA gains, upward pressure for HBAR, and the final stage for BlockDAG’s presale has created a key moment for traders balancing chart setups with limited-time entry points. ADA Tests Resistance Around $0.75 Cardano’s latest push came after touching a 24-hour low of $0.7296. Buyers stepped in, lifting the price by 2.37% to $0.7509, setting up another attempt at the $0.7550 resistance. This price level has acted as a barrier in recent sessions, and breaking above it with stronger volume could trigger a move toward the recent high of $0.7601 or more. Short-term trading has shown a series of higher lows on the 15-minute chart, pointing to a slow shift toward buyer control. Even so, sellers are still active, with 53.24% of current market activity leaning to the sell side. If momentum weakens, ADA could stay in a range between $0.7420 and $0.7520. The coming sessions will show if ADA can clear the $0.7550 resistance and turn short-term optimism into a stronger rally. Many will be watching for a volume spike as the sign of a confirmed breakout. HBAR Approaches Key Breakout Zone Hedera has bounced sharply from its 100% Fibonacci extension level at $0.23459, with deeper support found between $0.22460 and $0.22052. The price is now testing a descending trendline near $0.254, matching the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.25044. Technical signals lean bullish. Elliott Wave analysis suggests a completed wave (4) retracement, with a fresh impulsive wave possibly underway. On the 1-hour chart, a golden cross has appeared as the 50-period moving average crosses above the 100-period moving average, which can indicate more upside ahead. HBAR reached $0.2552 before facing rejection, showing strong resistance still in place. Trading volume remains above $417 million, yet repeated pushbacks at $0.254–$0.255 show market hesitation. A confirmed close over this level could open the move toward $0.28–$0.30, while a drop under $0.240 could see a return to the $0.225–$0.234 range. BlockDAG Holds the Top Spot in Trending Rankings While ADA and HBAR are getting short bursts of technical focus, BlockDAG is leading the trending lists for different reasons. Its presale is now in the final stage, with the $0.0016 Global Launch price set to close on August 11. After that, the price will rise to the Batch 29 rate of $0.0276, a 1,625% jump, before moving toward the confirmed launch price of $0.05. With more than $368 million raised, its momentum is shaped by urgency and consistent product rollouts. The release of Dashboard V4 has added a new layer of presale clarity by simulating a live exchange setup. Users can view real-time BDAG charts, make instant buy and sell orders, check order book activity, and track referral progress. Added gamified tools like leaderboards and bonus calculators keep participation active. The presale also carries extra appeal from the ongoing 10 BTC Auction, where every purchase before August 11 is entered for a chance to win a share of Bitcoin. Buying more increases the chances of winning. BlockDAG’s ecosystem is already showing practical use. The X1 and X10 Live Demo displayed mining hardware and mobile integration, with the X10 producing up to 200 BDAG daily compared to 20 from the X1 app. Sports tie-ups with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas bring NFT fan experiences, digital collectibles, and interactive content to rugby and cricket followers worldwide. With 20 confirmed exchange listings, a hybrid blockchain-DAG design for high-speed transactions, and more than 2.5 million X1 users, BlockDAG is already functioning like a live network ahead of its market debut. Market Watch: ADA, HBAR, and BlockDAG Cardano and Hedera are testing near-term resistance zones that could shape their next trading phases. ADA’s test is breaking through $0.7550 with solid momentum, while HBAR’s breakout depends on holding above the $0.254–$0.255 range. These setups have placed them on the top trending crypto list, yet their moves are tied to chart momentum and trader activity. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is trending for reasons outside of price charts. Its $0.0016 Global Launch release price, set to close in a matter of days, is creating time-driven urgency. Alongside live mining showcases, exchange-ready systems, sports collaborations, and gamified presale tools, BDAG’s rise is powered by both operational output and market attention. For those following ADA and HBAR, the next step will be dictated by technical performance. For BlockDAG, the key factor is time, and the countdown is close to ending.

There’s a significant South Korea crypto investment surge, as these savvy individuals are making a decisive pivot away from conventional U.S. big tech shares. Instead, they are embracing crypto-related stocks , especially those with a strong connection to the burgeoning stablecoin theme . This notable investor shift highlights a growing appetite for digital assets and the innovative companies behind them. Understanding the Bold Investor Shift in South Korea What exactly is driving this dramatic change in investment strategy? According to a recent report from the Korea Center for International Finance, cited by Yonhap News, a key catalyst is the passage of the U.S. Genius Act. This legislation appears to have ignited greater confidence and interest in cryptocurrency investments, with a particular emphasis on the stablecoin sector. The numbers truly tell the story of this dynamic change: In January, the share of crypto-related stocks among the top 50 net purchases by individual investors stood at a modest 8.5%. By June, this figure had dramatically climbed to an impressive 36.5%. In July, while slightly adjusting, it remained robust at 31.4%, showcasing sustained interest. This consistent growth underscores a fundamental re-evaluation of investment portfolios, moving towards the exciting potential of digital assets . Why the Focus on the Stablecoin Theme? The emphasis on the stablecoin theme is particularly intriguing. Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility by being pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar, offer a perceived layer of stability within the often-volatile crypto market. This characteristic likely appeals to investors seeking exposure to the crypto space with potentially lower risk compared to more volatile cryptocurrencies. Leading the charge in June was Circle Internet, the issuer of USDC, which stands as the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Its top ranking in net purchases signals strong investor confidence in its role within the digital economy. This focus on stablecoin issuers highlights a strategic approach to South Korea crypto investment , favoring foundational elements of the crypto ecosystem. Expanding Horizons: Beyond Stablecoins to Crypto-Related Stocks The investor shift isn’t solely confined to stablecoins. By July, the diversification of purchases became even more apparent. Five of the top ten net buys were significant players in the broader crypto ecosystem. These included major cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase, which provide crucial infrastructure for trading digital assets, and firms like Bitmain, known for their involvement in Ethereum-holding and mining operations. This broader embrace of crypto-related stocks indicates that South Korean investors are not just looking at stablecoins for stability but are also keen on gaining exposure to the wider growth of the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries. This comprehensive approach to digital assets reflects a maturing understanding of the sector’s diverse opportunities. What Does This Mean for Future Investment Trends? This significant South Korea crypto investment trend could signal a broader shift in global investment strategies. As regulatory frameworks evolve and the utility of stablecoins and other digital assets becomes clearer, more investors may consider rebalancing their portfolios. This movement from established tech giants to innovative crypto firms represents a bold vote of confidence in the future of decentralized finance and blockchain technology. However, it is crucial for investors to remain informed. While the potential for growth in crypto-related stocks is appealing, the market can be volatile. Understanding the underlying technology, regulatory developments, and market dynamics remains paramount for navigating this evolving landscape successfully. In conclusion, the compelling investor shift by South Korean individuals from U.S. big tech to crypto-related stocks , particularly those aligned with the stablecoin theme , marks a pivotal moment. Fuelled by legislative developments like the U.S. Genius Act, this trend underscores a growing conviction in the long-term potential of digital assets . It’s a clear indication that the future of investment is increasingly digital, diverse, and dynamic. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is driving the South Korea crypto investment trend? The primary drivers are a strategic pivot by individual investors away from U.S. big tech, increased interest in crypto-related stocks, especially those linked to the stablecoin theme, and the influence of the U.S. Genius Act. Which types of crypto-related stocks are South Korean investors buying? Initially, there was a strong focus on stablecoin issuers like Circle Internet (USDC). More recently, the purchases have diversified to include major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and firms involved in holding or mining Ethereum, like Bitmain. What is the U.S. Genius Act, and how does it impact this investor shift? The article mentions the U.S. Genius Act as a catalyst fueling crypto investment, particularly centered on the stablecoin theme. While the specific details of this act aren’t elaborated here, its passage appears to have boosted confidence and interest in the crypto sector among South Korean investors. Are stablecoins considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies? Yes, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. This makes them generally less volatile than unpegged cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, appealing to investors seeking more predictable exposure to the crypto market. What should investors consider before investing in crypto-related stocks? Investors should conduct thorough research, understand the inherent volatility and risks of the crypto market, stay informed about regulatory changes, and consider their personal risk tolerance. Diversification and a long-term perspective are often recommended. Did you find this article insightful?

The world of cryptocurrency is full of fascinating paradoxes, and one of the most intriguing developments currently captivating analysts is the unexpected behavior of Ethereum funding . While Ethereum (ETH) has enjoyed a robust spot price rally, a recent observation by crypto news outlet ZeroHedge on X highlights a surprising trend: implied funding levels for ETH in the derivatives market have actually declined. This divergence raises important questions about underlying market sentiment and the influence of strategic moves by large players, hinting that perhaps, ‘the move is just starting.’ What’s Happening with Ethereum Funding Dynamics? In the fast-paced crypto derivatives market, ‘funding rates’ are crucial. They represent periodic payments exchanged between long and short traders to keep the perpetual contract price close to the spot price. When implied Ethereum funding levels drop, it often signals an increase in bearish sentiment or a surge in traders taking ETH short positions . ZeroHedge specifically noted that despite the gains in Ethereum’s spot prices, this decline in funding levels reflects a significant growth in ETH short positions from leveraged funds over the past year. This situation presents a clear contrast: while the spot market shows strength, the derivatives market hints at underlying skepticism or strategic hedging. It’s a classic case of the futures market potentially signaling a different story than the immediate spot price action. Why Are ETH Short Positions Growing? The increase in ETH short positions can stem from various factors. Some traders might be hedging existing spot holdings, protecting against potential downturns. Others might simply believe that the recent Ethereum price rally is unsustainable and anticipate a correction. Moreover, large institutional players or ‘leveraged funds’ often employ complex strategies, which might involve taking short positions to balance their portfolios or capitalize on perceived inefficiencies within the crypto derivatives market . Consider these possibilities: Hedging Strategies: Large holders might short ETH to protect their long-term spot investments from volatility. Bearish Outlook: Some believe ETH is overvalued despite its recent gains, expecting a correction. Arbitrage Opportunities: Sophisticated traders might exploit price differences between spot and futures markets, using short positions as part of a broader strategy. This strategic accumulation of short interest within the derivatives market suggests a calculated move rather than pure panic, indicating a nuanced approach by significant players. The Paradox: Ethereum Price Rally vs. Funding Declines The juxtaposition of a strong Ethereum price rally and falling implied funding rates is indeed puzzling for many observers. Normally, a rising spot price would lead to higher funding rates as more traders go long, paying shorts to maintain their positions. However, the current scenario suggests that the buying pressure in the spot market is not being fully mirrored by bullish sentiment in the derivatives space. This could indicate a few things: The spot rally is driven by different factors than derivatives sentiment, such as retail accumulation versus institutional hedging. Large players are actively building short positions, potentially anticipating a future pullback or using them as a strategic hedge against other long exposures. ZeroHedge’s concise statement, ‘The move is just starting,’ further emphasizes the potential for these diverging trends to intensify. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor these dynamics closely for understanding future ETH market trends . Navigating Future ETH Market Trends Understanding these complex dynamics is key to navigating future ETH market trends . The persistent growth of ETH short positions , despite the spot market’s resilience, could signal a brewing storm or simply a sophisticated rebalancing by major players. Traders and investors should pay close attention to both on-chain data and derivatives metrics to gain a comprehensive view. What does this mean for you? Stay Informed: Continuously monitor funding rates and open interest in the derivatives market to gauge shifts in sentiment. Diversify: Consider diversifying your portfolio, especially with such conflicting signals, to mitigate potential risks. Risk Management: Be prepared for potential volatility, as these divergent signals could lead to sharper price movements in either direction. This unique market behavior underscores the importance of a holistic view, looking beyond just spot prices to grasp the full picture of market sentiment and strategic positioning within the broader crypto ecosystem. In conclusion, the current divergence between Ethereum’s spot rally and declining implied funding levels, driven by growing ETH short positions , presents a compelling narrative in the crypto space. It highlights the intricate dance between different market segments and the strategic maneuvers of large funds within the crypto derivatives market . As ZeroHedge aptly put it, ‘The move is just starting,’ suggesting that we are witnessing the early stages of a significant market development that could shape future Ethereum funding dynamics and broader ETH market trends . Staying vigilant and informed will be paramount for anyone participating in this exciting, yet complex, ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are Ethereum funding levels? Funding levels, or funding rates, are periodic payments exchanged between long and short traders in perpetual futures contracts. They help keep the contract price pegged to the spot price of Ethereum. Positive funding means longs pay shorts, while negative funding means shorts pay longs. Q2: Why are ETH short positions increasing despite a price rally? ETH short positions can increase due to various reasons, including hedging strategies by large holders, a bearish outlook on the sustainability of the rally, or sophisticated arbitrage opportunities exploited by leveraged funds in the derivatives market. Q3: How does this divergence impact the Ethereum market? This divergence suggests conflicting sentiments between the spot and derivatives markets. It could indicate potential future volatility, as large short positions might either be squeezed (leading to a sharp price increase) or validated (leading to a price decline) if the spot rally loses momentum. Q4: Should investors be concerned about this trend? While it’s not necessarily a direct cause for alarm, investors should be aware of this trend. It highlights underlying market complexities and strategic positioning by large players. Monitoring these signals can help in making more informed trading and investment decisions. Q5: What is the crypto derivatives market? The crypto derivatives market allows traders to speculate on the future price of cryptocurrencies without owning the underlying asset. It includes instruments like futures, options, and perpetual contracts, which can be used for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage. Q6: What does ‘The move is just starting’ imply? This phrase suggests that the current divergence between Ethereum’s spot price and funding levels is not a temporary anomaly but potentially the beginning of a more significant, evolving market trend. It implies that the impact of these growing short positions could become more pronounced over time. Did you find this analysis helpful?

A remarkable forecast from the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket suggests a highly optimistic future for ETH. This platform, known for its market-driven probabilities, has unveiled some compelling figures that are sure to capture the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. What Does Polymarket’s Ethereum Price Prediction Mean? Polymarket, a leading decentralized prediction market, recently made headlines with its bold Ethereum price prediction . The platform assigns a staggering 96% probability that Ethereum (ETH) will exceed the $4,400 mark in 2025. This isn’t just a casual guess; it’s a reflection of aggregated market sentiment on a platform where users bet real money on future events. Such high confidence levels from a prediction market often indicate strong underlying belief among participants. Currently, Ethereum is trading around $4,306.87, showing a slight increase of 0.13% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data . This proximity to the $4,400 threshold makes Polymarket’s projection particularly intriguing. It suggests that market participants widely expect ETH to not only reach but comfortably surpass this level within the next year. Delving Deeper: ETH Price Target Milestones Beyond the immediate $4,400 target, Polymarket’s data paints an even broader picture of potential growth for Ethereum. The platform provides further insights into more ambitious ETH price target milestones: $5,000 Mark: There’s a 74% likelihood that ETH will reach $5,000. This significant psychological barrier is seen as highly probable by the market. $6,000 Mark: The probability for ETH hitting $6,000 stands at 48%. While less certain than $5,000, nearly half of Polymarket participants believe this is achievable. $7,000 Mark: A 30% chance is assigned to ETH reaching $7,000. This indicates a notable segment of the market anticipates substantial growth. These figures highlight a tiered expectation, where the closer targets carry higher probabilities, as one might expect. Nevertheless, even the higher targets show considerable market confidence, indicating a bullish sentiment across the board for Ethereum’s future. Why This Optimistic Cryptocurrency Forecast? What factors might be driving such an optimistic cryptocurrency forecast for Ethereum? Several elements likely contribute to this positive outlook. Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, its pivotal role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and various Web3 applications, all play a significant part. The ongoing developments and upgrades to the Ethereum network are continuously enhancing its scalability, security, and efficiency. Moreover, increasing institutional interest and broader adoption of blockchain technology could also fuel this growth. As more enterprises and developers build on Ethereum, demand for ETH, which powers these operations, naturally increases. This fundamental utility, combined with its strong community and developer base, forms a solid foundation for future price appreciation. Navigating the ETH Market Outlook Understanding the current ETH market outlook requires considering both these optimistic predictions and the inherent volatility of the crypto space. While Polymarket’s data offers valuable insights into collective market sentiment, it’s crucial for investors to remember that predictions are not guarantees. The crypto market is influenced by a myriad of factors, including global economic conditions, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. However, the high probabilities from Polymarket do provide a strong signal of confidence. For those looking at Ethereum, this prediction suggests that the consensus leans heavily towards continued upward momentum. It encourages a closer look at Ethereum’s fundamentals and its position as a leading blockchain platform. Conclusion: A Bullish Path Ahead for Ethereum? The latest Polymarket prediction paints a decidedly bullish picture for Ethereum’s trajectory in 2025. With a 96% chance of ETH surpassing $4,400 and significant probabilities for even higher targets like $5,000 and $6,000, the collective sentiment is clear: the market anticipates substantial growth for Ethereum. This optimism stems from ETH’s foundational role in the decentralized economy and its continuous evolution. While past performance does not guarantee future results, these projections from a decentralized prediction market offer a unique lens into what the informed crypto community expects. As Ethereum continues to innovate and expand its influence, many believe its journey towards new all-time highs is well within reach. This makes ETH a compelling asset to watch in the coming year. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Polymarket? Polymarket is a decentralized prediction market platform where users can bet on the outcomes of future events, ranging from political elections to cryptocurrency prices. The probabilities displayed on the platform reflect the collective sentiment and bets placed by its users. How does Polymarket determine its probabilities? Polymarket’s probabilities are determined by the market dynamics of its platform. When users buy shares in a particular outcome, the price of those shares moves, reflecting the perceived likelihood of that event occurring. The higher the price for a ‘yes’ outcome, the higher the implied probability. What factors could influence Ethereum’s price in 2025? Several factors could influence Ethereum’s price, including network upgrades (like scalability improvements), broader adoption of DeFi and NFTs, institutional investment, regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and overall crypto market sentiment. Is a 96% probability from Polymarket a guarantee? No, a 96% probability is not a guarantee. It represents a very strong collective belief or consensus among Polymarket’s users based on their bets. However, the crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable, and external factors can always shift outcomes. What are the key ETH price targets according to Polymarket? According to Polymarket, the key ETH price targets for 2025 are $4,400 (96% probability), $5,000 (74% probability), $6,000 (48% probability), and $7,000 (30% probability).

Their entry brings significant capital and stability, bolstering the overall BTC value . Positive Regulatory News: Favorable regulatory developments or clarity in major economies can boost investor confidence, making Bitcoin more appealing.

This confluence of factors creates a powerful upward momentum, pushing the BTC value to new heights and reinforcing its position in the global financial landscape. Understanding the Current BTC Value Momentum The current momentum suggests strong buying pressure and a positive sentiment across the cryptocurrency market . When Bitcoin experiences such a significant jump, it often creates a ripple effect, drawing more attention and capital into the ecosystem.

This hidden gem could be a bigger winner than SOL and XRP,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/11/0-035-token-with-1-target-this-hidden-gem-could-be-a-bigger-winner-than-sol-and-xrp/,"Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) have long been hailed as heavyweight players in the crypto space, celebrated for their fast transaction speeds and broad adoption. Yet, despite their prominence, these giants face increasing competition from emerging projects that combine innovation with strong utility. One such contender is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a project carving out a unique position by blending dual lending models, stablecoin integration, and rewarding staking opportunities. This innovative approach could propel MUTM to outshine SOL and XRP in the coming months, with a current presale price of just $0.035 and a realistic target of $1. Dual lending and presale momentum fuel growth potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s strength will lie in its dual lending system, which will give users two distinct ways to engage: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. P2C lending pools will allow users to deposit blue-chip cryptocurrencies and will issue mtTokens—interest-bearing tokens that will represent their stake and earning potential within the platform. In contrast, P2P lending will facilitate flexible, negotiated loans directly between individuals using a broader range of assets, including speculative altcoins. This dual approach will diversify the platform’s appeal, attracting both conservative and risk-tolerant investors. Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale with an impressive $14.25 million raised. The total token supply is capped at 4 billion, and 15% of tokens in this phase have already been sold at the stable price of $0.035. Community interest is vibrant, with over 12,000 Twitter followers actively discussing the project and its promising future. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s strong commitment to security is evident in its CertiK audit results, scoring 95 in token security and 78 on the advanced Skynet monitoring system, giving investors added confidence in the platform’s reliability. An early investor who decided to diversify by swapping part of their Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) holdings into MUTM at just $0.015 has already realized gains nearing 130% at the current presale price. Analysts project this token to achieve a staggering 30x increase to $1 within 12 to 18 months following listing. This expected surge is driven by a combination of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s upcoming beta launch, which will bring its lending and staking functionalities to life, and the Layer-2 upgrade that promises to reduce costs and enhance scalability. Beta launch, Layer-2 upgrade, and exchange listings set the stage for success The forthcoming beta launch of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will provide users with hands-on access to its lending pools and mtToken staking features. This real-time interaction will turn MUTM from a speculative token into a utility powerhouse. As users actively engage with the platform, borrowing and lending with confidence, demand for MUTM tokens is projected to increase substantially. Unlike many tokens that rely primarily on hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers concrete financial services that generate continuous interest and use case expansion. Moreover, the integration of Layer-2 technology will play a critical role in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s growth trajectory. By significantly reducing transaction fees and increasing processing speeds, Layer-2 solutions will make the platform more competitive with existing DeFi ecosystems built on Layer-1 blockchains. This scalability will attract a broader user base, eager for efficient and cost-effective decentralized finance services. As the platform expands, this seamless experience is expected to fuel token demand and support robust price appreciation. Finally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap includes planned listings on major exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC. These high-profile listings will dramatically enhance liquidity and market visibility, drawing institutional investors and mainstream traders into the ecosystem. Such exposure is crucial to unlocking MUTM’s full market potential and establishing the $1 price target as a realistic milestone based on increasing user adoption and platform utility. In conclusion, while Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) continue to dominate headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly building a foundation for greater long-term success. Its dual lending system, secure and transparent infrastructure, upcoming beta platform, Layer-2 upgrade, and strong presale momentum collectively position MUTM as a compelling investment. The token’s current price of $0.035 offers an accessible entry point for investors aiming to capitalize on this hidden gem’s journey toward a $1 valuation shortly.

As the market sentiment reverses towards innovative, utility-driven blockchain projects, the performance of MUTM is redefining what’s to come for the altcoin market. Cardano (ADA) holds at $0.74 amid mixed momentum Cardano is trading for about $0.74, holding firm against a recent 4% pullback and testing important support in the $0.68–$0.72 area. To the upside, ADA has rallied about 30% since mid‑June, breaking out above its 200-day EMA and enticing new interest toward mid‑2025 highs of $2.00 or higher. Additionally, a “Midnight Glacier” airdrop and platform upgrades have revved up developer activity and community interest. That said, rising whale sell-offs and a nearly 60% drop in trading volume suggest investors are still wary. As ADA balances these opposing pressures, market interest is gradually shifting toward cutting-edge utility-focused DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance. Dual-layer decentralized lending protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a non-custodial DeFi protocol. The project offers Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending with the overall goal of flexibility and efficiency.

49892361,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=782352,1754880144,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49892361.jpeg,"Ethereum’s price has risen above $4,300 and may overtake Bitcoin in value within a year",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-dominance-has-dipped/,"Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market is falling while Ethereum has surged past $4,300, leading many experts to predict it could overtake BTC in value within a year. Strong chart patterns and rising corporate interest add weight to the idea of a possible “flippening,” where Ethereum becomes the top cryptocurrency. Ethereum’s rapid growth comes as Bitcoin’s market dominance breaks from a trend that started in late 2022. Analyst Lark Davis notes that the last similar drop sent ETH to its all-time high of $4,900 , and with the price already above $4,000, analysts now expect an even larger rally ahead. Analysts see Ethereum’s price rising sharply in the coming months Traders, institutional investors, and analysts are convinced this could be the start of a larger, more sustained rally after Ethereum’s price rose by around 24% to trade above $4,330. Most of this optimism stems from Ethereum’s recent breakout from a long-standing Wyckoff Accumulation pattern. This extended phase sets the stage for an upward trend after the market absorbs selling pressure from sellers and weak hands before the balance of power shifts decisively toward buyers. Analyst Lord Hawkins said the move above the $4,200 resistance zone shows buyers are dominating the market, and marks what Wyckoff theory describes as a “Sign of Strength. He explains that the price may experience a modest pullback (the “Last Point of Support”) and lead to an acceleration in price gains when demand outpaces supply (the “markup” phase). Hawkins estimates that this markup phase could propel Ethereum toward a technical target of roughly $6,000 and bring fresh momentum into the broader market. Popular analysts Crypto Rover and Titan of Crypto pointed to Ethereum’s breakout from a multi-year symmetrical triangle pattern and explained that the triangle size shows a potential target of $8,000. The 2020 breakout from a similar triangle proves Ethereum can move beyond initial targets as the price rose from under $200 to over $4,000 in just over a year. Analyst Nilesh Verma pointed out that Ethereum’s recent bounce from the $1,750–$1,850 support zone resembles the price action seen in 2017 and 2020. Back then, cycles lifted Ethereum from relative lows to record-breaking highs after gains reached as high as 8,000% in a year. Verma believes Ethereum could reach at least $10,000 within the next 6 to 8 months and possibly climb to $20,000 during the same period. Falling Bitcoin share boosts talk of altcoin season and flippening Analyst Ali said “…altcoin season is officially here” after pointing out that Ethereum’s net capital change surpassed Bitcoin’s for the first time in this cycle. His comments suggest investors are willing to commit larger amounts of capital into other major cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. Ethereum $ETH net capital change has just surpassed Bitcoin $BTC . This is the clearest signal yet that altcoin season is officially here! pic.twitter.com/LNEbZ6nVOu — Ali (@ali_charts) August 10, 2025 Ethereum’s co-founder even predicted that as more businesses choose to hold ETH alongside or instead of BTC, treasury companies could push Ethereum’s market value past that of Bitcoin within the next year. Famous trader and crypto influencer Lark Davis noted that institutional buying patterns and the rise of the “ETH over BTC” narrative are becoming more visible in market discussions and investment strategies. On the other hand, CEO of JAN3 and a prominent advocate for Bitcoin adoption, Samson Mow, warned investors of the recent surge in Ethereum’s value. He says the surge in Ethereum’s value may be driven by strategic moves from large holders rather than organic, long-term demand. Mow claims that certain early Ethereum insiders and ICO participants holding significant amounts of Bitcoin are capitalizing on new narratives and market excitement. They might be rotating their BTC into ETH to push Ethereum’s price. These players could sell their ETH holdings to lock in profits and rotate their gains back into Bitcoin once the price reaches a high enough level. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The rally was driven by a massive surge in Bitcoin. Bitcoin (BTC) rocketed above the $121,500 mark, buoyed by favourable macroeconomic indicators—including potential upcoming US rate cuts—and political developments that expand institutional exposure to digital assets. Ethereum (ETH) continues to surge, now trading above $4,300, with a weekly gain estimated at 22%, driving technical sentiment bullish. The next critical resistance level lies near $4,094, with bullish momentum pointing toward targets in the $4,500–$5,000 range. XRP is holding firm around $3.26, underpinned by the US SEC’s dismissal of its legal case—a development that enhanced investor confidence. However, BlackRock’s absence from filing for an XRP ETF tempers some optimism. Solana (SOL) is trading near $184, supported by growing technical interest despite lingering infrastructure concerns. Fed official comments help sentiment Federal Reserve Vice Chair of Supervision Michelle Bowman said on Saturday that recent weak job data reinforces her concerns about labour market fragility and bolsters her view that three interest rate cuts will likely be appropriate this year. Bowman was one of two Fed governors who dissented last month against the central bank’s decision to keep short-term borrowing costs in the 4.25% to 4.50% range, where they have been since December. While most Fed officials have been cautious about lowering rates amid concerns that the Trump administration’s tariffs could hinder progress toward the Fed’s 2% inflation target, several policymakers in recent days have signalled greater openness to cuts. Bowman said acting at last week’s meeting would have helped guard against further deterioration in labour market conditions and additional weakening in economic activity. Her comments, delivered to the Kansas Bankers Association, placed greater emphasis on labour market risks than her post-meeting policy statement. Top crypto gainers and losers Ethena (ENA) led the gains with a surge of 12.54% to $0.8309, followed closely by Lido DAO (LDO), which climbed 12.32% to $1.47.

Lido DAO (LDO) also saw intraday volatility despite its daily gain, with a 3.72% hourly decline noted. MemeCore (M) fell 2.06% to $0.4661, and KuCoin Token (KCS) eased 2.12% to $11.99.

One such event that captures immediate attention is crypto perpetual futures liquidation . Over the last 24 hours, the market witnessed substantial liquidation events across major digital assets. Understanding these liquidations provides crucial insights into market sentiment and trader positioning. Let’s delve into the recent breakdown. What is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? For those new to the space, perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract in cryptocurrency trading. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. However, they involve leverage, meaning traders can control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. When a trader uses leverage, they borrow funds to amplify their potential gains. This also magnifies potential losses. Crypto liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. Essentially, the market moves against their position to a point where their collateral can no longer support the trade, leading to an automatic sell-off. This mechanism protects exchanges from incurring losses from traders who cannot meet their margin requirements. It’s a critical aspect of leveraged trading that every participant must understand to manage risk effectively. A Closer Look at the 24-Hour Liquidation Snapshot The past 24 hours revealed significant activity in the crypto perpetual futures liquidation landscape. Here’s a detailed look at the figures: Bitcoin (BTC): $120 million liquidated. A staggering 92.64% of these were short positions. This indicates that a large number of traders betting on BTC’s price decline were caught off guard as the price moved upwards, forcing their positions to close. Ethereum (ETH): $100 million liquidated. For ETH, 57.83% of the liquidations were long positions. This suggests that traders expecting ETH’s price to rise faced headwinds, leading to their leveraged long positions being closed out. XRP: $15.7 million liquidated. A significant 84.84% of these were long positions. Similar to ETH, this points to a strong correction against bullish bets on XRP. These figures paint a vivid picture of the immediate market movements and the financial impact on traders. The dominance of short liquidations for BTC and long liquidations for ETH and XRP highlights divergent price actions and trader sentiment across these assets. Why Does This Liquidation Data Matter for Traders? Understanding these liquidation patterns is vital for several reasons. Firstly, it provides insights into current market volatility . Large liquidation events often accompany significant price swings, indicating periods of heightened uncertainty or strong directional moves. Secondly, it reveals prevailing market sentiment. When short positions are heavily liquidated, it often signals an unexpected upward price movement, suggesting bullish pressure. Conversely, heavy long liquidations point to downward price pressure. Moreover, cascading liquidations can create further price momentum. When a large number of positions are forced closed, it can trigger a chain reaction, pushing prices further in the direction of the liquidation. This can amplify existing trends, making it crucial for traders to monitor these metrics. Navigating the Risks of Leveraged Trading The substantial liquidation figures underscore the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading . While leverage offers the potential for magnified profits, it also carries the risk of magnified losses, leading to rapid capital depletion. Traders often face the challenge of managing margin calls and avoiding liquidation, especially during periods of high market volatility. To mitigate these risks, it is essential to implement robust risk management strategies. This includes setting appropriate stop-loss orders, managing position sizes, and avoiding excessive leverage. Furthermore, understanding the underlying market dynamics and not relying solely on technical indicators can significantly improve trading outcomes. Always remember, the market can be unpredictable, and protecting your capital should be the top priority. What Can We Learn from Recent Crypto Liquidations? The recent crypto liquidation breakdown offers valuable lessons. It highlights that even major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are subject to sudden price reversals that can catch leveraged traders off guard. For Bitcoin, the strong short liquidation suggests a powerful upward movement, defying bearish expectations. For Ethereum and XRP, the long liquidations indicate that bullish momentum may have faltered, leading to a downside correction. These events serve as a stark reminder that while perpetual futures offer exciting opportunities, they demand meticulous risk management and a deep understanding of market forces. Traders should always prioritize capital preservation over aggressive profit-seeking, especially in volatile environments. In conclusion, the 24-hour crypto perpetual futures liquidation data provides a compelling snapshot of market dynamics. It reveals the immediate financial consequences for leveraged traders and offers critical insights into current market sentiment and price action across major cryptocurrencies. Staying informed about these trends is paramount for anyone navigating the complex world of digital asset trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Crypto perpetual futures liquidation is the automatic closing of a leveraged trading position by an exchange when a trader’s margin falls below the required maintenance level, typically due to adverse price movements. Why do liquidations occur in crypto futures trading? Liquidations occur primarily because of the use of leverage. When the market moves against a leveraged position and the trader’s collateral is insufficient to cover potential losses, the exchange liquidates the position to prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange. What does a high percentage of “short” or “long” liquidations mean? A high percentage of “short” liquidations means that many traders betting on a price decline (shorting) were forced to close their positions, usually indicating a strong upward price movement. Conversely, a high percentage of “long” liquidations means many traders betting on a price increase (longing) were forced to close, suggesting a strong downward price movement. How can traders avoid liquidation in perpetual futures? Traders can avoid liquidation by implementing robust risk management strategies, such as using stop-loss orders, managing position sizes, avoiding excessive leverage, and maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts. Are crypto perpetual futures suitable for beginners? Due to the high leverage and inherent volatility, crypto perpetual futures trading is generally considered high-risk and is often not recommended for beginners. It requires a deep understanding of market dynamics and advanced risk management skills.

Ethereum holding firm around $3.71K as institutional support increases Ethereum is priced at $3,710, ranging within the $3,650–$3,733 consolidation area. Institutional investors keep showing robust buying, and July saw record $12.8 billion of ETH ETF inflows, topped off with rising on-chain activity and whale purchases, further fueling long-term trust in Ethereum’s value proposition. ETH is respecting short-term support at $3,650, and a break above the $3,733 resistance will trigger a rally to $3,880–$4,100, with more detailed bullish forecasts envisioning highs of $4,500 to $7,000+ during the second half of 2025.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are already shaping up to be the ones to watch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands at $0.035 in phase 6 of its presale. The project promises early buyers 300%-400% gains. Mutuum Finance has already generated over $14.15 million in sales and has over 14950 investors who have bought the token.

There has recently been a 5% drop in price. Such dips are a reflection of bearish momentum amidst rotation out of overbought meme coins in the broader market. DOGE still enjoys a massive following and meme factor consideration, but investor focus increasingly turns to utility-driven DeFi players like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance begins phase 6 of its presale Mutuum Finance is showing strong performance in presale. Phase 5 recently ended early. The project is now priced at $0.035 as phase 6 gains momentum.

Polygon (POL) breakout trend watchers see price coiling at $0.22–$0.23, with on-chain metrics like 3 million daily transactions and ultra-low fees suggesting technical and operational alignment for a potential 100% run. Dogecoin (DOGE) market dip outlook traders are eyeing a $0.18 retest for liquidity before a possible surge toward $0.30, but also bracing for risk if $0.15 fails. Then there’s Cold Wallet , the best new crypto to buy right now. With a $270M Plus Wallet acquisition locking in 2M+ active users pre-launch, a live cashback rewards model, and a Stage 17 presale price of $0.00998 (3,632% ROI window to $0.3517 listing), CWT isn’t waiting for adoption, it’s already there. In a market of potential, Cold Wallet offers proof and profit. Polygon Eyes 100% Breakout as On-Chain Usage Soars Is Now the Time to Buy? Polygon (POL) is showing fresh strength after coiling within a long-term symmetrical triangle. Price action hovering between $0.22–$0.23 resistance and $0.19–$0.20 support now looks poised for a move. A confirmed breakout above $0.23, backed by volume, could spark a 100%+ rally toward $0.55. Meanwhile, the network is buzzing: over 3 million daily transactions and micro‑low fees (under $0.002) reinforce Polygon’s real utility and support a bullish trend. For investors seeking a smart entry, this setup offers a rare blend of technical timing and operational strength, making Polygon hard to ignore right now. Dogecoin at the Tipping Point – Could It Rally to $0.30 or Crash to $0.15? Dogecoin (DOGE), currently hovering near $0.20, faces a pivotal moment. Technical charts show a bullish pattern of higher highs supported by a strong demand zone, signaling potential momentum upward. Still, a dip toward $0.18 could be a deliberate move to gather liquidity before making a real push. If bulls take control, $0.30 could be within reach, especially amid growing whale accumulation and neutral sentiment. That said, any breakdown below $0.15 would invalidate the setup and signal deeper downside. For traders, this isn’t about hyp,e it’s about watching the structure and acting on the breakout. If you’re looking for a calculated entry point, now might be one of the last chances before price action makes its next big move. Cold Wallet’s $270M Acquisition Puts It Miles Ahead Before Launch Cold Wallet’s $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet is the kind of pre-launch power move rarely seen in crypto. By instantly absorbing over 2 million active users, CWT has bypassed the long, expensive battle for adoption that most projects face after going live. This isn’t just about numbers. Plus Wallet’s established infrastructure plugs directly into Cold Wallet’s cashback-driven economy, where gas, swap, and bridge fees are refunded in CWT. That means real value from day one. Even more strategically, the deal imports Plus Wallet’s sleek, user-friendly design at a time when industry giants like MetaMask and Trust Wallet face criticism for clunky interfaces. Cold Wallet is entering the market not as a newcomer but as a scaled, revenue-ready competitor. Currently in Stage 17 of its presale at $0.00998 , early buyers can still lock in a potential 3,632% ROI to its confirmed $0.3517 launch price. With live utility, a built-in user base, and a frictionless experience already in motion, the question isn’t whether Cold Wallet will attract adoption; it’s how fast. At this stage, the upside is huge, but the window is closing fast as each presale batch sells out. Takeaway Polygon (POL) may capture upside if its breakout trend clears $0.23 with conviction, but it still needs market momentum to validate the move. Dogecoin (DOGE) market dip outlook points to a bullish structure, yet whale behavior and key support at $0.15 make it a calculated risk. Cold Wallet, however, eliminates much of that uncertainty. Already backed by a $270M acquisition, 2M active users, live in-app swaps, and real-time USDT referral rewards, it is the best new crypto to buy for those seeking a blend of utility and outsized ROI. At just $0.00998 in Stage 17, its confirmed $0.3517 listing price creates a 3,632% gap but every presale batch sold narrows it. Where Polygon’s upside is technical and Dogecoin’s is speculative, Cold Wallet’s is structural, scalable, and already generating value. The market will eventually notice that the advantage lies in noticing first.

While the markets brace for an altseason, the LayerZero Foundation has introduced a proposal to purchase the Stargate bridge. Known for the cross-chain interoperability network LayerZero, the Foundation has offered Stargate DAO $110 million to acquire the bridge and discontinue the native STG coin.

A successful acquisition would mean dissolving the Stargate DAO and phasing out STG tokens, with holders swapping them for ZRO at a determined conversion rate. The proposal reads: If approved, STG holders will be informed of how to swap for ZRO. LayerZero Foundation will assume ownership and operation of all Stargate Finance duties. Stargate will continue without interruption; users of the Stargate bridge will not experience any downtime or changes in functionality during the transition. Notably, the LayerZero Foundation aims to bring an active cross-chain bridge and its control to support its long-term goals.

Alex Svanevik, the CEO of the renowned on-chain analytics platform Nansen, moved a hefty 1 million LDO tokens, valued at approximately $1.46 million, to the Coinbase Exchange. This notable LDO token transfer , reported by on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X , immediately sparked discussions and speculation among market observers. What Happened: The Alex Svanevik LDO Transfer Explained Just recently, within a span of 40 minutes, Alex Svanevik executed a major transaction. He transferred 1 million LDO, equivalent to $1.46 million, directly to Coinbase. This Alex Svanevik crypto movement is particularly interesting given his role at Nansen, a platform dedicated to providing deep insights into blockchain activity. Svanevik originally received 5 million LDO tokens from Lido in December 2020. This was likely a distribution or grant from the Lido protocol. Despite this recent deposit, he still retains a holding of 1 million LDO. This indicates a strategic decision rather than a complete divestment. Such a large Coinbase LDO transaction from a prominent figure often signals potential market shifts or personal financial strategies. The precise motivation behind this specific transaction remains private. However, its public nature allows for valuable on-chain analysis insights into the movements of significant token holders. Understanding LDO and Lido Finance’s Role in DeFi To fully grasp the significance of this event, it is essential to understand LDO and Lido Finance. LDO is the native governance token of Lido Finance, a leading liquid staking protocol. Lido allows users to stake their Ethereum (ETH) and other proof-of-stake assets. In return, users receive liquid tokens like stETH, which they can then use across various DeFi applications. This mechanism helps maintain liquidity for staked assets. The fact that a CEO deeply embedded in on-chain analysis insights is making such a move naturally draws attention. It prompts questions about the potential motivations behind this particular LDO token transfer and what it might imply for the broader LDO ecosystem or the market at large. The Implications of a Coinbase LDO Transaction When a large amount of a token like LDO is moved to an exchange, several scenarios could be at play. While we cannot definitively state the exact reason for the Nansen CEO LDO deposit , common motivations include: Potential Sale: The tokens might be intended for sale on the exchange, which could add selling pressure to LDO’s market price. Enhanced Custody: Svanevik might be moving the tokens for safer or more convenient custody on a centralized exchange. This offers different security features compared to self-custody. Portfolio Rebalancing: It could be part of a broader portfolio rebalancing strategy. This involves diversifying holdings or preparing for other investments within the crypto space. Regardless of the specific reason, significant movements by well-known figures like Alex Svanevik are closely monitored by the crypto community. They often act as indicators, even if indirect, of market sentiment or future intentions. Why On-Chain Analysis Insights Matter to Investors This event perfectly illustrates the power and relevance of on-chain analysis insights . Platforms like Nansen provide crucial data that allows users to track large transactions, identify whale movements, and understand the flow of capital within the crypto ecosystem. This transparency is a cornerstone of decentralized finance. Monitoring significant transfers, such as this Alex Svanevik crypto movement, helps market participants: Gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics and liquidity. Anticipate potential price movements based on supply and demand shifts. Make more informed investment decisions based on actual blockchain activity, rather than just speculation. Nansen’s role in demystifying these complex movements through accessible data makes Svanevik’s own actions particularly scrutinized. His actions, therefore, provide a real-world example of the data Nansen itself specializes in analyzing. The recent Nansen CEO LDO deposit into Coinbase serves as a compelling reminder of how closely the crypto world watches the actions of its prominent figures. Alex Svanevik’s $1.46 million LDO token transfer highlights the continuous flow of capital in the digital asset space and the vital role of on-chain analysis in deciphering these movements. Whether this signifies a strategic sale, a portfolio adjustment, or something else entirely, such transactions underscore the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets and the importance of staying informed through reliable data sources. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who is Alex Svanevik? Alex Svanevik is the CEO of Nansen, a leading on-chain analytics platform that provides data and insights into blockchain activity for investors and researchers. 2. What is LDO? LDO is the native governance token of Lido Finance, a prominent liquid staking protocol. Holders of LDO can participate in the governance of the Lido DAO. 3. Why is the Nansen CEO LDO deposit significant? The Nansen CEO LDO deposit is significant because it involves a large sum ($1.46 million) moved by a highly influential figure in the crypto analytics space. Such movements often spark market speculation and interest in potential future actions or market trends. 4. What are common reasons for a large LDO token transfer to an exchange? Common reasons for a large LDO token transfer to an exchange include preparing for a sale, seeking enhanced custody options on a centralized exchange, or rebalancing a personal investment portfolio. 5.

Since July 10, unidentified whales and prominent institutions have collectively amassed an astonishing 1.1 million Ethereum (ETH), valued at approximately $4.78 billion. This substantial acquisition, executed at an average purchase price of roughly $3,584, highlights a strong conviction in Ethereum’s future. Currently, ETH is trading robustly at $4,308.34, showcasing a 1.36% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. This massive inflow suggests strategic positioning by major players, hinting at what could be next for the second-largest cryptocurrency. What’s Behind This Surge in Ethereum Whales? On-chain analyst @EmberCN first brought this remarkable activity to light, detailing the significant purchases. The term “whales” refers to individual or entity holders of large amounts of cryptocurrency, whose trades can significantly influence market prices. When these Ethereum whales make such substantial moves, it often signals their long-term bullish outlook. Their recent buying spree, accumulating over a million ETH, suggests they anticipate considerable appreciation in Ethereum’s value. This pattern of behavior is closely watched by retail investors and analysts alike, as it can be a precursor to broader market movements. Understanding their motivations is key to interpreting current crypto market trends . The Growing Influence of Institutional ETH Investment Beyond individual whales, the involvement of institutions in this recent ETH accumulation is particularly noteworthy. Institutional investors, typically large financial entities like hedge funds, asset managers, or corporations, bring substantial capital and often a more structured, long-term investment approach to the market. Their increasing presence in the Ethereum ecosystem validates its position as a mature and viable asset class. This significant inflow of institutional ETH capital suggests a deepening trust in Ethereum’s underlying technology and its potential for widespread adoption. It also indicates a shift from speculative trading to more fundamental, value-driven investment. Increased Legitimacy: Institutional participation lends credibility to the crypto space. Long-Term Vision: Institutions often hold assets for extended periods, reducing short-term volatility. Market Maturation: Their involvement signals the crypto market’s evolution. How Does This Impact ETH Price? The sheer volume of this ETH accumulation naturally leads to questions about its effect on the ETH price . When large entities absorb such a significant portion of the available supply, it can create a scarcity effect, potentially driving prices upward. While past performance is not indicative of future results, a sustained period of accumulation by major holders often precedes positive price action. The current trading price of $4,308.34, significantly above the average purchase price of $3,584, suggests these whales and institutions are already seeing returns on their strategic buys. This reinforces a bullish sentiment across the market, influencing broader crypto market trends . Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends This period of intense ETH accumulation is not occurring in isolation. It’s part of a broader narrative within the digital asset space. Factors like upcoming Ethereum network upgrades, increasing utility of decentralized applications (dApps), and growing interest in NFTs and DeFi on the Ethereum blockchain all contribute to its appeal. Investors are carefully observing these developments. The strategic positioning by whales and institutions serves as a strong indicator for others looking to understand the underlying currents shaping the market. It suggests a belief that Ethereum’s foundational strength and innovative ecosystem will continue to drive its value. In conclusion, the recent $4.78 billion ETH accumulation by whales and institutions marks a pivotal moment for Ethereum. This substantial inflow of capital underscores a robust confidence in Ethereum’s future, hinting at sustained growth and stability for the second-largest cryptocurrency. As these powerful players position themselves, the market watches keenly for the ripple effects on ETH price and the broader digital asset landscape.

Morgan Taps Marex as Clearing Firm for Settlements on its Blockchain,https://cryptopotato.com/j-p-morgan-taps-marex-as-clearing-firm-for-settlements-on-its-blockchain/,"The largest bank in the United States continues its stride into DeFi innovation with TradFi roots, marking a partnership with two financial institutions. Improving Solid Foundations Marex Group Plc, a publicly traded financial services company listed on the NASDAQ (MRX), made an announcement last week regarding a collaboration with Brevan Howard Digital (BHD), a digital asset management division, to leverage J.P. Morgan’s Kinexys Digital Payments system for reduced risk and more efficient payments. Marex will be the first clearing company to utilize the blockchain deposit accounts of this system, streamlining its work with its client base. BHD joined Kinexys last year and has been working diligently with industry peers to aid in the development of a programmable blockchain infrastructure ecosystem. The payments system, part of the bank’s pioneering blockchain business unit, enables partners to facilitate instant settlements around the clock in real-time using its network of blockchain accounts. With it, Marex and BHD can improve payment settlement time, reduce risks and costs, whilst upholding the institutional security provided by traditional finance (TradFi) payment rails. “Kinexys by J.P. Morgan is the next generation of financial market infrastructure. By enabling programmable payment and settlement, the platform leverages automation to unlock the utility of assets and reduce risk. As a firm with innovation and client service at our core, we are proud to collaborate with Brevan Howard Digital on this forward-looking initiative, bringing greater operational efficiency to our clients as well as the wider market.” Said Terry Hollingsworth, Global Head of Futures & OTC Clearing Sales, Marex A Little Backstory The prominent global financial institution was not always as lenient towards cryptocurrency and the blockchain as it is currently. Its CEO, Jamie Dimon, has called Bitcoin “fraud” on numerous occasions, and his stance remains cautious to this day. Their journey into the space began in 2016 with the launch of their Ethereum-based blockchain platform, Quorum, followed by the introduction of their own JPM coin in 2019. In 2020, both initiatives were merged under one umbrella called Onyx. In early November last year, Onyx became Kinexys, with the platform reportedly processing over $1.5 trillion in transaction volume since its inception and having an average daily transaction volume of $2 billion. The current year saw J.P. Morgan launch a new coin, JPMD, which will represent dollar deposits at the bank, and there are also rumors that they will start offering crypto-backed loans next year. Additionally, we should mention their ambitious move to join forces with Coinbase, which will allow Chase credit card holders to fund their accounts on the exchange using their bank cards.

A recent development from South Korea’s prominent Bithumb crypto exchange highlights this necessity. Bithumb has issued a crucial notice regarding the Bithumb SCR suspension , directly impacting users holding SCR tokens. What Does the Bithumb SCR Suspension Mean for You? Bithumb officially announced on its website that it will temporarily halt SCR token deposits and withdrawals. This suspension is scheduled to commence on August 19 at 00:00 UTC . It is important to understand that this is a temporary measure, not a permanent delisting. For anyone planning to move their SCR tokens onto or off the exchange around this date, proactive planning is essential. Once the suspension takes effect, you will be unable to complete these transactions until the service resumes. Understanding the Scroll Network Upgrade The primary reason behind Bithumb’s decision is Scroll’s upcoming network upgrade. Scroll is a significant Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, aiming to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs while maintaining strong security through zero-knowledge proofs. Network upgrades are critical for blockchain projects. They introduce new features, improve performance, and address potential vulnerabilities. For exchanges, supporting these upgrades often requires a temporary halt in related services to ensure a smooth transition and safeguard user assets. Why is a Crypto Deposit Suspension Necessary? When a blockchain network undergoes a major upgrade, exchanges typically implement a crypto deposit suspension and withdrawal halt for several key reasons: Data Integrity: To prevent discrepancies or loss of funds during the upgrade process. Security: To protect user assets from potential vulnerabilities that might arise during the transition period. Compatibility: To ensure that the exchange’s systems are fully compatible with the new network version before resuming services. Smooth Transition: To allow the development team and the exchange ample time to implement and test the changes without active transactions. This practice is standard across reputable exchanges and demonstrates a commitment to user safety and operational stability. The Bithumb SCR suspension is a testament to this commitment. Navigating Bithumb Crypto Exchange Updates For users of the Bithumb crypto exchange , staying informed is your best defense. Here are some actionable insights: Check Official Announcements: Always refer to Bithumb’s official website or announcement channels for the most accurate and up-to-date information. Plan Ahead: If you anticipate needing to deposit or withdraw SCR tokens, do so well before the August 19 deadline. Understand the ‘Why’: Knowing that the suspension is for a network upgrade helps alleviate concerns and reinforces trust in the exchange’s proactive measures. While temporary service interruptions can be inconvenient, they are often a necessary part of maintaining a healthy and secure cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Bithumb SCR suspension is a proactive step to ensure the integrity of your SCR token transactions post-upgrade. In conclusion, the temporary halt of SCR token deposits and withdrawals on Bithumb is a standard procedure in response to the upcoming Scroll network upgrade. This proactive measure by the Bithumb crypto exchange underscores its commitment to security and smooth operations. Users should take note of the August 19 deadline and plan their transactions accordingly to avoid any inconvenience. Staying informed about such updates is paramount for all crypto participants.

Q4: How long will the SCR token deposits and withdrawals be suspended? A4: The announcement specifies the start date, but the duration depends on the successful completion and stability of the Scroll network upgrade.

While your focus might often be on Bitcoin’s latest moves or Ethereum’s next upgrade, understanding the foundational shifts in the Forex Market , particularly in key regions like Asia, is crucial. Today, we delve into the subtle yet significant movements of Asia FX , the persistent shadow of US-China Trade relations, and the intriguing question of Dollar Stability ahead of critical CPI Data . How do these seemingly distant events influence the liquidity, investor sentiment, and overall health of the digital asset space? Let’s explore. Understanding Asia FX Movements: A Calm Before the Storm? The currencies of Asia have recently displayed a remarkable calm, moving with minimal volatility. This period of relative tranquility in Asia FX might seem uneventful, but for seasoned investors and market watchers, it often signals a moment of anticipation. Central banks across the region, from the Bank of Japan to the People’s Bank of China, maintain a vigilant watch, often intervening subtly to ensure economic stability and manage currency valuations. This delicate balancing act aims to protect export competitiveness while curbing inflationary pressures. Key factors contributing to the current Asia FX stability include: Cautious Monetary Policies: Many Asian central banks are adopting a wait-and-see approach, avoiding aggressive rate hikes that could destabilize their currencies. Steady Economic Growth: Despite global headwinds, several Asian economies continue to show resilience, attracting foreign investment and supporting their local currencies. Reduced Speculative Activity: With major economic catalysts on hold, speculative trading in Asian currencies has somewhat subsided, contributing to lower volatility. However, this calm is often a prelude to potential shifts. Any significant economic data release or geopolitical development could quickly disrupt this equilibrium, leading to more pronounced movements in currencies like the Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, or South Korean Won. For crypto investors, understanding these underlying currency flows can provide early indicators of broader market sentiment and capital movements. The Shadow of US-China Trade Tensions: What’s at Stake? The relationship between the United States and China remains one of the most significant geopolitical and economic narratives of our time. The ongoing US-China Trade tensions, while not always front-page news, continue to exert a profound influence on global supply chains, commodity prices, and currency valuations, particularly in Asia. While overt trade wars have subsided, the underlying strategic competition and tariff policies persist, creating a layer of uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. How US-China Trade dynamics impact the Forex Market: Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs and trade restrictions can force companies to re-evaluate their manufacturing and sourcing strategies, impacting demand for certain currencies. Economic Growth Outlook: Prolonged trade disputes can dampen economic growth prospects for both nations, which in turn affects investor confidence and currency strength. Currency Manipulation Concerns: Accusations of currency manipulation, particularly concerning the Chinese Yuan, can lead to increased volatility and political pressure, influencing the broader Forex Market . For example, a sudden escalation in trade rhetoric could lead to a depreciation of the Yuan, making Chinese exports cheaper but potentially signaling broader economic stress that could spill over into other Asian currencies and global risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, any signs of de-escalation or cooperation could bolster market confidence. Dollar Stability: A Beacon or a Bluff Ahead of CPI Data? The U.S. Dollar (USD) has demonstrated remarkable Dollar Stability in recent times, holding firm against a basket of major currencies. As the world’s primary reserve currency and a traditional safe haven, the dollar’s performance is meticulously watched by investors globally. Its current steady state is largely attributed to expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and the anticipation of crucial economic indicators, particularly the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Why is CPI Data so important for Dollar Stability? The CPI Data is a key measure of inflation, reflecting the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. For the Federal Reserve, it’s a critical piece of the puzzle in determining future interest rate decisions. Here’s why it matters: Inflation Outlook: Higher-than-expected CPI could signal persistent inflationary pressures, potentially prompting the Fed to maintain or even raise interest rates further. This typically strengthens the dollar as higher rates make dollar-denominated assets more attractive. Monetary Policy Expectations: Conversely, lower-than-expected CPI might suggest inflation is cooling, giving the Fed room to pause or even consider rate cuts in the future. This scenario could weaken the dollar. Investor Sentiment: CPI data directly influences market sentiment. A surprise in the data can trigger significant shifts in investor portfolios, affecting everything from bond yields to equity markets and, consequently, the dollar’s value. The upcoming CPI release is therefore a pivotal moment. A strong dollar, driven by hawkish Fed expectations, can sometimes exert downward pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies, as investors might prefer the perceived safety and yield of traditional assets. Conversely, a weakening dollar could make alternative investments more appealing. Navigating the Global Forex Market: Key Considerations for Investors The Forex Market is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, where currencies are traded. Its sheer scale means that movements here can cascade into every other asset class, including digital currencies. For crypto enthusiasts, understanding the macro drivers of the Forex Market provides a broader context for investment decisions. Key Considerations for Navigating the Forex Market: Interconnectedness: No currency exists in isolation. The strength of the dollar impacts Asia FX , which in turn can be influenced by US-China Trade relations. These interdependencies are critical. Economic Calendars: Regularly monitor economic calendars for key data releases like CPI Data , GDP figures, employment reports, and central bank announcements. These are often the biggest drivers of short-term currency movements. Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: During periods of global uncertainty (risk-off), safe-haven currencies like the USD or JPY tend to strengthen. In times of optimism (risk-on), investors might move towards higher-yielding or more volatile currencies. This sentiment often correlates with crypto market movements. Central Bank Policies: The monetary policies of major central banks (Fed, ECB, BoJ, PBOC) are paramount. Their decisions on interest rates, quantitative easing, or tightening directly influence currency valuations and global liquidity. Table: Key Economic Indicators and Their Potential Impact on Currencies Indicator Description Potential Currency Impact (General) Consumer Price Index (CPI) Measures inflation (cost of goods/services) Higher CPI → Potential rate hikes → Stronger currency Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Total value of goods/services produced Stronger GDP → Economic health → Stronger currency Employment Data (NFP, Unemployment Rate) Health of the labor market Strong employment → Economic growth → Stronger currency Interest Rate Decisions Central bank’s policy rate Rate hikes → Higher returns → Stronger currency Trade Balance Difference between exports and imports Trade surplus → Increased demand for currency → Stronger currency Understanding these dynamics helps paint a clearer picture of the macro environment that indirectly shapes the crypto markets, affecting everything from stablecoin pegs to the appetite for risk in decentralized finance. Concluding Thoughts: Vigilance in a Volatile World The relative calm in Asia FX , the persistent undercurrents of US-China Trade , and the dollar’s steady stance ahead of critical CPI Data are all pieces of a complex global economic puzzle. While these movements might seem distant from the daily swings of cryptocurrencies, they form the bedrock of global liquidity and investor confidence. The stability of the dollar, the health of Asian economies, and the resolution (or lack thereof) of trade disputes directly influence the flow of capital and the overall risk appetite that permeates all financial markets, including digital assets. For those navigating the exciting yet unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies, a keen eye on these traditional market indicators is not just beneficial, but essential. It provides a deeper understanding of the macro forces at play, enabling more informed decisions and a more robust investment strategy.

This significant achievement is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts globally, marking a pivotal moment in recent cryptocurrency news and setting a new tone for the market. Unpacking This Significant BTC Market Update According to diligent monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC is now trading at an impressive $122,057.91 on the Binance USDT market. This notable ascent signifies a strong bullish momentum, reflecting increased confidence and heightened activity within the digital asset space. When Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, makes such a substantial jump, it often signals broader positive sentiment across the entire crypto ecosystem. Consequently, investors are closely watching this development, eager to understand its implications. This remarkable Bitcoin price surge is more than just a numerical milestone; it represents a significant psychological and technical breakthrough. It clearly highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto markets and Bitcoin’s continued role as the benchmark for digital assets. Understanding the underlying factors behind such a powerful move is absolutely crucial for anyone involved in the crypto landscape, from seasoned traders to new entrants. What’s Driving Bitcoin’s Explosive Value? Several fundamental and speculative factors typically contribute to an upward movement in Bitcoin value . While specific catalysts for this particular surge would require in-depth analysis, general drivers that often propel Bitcoin to new heights include: Increased Institutional Adoption: When more large corporations, investment funds, and financial institutions integrate Bitcoin into their portfolios or services, it significantly boosts demand and legitimacy. Positive Regulatory Developments: Clearer, more favorable, or supportive regulations in major global economies often reduce market uncertainty, attracting new capital and mainstream participation. Halving Cycle Influence: Historically, Bitcoin’s quadrennial halving events, which slash the rate at which new BTC is introduced into circulation, have preceded major bull runs due to reduced supply. Macroeconomic Shifts: Global economic conditions, concerns about inflation, currency debasement, and evolving interest rate policies can drive investors towards Bitcoin as a perceived safe-haven asset or store of value. Renewed Retail Investor Interest: A resurgence of enthusiasm and buying pressure from individual investors, often fueled by positive news and social media trends, can create powerful upward momentum. Moreover, consistent positive cryptocurrency news and growing public awareness play a vital role in sustaining such upward trends. The market is always reacting to a complex interplay of supply and demand dynamics, global events, and technological advancements. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends Effectively For those observing these dramatic crypto market trends , understanding the inherent volatility is paramount. While a rapid increase in Bitcoin value is undoubtedly exciting, markets can shift directions quickly and unpredictably. Therefore, it is important to approach the market with a well-informed strategy and a clear understanding of your personal risk tolerance. Consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Regularly check reliable and reputable sources for the latest BTC market update and broader economic indicators. Knowledge is power in volatile markets. Diversify Your Portfolio: Consider spreading investments across different digital assets or traditional assets to mitigate potential risks associated with single-asset exposure. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Only invest capital that you can genuinely afford to lose. Cryptocurrency markets are speculative and can experience significant swings. Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: Many experienced investors and financial advisors advocate for a long-term view when it comes to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, focusing on their fundamental value proposition rather than short-term fluctuations. This current rally reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a dominant force in the financial world. It also prompts widespread discussions about future price targets and the potential for new all-time highs in the coming months or years. What’s Next for Bitcoin’s Future Value? The question on everyone’s mind is clear: where does Bitcoin value go from here? While no one can predict the future with absolute certainty, this significant rise above $122,000 sets a new, higher precedent. It establishes a more robust baseline and potentially attracts even more institutional and retail capital into the broader crypto ecosystem.

They both dismissed their appeals in the Second Circuit on August 7, 2025. This move validates the landmark 2023 decision of Judge Analisa Torres. That ruling determined that XRP tokens sold to retail investors on public exchanges are not securities. Consequently, Ripple agreed to pay a $125 million fine concerning institutional XRP sales. Simultaneously, another project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is gaining significant traction during its ongoing presale. Many investors are now comparing its potential trajectory to XRP’s recent success. Ripple’s landmark victory and market impact Ripple Labs consistently argued that XRP was not a security since the SEC initiated its lawsuit in December 2020. The recent rejection of appeals confirms the legal difference between retail and institutional token sales. This precedent is a crucial one to the broader crypto industry. Moreover, the Chief Legal Officer of Ripple, Stuart Alderoty, indicated that the company would resume regular business activities. Market analysts are already speculating about potential XRP-based financial products. The possibility of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) seems more plausible now. Increased institutional adoption appears likely given the resolved regulatory uncertainty. The ruling significantly influences crypto prices today, particularly for assets entangled in regulatory disputes. This observation shows the importance of legal structures in investing in cryptocurrencies. It offers a blueprint on how to navigate the tricky securities regulations that touch on a variety of crypto coins. Mutuum Finance presale momentum builds Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues its highly successful token presale, currently in Phase 6. Investor participation remains exceptionally strong. The project has impressively raised over $14,300,000 since the presale began. More than 670 million MUTM tokens have already been sold to participants. Total MUTM holders now exceed 15,050 individuals. Phase 6 is currently underway, offering tokens at $0.035 each. This represents a substantial 250% increase, or 3.5x growth, from the opening phase price of $0.01. Tokens in this phase are selling out rapidly. Consequently, the opportunity to acquire MUTM at this level is diminishing quickly. Phase 7 will commence next, featuring a 14.3% price increase to $0.04 per token. Following the presale conclusion, MUTM will officially launch at $0.06. Current Phase 6 buyers can therefore anticipate significant gains post-launch. Projections suggest potential returns exceeding 400% for current buyers. This potential growth fuels considerable interest among investors seeking the next big crypto opportunity. Mutuum Finance core utility and security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself through tangible utility within decentralized finance. The protocol is developing a dual-lending model. This model integrates peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending mechanisms. P2C allows users to tokenize established assets like ETH or BTC, earning interest. P2P facilitates direct lending agreements between users, often involving more volatile assets. Both systems aim to operate efficiently on a Layer-2 network. This integration promises drastically lower transaction fees and faster processing times. Security is paramount for the Mutuum Finance team. They recently finalized a comprehensive audit with CertiK, achieving an outstanding 95.00 security score. To bolster security continuously, Mutuum Finance has launched an official Bug Bounty Program. This program, run in partnership with CertiK, offers $50,000 USDT in rewards. Community engagement and incentives Mutuum Finance actively cultivates a strong and engaged community. They recently announced an exciting $100,000 MUTM giveaway . Ten fortunate winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Additionally, the project introduced a new dashboard feature. This dashboard includes a leaderboard tracking the top 50 MUTM token holders. Individuals maintaining their position within this elite group will receive bonus token rewards. This initiative encourages long-term holding among significant stakeholders. It fosters greater stability within the token ecosystem. MUTM positioned for future growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a compelling case within the current crypto market. Its presale performance demonstrates considerable investor confidence. The project offers clear utility through its innovative dual-lending approach. Explore the Mutuum Finance presale opportunity today before Phase 6 concludes.

His comments surfaced on August 8th, 2025, following a sharp ETH price surge. The cryptocurrency climbed 4.6%, surpassing $4,000 for the first time since late 2024. This price jump triggered roughly $105 million in ETH short position liquidations within a single day. Furthermore, substantial spot Ether ETF inflows, nearing $537 million over four days, are fueling this bullish sentiment. Consequently, the search intensifies for the best crypto to buy now beyond Ethereum. Investors are actively examining crypto charts for emerging opportunities, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking the lead. Ethereum momentum post-short squeeze Ethereum’s recent performance is commanding investor attention. Its price ascent above $4,000 caused considerable pain for bearish traders. These liquidations represented over half of all crypto short losses recorded that day. Market observers highlight growing institutional interest as a key driver. Spot Ether ETF inflows provide concrete evidence of this trend. Some analysts project even more dramatic gains ahead. Predictions suggest ETH could potentially reach $10,000 or even $16,000 in future cycles. This event underscores the inherent volatility within the crypto market. Presently, the market appears self-correcting without major regulatory interference. Ethereum’s momentum makes it a significant crypto investment, yet alternatives also beckon. Mutuum Finance presale achieves strong traction Simultaneously, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is demonstrating remarkable presale progress. Phase 6 is actively underway, offering tokens at $0.035. This represents a substantial 250% increase from the opening phase price of $0.01. The project has already secured an impressive $14,300,000 in funding. Moreover, over 670 million MUTM tokens have been sold to date. A growing community of 15,050 total holders now supports the project. Phase 6 is selling out rapidly, indicating strong demand. Consequently, the window to acquire tokens at this price point is closing fast. The imminent Phase 7 will introduce a 14.3% price hike, setting the token cost at $0.04. Moreover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will officially launch at $0.06. This structure offers current Phase 6 participants a potential 400% return post-launch. Market analysts further project a possible rise towards $3 within the next year, adding significant long-term appeal. Mutuum Finance security and incentives Security remains paramount for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project has successfully concluded its Certik audit.

Mutuum Finance holder rewards program Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has introduced an innovative dashboard feature. This includes a leaderboard tracking the top 50 token holders. Importantly, these leading holders will receive bonus token rewards. The program incentivizes maintaining positions within this elite group. This initiative directly rewards long-term commitment and significant investment. It fosters a strong, engaged community around the token.

This bullish technical signal appears on the hourly chart. The 50-hour SMA has crossed above the 200-hour SMA. Consequently, short-term selling pressure seems to be fading for ADA. Bullish momentum may be building now. Nevertheless, many analysts remain unconvinced about ADA hitting $1 soon. They point to persistent resistance and market volatility risks. Instead, they are focusing attention elsewhere for explosive gains. Their choice is becoming increasingly clear: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Cardano’s technical strength meets scepticism ADA’s golden cross suggests potential upside. This technical indicator often precedes price rallies. Cardano has managed to hold above crucial moving averages. Market sentiment is improving across the crypto market. Optimism exists around institutional adoption possibilities. Key resistance levels are the immediate focus. Breaking $0.86 is necessary for further progress. Then $0.94 becomes the next target. Only then can $1 be realistically tested. However, failure to hold above $0.80 risks a pullback. Market rallies can lose steam quickly. Trading volume needs confirmation soon. Therefore, analysts express caution despite the positive chart formation. They are looking beyond established altcoins for superior opportunities. New crypto projects offer different potential. Mutuum Finance presale momentum builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is demonstrating remarkable presale traction. Phase 6 is currently underway. Tokens are selling rapidly at $0.035 each. This phase represents a 250% increase from the opening phase price of $0.01. Over $14,300,000 has been raised since the presale began. Total MUTM holders now exceed 15,050. Further, phase 6 is selling out fast. The chance to acquire tokens at this price is ending soon. Immediately after, Phase 7 will open. It features a 14.3% price increase, setting the token cost at $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch at $0.06. This offers current Phase 6 buyers a potential 450% return on investment after launch. Market predictions suggest significant upside post-launch, potentially reaching between $1 and $5 in 2025. Security and incentives enhance trust Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prioritizes robust security. The team has successfully finalized its CertiK audit. This rigorous examination yielded an impressive 95.00 security score. It indicates a solid security posture. Mutuum Finance has also launched its official Bug Bounty Program. This initiative partners with CertiK. A substantial $50,000 USDT reward pool exists. Rewards are tiered based on vulnerability severity: critical, major, minor, and low. Additionally, Mutuum Finance has introduced a unique dashboard. It features a leaderboard tracking the top 50 token holders. These holders will receive bonus token rewards for maintaining their positions. This incentivizes long-term crypto investment. Community growth through major giveaway Excitement surrounds a significant Mutuum Finance (MUTM) giveaway. The project is awarding a total of $100,000 in MUTM tokens. Ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000. Participating requires specific steps. First, submit a valid wallet address for potential prize receipt. Second, complete all designated quests carefully. Third, confirm eligibility. Moreover, a minimum $50 investment in the Mutuum Finance presale is mandatory for entry. This giveaway fuels community engagement and investment interest. Mutuum Finance offers real utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers tangible decentralized finance solutions. It is developing a peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform. This operates efficiently on Layer-2 technology. Consequently, users experience drastically lower gas fees. Faster transaction speeds become the norm. The protocol will also introduce an overcollateralized stablecoin system. This stablecoin maintains a $1 peg through disciplined minting and burning linked to loan activity. It provides stability during crypto market volatility. These utilities drive genuine demand for the MUTM token. Investors seeking the best crypto to buy now recognize this practical value. Crypto investing strategies increasingly favor projects with clear use cases. Final thoughts Analysts see greater near-term potential in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) despite Cardano’s technical signals. The presale progress, strong security, real utility, and substantial incentives position it uniquely. Phase 6 offers a final low entry point before the next price rise.

BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction is sparking significant participation, aligning with its $0.0016 Global Launch price, which remains available only until August 11. Ethereum (ETH) is pushing toward the $4,000 milestone, a level that could open doors to fresh all-time highs. At the same time, a recent XRP update points to rising adoption and growing passive income options through cloud mining platforms. Together, these events position Ethereum, XRP, and BlockDAG (BDAG) at the forefront for those tracking the top crypto coins right now. The mix of presale urgency, bullish technical indicators, and expanding real-world applications creates a compelling blend for market watchers. Ethereum (ETH) Rally Approaches Key Resistance Ethereum’s rally is moving closer to the $4,000 threshold, a price level considered both a psychological barrier and a technical turning point. Analyst Lark Davis suggests that clearing this zone could trigger a strong push toward uncharted price territory. Failure to break through might see ETH revisiting support levels at the 20-day EMA near $3,600 or the 50-day EMA around $3,300. The rally is also part of a wider bullish momentum across crypto, backed by moves from major market participants. For example, MARA Holdings recently secured $850 million for Bitcoin accumulation, signaling strong institutional interest in digital assets. For now, $4,000 is the crucial mark to watch. A confirmed breakout above it could firmly secure Ethereum’s place among the top crypto coins right now, driven by healthy on-chain metrics and sustained market optimism. XRP Adoption Expands with New Cloud Mining Option XRP’s recognition continues to grow, bolstered by fast transactions and versatile use cases. A recent update from LET Mining now enables users to start cloud mining contracts directly with XRP, removing the need to first convert into BTC or DOGE. These contracts offer fixed daily returns, with some paying up to $2,530 per day. Payments are automatic, withdrawals are instant, and the process requires no technical expertise. For instance, a $1,500 contract over 10 days generates $19.50 daily, while a $10,000 contract over 43 days yields $174 per day. Global participation is evident, with users across Europe, America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East adopting XRP for steady earnings. This combination of utility and income potential strengthens XRP’s standing among the top cryptocurrencies right now, appealing to both active traders and those seeking passive gains. BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction and $0.0016 Final Days BlockDAG’s presale has now exceeded $368 million, with over 24.9 billion coins sold. The $0.0016 Global Launch price remains open until August 11, after which the cost will move to the Batch 29 rate before heading toward the confirmed $0.05 launch price. Early participants have already experienced a 2,660% increase in their funds since Batch 1, making this stage one of the most rewarding in the presale phase. The 10 BTC Auction is a key factor driving last-stage demand. Every purchase before August 11 automatically qualifies for entry, and larger transactions increase the odds of winning part of the Bitcoin prize pool. This format adds excitement and competition, motivating higher buy volumes as the deadline approaches. BlockDAG’s upgraded Dashboard V4 boosts transparency by offering real-time BDAG price charts, live order book tracking, instant buy and sell options, and a referral rewards system. Gamified features like leaderboards and bonus calculators enhance user engagement. The recently concluded X1 and X10 Live Demo highlighted BlockDAG’s functioning mining technology. The X10 miner produces up to 200 BDAG daily, compared to 20 BDAG/day through the X1 mobile miner, with both being simple to operate even without technical skills. Visibility is rising through partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas, incorporating NFTs, fan tokens, and interactive fan experiences into mainstream sports. With 20 confirmed exchange listings, its hybrid blockchain-DAG framework, and more than 2.5 million X1 app users, BlockDAG operates as a thriving ecosystem. With the price increase on the horizon, the 10 BTC Auction, and proven tech delivery, BlockDAG strengthens its claim as one of the top crypto coins right now . Final Thoughts Ethereum’s approach to the $4,000 level could mark a pivotal moment, potentially leading to new record highs. XRP’s latest functionality showcases its growing adoption and appeal for those seeking reliable passive income. BlockDAG stands out by combining a limited-time $0.0016 entry point, a massive post-deadline price jump, and the added thrill of the 10 BTC Auction. For those balancing short-term market plays with long-term growth prospects, Ethereum, XRP, and BlockDAG all hold promise, but only BlockDAG offers a countdown to a permanent pricing shift.

Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) bullish price breakout forecasts keep heating up, with adoption-driven projections aiming for $1,000 by 2030. Yet, amid the hype surrounding these established names, an analysis of emerging crypto coins points to a quieter, more disruptive player: Cold Wallet (CWT) . Priced at just $0.00998 in Stage 17 and backed by a $270M Plus Wallet acquisition that added 2M+ users before launch, CWT offers live infrastructure and a unique cashback loop that turns gas fees into rewards. While SHIB chases momentum and SOL builds on scalability, CWT is redefining wallet economics entirely, and its 3,423% ROI gap to launch is closing fast. Shiba Inu Whale Activity Jumps 870%; Is SHIB Set for a 30% Rally? Shiba Inu’s price has been struggling to break higher, trading at $0.0000127 after a slight daily dip. However, market watchers see signs of a potential breakout. Analyst SHIB Knight highlights a falling wedge pattern that has now broken to the upside, a technical signal that could push SHIB toward $0.000014 or even $0.000016, representing gains of up to 33%. The surge in optimism follows a massive 870% jump in whale transactions within 24 hours, alongside $3.4 million worth of SHIB leaving exchanges, a sign of reduced sell pressure. With network upgrades like Shibarium improvements on the horizon and the broader crypto market recovering, momentum could be shifting in SHIB’s favor. For traders, these on-chain signals may indicate a timely entry before the next potential leg up. Solana Price Prediction: Could SOL Hit $1,000 by 2030? Solana (SOL), launched in 2020, has grown into one of the most used blockchains, processing up to 65,000 transactions per second with minimal fees. Its strong DeFi and dApp ecosystem, energy efficiency, and recent acquisitions like Phantom’s purchase of Solsniper continue to boost adoption. Currently trading near $166, analysts anticipate that SOL may reach $300-$400 by 2025, supported by network growth. Long-term forecasts suggest $834-$1,376 by 2030, with a $1,000 milestone possible if bullish conditions persist. Investors may consider Solana for its scalability, low transaction costs, and increasing developer activity. However, market volatility and regulatory risks remain key factors. For those seeking high-growth crypto exposure with strong fundamentals, SOL’s projected multi-year trajectory offers compelling upside, especially for long-term holders willing to ride short-term price swings. Cold Wallet Turns Crypto Fees Into Fuel: Why Stage 17 Could Be the Sweet Spot? Crypto will never fully go mainstream until the cost of participation drops, and Cold Wallet has found a way to make that happen. Instead of letting gas, swap, and bridge fees drain portfolios, it refunds them in CWT, creating a self-sustaining loop where every transaction powers the next. The recent $270M Plus Wallet acquisition adds more than 2 million users to this ecosystem before launch, meaning Cold Wallet starts with the kind of network effect most projects spend years chasing. Now in Stage 17 of its presale, CWT is priced at $0.00998, with a confirmed launch price of $0.3517, offering a potential 3,421% ROI for early entrants. With live infrastructure, a built-in user base, and tokenomics engineered for retention, this is more than a concept. It’s a working model designed for mass adoption. The price will climb with each stage, and as adoption ramps up, the upside for early buyers could compress fast. In a market where most wallets only take, Cold Wallet is rewriting the rules by giving back. If mainstream adoption is the goal, this could be the wallet that gets us there, and Stage 17 may be the last real bargain. Why Cold Wallet Could Leave SHIB and SOL Behind? Emerging crypto coins analysis often pits momentum plays like Shiba Inu and Solana against each other, but Cold Wallet changes the conversation. Shiba Inu (SHIB) investor analysis shows clear short-term upside potential, yet its trajectory still hinges on whale behavior and meme-driven sentiment. Solana (SOL) bullish price breakout signals point to long-term strength, but the path to $1,000 is years away and dependent on ecosystem growth. Cold Wallet offers something different, a live, self-reinforcing utility model that pays users to engage. The Plus Wallet acquisition instantly adds 2M+ active wallets before launch, accelerating adoption from day one.

However, a significant development in East Africa is highlighting the critical link between this digital pursuit and real-world infrastructure. Recently, Ethiopia, a nation increasingly on the radar for its burgeoning digital economy, has made a crucial decision regarding Ethiopia crypto mining operations. Why is Ethiopia Crypto Mining Facing a Power Cut? Ethiopia is currently grappling with a severe Ethiopia electricity shortage . This isn’t a new challenge, but it has now reached a point where it directly impacts the nation’s capacity to support energy-intensive industries like crypto mining. The country’s power grid, which relies heavily on hydropower, has reportedly reached its absolute limit. According to reports from Bitcoin.com News, shared on X, the government has halted issuing new electricity permits specifically for Ethiopia crypto mining . This decision comes as the grid struggles to meet existing demand, leaving little room for additional power-hungry operations. The Scale of Bitcoin Mining in Ethiopia It might surprise some to learn the extent of Bitcoin mining in Ethiopia . Despite its developing infrastructure, the nation has attracted considerable interest from the crypto community. Currently, 25 Bitcoin mining operations are actively running within Ethiopia’s borders. Moreover, another 20 operations were eagerly awaiting approval for electricity permits. This significant number underscores the growing appeal of African crypto mining , often due to perceived lower energy costs or favorable regulatory environments. However, the current situation demonstrates the inherent risks associated with such ventures in regions with unstable power supplies. Broader Implications for African Crypto Mining The decision in Ethiopia sends a clear signal across the continent about the challenges facing African crypto mining . While many African nations possess vast renewable energy potential, translating that into a stable, nationwide power grid is a monumental task. This incident highlights the delicate balance between fostering technological innovation and ensuring basic infrastructure needs are met for the general populace. Governments must weigh the economic benefits of attracting crypto miners against the potential strain on national resources and the impact on their citizens. This situation in Ethiopia could prompt other African nations to reassess their own energy capacities before welcoming large-scale crypto mining operations. What Does This Mean for Crypto Mining Power? This development underscores a critical aspect of the entire crypto industry: the immense need for reliable and affordable crypto mining power . Miners are always seeking locations with surplus energy, ideally from renewable sources, to maximize profitability and reduce their carbon footprint. When a nation like Ethiopia, which has been seen as a potential hub, faces such constraints, it forces a re-evaluation of global mining strategies. It reminds us that while the digital world seems boundless, its foundational infrastructure is very much rooted in physical realities and resource availability. The pursuit of sustainable and ample energy remains a paramount concern for the long-term viability of decentralized networks. Ethiopia’s decision to halt new electricity permits for crypto miners is a stark reminder of the real-world limitations impacting the digital asset space. It’s a clear signal that infrastructure development must keep pace with technological ambition. While the future of Ethiopia crypto mining remains uncertain, this event will undoubtedly influence how other nations approach the energy demands of the crypto industry. It’s a pivotal moment, emphasizing the need for robust power solutions to truly support the decentralized future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did Ethiopia halt new crypto mining permits? Ethiopia halted new permits due to its power grid reaching capacity and an ongoing Ethiopia electricity shortage , making it unable to support the high energy demands of additional crypto mining operations. How many crypto mining operations were active in Ethiopia? At the time of the halt, 25 Bitcoin mining operations were active, with an additional 20 awaiting approval for electricity permits. What is an “electricity shortage”? An electricity shortage occurs when the demand for power exceeds the available supply from the national grid, leading to insufficient electricity for consumers and industries. How does this affect other African nations interested in crypto mining? This situation serves as a cautionary tale, prompting other African nations to carefully assess their own energy infrastructure and capacity before attracting large-scale African crypto mining ventures. Is Ethiopia against crypto mining? The decision is primarily driven by infrastructure limitations and power grid capacity, not necessarily an outright ban or opposition to crypto mining itself. It’s a matter of resource allocation. Did you find this article insightful?

Since June 22, this mysterious entity has amassed a staggering 68,000 ETH, valued at approximately $120 million. This significant ETH accumulation highlights a powerful conviction in Ethereum’s future, sending ripples through the market. Who is This Mysterious Ethereum Whale? According to diligent on-chain analysis by crypto observer @ai_9684xtpa on X, a specific address has been consistently adding to its Ethereum holdings. This large-scale acquisition began on June 22, with the average purchase price hovering around $2,597 per ETH. Such focused buying indicates a strategic long-term outlook rather than speculative day trading. Just recently, a substantial transaction occurred: the address withdrew 8,745 ETH directly from the Binance Exchange. This move suggests the whale is moving assets to a self-custody wallet, further emphasizing their intent to hold these assets for an extended period. Understanding the patterns of a large ETH holder like this is crucial for market watchers. Understanding Large ETH Accumulation When an Ethereum whale undertakes such a massive accumulation, it’s rarely a random event. These entities often possess deep market insights or are making calculated moves based on extensive research and conviction. Their actions can significantly influence market sentiment and, potentially, price action. Market Confidence: Large purchases by whales can signal confidence in the asset’s future, encouraging other investors. Supply Dynamics: Removing significant amounts of ETH from exchanges can reduce the available supply, potentially creating upward price pressure. Strategic Positioning: Whales often accumulate during periods of market consolidation or slight dips, positioning themselves for future rallies. This particular instance of ETH accumulation demonstrates a strong belief in Ethereum’s ecosystem and its upcoming developments. What Drives Crypto Whale Activity? Crypto whale activity is a fascinating aspect of the digital asset landscape. Several factors typically drive these significant movements: Fundamental Belief: A strong conviction in the underlying technology and long-term potential of a blockchain like Ethereum. Macroeconomic Trends: Whales might be positioning assets in anticipation of broader economic shifts, such as inflation or interest rate changes. Technological Milestones: For Ethereum, major upgrades like the upcoming Dencun or future developments could be strong motivators for a large ETH holder to increase their stake. Arbitrage Opportunities: While less likely for such large, sustained accumulation, some whale activity can stem from exploiting price differences across exchanges. The anonymity of this particular whale adds an element of intrigue, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact rationale behind their extensive buying spree. However, the sheer volume speaks volumes about their bullish stance. Implications for the Ethereum Market The continuous ETH accumulation by this anonymous whale could have several implications for the broader Ethereum market. Firstly, it reduces the circulating supply available on exchanges, which, if demand remains constant or increases, could lead to price appreciation. Secondly, such visible on-chain analysis of large purchases can inspire retail investors and smaller institutions, creating a positive feedback loop. Furthermore, the fact that a significant portion of these holdings was withdrawn from Binance suggests a move towards cold storage, indicating a long-term investment strategy rather than short-term speculation. This behavior often precedes periods of sustained growth, as it removes a large block of ETH from immediate selling pressure. In conclusion, the relentless ETH accumulation by this anonymous Ethereum whale since June 22 is a powerful signal in the crypto space. It underscores a deep conviction in Ethereum’s value proposition and future growth. While the identity of this large ETH holder remains a mystery, their actions provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. Monitoring such significant movements through on-chain analysis continues to be a vital practice for anyone navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an Ethereum whale? A: An Ethereum whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH), typically enough to influence market prices or sentiment through their transactions. Q2: How much ETH did the anonymous whale accumulate? A: The anonymous whale accumulated 68,000 ETH, valued at approximately $120 million, since June 22. Q3: What does ‘on-chain analysis’ mean? A: On-chain analysis involves examining data directly from a blockchain’s public ledger, such as transaction volumes, wallet addresses, and token movements, to gain insights into market behavior and trends. Q4: Why is a whale moving ETH from an exchange to a private wallet significant? A: Moving ETH from an exchange to a private (cold) wallet typically indicates a long-term holding strategy, as it removes the assets from immediate trading availability and reduces selling pressure on exchanges. Q5: How can large ETH accumulation affect the market? A: Large ETH accumulation can signal strong bullish sentiment, reduce circulating supply on exchanges, and potentially lead to upward price pressure due to increased demand relative to available supply.

Bitcoin rose 3% to $121,900, extending gains from the weekend. Ether added 1.5% to $4,295, capping a week in which it jumped 20% on surging institutional demand. The rally marked one of the strongest altcoin runs in recent months, defying the usual summer slowdown. “Our tactical altcoin model just triggered its longest bullish streak in over a year, and Ethereum’s breakout has traders eyeing a level not seen since 2021,” 10X Research said in a note. El Salvador Opens Institutional Access to Bitcoin Bitcoin’s advance follows El Salvador’s approval of its Investment Banking Law , a measure that could turn the Central American nation into a regional crypto hub. Passed on Aug. 7, the legislation grants licensed investment banks the power to hold Bitcoin and other digital assets alongside legal tender and foreign currency, provided they deal only with sophisticated investors. These institutions must maintain at least $50m in capital and serve clients with market knowledge and a minimum of $250,000 in investable assets. The broader market mood was reinforced by MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, a prominent Bitcoin advocate, who wrote on X: “If you don’t stop buying Bitcoin, you won’t stop making money.” If you don't stop buying Bitcoin, you won't stop making Money. pic.twitter.com/G9S2gPO1t8 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) August 10, 2025 ETH Treasuries and ETFs Fuel Strong Institutional Demand Ethereum’s climb has been underpinned by record flows into ETH-focused treasuries and exchange-traded funds. Data from Coinglass showed $92.25m in ETH long liquidations in the past day, compared with $117.67m for Bitcoin, indicating aggressive repositioning as prices spiked. Corporate treasuries are playing a growing role in the rally. According to CoinGecko, 17 public companies now hold a combined 1.75m ETH, valued at more than $7.53b. Bitmine Immersion Technologies leads the list with 833,133 ETH worth about $3.59b, followed by SharpLink Gaming with 521,939 ETH and Coinbase with 136,782 ETH. SharpLink’s recent $200m stock offering to expand its Ethereum holdings has added to bullish sentiment, with analysts projecting it could soon become one of the largest corporate holders of the token. ETF flows have also surged . BlackRock’s ETHA ETF absorbed over $254m on Friday, pushing its net assets past $12.3b. Grayscale’s main ETH trust now holds $4.5b in assets, while products from Bitwise, VanEck and Franklin have seen steady inflows. Bullish Hashtags Surge as Retail Traders Pile In Social sentiment reflects the optimism. Analytics firm Santiment noted a spike in bullish hashtags such as #buying and #bullish, with bearish mentions dropping by half. The firm cautioned, however, that excessive retail FOMO could temporarily stall the rally. With Bitcoin nearing $122,000 and Ether within striking distance of $4,500, traders are watching whether momentum can push the two largest cryptocurrencies to fresh highs before the quarter’s end.

A growing group of crypto-first users is shifting to a platform that does what it says. Spartans is building a strong place in the crypto betting market with a smooth, quick, and fully linked setup that solves long-standing problems players have faced. Here are five reasons why crypto gamers are making this move. 1. Fast Crypto Payouts With No Delays or Hassles Speed is key in crypto. Spartans.com sends withdrawals to user wallets in less than 15 minutes. This is a clear step up from traditional sites where payouts can take hours or even days. It supports Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Avalanche (AVAX), and Cardano (ADA) without the need for banks or outside processors. CryptoNews notes that payout speed is a top driver of user satisfaction in crypto casinos. Spartans delivers what experienced players want most: quick, safe, and simple transactions. 2. One Platform for Casino and Sports Betting Rather than splitting play between separate casino and sportsbook apps, Spartans brings it all together in one place. With more than 5,900 games from 43+ providers, players can try high-volatility slots, live blackjack, crash games, or place a UFC or football bet without leaving the page or logging in elsewhere. Sports coverage includes EPL, Champions League, NBA, cricket, UFC, tennis, and eSports, with pre-match and live in-play betting offered. The site is browser-based, made for mobile, and quick to load with no app needed. 3. No KYC Needed, Privacy at the Core Most older platforms ask for KYC documents even before a deposit is made. Spartans changes that approach. Users can sign up with only an email address and link their crypto wallet. No identity check is needed to start playing. This privacy-first setup appeals to Web3-native users and DeFi players who are used to self-custody and quick onboarding. For many, it is less about avoiding rules and more about avoiding unnecessary barriers. 4. Clear Bonuses Without Tricks Spartans’ promotions are bold yet clear. New users can get a 300% welcome bonus (up to $200) for both casino and sports, along with a 25% daily reload bonus. All terms are stated openly: 35x wagering for casino, 10x for sports, and set maximum withdrawals. There is also a Lamborghini giveaway linked to platform activity, not pure chance. Unlike sites that overpromise with unclear offers, Spartans shows exactly what players receive and the steps needed to claim it. 5. Simple and Reliable, No Distractions Spartans.com is built to run smoothly. It works well in the browser, loads quickly on desktop and mobile, and allows users to go from signup to first bet in under a minute. Odds refresh in real time, the betslip is easy to use, and navigation is smooth. The affiliate program is also designed with care, offering CPA, RevShare, and Hybrid models with proper tools, not just an added feature. In short, Spartans seems built by people who actually use crypto. It avoids empty hype. It simply works, and it works fast. Final Say Crypto players want platforms that match their needs, with quick signup, self-custody, low fees, and a smooth design. Spartans.com meets all these points. For users tired of traditional platforms that cannot keep up with crypto standards, switching is a clear choice. With one account for casino and sports, fast payouts, and a clear user experience, Spartans shows what crypto betting can be.

The claim, which he denies, has sparked calls for transparency and due process from the crypto community. In a series of X posts , Fede’s Intern said local authorities told his lawyer that he could face charges. “It’s obviously wrong, we are just infra builders,” he wrote, adding that he had been advised to limit what he shared publicly. He urged followers to contact associates who could speak on his behalf. So we now have more information. The minister of internal affairs of Turkey is saying I helped people misuse @ethereum . I’m fully open to cooperate with any authorities from Turkey or any country, we didn’t help anybody do anything, but we will also defend ourselves. — Fede’s intern (@fede_intern) August 10, 2025 Ethereum Dev Cites International Ties in Defense Effort The developer described himself as a businessman with operating companies in more than a dozen industries, headquartered in Europe and working with governments. “If we are the baddies I don’t know what to say. Everything we do is in the open,” he said. He claimed to have reached out to senior contacts in more than 10 countries, including in Europe, the US, the UAE and Asia. Friends from multiple jurisdictions were also calling officials in Turkey, he said, adding that there was a possibility he could leave the country and contest the allegations from abroad. Later, he said Turkey’s internal affairs minister had accused him of helping people misuse Ethereum. He reiterated his willingness to cooperate with Turkish authorities or any other government, while maintaining that neither he nor his companies had aided criminal activity. He indicated that a team of lawyers was already working on the case and that he might soon be able to fly to Europe on a private jet. Skepticism Delayed Public Disclosure of Detention His posts also described some unusual incidents during his detention. For example, he recounted experiencing an earthquake while in custody. He also witnessed an altercation involving an intoxicated British national in the same holding room. Fede’s Intern said he had delayed posting earlier because he anticipated skepticism. Moreover, he wanted to wait until his lawyer cleared him to speak publicly. He added, “I don’t know what the heck I win by inventing that this happened to me.” The developer’s detention has drawn comparisons to the case of Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan . He was arrested in Nigeria earlier this year alongside Nadeem Anjarwalla. As a result, both incidents have fueled debate over whether governments are overreaching in their enforcement actions against blockchain infrastructure providers. Definition of Ethereum “Misuse” Yet to Be Clarified Some in the crypto community believe translation errors could be to blame. Others think the issue stems from misunderstandings about Ethereum’s infrastructure. Meanwhile, some fear it points to a more aggressive regulatory stance in the region. Key questions remain unanswered. For instance, it is unclear whether the charges target Fede’s Intern personally or an affiliated company. In addition, it is not known if the detention is tied to a broader sweep of arrests announced by Turkey’s interior ministry earlier this week. Finally, questions remain over what specific activities are being labeled as “misuse” of Ethereum.. The developer promised to share more details once he leaves Turkey. He also said he would speak further after receiving legal clearance. In the meantime, the case has become a flashpoint in the ongoing tension between blockchain builders and regulatory authorities worldwide.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 index remained closed due to a holiday, but futures inched up to 42,465, pointing to a possible test of its all-time peak of 42,426 later this week. Global trade and political developments were also in focus. A deadline for new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will be expiring on Tuesday, with widespread expectations that it will be extended. Meanwhile, U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet on Friday in Alaska to discuss the conflict in Ukraine. The most closely watched economic data this week will be U.S. consumer price figures for July, due Tuesday. Analysts expect tariffs to push the core CPI up by 0.3%, bringing the annual rate to 3.0%, which would move further away from the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Dollar steady ahead of inflation data, U.S.-China tariff decision The U.S. dollar held its ground on Monday after falling last week, as traders awaited the inflation data and monitored U.S.-China trade talks ahead of the tariff deadline. The dollar index remained flat at 98.25 after sliding 0.4% last week. Against the Japanese yen, it was unchanged at 147.685, with Tokyo markets shut for the holiday. Attention remained on trade negotiations, particularly over semiconductor policy, with Trump’s August 12 deadline for a deal approaching. “The market has fully priced in the idea that we’re going to get an extension,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group in Melbourne, adding that another 90-day pause appeared most likely. Efforts are underway to avoid steep tariffs on goods from both countries. Reuters reported on Sunday that chipmakers Nvidia and AMD had agreed to channel 15% of their China sales revenue to the U.S. government in exchange for export licences to sell semiconductors in the Chinese market. Oil prices drop as markets eye U.S.-Russia talks Oil prices fell in early Asian trade, adding to losses of more than 4% from last week. The declines followed an OPEC production increase, higher U.S. tariffs on trading partners, and growing expectations that Washington and Moscow could be nearing a ceasefire agreement over Ukraine. Brent crude futures dropped 52 cents, or 0.78%, to $66.07 a barrel by 0041 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude slid 58 cents to $63.30. Hopes for an end to sanctions restricting Russian oil supplies grew after Trump said on Friday that he would meet Putin in Alaska on August 15 to negotiate a resolution to the war in Ukraine. The development comes as the U.S. has been increasing pressure on Russia. Washington has warned that sanctions could be tightened further if no peace deal is reached. Trump had set last Friday as the deadline for Moscow to agree to a settlement, threatening secondary sanctions against buyers of Russian oil. At the same time, he is urging India to scale back its imports of Russian crude.

Bitcoin surged to the $122k mark and is now closing in on its all-time high price of $123k. Meanwhile, Ether added 20% to its value over the last seven days and now trades above $4,300 per coin. Other altcoins also recorded excellent gains over the last few days. PENDLE is another coin that rallied higher as it added 35% to its value in the last seven days. The coin is now looking to hit a new yearly high, with its all-time high price still 25% away. Pendle’s TVL hits a record $8.5 billion PENDLE, the native coin of the Pendle ecosystem, performed positively over the weekend. The coin rallied to a 2025 high of $6.014 before retracing to trade below $5.5. The positive performance comes after Pendle’s total value locked (TVL) reached a record $8.5 billion. The surge in its TVL is thanks to Pendle’s recently launched Boros platform. The new yield-trading platform, Boros, allows traders to go long or short on funding rates. Boros has attracted significant deposits and activity since its launch. According to Dune, Bitcoin’s funding rates averaged about 10% annualised this week and roughly $80 billion in open interest, resulting in more than $8 billion changing hands yearly between longs and shorts. This opens up a big market potential for Boros, resulting in Pendle’s TVL hitting a new all-time high. According to TheTie, activity on Pendle’s Arbitrum deployment has surged since the Boros launch, with active addresses reaching 1,428, well above the monthly average. PENDLE eyes a new 2025 high of $6.5 The PENDLE/USD 4-hour chart is bullish and efficient thanks to the coin’s rally over the past few days. The technical indicators are bullish but suggest that PENDLE could soar higher in the near term. Its Relative Strength Index of 74 shows that PENDLE is not yet in the overbought region, suggesting that investors are still bullish on the coin. The MACD lines are also within the positive territory, indicating a bullish bias. PENDLE has swiftly retraced below $5.5 after hitting a new yearly high of $6.014 a few hours ago. However, the coin could be sweeping the Transactional Liquidity (TLQ) at $5.3 before rallying higher. If the rally continues, PENDLE could hit a new 2025 high of $6.5 over the next few hours or days. An extended rally would allow it to come close to the all-time high price of $7.52 it set last year. However, if the market undergoes a correction, PENDLE could drop lower in the coming hours. If the TLQ at $5.3 fails to hold, PENDL could drop to the next major resistance level around $4.58.

The top cryptocurrency rose to $122,056, testing the 1.618% Fibonacci extension originating from the 2018 bear market low and the 2022 bear market low. The 1.618% extension is derived from the ""golden ratio,"" a revered mathematical constant in finance, which is widely found in nature and art. Many believe it also influences human psychology and market movements. This is the bulls' second attempt to scale the key resistance levels. They previously penetrated the same last month, but failed to sustain gains, which ultimately led to a price pullback to lows under $112,000. A successful hold above the ""golden ratio"" would cement expectations for a rally toward $140,000, the most popular call option strike on the crypto derivatives exchange Deribit. As of writing, the $140,000 call boasted a notional open interest of over $3 billion, according to data source Deribit Metrics. However, if the bulls fail to hold their ground for a second time, it would suggest the buying pressure is insufficient, potentially yielding a deeper correction. As of writing, BTC changed hands at $122,000, having hit a high of $122,171 during the early Asian trading hours, according to CoinDesk data. Focus on U.S. inflation Data due Tuesday is expected to show that the impact of Trump's tariffs crept into inflation in July, lifting price pressures in the economy. The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, is likely to have risen 0.3% in July, according to the median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In June, the core CPI increased by 0.2% from the previous month. A hotter-than-expected inflation print may trigger market volatility, but it is unlikely to deter the Fed from cutting rates in September, according to Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. In other words, the dollar's downtrend could continue after the CPI report, boding well for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. ""With U.S. interest rates still at the lower end of their ranges, despite a soft reception at the U.S. refunding last week, we suspect the market is vulnerable to what may prove to be the third consecutive monthly increase in the year-over-year headline and core CPI. After the report, we suspect the dollar's downtrend can resume,"" Chandler said in the market report on Sunday. He explained that July's weak jobs report was a significant turning point that raised bets for a Fed rate cut, ending the dollar's counter-trend recovery rally.

A significant Bitcoin price surge recently saw the leading digital asset reach an astounding new cryptocurrency all-time high on the South Korean exchange, Upbit. This remarkable achievement highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market and its continued growth, drawing attention to the unique conditions within the South Korean crypto market . What Drove This Upbit Bitcoin Record? On Upbit, South Korea’s premier cryptocurrency exchange, Bitcoin (BTC) briefly touched an incredible 166,884,000 won, equivalent to approximately $120,181. This monumental figure marks a new Upbit Bitcoin record , surpassing previous highs and capturing global attention. Several factors contribute to such localized price spikes, often distinct from global averages, and are key for accurate BTC price analysis . Kimchi Premium: A well-known phenomenon in the South Korean crypto market , the “Kimchi Premium” refers to Bitcoin trading at a higher price on South Korean exchanges compared to international platforms. This premium arises due to high demand, limited arbitrage opportunities, and capital controls. Strong Local Demand: South Korea boasts a highly active retail investor base with a significant appetite for cryptocurrencies. This consistent demand provides strong upward pressure on prices within the region. Market Liquidity: Upbit, being a dominant exchange in South Korea, commands substantial liquidity, allowing for large trades that can influence local price discovery. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for any comprehensive BTC price analysis . Was This a Global Cryptocurrency All-Time High? While the Upbit Bitcoin record is undeniably impressive, it’s important to differentiate it from a global cryptocurrency all-time high . The price of Bitcoin on Upbit often trades at a premium due to the “Kimchi Premium.” For instance, at the time of Upbit’s peak, Bitcoin’s global price on exchanges like Binance or Coinbase was lower, typically hovering around $70,000 to $71,000. This regional disparity underscores the fragmented nature of global crypto markets. However, a significant surge in a major market like South Korea can still send positive ripples across the international landscape. It contributes to overall market sentiment and hints at strong underlying demand for Bitcoin, even if it’s not a global cryptocurrency all-time high across all exchanges. Investors performing their own BTC price analysis should always consider both local and global market conditions to gain a complete picture. What Does This Bitcoin Price Surge Mean for Investors in the South Korean Crypto Market? The recent Bitcoin price surge on Upbit offers several insights for both current and prospective investors. Firstly, it reinforces Bitcoin’s resilience and its capacity to achieve new milestones, even if regionally. For those actively involved in the South Korean crypto market , it signifies robust local enthusiasm and potentially higher entry/exit points. For international investors, this event highlights the importance of monitoring regional trends as they can sometimes precede or influence broader market movements. It also serves as a reminder of Bitcoin’s inherent volatility and the potential for rapid price movements, both upwards and downwards. This dynamic nature is a key aspect of any effective BTC price analysis . When considering investments, conducting thorough BTC price analysis and understanding market nuances, such as the Kimchi Premium, is essential. Always remember that past performance does not guarantee future results. Navigating the Market: Tips for BTC Price Analysis and the Upbit Bitcoin Record Engaging with the South Korean crypto market , especially concerning the Upbit Bitcoin record , requires careful consideration. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Local Premiums: Keep an eye on the “Kimchi Premium” if you are trading across different jurisdictions. Significant premiums can present arbitrage opportunities, but also risks. Understand Regulatory Landscape: South Korea has an evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. Staying informed about local regulations is vital for compliance and risk management. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin’s performance is compelling, a diversified portfolio can mitigate risks associated with single asset volatility. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources and expert BTC price analysis to stay updated on market trends and potential shifts. The recent cryptocurrency all-time high on Upbit is a testament to Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and the unique dynamics of regional markets. This milestone not only excites the South Korean investor base but also provides valuable data points for a global understanding of Bitcoin’s trajectory. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, such records serve as significant markers of its journey towards broader adoption and integration into the global financial system. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the “Kimchi Premium”? The “Kimchi Premium” refers to the phenomenon where the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is higher on South Korean exchanges compared to international exchanges. This difference is often attributed to strong local demand and capital controls. 2. Did Bitcoin hit a new global all-time high? While Bitcoin reached a new record high on Upbit in South Korea, this was a regional record due to the “Kimchi Premium.” The global price of Bitcoin on most international exchanges was lower at that time. 3. Why is Bitcoin’s price often higher on Upbit? Bitcoin’s price on Upbit is often higher due to the “Kimchi Premium,” which results from high retail investor demand in South Korea and restrictions on capital outflows, making arbitrage difficult. 4. How does the South Korean crypto market impact global prices? While regional price spikes like the Upbit record don’t directly set global prices, they can indicate strong underlying demand and positive sentiment, potentially influencing broader market trends and investor confidence. 5. What should investors consider when trading in the South Korean crypto market?

The rally may have been aided by some signs of economic softness and increasing odds of a rate cut in September. However, analysts tend to think that the path ahead may remain choppy, with trade, macro, and geopolitical developments still casting darker clouds over markets. This week, all eyes are on inflation data and consumer sentiment reports, which could also sway the Federal Reserve in September. Economic Events August 11 to 15 July’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, not including food and energy, is due on Tuesday, and this is one of two primary gauges of inflation. Policymakers, businesses, and consumers closely monitor the CPI report, as it reflects price trends across the economy and shapes sentiment. It is expected to come in firmer at 2.8% from 2.7%. July’s Producer Price Index (PPI) report is due on Thursday, and this is another leading indicator of inflation as it reflects input costs for producers and manufacturers and impacts retail prices. Friday will see July’s retail sales data released, indicating how much consumers are spending on durable and non-durable goods and highlighting overall economic health. This is followed by the consumer sentiment and consumer inflation expectations preliminary readings, which summarize the findings of a monthly survey measuring consumer confidence and long-term inflation expectations in the US. Key Events This Week: 1. OPEC Monthly Report – Tuesday 2. July CPI Inflation data – Tuesday 3. July PPI Inflation data – Thursday 4. July Retail Sales data – Friday 5. MI Consumer Sentiment data – Friday 6. Total of 5 Fed speaker events It’s a big week for inflation data. — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) August 10, 2025 The current probability of a September rate cut stands at 88%, according to the CME futures Fed Watch tool. Earnings season is now nearing completion, so eyes are shifting to Nvidia, which is scheduled to report on August 27. Crypto Market Outlook Weekend momentum, which spilled over into Monday morning in Asia, has pushed total market capitalization up 2% on the day to an all-time high of $4.13 trillion. Bitcoin jumped more than 3% early on Monday to a four-week high of $121,850, as it came to within $1,000 of its all-time high. A new peak now seems inevitable. Ethereum was also outperforming, surging to an almost four-year high of $4,320 in early trading this week. ETH is now just 11.5% away from its 2021 all-time high. Only the top two were really making moves, and the rest of the altcoins were flat, aside from Hyperliquid and Chainlink, both adding more than 4% on the day.

Meanwhile, cybersecurity firm Koi Security uncovered “GreedyBear,” a group that stole over $1 million in crypto through a coordinated campaign of fake browser extensions, malware, and scam websites. Experts warn that such physical and digital threats are growing more sophisticated, and are targeting users of all sizes. Attacks Against Crypto Holders Surge At the Baltic Honeybadger 2025 conference in Riga, Latvia, the founder of SatoshiLabs Alena Vranova issued a scary warning about the growing threat of “wrench attacks” and other violent crimes targeting Bitcoin and cryptocurrency holders. These attacks are named after the idea of coercing someone to hand over their private keys under threat of physical harm, and they are reportedly increasing at an alarming rate, with 2025 on track to double the worst year on record. Vranova believes that this is not an issue confined to early Bitcoin adopters or wealthy investors. Even small holders have found themselves in the crosshairs of criminals. She specifically pointed out some incidents where victims were kidnapped, tortured, or murdered for amounts as low as $6,000 in crypto, with other cases involving $50,000 leading to deadly outcomes. Vranova said that these crimes are often facilitated by sensitive information leaks from centralized crypto exchanges and service providers that collect extensive user data under know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. According to her, over 80 million crypto user identities have been leaked online, with 2.2 million of those records including home addresses. This data provides criminals with very detailed information to locate and target victims and their families. The situation is aggravated by a clear correlation between Bitcoin’s market performance and the frequency of attacks. Vranov shared that violent incidents tend to rise sharply during bull markets, when valuations and investor enthusiasm are high. This year’s surge in physical crimes took place in parallel with a worrying number of high-profile data breaches. The correlation between BTC’s price and the number of physical attacks (Source: Glok.me ) In May, Coinbase disclosed a breach that exposed the home addresses and other identifying details of some of its customers. In June, a report from Cybernews revealed that databases containing over 16 billion leaked login credentials from major platforms like Apple, Facebook, and Google surfaced online. These leaks open the door to a number of secondary threats beyond physical violence, including phishing, social engineering, hacking, and identity theft. Overall, the sophistication and brazenness of those willing to use violence to seize digital assets is growing, and it is pushing many investors, developers, and executives to adopt stricter personal safety measures. GreedyBear Targets Crypto Users Crypto users have more than one target on their backs. Cybersecurity firm Koi Security uncovered a large-scale malicious campaign that stole more than $1 million in cryptocurrency by combining three different attack types—malicious browser extensions, malware, and scam websites. The group is called “GreedyBear,” and has been described by Koi Security researcher Tuval Admoni as having “redefined industrial-scale crypto theft” by deploying all three tactics simultaneously. Admoni pointed out that while cybercriminals often specialize in a single method, GreedyBear’s decision to operate on multiple fronts is the start of a shift toward more complex and ambitious scams targeting crypto users. The campaign involved more than 650 malicious tools, including over 150 fake browser extensions published to the Firefox marketplace. These extensions impersonated popular crypto wallets like MetaMask, TronLink, Exodus, and Rabby Wallet. By using a technique called “Extension Hollowing,” the attackers first created legitimate extensions to pass security checks, then later modified them to steal wallet credentials directly from user input fields within fake wallet interfaces. This method allowed the malicious extensions to maintain positive ratings and user trust before being weaponized. (Source: Medium ) In addition to browser-based attacks, GreedyBear deployed close to 500 samples of crypto-focused malware. These included credential stealers like LummaStealer, which targets wallet information, and ransomware like Luca Stealer, which demands payments in cryptocurrency. Much of the malware was distributed through Russian websites offering cracked or pirated software. The third arm of the operation involved an extensive network of scam websites posing as legitimate crypto products, hardware wallets, or wallet repair services. Unlike traditional phishing pages, these sites were designed to look like polished landing pages to lure unsuspecting users. One central server acted as a command-and-control hub, coordinating credential theft, ransomware operations, and scam deployments. Signs of AI-generated code were also found, which allowed the group to scale and diversify their attacks very rapidly. Admoni warned that this is “the new normal” for online threats against crypto holders, while Cyvers CEO Deddy Lavid believes there is an urgent need for better vetting by browser vendors, greater developer transparency, and stronger user vigilance to combat these very sophisticated and multifaceted attacks.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-11 05:30:00

As the crypto market looks to be in an uptrend, it is likely that the XRP price could see a continuation of the current bullish trend going into the new week. If this happens, crypto analyst Lingrid sees such a move leading the digital asset back toward its all-time high levels before the next major decline. XRP Price In A Perfect Position For Continuation In the analysis, Lingri points out that the XRP price is now holding support at a notable level, which is above $3. This comes after a crash below this level, as bears had beaten down the price. However, as the ascending trendline had moved, the cryptocurrency was able to break above, and this meant that it was a signal for a possible continuation. Related Reading: Ethereum Fractal Mirrors Bitcoin’s 2018-2021 Run, Ready For 1,110% Surge The analyst had initially predicted a decline back below $3.2, but the emphasis was on the fact that the $3.15 support is able to hold after the rebound. This level now becomes the level to watch, especially if the structure is able to remain intact from here. In the event of a bounce from the $3.15 support and a breakout, Lingrid expects a sharp upward movement for the XRP price. The buy zone here is placed at the $3.1-$3.2 levels, with a break above $3.4 being the confirmation of the buy trigger. Once the move is underway, a 20% move is expected to send the price toward $3.8. This is where the next major resistance lies for XRP once the break is complete. “A breakout above 3.4000 could open the way for accelerated upside movement. Trend bias remains bullish while price holds above key support,” Lingrid stated. Bears Could Still Take Control As is the case with any analysis, there is the possibility of an invalidation and that the XRP price would end up going the opposite direction. In this scenario, it is if there is another break below $3 again, which would serve as the invalidation move that will put bears back in control. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moves Into $12 Trillion Sector: Why BTC In 401Ks Is A Big Deal Lingrid explains that such a breakdown would shift the trend to bearish. There is also the possibility of limited upside brought about by a weakening of the market. Even in the event that the XRP altcoin does complete the bullish move to $3.8, the crypto analyst says the resistance near $3.8 could also trigger a sharp rejection.

Alongside ETH’s potential surge, meme coin PEPE and scaling-focused Ethena (ENA) are capturing headlines. Yet, speculation is mounting over whether $LBRETT could emerge as the market’s most explosive opportunity, promising eye-watering percentage gains. Ethereum Performance and Price Outlook Ethereum price momentum is under close watch, with analysts highlighting a possible move toward $6,000 before month-end. The Ethereum Foundation’s roadmap points to a Layer 1 throughput goal of about 400 TPS by late 2025. However, today’s transaction efficiency is largely driven by Layer 2 solutions—Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync—where throughput can reach into the tens of thousands of TPS. This scaling power minimizes congestion’s impact on Ethereum price shifts. As Layer 1 gas fees remain both high and volatile, these L2 networks attract more users, further solidifying ETH’s dominance across the DeFi sector and the broader blockchain market. Trending Meme Coins: PEPE and ENA Amid this backdrop, meme coins are again surging. PEPE has captured market attention, with its price trajectory echoing previous meme coin cycles. Although the latest data on PEPE’s market cap or specific price movement is limited, its trading volumes and online engagement remain robust. Similarly, Ethena (ENA) has experienced a rapid ascent, standing out among Layer 2-associated tokens. Both PEPE and ENA embody the speculative spirit driving much of the current market sentiment, offering high-risk, high-reward opportunities that attract a broad spectrum of investors. $LBRETT: The Potential 10,000% Meme Play? The emergence of $LBRETT as a potential contender for outsized gains—possibly up to 10,000%—has piqued community curiosity. However, unlike PEPE and Ethena (ENA), verifiable technical or financial data for $LBRETT remains absent from indexed open sources. There is no official information available regarding $LBRETT’s TPS, current gas fees, staking APY, presale stages, tokenomics, or total fundraising. Payment options for $LBRETT purchases, such as ETH, USDT, or BNB, are speculated to be supported, but direct confirmation from official channels is necessary. This information gap means investors seeking to evaluate $LBRETT’s fundamentals must consult its whitepaper directly and monitor its official platforms for real-time updates. Comparison: PEPE, Ethena (ENA) And $LBRETT Comparing PEPE, Ethena (ENA), and LayerBrett ($LBRETT) highlights a pattern. PEPE and Ethena (ENA) are established memes and Layer 2 tokens with high public visibility and trading activity, but $LBRETT remains in the speculative phase. PEPE and Ethena (ENA) both leverage Ethereum’s scaling roadmap and high community engagement to maintain momentum. In contrast, $LBRETT’s value proposition—potentially a Layer 2 meme coin targeting massive percentage returns—is hampered by a lack of public technical and financial details. Until $LBRETT’s ecosystem features, utility, and tokenomics are transparently disclosed, it remains a higher-risk, more speculative bet compared to the more established PEPE and Ethena (ENA). Conclusion The crypto market’s focus on Ethereum price, PEPE, Ethena (ENA), and emerging tokens like $LBRETT reflects both the ongoing demand for scalability and the risk/reward appetite of current investors. Ethereum’s scaling solutions maturing and with meme coins like PEPE and Ethena (ENA) sustaining attention, transparent data and ecosystem development will be key for $LBRETT. Early adopters are already moving, don’t miss LayerBrett’s presale stage.

An early investor, who got in on the ground floor during Ethereum’s initial coin offering, has just executed a massive ETH whale sale , sending ripples across the market. This kind of large-scale Ethereum transaction always grabs attention, and for good reason. Unpacking the Latest Ethereum Transaction: What We Know Just recently, an address linked to an original Ethereum ICO participant made headlines. This investor, who incredibly acquired 20,000 ETH for a mere $6,200 during the ICO phase, decided to offload a substantial portion of their holdings. The Sale: Approximately 2,300 ETH were sold. Value Realized: This transaction fetched a staggering $9.91 million. Remaining Holdings: Even after this significant sale, the address still retains 1,623 ETH, valued at about $6.99 million. This demonstrates the incredible foresight and patience of an early Ethereum investor . Their initial small investment has blossomed into a fortune, highlighting the transformative potential of early cryptocurrency adoption. What Does This ETH Whale Sale Mean for the Market? When an ETH whale sale of this magnitude occurs, it naturally prompts questions about its potential impact. Large transactions from long-dormant wallets or early participants can sometimes signal a shift in sentiment or an intention to take profits. Understanding the potential ETH price impact is crucial for market participants. For market observers, such moves are closely watched: Potential Price Pressure: A large sell-off can, in the short term, add selling pressure to the market, potentially influencing the ETH price impact . Market Confidence: While one sale doesn’t define the entire market, a series of similar actions from other early investors could suggest a broader trend of profit-taking. Liquidity Test: The market’s ability to absorb such a large transaction without significant volatility is also a testament to its current liquidity and depth. It’s important to remember that individual decisions by an Ethereum ICO participant are just one piece of a much larger and more complex market puzzle. The Astounding Journey of an Early Ethereum Investor Imagine turning $6,200 into tens of millions. That’s the reality for this particular early Ethereum investor . Their journey underscores the parabolic growth of Ethereum since its inception. Ethereum’s ICO took place in 2014, long before it became a household name in the crypto space. Participants then took a significant risk, investing in a nascent technology with unproven potential. Today, Ethereum powers a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications, NFTs, and DeFi protocols, making it a cornerstone of the digital economy. This investor’s decision to sell now, while still holding a substantial amount, could be strategic profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or simply liquidating assets for personal reasons. Each Ethereum transaction by these early holders tells a story of incredible wealth creation. Considering the Broader ETH Price Impact While a $9.91 million sale is substantial, the overall ETH price impact from this single transaction might be limited given Ethereum’s daily trading volume, which often runs into billions of dollars. However, the psychological effect of an ""old"" wallet moving funds can sometimes be disproportionate to the actual volume. Traders and analysts often monitor whale movements using on-chain data tools. These tools help identify large transactions, wallet dormancy, and fund flows, providing insights into potential market trends. This specific Ethereum transaction was highlighted by Lookonchain, a well-known on-chain analytics firm, demonstrating the transparency inherent in blockchain technology. The continued holdings of 1,623 ETH by this participant suggest they still have faith in Ethereum’s long-term prospects, or perhaps they are simply diversifying their immense gains. A Glimpse into Crypto Wealth The story of this Ethereum ICO participant serves as a powerful reminder of the life-changing wealth that early adoption in disruptive technologies can bring. It also highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market, where large movements by key players are constant points of interest. While significant, this ETH whale sale is a snapshot in time. The Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, with ongoing developments like the Dencun upgrade and future scalability solutions. The market will undoubtedly continue to absorb such transactions as it matures. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who was the Ethereum ICO participant mentioned in the article? A specific early investor who acquired 20,000 ETH during Ethereum’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2014. Q2: How much ETH did the participant initially acquire during the ICO? The participant initially acquired 20,000 ETH for just $6,200. Q3: What was the value of the recent ETH sale? The recent sale involved 2,300 ETH, valued at $9.91 million at the time of the transaction. Q4: How much ETH does the participant still hold after the sale? Even after this significant sale, the address still holds 1,623 ETH, currently valued at approximately $6.99 million. Q5: What is the potential market impact of such a large sale? While a single large sale might have limited direct ETH price impact on the overall market due to high trading volumes, it can create short-term selling pressure and influence market sentiment, especially when coming from an early Ethereum investor . Q6: Why do early investor sales matter in the crypto market? Sales by early investors, often referred to as ""whales,"" are closely watched as they can indicate profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or a shift in long-term conviction, offering insights into market dynamics.

No immediate catalyst or news event seemed to create the demand bump, but the rapid price movement suggests a wealthy player purchased an unusually high amount of tokens in anticipation of future volatility to the upside. As such, on-chain metrics show a spike in coin creation activity on Sunday, with 47,000 issuances from 21,000 creators, marking the highest such figures since July 31. Zora, an OP Stack Layer 2 built for creators and media minting, was added to the “Base App” discovery flow in mid-July, improving retail access and boosting creator-side activity. Trading volume spiked to $284 million on Sunday from under $160 million a day prior. The rally came as major derivatives venues, including Binance, introduced ZORA perpetual contracts with leverage up to 50x — widening directional access and drawing speculative capital into the market. These listings have likely compressed spreads and deepened liquidity, fueling both spot and leveraged positioning in the Base ecosystem token. The ZORA token was launched in April via a retroactive airdrop to early users, leaving a relatively tight free float.

As 2025 shapes up to be a defining year for digital assets, a handful of meme coins are stealing the spotlight with viral momentum, major community backing, and signals that have whales taking notice. For anyone scanning the market for the top cryptos to join in 2025, this new lineup has the potential to change the game. In the latest analyst discussions, four projects are consistently highlighted for their explosive upside, unique stories, and surging social buzz. From Ethereum to Solana, these meme coins each bring something different, whether it’s a historic community, viral narrative, or a wave of exclusive early access that’s sparking headlines. Here’s a closer look at the top cryptos to join in 2025, and why each deserves a spot on every savvy trader’s radar. 1. MoonBull: The Bulls Are Moving Early The race is on for early access to one of the top cryptos to join in 2025, and only those on the inside will have a shot. MoonBull ($MOBU), built on Ethereum, is making waves among meme coin fans and high-risk traders by opening an ultra-limited whitelist for its explosive launch. Whitelisted users get more than just bragging rights. They secure entry at the lowest price available, unlock exclusive staking rewards, and receive bonus token allocations that won’t be available to the public. MoonBull goes further by delivering private roadmap hints and secret drops only to whitelist members, ensuring early adopters have every advantage before launch. Inside the Moon Bull Advantage Getting whitelisted is the only way in, public details are tightly locked down, and spots fill in seconds as soon as word gets out. Analysts point to the viral surge in demand, with the coin’s “run with the bulls” energy dominating social feeds and influencer channels. Every aspect is tailored to reward fast movers: the quicker the entry, the bigger the potential upside. To claim a spot, traders need to submit an email through a secure whitelist form. Whitelisted users are privately notified of Stage One’s exact time and date before anyone else. With a capped supply and massive hype, analysts say this is one of the top cryptos to join in 2025 for anyone who doesn’t want to miss out on the next meme coin stampede. 2. Peanut the Squirrel: Community Roots Drive Viral Growth Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) brings a heartwarming backstory and community-first spirit to the top cryptos to join in 2025. Originating on the Solana blockchain, this meme coin was inspired by Peanut, a real-life squirrel whose internet fame sparked a movement for animal welfare. The project honors Peanut’s legacy and his caretaker, fostering a sense of mission that goes beyond trading. Analysts have noticed the viral appeal behind PNUT, as well as its growing traction on social channels. The token’s mission to support animal causes and community initiatives has built genuine loyalty, with early holders rallying behind both the story and the coin’s meme power. Solana’s ecosystem gives PNUT speed and accessibility, making it attractive to both traders and those passionate about cause-driven crypto. Why did this coin make it to this list? Peanut the Squirrel stands out for its emotional narrative, viral adoption, and ability to turn a powerful story into sustained crypto momentum, key factors for any top cryptos to join in 2025 list. 3. Goatseus Maximus: Meme Culture Meets AI Innovation Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) is a viral Solana meme coin with a unique twist: it harnesses the power of meme culture alongside an AI-powered bot, Truth Terminal (ToT), that fuels ongoing engagement. GOAT’s community is fiercely dedicated, using inside jokes, bold memes, and creative campaigns to keep the project in the crypto conversation. GOAT isn’t just about laughs. The project’s speculative trading activity, active liquidity pools, and rapid social buzz have caught the attention of analysts and traders alike. With whales circling the action and new viral memes dropping almost daily, GOAT continues to evolve as one of the most engaging stories in the Solana ecosystem. Why did this coin make it to this list?

The whispers suggested a groundbreaking partnership to launch the world’s first rare earth RMB stablecoin. However, Ant Group, a prominent affiliate of Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group, has now stepped forward with a crucial denial. This official statement aims to clarify the situation and protect the public from misinformation. What Were the Ant Group Stablecoin Rumors About? Reports had circulated claiming that Ant Group was collaborating with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Rare Earth Group. The purported goal was to develop an innovative rare earth RMB stablecoin . This concept, linking a digital currency to a physical commodity like rare earth elements, captured significant attention within the cryptocurrency community. The rumors suggested a unique form of stablecoin, different from those backed by fiat currencies or other digital assets. The involvement of such high-profile entities like Ant Group and the PBOC added weight to the unverified claims. Speculation quickly grew about the potential impact of such a digital asset on global finance and commodity markets. Why Did Ant Group Issue This Crucial Denial? According to JinSe Finance on August 11, Ant Group firmly stated that it has no such plans for a rare earth RMB stablecoin . The company emphasized the importance of verifying information. This clear and direct denial serves as a vital warning to the public. The primary reason for Ant Group’s statement is to combat misinformation and prevent potential scams. In the fast-evolving world of digital assets, false claims can lead to significant financial losses for unsuspecting individuals. Ant Group’s action reinforces its commitment to transparency and user protection. The Broader Picture: China’s Digital Currency Landscape This incident occurs within a broader context of significant stablecoin development and digital currency innovation, particularly in China. The People’s Bank of China has been a pioneer in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) with its ongoing rollout of the digital yuan (e-CNY). This official digital currency is designed to be a legal tender, not a speculative asset. Unlike the digital yuan, the concept of a rare earth RMB stablecoin would introduce a different type of digital asset, potentially backed by a volatile commodity. This distinction is important for understanding China’s cautious approach to private digital currencies and its focus on its own CBDC. The government maintains strict controls over cryptocurrency activities, making any private stablecoin initiative highly unlikely without official endorsement. Protecting Yourself: A Crypto Scams Warning The incident highlights a persistent challenge in the digital asset space: the prevalence of false information and scams. Ant Group’s warning serves as a timely reminder for everyone. When encountering news about new cryptocurrencies or investment opportunities, especially those involving major companies or governments, always exercise extreme caution. Key steps to protect yourself: Verify Sources: Always check if information comes from official, reputable channels. Be Skeptical of Unrealistic Promises: High returns with no risk are often red flags. Understand the Technology: Learn the basics of how digital currencies work before investing. Consult Experts: Seek advice from trusted financial advisors if unsure. This crypto scams warning is not just for new investors but for everyone navigating the complex digital landscape. Navigating the Digital Asset World Responsibly Ant Group’s swift denial of the Ant Group stablecoin rumors underscores the need for vigilance in the digital asset market. While innovation in stablecoin development continues globally, it is crucial to differentiate between legitimate projects and speculative, unverified claims. The focus for China remains on its official China digital currency , the e-CNY, rather than commodity-backed private stablecoins. Always prioritize due diligence and rely on confirmed information from official sources. This approach helps ensure you make informed decisions and avoid falling victim to misleading narratives or outright scams. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, a commodity like gold, or a basket of assets, to reduce price volatility. Q2: What is Ant Group? Ant Group is a financial technology company based in China, an affiliate of Alibaba Group. It operates Alipay, one of the world’s largest mobile payment platforms, and offers various financial services, including lending, insurance, and wealth management. Q3: Does China have its own digital currency? Yes, China has been actively developing and piloting its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) called the digital yuan, or e-CNY. It is issued by the People’s Bank of China and is intended to be a digital form of the country’s fiat currency. Q4: Why were there rumors about a rare earth stablecoin? The exact origin of the rumors is unclear, but they likely stemmed from a combination of public interest in new stablecoin models, China’s prominent role in rare earth production, and the country’s ongoing digital currency initiatives, leading to speculative connections. Q5: How can individuals avoid crypto scams? To avoid crypto scams, always verify information from official sources, be wary of promises of guaranteed high returns, understand the technology before investing, use reputable exchanges, and never share your private keys or sensitive personal information.

This significant rally has pushed the value of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s personal holdings past an astonishing $1 billion mark. This milestone highlights not only Buterin’s personal success but also the broader bullish sentiment sweeping across the crypto landscape. What’s Driving This Incredible Ethereum Price Rally? Recent reports shed light on the powerful forces behind Ethereum’s upward trajectory. A key factor is the escalating corporate demand for ETH. Institutions are increasingly looking to acquire significant amounts of the asset, leading to a notable supply shortage in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. OTC Market Dynamics: Large institutional purchases often occur via OTC desks. Current demand, however, outstrips this supply. Public Market Influx: This scarcity compels major players to turn to public exchanges, directly pushing the Ethereum price higher. Increased Scarcity: As more ETH is bought and potentially locked up, circulating supply decreases, further contributing to price appreciation. This dynamic creates a feedback loop, where rising prices attract more attention, potentially leading to further demand. The Billion-Dollar Impact: Vitalik Buterin’s Holdings Explained The news of Vitalik Buterin ‘s holdings surpassing $1 billion comes directly from data analyzed by Arkham, as reported by BeInCrypto. The address widely presumed to belong to the Ethereum co-founder currently holds over 240,000 ETH. This substantial holding demonstrates his continued commitment and belief in the project he co-created. His net worth fluctuating with the ETH rally is a clear indicator of the direct link between a project’s success and its founder’s personal stake. While his holdings are public, such valuations are highly volatile. Nevertheless, this milestone underscores the immense value accumulated within the Ethereum network. Is Institutional Demand Fueling the Next ETH Rally to $5,000? The growing institutional demand for Ethereum is a significant shift in the cryptocurrency investment landscape. Large corporations and financial institutions recognize Ethereum’s utility beyond just a speculative asset, viewing it as a foundational technology for future financial systems and decentralized applications. This sustained interest from institutional players is fueling significant market speculation. Many analysts are now openly discussing the possibility of ETH’s price surpassing the $5,000 mark. This optimism is rooted in: Real-World Utility: Ethereum’s role in DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise blockchain solutions. Network Upgrades: Continuous improvements enhance scalability and efficiency. Evolving Regulations: Increasing clarity could encourage more institutional participation. These factors paint a bullish picture for the next phase of the ETH rally . Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends The strong performance of Ethereum is a key highlight in the broader crypto market trends . It reflects renewed investor confidence in established blockchain technologies. This positive sentiment often influences other major cryptocurrencies and the altcoin market. For investors, understanding these trends means paying attention to: Supply-Demand Dynamics: How institutional buying impacts available supply. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions can influence crypto markets. Technological Developments: Protocol upgrades and new use cases drive long-term value. While the market remains volatile, increasing maturity and institutional interest suggest a shift towards more stable, utility-driven growth for assets like Ethereum. In conclusion, Vitalik Buterin’s achievement of crossing the $1 billion mark in ETH holdings is a symbolic moment for the entire Ethereum ecosystem. It underscores the profound impact of the recent Ethereum price surge, driven significantly by escalating institutional demand. As the market continues to evolve, the narrative around Ethereum shifts from speculative asset to a critical piece of the future digital economy, with many eyes set on that ambitious $5,000 price target. This period truly highlights the dynamic and transformative power of decentralized technologies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How much ETH does Vitalik Buterin hold? A1: Vitalik Buterin’s presumed address holds over 240,000 ETH, according to Arkham data. Q2: What is causing the current Ethereum price rally? A2: Growing corporate and institutional demand for ETH, leading to OTC supply shortages and increased buying on public exchanges, drives the Ethereum price rally. Q3: What is the significance of Vitalik Buterin’s holdings surpassing $1 billion? A3: This milestone highlights Ethereum’s significant appreciation and the immense value created within its ecosystem, showcasing the direct link between the project’s success and its founder’s stake. Q4: Is it possible for ETH to reach $5,000? A4: Market speculation, fueled by strong institutional demand, Ethereum’s utility, and network upgrades, suggests ETH’s price could surpass $5,000 in the near future.

49900281,https://invezz.com/?p=2833634,1754891814,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,How this altcoin could deliver a 24x return before ETH retests ATH,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/11/how-this-altcoin-could-deliver-a-24x-return-before-eth-retests-ath/,"As Ethereum (ETH) approaches its next all-time high retest, another contender is preparing to seize the spotlight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035 per token, has already secured over $14.30 million in funding from more than 15,000 holders. With 15% of the tokens already sold in this phase, the price is on track to rise to $0.040 soon — a momentum shift that early entrants are positioned to benefit from. The strength behind this rapid traction lies in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s purpose-driven approach to decentralized finance. Designed as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol, it will enable lenders to deposit assets into liquidity pools and earn interest, while borrowers will access overcollateralized loans without giving up their exposure to asset price growth. This model is built to address real user needs in the DeFi ecosystem while creating consistent demand for the MUTM token. A lending ecosystem with layer-2 speed and a sustainable reward model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will integrate a pooled liquidity model, removing the need for individual loan matching and ensuring continuous liquidity for participants. Interest rates will adjust automatically based on pool utilization, and reserve factors will maintain stability during high-demand periods. In its P2C (peer-to-contract) model, interest rates will fluctuate dynamically according to pool usage, while its P2P (peer-to-peer) option will allow borrowers and lenders to negotiate terms directly. Participants who deposit into the protocol will receive mtTokens — ERC-20 compliant tokens that represent their deposited assets and accrued interest. These mtTokens will be transferable, tradable, and usable as collateral within the Mutuum ecosystem and beyond. For example, a user depositing $15,000 USDT will receive mtUSDT on a 1:1 basis, and at a 15% APY, this will generate $2,250 in yearly income — all without ceding custody of their funds. To enhance efficiency and user experience, the protocol’s planned migration to Layer-2 technology will provide faster transaction speeds and lower gas costs compared to Layer-1 platforms. Alongside this, the introduction of a dedicated stablecoin will add another layer of utility, appealing to both lenders seeking steady returns and borrowers prioritizing price stability. A portion of the platform’s revenue will be allocated to regular open-market buybacks of MUTM tokens, with the repurchased tokens distributed as rewards to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in the smart contracts. This buyback-and-distribute system is designed to generate consistent buy pressure while directly rewarding community members, embedding value into the ecosystem from the inside out. Clear roadmap, strong security, and a path to 24x gains The development trajectory for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is mapped across four distinct phases. The presale will transition into a beta launch, introducing live platform features to early adopters. From there, platform upgrades will expand functionality and user capacity before culminating in final exchange listings. Targets include major platforms such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken — each capable of significantly amplifying trading volume and global visibility. Security measures have already been implemented ahead of launch. A comprehensive CertiK audit has awarded Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78, underscoring its high-quality code and secure infrastructure. To further strengthen community trust, a $50,000 Bug Bounty program will invite independent security researchers to test the platform’s resilience, offering rewards of up to $2,000 for the discovery of critical vulnerabilities. The presale structure itself has been designed to reward early participation. With the listing price set at $0.06, investors entering at the current $0.035 level will see an immediate price uplift on listing day on paper. Early-phase participants, some of whom built positions alongside ETH and AVAX holdings, are already positioned to multiply their gains once the token begins trading on major exchanges. Given the expected trajectory from presale growth, platform launch, user adoption, and listing momentum, the opportunity for a 24x return before Ethereum (ETH) reaches its next ATH stands as a bold yet achievable target. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is aligning its tokenomics, product utility, and security foundation to create both immediate presale value and long-term growth potential. For investors seeking to capture outsized returns ahead of a major market shift, this presale phase is the critical window before wider market exposure accelerates demand beyond reach.

From decentralized AI frameworks to DeFi-powered cross-chain systems, development remains active. Among the names showing renewed confidence and growth are Render, Polygon, and Polkadot, each benefiting from expanding ecosystems. Yet BlockDAG is drawing particular interest as a strong Layer 1 contender. Its presale price of $0.0016 and rapid growth metrics position it as the top performing crypto right now. Supported by an active ecosystem, worldwide outreach efforts, and a 10 BTC reward pool, BlockDAG is showing consistent delivery. This review looks at why these four projects are in focus this week and why market watchers are closely following the new leaders shaping the current trend. BlockDAG: The $0.0016 Contender Making an Impact BlockDAG is becoming one of the most discussed names among top performing crypto projects in the presale space, with clear numbers backing its rise. A confirmed listing price of $0.05 later this year gives early buyers at $0.0016 the chance for a 30x return. It has already secured $368 million in funds, over 200,000 holders, and 2.5 million global downloads of its X1 mobile mining app. The project combines Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with Proof-of-Work for a faster and more decentralized Layer 1 network. With 19,000 miners sold and a working demo trading platform live, its progress is tangible. Its 10 BTC Auction Pool, worth over $1.1 million, adds further activity to the presale. With its GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11 to attract worldwide attention, BlockDAG (BDAG) is entering with users, capital, and a live ecosystem. While many Layer 1 projects start with little more than plans, this one is launching with proven traction, making it a clear name in the top performing crypto category this quarter. Render: Visual Backbone of Blockchain AI In the growing decentralized AI ecosystem, Render (RNDR) is taking on a distinct role. While networks like Bittensor act as the “brain” for AI coordination, Render functions as the “eye,” supplying GPU rendering power for visualizing and training AI models. As outlined by Indodax Academy, this makes Render an essential part of blockchain-based AI infrastructure. Its accessibility stands out. The process of renting or providing GPU rendering power is clear and easy to grasp, especially when compared to more complex AI protocols such as TAO. This simplicity can drive adoption, particularly for those new to AI-focused crypto. With global demand for GPU capacity on the rise, Render’s strategic position becomes even more important. This is why it continues to appear on lists of top performing crypto projects that merge AI with blockchain utility. Polygon: Strengthening Liquidity and Market Signals Polygon (POL), previously MATIC, is reinforcing its place in the market through infrastructure growth and partnerships. This week, DeFi platform Fluid expanded liquidity incentives across multiple chains, highlighting Polygon alongside Arbitrum and Base. This move is improving cross-chain liquidity, a key factor in DeFi development. Technically, POL’s recent move above its 50-day EMA ($0.2149) and 200-day EMA ($0.2177) has caught trader attention, pointing to possible bullish momentum. The combination of technical improvement and ongoing enterprise collaborations has strengthened market confidence in its direction. Polygon’s steady performance in scaling and interoperability explains why it remains on top performing crypto watchlists within the infrastructure space. Polkadot: Steady Growth Backed by Institutional Interest Polkadot (DOT) saw a 4% climb from $3.65 to $3.80 this week, with buying activity largely coming from institutional players. Strong price support near $3.68 adds to its stability, while analysts see potential for a breakout if momentum continues. Although Binance notes DOT is still consolidating, its recent movement shows underlying strength. As parachain auctions and interoperability solutions regain attention, Polkadot is reasserting its relevance in the broader crypto conversation. Even without dramatic headlines, its role in building scalable, long-term blockchain infrastructure ensures it keeps a place among top performing crypto projects. Final Say The market may shift quickly, but certain projects are shaping the next stage of development. Render is fueling the AI vision layer, Polygon is expanding DeFi’s liquidity networks, and Polkadot is reinforcing multi-chain scalability. Yet, BlockDAG is emerging as the leading name right now. Priced at $0.0016 in its presale phase, with a confirmed $0.05 listing ahead, it shows 30x ROI potential. Its growing community, functional ecosystem, and 10 BTC prize pool highlight why it is dominating this quarter’s top performing crypto discussions. As its August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release approaches, the spotlight will only intensify. These projects are not just short-term stories but possible foundations for the next market cycle.

But big launches are not the only thing players look for. They want platforms with clarity, access, and value every time they log in. This is where Spartans continues to stand out. It offers 5,963 games, instant crypto withdrawals, and a clear 300% welcome bonus without tricky conditions. Spartans is already live worldwide and built for user needs. While others focus on new offers and updates, Spartans is already delivering. Sky Bet Aims for Football Fans with £50 Bonus Sky Bet is celebrating the EFL season return with a promo aimed at football acca players. New users placing a £10 accumulator with at least five legs at minimum 1/1 odds receive five £10 free bet tokens. These can only be used on football accas with 5+ selections, keeping the focus on weekend betting. Its “Acca Freeze” feature lets players lock in winning legs mid-game, settling bets early to secure partial wins. This works across most football leagues and can protect against last-minute changes. There is also a £2 free acca bet for all users on League One and League Two games with a simple opt-in via the ‘Promotions’ tab. The campaign boosts activity early in the season, though the bonuses are limited by market and expiry rules. ESPN Plans Betting App for NFL Season ESPN will release its all-in-one streaming app in Fall 2025 before the NFL season starts. The app will offer “enhanced betting features,” better ESPN BET integration, and custom SportsCenter content. While full details are not public, the goal is to let users check stats, place live bets, and watch games in one place. The launch builds on ESPN’s 2024 test that linked live events with in-app betting during tournaments like the PGA Championship. Partner Penn Entertainment hopes the update will help ESPN BET gain market share against leaders like DraftKings and FanDuel. ESPN BET’s Q1 2025 results showed an $89M EBITDA loss, better than Q4 2024’s $110M loss. With a $1.5 billion, 10-year deal and an opt-out clause coming soon, the Fall launch will be crucial. ESPN is betting that mixing media with betting will finally turn viewers into regular players. Why Spartans Focuses on Consistent Results Over Hype While many platforms focus on short-term offers or heavy betting integrations, Spartans is showing what a crypto-first betting site can truly deliver. The platform is fast, simple to use, and built for players worldwide. There are no region blocks, hidden exclusions, or mandatory app downloads. That alone makes it stand out. Spartans offers a 300% welcome bonus with a 35x wagering requirement, and the terms are clear from the start. Unlike sites that limit bonuses by region or hide extra conditions, Spartans puts all the details upfront. Players see the seven-day bonus period, withdrawal rules, and eligible games before placing a single bet. The library includes over 5,963 games covering crash games, slots, blackjack, live roulette, baccarat, and esports betting. Sports fans have access to tools like live stats, combo bets with boosted odds, and instant updates for leagues such as EPL, UFC, NBA, and more. Crypto withdrawals in BTC, ETH, and USDT are processed instantly with no repeated verification checks or manual hold-ups. There is also an affiliate program with flexible options, including CPA, Rev Share, or Hybrid models. Tracking is accurate, and commission payouts arrive without delays. In a market full of loyalty schemes that give little in return, Spartans provides real benefits that hold value over time. Final Word on Why Spartans Stands Apart Sky Bet and ESPN BET are focusing on well-timed offers, platform rollouts, and integrated features. Yet many of these perks come with geo limits, delayed payments, or bonuses tied to strict betting rules. Spartans avoids these hurdles. It operates globally, pays out quickly, and keeps the process straightforward. There are no loyalty tiers, no blocked countries, and no unnecessary extras. Whether you enjoy weekend football betting or want to use your crypto with no restrictions, Spartans proves the point. Initial promotions might get attention, but long-term performance is what keeps users coming back, and Spartans delivers that every time.

This steady decline has come with the price struggles triggered by uncertain market headwinds that have seen investors take a more conservative stance on the market. In this report, we take a look at the Dogecoin open interest and how it has performed over the last week, with the possibility of a price reversal. Dogecoin Open Interest Still Above $3 Billion The Dogecoin open interest has still remained high despite not breaking its all-time high levels yet. Back in January 2025, the open interest had reached $5.5 billion, which remains its highest level yet, before crashing back down. Then, in July 2025, it seemed as though this peak would be surpassed. However, the month’s high was only $5.35 billion before spiraling back downward again. After the July peaks, there has been a 40% decline in the Dogecoin open interest going into the month of August. So far, though, the open interest has managed to stay at an average of $3 billion, suggesting that there is still a lot of interest in the meme coin . With what looks like a recovery in the open interest, bouncing off from its early August lows, the Dogecoin price could be gearing up to follow through . Historically, periods of high open interest have coincided with periods of price rallies, a trend that has been maintained over time. This is even noticeable in the fluctuations that have dominated the open interest recently, as the price has wobbled accordingly. Where Could The DOGE Price Be Headed? Looking at the historical performance of Dogecoin in the month of August, it shows that it could be hit or miss for the meme coin. There have been more red closes for this month compared to green closes over the years, with the last three years in a row closing in the red, data from Coinglass shows. However, there has been some bullish momentum for Dogecoin this month after a quick bounce, putting it so far at an approximate 7% increase already. If the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices do continue to rally, then it is possible that the meme coin will rise in tandem and the month of August could sloe in the green like it did back in 2021 in a post-Bitcoin halving year.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|Dogecoin open interest|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|open interest,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-11 06:00:39

From there, it gained about 3% through Sunday and is now within striking distance of the $123,218 peak set on July 14. Technical readings show the bullish momentum is still in play. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is at 65, well above the neutral 50 mark, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signaled a bullish crossover on Monday. These conditions point to the possibility of another leg up, though analysts caution that if the rally loses steam, Bitcoin could fall toward $116,000, a key daily support level. Trump policy changes and ETF inflows boost demand On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order instructing the Labor Department to work toward allowing 401(k) retirement plans to hold cryptocurrencies, private equity, and other alternative assets. The change could open millions of retirement accounts to Bitcoin, potentially increasing buying activity. Analyst Fan said opening up these accounts to higher-risk investments could bring in “significant” demand. Institutional flows remain another strong driver. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $253 million in net inflows over the past week, keeping demand high despite some price consolidation after last month’s peak. Ethereum also saw strong interest, hitting its highest level since December 2021. Spot ether ETFs drew in $461 million last week, surpassing Bitcoin’s ETF inflows and underscoring strong institutional participation in both assets. Global markets watch inflation, trade deadlines, and currency moves In U.S. equities, futures inched higher Sunday night. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 56 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures both gained 0.1%. The uptick followed a strong close last week, with the Nasdaq Composite setting a new high, the S&P 500 just shy of another record, and the Dow buoyed by a rally in Apple. Despite these gains, some investors remain cautious. Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said the market might “be more in a digestion phase” and could see sideways movement. This week’s inflation data will be a major focus, with the consumer price index (CPI) due Tuesday and the producer price index (PPI) on Thursday. Woods stressed that “the most important thing is the CPI data” for shaping expectations ahead of the Federal Reserve’s September meeting. These reports come before the Fed’s Jackson Hole gathering in Wyoming on August 21-23, which could set the tone for future rate decisions. In Europe, IG futures suggest a positive open, with London’s FTSE 100 slightly higher, France’s CAC 40 up 0.2%, Germany’s DAX rising 0.3%, and Italy’s FTSE MIB up 0.5%. Asian markets were quieter overnight as traders awaited word on whether the U.S.-China tariff truce will be extended past its August 12 deadline. The truce, currently set for 90 days, has helped ease tensions that had threatened to disrupt trade flows. Emerging-market assets are also gaining. A weaker U.S. dollar boosted developing-market currencies, with the Indonesian rupiah leading gains in Asia. The Romanian leu and Czech koruna outperformed in broader emerging markets ahead of planned talks between the U.S. and Russia. An MSCI index of emerging-market currencies edged higher, while an MSCI gauge of EM stocks rose 0.2%. Traders are watching for signs of a more dovish Fed, potential extensions to the U.S.-China tariff truce, and progress in the U.S.-Russia discussions later this week; factors they believe could help drive the next phase of gains in developing markets.

One powerful indicator that offers a glimpse into collective investor sentiment is the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratio . This metric provides vital insights into how traders are positioning themselves, whether they anticipate price increases or decreases for Bitcoin, offering a window into the market’s immediate expectations. What Does the Long-Short Ratio Reveal About Crypto Trading Sentiment? The long-short ratio is a straightforward yet potent tool for market analysis. It precisely measures the proportion of traders holding long positions versus those holding short positions on a particular asset, in this case, BTC perpetual futures . A ‘long’ position reflects a trader’s belief that the asset’s price will rise, allowing them to profit from an upward movement. Conversely, a ‘short’ position indicates an expectation of a price fall, aiming to profit from a downward trend. When this ratio stands above 1, it clearly indicates that more traders are currently long than short, suggesting a generally bullish crypto trading sentiment across the board. On the other hand, a ratio below 1 points to a more bearish outlook, where short positions outweigh long ones. Consistently monitoring this ratio helps market participants gauge the prevailing mood and potential directional biases within the Bitcoin futures market , offering a proactive view of collective market psychology. Unpacking the Latest Bitcoin Futures Market Data Over the past 24 hours, the aggregated long-short ratio for BTC perpetual futures across major exchanges shows a relatively balanced, yet slightly bullish, lean. The overall breakdown of trader positioning reveals: Total: Long 50.68%, Short 49.32% This near 50/50 split suggests a cautious optimism pervading the market, with a marginal edge given to those betting on a price increase for Bitcoin. While the overall picture appears balanced, the true nuances often emerge when we examine individual exchange data. Each platform typically caters to a slightly different demographic of traders, leading to variations in their respective sentiment indicators. Diving into Trader Positioning Across Top Exchanges Analyzing the data from leading platforms provides a more nuanced understanding of trader positioning and how sentiment might vary. Here’s how the top three exchanges in terms of volume and activity stack up for their long-short ratio : Binance: Long 51.43%, Short 48.57% Bybit: Long 52.33%, Short 47.67% Gate.io: Long 48.46%, Short 51.54% Binance and Bybit, both prominent players in the cryptocurrency derivatives space, show a stronger inclination towards long positions among their users. This signals a more pronounced bullish conviction within their respective user bases, with Bybit exhibiting the highest long bias among these three. In stark contrast, Gate.io presents a different scenario, revealing a higher percentage of short positions. This suggests a more cautious or even bearish outlook from traders on that specific platform, potentially indicating different risk appetites or regional influences. These variations can stem from several factors, including differing liquidity pools, regional user preferences, or even the typical trading strategies prevalent on each exchange. Understanding these differences is absolutely key to forming a comprehensive and accurate market perspective, as a single aggregated number might not tell the whole story of crypto trading sentiment . Actionable Insights for Your Bitcoin Futures Strategy How can you effectively leverage this long-short ratio data in your own trading decisions? Firstly, it is vital to remember that these ratios serve as sentiment indicators, not definitive trading signals. They provide a valuable snapshot of collective market emotion rather than a guaranteed prediction of future price movements. Consider these actionable insights to integrate this data into your strategy: Confirming Trends: If your independent analysis suggests Bitcoin is poised for a rally, a consistently high long-short ratio across multiple exchanges can act as a powerful confirmation of widespread bullish sentiment, reinforcing your conviction. Spotting Contrarian Opportunities: Conversely, an extremely skewed ratio (e.g., overwhelmingly long positions) might suggest over-optimism or “crowding,” potentially preceding a market correction or even a “long squeeze.” A savvy trader might look for contrarian opportunities in such scenarios. Risk Management: Always combine this ratio data with other forms of analysis, including technical indicators, on-chain metrics, and broader macroeconomic factors. The Bitcoin futures market remains inherently volatile, and prudent risk management, including setting stop-losses and managing position sizes, is paramount to protect your capital. Monitoring BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios offers a powerful lens into the current pulse of the crypto market. While not a standalone predictor, it provides invaluable insight into trader positioning and prevailing sentiment. By understanding these dynamics across various exchanges, market participants can make more informed decisions and navigate the complexities of Bitcoin’s derivatives landscape with greater confidence. Stay informed, stay strategic. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are BTC perpetual futures? BTC perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, allowing positions to be held indefinitely as long as margin requirements are met. How is the long-short ratio calculated? The long-short ratio is calculated by dividing the total number of long positions by the total number of short positions on an exchange or across multiple exchanges for a specific asset. It can also represent the volume or value of these positions. Does a high long-short ratio always mean a price increase? No, a high long-short ratio indicates strong bullish sentiment, but it does not guarantee a price increase. Overly skewed ratios can sometimes lead to liquidations (long squeezes) if the price moves against the majority, causing a rapid price decline. Why do long-short ratios differ across exchanges? Ratios can differ due to variations in user demographics, regional trading preferences, available liquidity, and the specific trading strategies prevalent on each platform. Different exchanges may attract different types of traders. How can I use long-short ratio data in my trading strategy? You can use long-short ratio data as a sentiment indicator to confirm trends, identify potential contrarian opportunities (e.g., extreme overbought/oversold sentiment), and complement your technical and fundamental analysis. It should not be used as a standalone signal. Did you find this analysis of BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios helpful?

Key Takeaways: Samson Mow claims ETH’s rally is driven by BTC holders rotating into Ethereum, with plans to shift profits back to Bitcoin. He warns ETH faces strong selling pressure near its all-time high. Other analysts see ETH breaking records first, potentially triggering an altseason before funds flow back into BTC. His comments come as Ether hit $4,303 on Sunday, marking its highest weekly close since November 2021 after a 21% gain. Mow, CEO of Bitcoin adoption firm Jan3, claimed that many long-term ETH holders , particularly early insiders from the ICO era, already own significant amounts of Bitcoin. ETH Gains Fueled by BTC Rotations on New Treasury Narratives, Says Mow According to him, these investors are rotating BTC into ETH to “pump it on new narratives” such as the emergence of Ethereum treasury companies. Once prices rise sufficiently, he predicts they will sell their ETH, leaving “new generational bagholders,” and move the profits back into Bitcoin. “No one wants ETH in the long run,” he said. He also warned that it could be “challenging” for Ether to surpass its previous all-time high, arguing that the closer the market gets to that psychological level, the stronger the incentive to sell, what he called the “Bagholder’s Dilemma.” The ETH/BTC ratio currently stands at 0.036, double its April low of 0.018, according to TradingView. Let me explain what’s happening with ETHBTC. Most ETH holders have a lot of BTC (ICO/insiders) and they are rotating that BTC into ETH to pump it on new narratives (Ethereum Treasury co’s). Once they’ve gotten it high enough, they’ll dump their ETH, creating new generational… — Samson Mow (@Excellion) August 10, 2025 Not everyone shares Mow’s view. Ethereum proponent Anthony Sassano dismissed the remarks as “old school Bitcoin maxis” rhetoric, calling it a bullish sign for ETH. Investor Ted Pillows outlined a more traditional cycle forecast, expecting ETH to break its all-time high and trigger a brief altseason before capital rotates back into Bitcoin toward $140,000, and then flows once again into ETH and other altcoins. This cycle-based rotation has been a familiar pattern in past bull markets, with Ethereum and altcoins often lagging Bitcoin’s peak before staging their own surges. Supporting this trend, Bitcoin dominance has fallen 10% since late June as traders shift into alternative assets. Buterin Warns Against Risks Behind ETH Treasury Boom While ETH’s latest run has been bolstered by institutional inflows and corporate treasuries holding Ether, Vitalik Buterin has voiced caution over the trend. In a recent interview, he warned that excessive leverage within ETH treasuries could pose long-term risks. “If you woke me up three years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH… my guess would basically be that somehow they turned it into an overleveraged game,” he said. Last week, BitMine Immersion Technologies, chaired by Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, added 208,137 ETH to its growing crypto reserves , boosting its total holdings to 833,137 ETH, now worth over $3 billion. The move cements BitMine’s position as the top Ethereum-holding treasury firm and places it fourth among global crypto treasuries overall.

Deutscher centered the analysis on a simple question—how high can Ethereum go—and answered it with a blend of technical context and model-driven probabilities. Before invoking AI, he sketched an “eye test” path in which price discovery unfolds “well into this range here between $6,000 to $8,000,” arguing that Ethereum is effectively “playing catch-up” after lagging other top assets that already printed new highs. He even floated a directional benchmark—“I think the price prediction is going to be $7,000”—before deferring to probability distributions as a more disciplined way to size the upside. To that end, he ran two large-language models on a shared set of inputs, asking for odds of specific price bands by the end of 2025 and then by the end of 2026. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyeing A Breakout? On-Chain Analysis Places Short-Term Target At $4,800 On his telling, the first model’s 2025 peak probabilities favored continuation: roughly a three-in-four chance to revisit the prior high near $4.7k, about sixty-plus percent to clear $5k, around thirty percent to reach $6k, high-single-digits to breach $7.5k, and roughly one percent to tag $10k this year. Expanding the window through 2026 raised those odds materially, to what he summarized as high confidence in $4.7k–$5k, better-than-even odds for $6k, and about forty percent for $7.5k, with a non-trivial tail—“even here 10k plus it’s giving an 18% probability to.” Running the same exercise on Grok produced a more aggressive contour. As Deutscher relayed it, Grok’s “base case could very well be $10,000,” with an $8,000–$15,000 band as a plausible cycle-top range. He quoted the model’s technical guardrails explicitly: “A break above $4,800 signals new all-time high pursuit. Drop below $3,800 could invalidate the bullish thesis.” By contrast, his own trading invalidation skews tighter to trend, cautioning that “if Ethereum drops below the money noodle on the daily, which right now is around like $3,400, I think structurally this could start to invalidate the bullish move at least in the short term,” while “as long as we maintain above $4,000, we are in the pursuit of that prior all-time high.” Headwinds For Ether The projection stack rests on a macro-to-micro chain of tailwinds that Deutscher argued now favors Ethereum more directly than in prior cycles. He cited consistently positive ETF flows—“around $17 billion of net inflows into the crypto ETFs over the last 60 days, $11 billion coming in the month of July alone,” with particular traction on the ether side—alongside anticipated retirement-account access to crypto that could unlock what he called a “massive pool of new buyers.” He framed recent US policy steps as a near-term accelerant for on-chain finance, saying the GENIUS Act clarified treatment for a set of crypto assets and “regulates some of the key stable coins,” thereby widening the aperture for institutional yield strategies and tokenization. In his view, those are specifically Ethereum-centric growth funnels because “Ethereum is the biggest blockchain facilitating asset tokenization and DeFi,” which makes ETH “the number one proxy for anyone looking to get exposure to this narrative.” Related Reading: Ethereum Hits $4,300, Restoring Vitalik Buterin’s Crypto Billionaire Status Deutscher also paired the flows argument with market-structure observations: stablecoins at fresh highs, price resilience marked by “sell-offs… relatively short-lived,” and a turn in bitcoin dominance that, if it persists, historically precedes broader alt rotation with ETH at the fulcrum. None of this, he stressed, implies a straight line. Deutscher expects the cycle to oscillate through rotations—bitcoin strength, an ether catch-up, then a higher-beta alt expansion—rather than a single monolithic “altseason.” He even penciled in a likely second-leg window into 2026, aligning with political and monetary calendar points, while cautioning that “you never know what’s going to happen” and emphasizing the need for clear invalidations. Still, the directional conclusion is unambiguous: the combination of structural inflows, regulatory clarity around on-chain finance, and Ethereum’s technical regime shift leaves him biasing to the upside. “This would be hard momentum to slow down in the short to mid-term,” he said, adding that the true “FOMO” phase probably begins only once ETH is in price discovery above its $4,800 peak. At press time, ETH traded at $4,303.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is getting more attention lately, but there’s a new name everyone’s talking about. Then there’s Layer Brett ($LBRETT) . This meme token is in presale right now ($0.004), built on Ethereum Layer 2 , so it’s fast, cheap, and built for massive staking rewards. Some say it could 100x in the next bull run, which is huge for anyone getting in early . Why DOGE’s growth is slowing in 2025 In 2025, the DOGE price prediction is still holding its spot thanks to its huge community and constant social buzz. Analysts think it could hit $0.731, which would be around a 326% gain, but that’s far from guaranteed. Mainstream adoption could help push it higher, things as more retailers accept DOGE or new payment platform integrations. The problem is, DOGE still leans heavily on speculative trading. That means if the overall market takes a hit, DOGE price prediction could swing hard in the wrong direction, making growth less reliable compared to newer, utility-packed projects. Why SHIB is gaining more attention than DOGE Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been getting more hype lately, and a big part of that is its massive 3,465% spike in burn rate. In just one day, 9.81 million SHIB were burned, with 9.47 million wiped out in a single transaction. Burning tokens cuts down the circulating supply, and that can push prices higher, especially when SHIB already sits as the second biggest meme coin. While the amount burned is still small compared to the huge 590 trillion supply, it’s a sign that big moves are happening behind the scenes. Traders see this as a bullish signal for SHIB . How Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is winning the meme coin cycle Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is flipping the meme coin script by mixing hype with real blockchain power. Built on Ethereum Layer 2 , it’s fast, cheap to use, and perfect for massive staking rewards that can hit crazy APYs during crypto presale . While coins like DOGE and SHIB rely mostly on community hype, $LBRETT adds utility, from scalable transactions to future DeFi features. With a low starting market cap and strong community push, it’s positioning itself as the standout winner of this meme coin cycle. Ethereum Layer 2 speed, low fees, and massive staking rewards One of the biggest things that sets Layer Brett ($LBRETT) apart is that it’s built on Ethereum Layer 2. That means transactions are lightning-fast, cost just pennies in gas fees, and can handle way more traffic than older meme coins. For early buyers, the staking rewards are insane, APYs in the tens of thousands during presale. You can buy with ETH, USDT, or BNB and start staking right away through the project’s dApp. Low fees, high speed, and huge rewards make $LBRETT not just fun to hold, but actually rewarding for anyone getting in before the presale ends. Conclusion: LBRETT could be the biggest meme coin winner of 2025 Layer Brett ($LBRETT ) is still in its presale, which means early buyers can lock in huge staking rewards. With a tiny market cap compared to coins like DOGE and SHIB , the room for 100x growth in the 2025 bull run is massive. Layer Brett is still in presale, but not for long. Don’t miss your shot at the most scalable meme project on Ethereum.

Grok Weighs In on the Price Forecast + Best ERC-20 Tokens",https://bitcoinist.com/grok-weighs-in-ethereum-5000-best-erc-20-tokens/,"Ethereum’s latest surge has the crypto world buzzing, and for good reason. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency climbing 50% in under 30 days is nothing short of jaw-dropping. It speaks volumes about just how hot the broader crypto market is right now, and it could be hinting at something even bigger on the horizon: the start of a major altcoin boom. Currently trading at $4,300 , $ETH is holding firmly above the all-important $4,000 mark, prompting the question on every trader’s mind: Where will Ethereum end up by year’s end? Could it crack $5K? Given that “never say never” is the unofficial motto of the crypto world, we decided to put that question under the microscope. To add another layer of insight, we turned to Grok for its 2025 Ethereum price forecast. Grok’s unique ability to scan everything crypto-related in real time – thanks to its integration with X, where every major and minor crypto voice shares their opinions – has made it an invaluable tool for spotting trends before they hit the mainstream. Spoiler alert : Grok sees a $5K target for $ETH in 2025 as entirely possible, given that it’s perfectly positioned to ride both fundamental and technical tailwinds. Keep reading to discover Grok’s top reasons for being bullish on Ethereum, why we specifically chose Grok for this critical analysis, and how you can ride this wave by buying the best ERC-20 tokens . Factors Driving Ethereum to New Highs Probably the hottest reason behind the current risk-on sentiment in Ethereum – and the crypto market as a whole – is the growing likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. According to the prediction platform Polymarket, the odds now stand at a staggering 83% , with 7% of participants even betting on a cut of 50+ basis points. In plain English, lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper and traditional savings less rewarding, which is a combination that often drives more capital into higher-risk, higher-reward assets like crypto. Another bullish tailwind is Donald Trump’s recent change to 401(k) retirement plans , which now allows cryptocurrencies to be included as an investment option. This opens the door for millions of Americans to gain exposure to assets like Ethereum directly through their retirement accounts, potentially unlocking a massive new wave of demand. Combined with rising ETF inflows, corporate accumulation, and bullish technical patterns, the $5K milestone, which is now just about 15% away, is absolutely within reach. If you want to grab $ETH’s bullish momentum by the scruff of the neck and squeeze every last drop of profit potential from it, the smartest play might be to look beyond $ETH itself and into low-cap, high-upside ERC-20 tokens that can deliver outsized returns. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Powering a Telegram Trading Bot Built to Snipe Meme Coins Snorter Token ($SNORT) powers a Telegram-based trading bot designed to level the playing field for retail crypto traders. In the fast-moving world of meme coins, small traders are often outplayed by whales using advanced algorithmic tools to snipe liquidity in new tokens. Snorter changes that. Its bot lets you set buy and sell limit orders, as well as stop orders, and the moment liquidity is introduced, it automatically executes the trade, giving you a fighting chance against institutional-level players. Every token listed on Snorter’s bot is vetted by the team, plus the platform employs advanced security measures to protect against common crypto scams like honeypots, rug pulls, and sandwich attacks. Buying $SNORT comes with some serious perks: trading fees drop to just 0.85% versus the industry average of 1%+, and holders enjoy dynamic staking rewards, currently yielding an impressive 147% APY. Snorter Bot will launch with full Solana compatibility, with support for Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, and Base coming soon thereafter. Priced at just $0.1009 at the time of writing, the $SNORT presale has already raised over $2.97M. And according to our Snorter Token price prediction , it could reach $0.94 this year itself, churning out a staggering 800%+ gain from current levels. Visit Snorter Token’s website for more information. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Ride the Growth of One of the Best Non-Custodial Crypto Wallets Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native cryptocurrency of Best Wallet , a free, non-custodial, multi-currency wallet that’s both secure and incredibly easy to use. Being non-custodial means you hold complete control over your private keys, ensuring no malicious third party can ever access your funds. On top of that, Best Wallet uses Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP cryptographic technology, combined with biometric logins and other multi-factor authentication options, to keep your assets safe 24/7. And that’s just the security part of it; Best Wallet packs serious convenience, too. For example, you can buy new meme coins on presale directly within the app. No need to visit separate presale websites. Holding $BEST unlocks even more perks, including early access to new projects, voting rights, lower transaction fees, and generous staking rewards (currently offering 92%). As a multi-chain wallet, Best Wallet already supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and Polygon, with 50+ additional blockchains coming soon. You can even create multiple Ethereum wallets inside the app to better organize your trades and investments. Currently in presale at $0.025465 apiece, $BEST has a strong year-end target of $0.072 – a projected 180% return. And with an ambitious goal to capture 40% of the non-custodial wallet market by 2027, along with $14.65M in early investor funding, it’s shaping up to be one of the best crypto presales of the year. Learn all about $BEST by visiting its presale website. 3. SPX6900 ($SPX) – Viral New Meme Coin with a Hilarious Mission & Fun-Loving Vibe SPX6900 ($SPX) is one of the most viral meme coins of the past year, thanks to its ridiculous (and amusing) mission of overtaking the S&P 500 in market capitalization. For context, the S&P 500 has a market cap of over $45 trillion. Currently, $SPX sits at a market cap of $1.82B, with a total supply of 1B tokens and around 930M already in circulation. Of course, $SPX isn’t getting anywhere close to its namesake index. But in the wild world of meme coins, it’s not so much about the destination as it is about the journey. With its fun-loving vibe, $SPX has certainly captured the meme coin community’s attention. It’s up over 21% in the past seven days and is now trading just shy of the $2 mark. Given that we’re fast approaching a full-blown altcoin season, a break above $2 – and potentially its all-time high of $2.27 – could set in motion a new, explosive rally. It’s also worth noting that in addition to Ethereum, $SPX is also available on Solana and Base. Wrapping Up $ETH’s recent run-up, fueled by a potential interest rate cut, growing regulatory clarity, rising adoption, and bullish technical breakouts, has put it in a prime position to challenge the $5K mark before year’s end. Want in? Consider loading up on low-priced, high-upside ERC-20 tokens like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . However, bear in mind that crypto investments are inherently risky.

The move has eclipsed the previous market capitalization peak on July 23. Total crypto capitalization has gained 22% since the beginning of the year, as around $750 billion has flowed into digital assets. The inflow is pretty close to the $820 billion that represented the entire market cap during the bear market crash in November 2022. However, the entire crypto market is still worth less than one US corporation – Nvidia, which has a total capitalization of $4.45 trillion. “Now is the most unclear timeline I’ve seen, the market is at ATH, but no one knows what’s next,” said analyst ‘cyclop’. Ethereum’s Massive Move The big move has been driven by Ethereum , which has continued to rally, reaching $4,332 on Monday morning. This is the highest price ETH has seen since December 2021, more than three and a half years ago. It has gained 46% over the past month as its rally continues, largely driven by institutional ETPs and corporate treasury accumulation. The asset also closed its largest weekly candle since November 2021. ETH treasury companies have now hoovered up more than 3 million ETH worth around $13 billion in just four months, according to SER. As a result, ETH market capitalization has surged to $522 billion, which makes it larger than MasterCard and Netflix.

This strategic move marks a pivotal moment for Mantra, signaling a strengthened commitment to robust infrastructure and broader decentralization within the blockchain ecosystem. For those unfamiliar, Mantra is at the forefront of bringing traditional assets like real estate, art, and commodities onto the blockchain, transforming them into digital tokens. This process, known as RWA tokenization , aims to unlock liquidity, enhance transparency, and enable fractional ownership, making these assets more accessible to a wider audience. Binance’s entry as a validator adds substantial weight and credibility to Mantra’s mission, directly impacting its future trajectory. Why is Binance Becoming a Mantra Validator So Significant for RWA Tokenization? Binance’s decision to become a Mantra validator is a powerful endorsement of Mantra’s technology and its vision for RWA tokenization . When a major player like Binance steps in, it brings several immediate benefits: Enhanced Trust: Binance’s reputation lends significant credibility to Mantra’s network, potentially attracting more institutional and retail participants to the RWA space.

A more diverse set of validators means: Improved Resilience: The network becomes less susceptible to single points of failure or malicious attacks. Fairer Decision-Making: With more independent entities participating in governance, the decision-making process becomes more distributed and less prone to manipulation by a single dominant party. Greater Transparency: A larger, more diverse validator set often leads to increased transparency in network operations. This move aligns perfectly with the core principles of blockchain technology, emphasizing a robust and community-driven approach to network management. The Strategic Importance of Binance’s Role in the Blockchain Ecosystem Binance is not just any validator; it is a titan in the cryptocurrency world, known for its extensive infrastructure and deep technical expertise. Their involvement as a Binance blockchain validator for Mantra’s mainnet signifies a strategic alignment that goes beyond mere transaction validation. Binance’s experience in managing large-scale blockchain operations, coupled with their commitment to security and innovation, positions them as an invaluable partner for Mantra. Their participation is a testament to the growing interest of major crypto exchanges in the RWA sector, recognizing its potential to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). This collaboration could set a precedent for future partnerships in the RWA space. What Does the Future Hold for Mantra’s Mainnet? The addition of Binance as a Mantra validator is more than just a technical upgrade; it’s a strategic declaration. It positions Mantra to accelerate its roadmap for RWA tokenization , potentially leading to: Faster Onboarding of Assets: With increased network robustness and credibility, Mantra might attract more diverse real-world assets for tokenization. Broader Institutional Adoption: The backing of a name like Binance could pave the way for greater institutional participation in Mantra’s ecosystem. Enhanced Scalability: A stronger validator set can contribute to the network’s ability to handle more transactions and users efficiently. This move solidifies Mantra’s commitment to building a secure, decentralized, and scalable platform for the future of tokenized assets. It’s an exciting time for anyone interested in the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain innovation. In conclusion, Mantra’s announcement that Binance has joined its mainnet as a validator is a landmark event. This collaboration significantly bolsters Mantra’s network security and advances its mission for truly decentralized governance , particularly in the rapidly expanding field of RWA tokenization . It’s a powerful signal that the future of finance is increasingly digital, secure, and interconnected, driven by strategic partnerships that build trust and foster innovation. The integration of a leading entity like Binance as a key Mantra validator is poised to propel the platform to new heights, making real-world assets more accessible and liquid than ever before. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Mantra, and what does it do? A1: Mantra is a real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform.

The number of S&P 500 companies that mentioned the word ""recession"" during their second-quarter earnings call dropped sharply to just 16, down sharply from 124 in the first quarter, according to data source FactSet . A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, as measured by the gross domestic product. ""Recession was uttered just 16 times so far on earnings calls this quarter (4%), down from 124 in Q1 and the 10-yr average of 61. After Q4 '24 it was the least of any quarter since Q4 '21,"" Neil Sethi, managing partner at Sethi Associates, said on X, quoting FactSet. The decline comes as some observers fear that President Donald Trump's trade tariffs are beginning to impact the economy. Perhaps company leaders are operating under the assumption that the elevated tariffs will eventually be ""watered down"" through negotiations, rather than remaining a long-term economic burden. Trump recently unveiled sweeping tariffs in addition to those announced in April in a move aimed at sparking a manufacturing boom. That has lifted the average U.S. tariff rate to 20.1%, the highest sustained level since the 1910s, according to estimates released by the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund. Markets, too, have largely looked past tariff-induced recession fears, with the S&P 500 rising 28% since the early April dip. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has risen to $122,000 from roughly $75,000, a 62% surge in four months, CoinDesk data show. According to JPMorgan, traders have been focusing on resilient corporate earnings and the expected economic recovery following the interim slowdown. More than 80% of S&P 500 companies have recently reported their second-quarter earnings, with over 80% beating earnings expectations and 79% surpassing revenue forecasts. That's the strongest performance in four years.

Global crypto exchange Binance has officially announced the addition of three significant Binance new spot trading pairs to its platform. This expansion provides fresh opportunities for traders looking to diversify their portfolios and engage with emerging digital assets. The move underscores Binance’s continuous effort to enhance its Binance spot trading offerings, solidifying its position as a leading venue for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. What Are These New Crypto Pairs? Binance is set to launch these highly anticipated new crypto pairs on August 12, 2024, at 08:00 UTC. Traders will soon have access to: ILV/USDC: This pair introduces Illuvium (ILV), a promising decentralized gaming token, against USDC, a stablecoin. MAGIC/USDC: Featuring Treasure (MAGIC), another notable gaming and metaverse token, also paired with USDC. USDC/BRL: This crucial addition allows direct trading between USDC and the Brazilian Real, expanding fiat on-ramp and off-ramp options for users in Brazil. These additions reflect Binance’s strategy to cater to diverse market demands, from the rapidly growing GameFi sector to crucial regional fiat accessibility. Each new pair opens doors for different trading strategies and investment avenues. Why Are These Binance Spot Trading Additions Important? The introduction of these Binance spot trading pairs brings several key benefits to the platform’s vast user base. For one, listing ILV and MAGIC against USDC provides more direct and stable trading avenues for these popular altcoins. Traders can now avoid multiple conversions, potentially reducing fees and slippage. This is particularly beneficial for those actively involved in the GameFi and metaverse ecosystems, as it streamlines their access to these tokens. The USDC/BRL pair is a significant development for the Brazilian market. It simplifies the process of converting fiat to stablecoin and vice-versa, making USDC trading more accessible and efficient for users in the region. This strategic move by Binance enhances liquidity and user convenience, which are critical for broader crypto adoption. How Do These Crypto Exchange Updates Benefit You? Every time a major platform like Binance introduces crypto exchange updates like new trading pairs, it signals growth and evolving opportunities. For individual traders, this means: Increased Diversification: Access to a wider range of assets allows for more varied portfolio strategies. Enhanced Liquidity: New pairs often bring increased trading volume, leading to better price discovery and easier execution of trades. Better Accessibility: The USDC/BRL pair specifically improves the ease of entry and exit for traders using the Brazilian Real. Market Insight: Observing which pairs exchanges add can offer insights into emerging trends and popular demand within the crypto space. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) before trading any new assets. Understand the projects behind ILV and MAGIC, and consider the market dynamics of USDC and BRL. Navigating New Spot Trading Opportunities on Binance When approaching these new spot trading pairs on Binance, consider the following actionable insights. First, familiarize yourself with the underlying assets. Research Illuvium and Treasure to understand their fundamentals, use cases, and community support. For USDC trading against BRL, be aware of any local regulations or tax implications that might apply to your transactions. Binance typically provides detailed information on newly listed assets, including project overviews and risk warnings. Utilize these resources to make informed decisions. Furthermore, consider starting with smaller positions to gauge market volatility and liquidity before committing larger capital. This cautious approach can help you manage risk effectively while exploring these fresh trading avenues. In conclusion, Binance’s continuous commitment to expanding its offerings with Binance new spot trading pairs like ILV/USDC, MAGIC/USDC, and USDC/BRL is a clear indicator of the dynamic growth in the cryptocurrency market. These additions not only provide more choices for traders but also reinforce Binance’s role in facilitating global crypto adoption. Stay informed, trade wisely, and make the most of these exciting new opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When will the new spot trading pairs be available on Binance? A1: The new spot trading pairs – ILV/USDC, MAGIC/USDC, and USDC/BRL – will be available for trading on Binance starting August 12, 2024, at 08:00 UTC. Q2: What is USDC, and why is it used in these new pairs? A2: USDC (USD Coin) is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is commonly used in trading pairs because its stable value provides a less volatile base for trading other cryptocurrencies, offering a reliable benchmark for asset valuation. Q3: What are ILV and MAGIC? A3: ILV is the native token for Illuvium, a decentralized RPG adventure game on the Ethereum blockchain. MAGIC is the native token for Treasure, a decentralized NFT ecosystem bridging various GameFi projects on Arbitrum. Q4: How does the USDC/BRL pair benefit traders in Brazil? A4: The USDC/BRL pair allows traders in Brazil to directly convert their Brazilian Real (BRL) into USDC and vice versa. This simplifies the process of entering and exiting the crypto market, potentially reducing transaction steps and costs for local users. Q5: Are there any risks associated with trading new crypto pairs? A5: Yes, trading new crypto pairs, especially those involving newer altcoins like ILV and MAGIC, can carry higher volatility and liquidity risks compared to more established assets. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and understand the projects before investing. Q6: Where can I find more information about these new listings on Binance? A6: You can find official announcements and detailed information about new listings directly on the Binance official website and their support pages. Did you find this article helpful?

The token continues to be utilized for cross-border payments and liquidity solutions within the Ripple ecosystem, with market participants closely watching legal updates that could influence its adoption trajectory.

His comment is a response to a community member who questioned whether Ripple had changed its longstanding practice of unlocking funds on the first day of each month. Unusual Timing Sparks Questions The discussion began when an XRP community member noted that the company’s most recent escrow activity appeared to occur on an irregular date. On August 9, Whale Alert reported that a total of 1 billion XRP had been unlocked from Ripple’s escrow . The timing of these movements caught attention, as the company typically executes such releases at the start of the month. Adding to the uncertainty, data from the XRP Ledger (XRPL) explorer XRPscan continued to display the standard monthly release schedule, indicating the first day of the month as the set date. This discrepancy prompted speculation that Ripple may have altered the release process or could unlock the entirety of its escrow holdings ( over 35 billion XRP ) at any time. They always release on the first day of the month. You may not necessarily see any on ledger activity just because the escrow has released though. The ledger doesn't do anything by itself, it always waits for someone to submit a transaction to trigger it. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) August 9, 2025 Earlier Ripple Escrow Activity in August Before the August 9 unlock, Ripple executed a separate escrow-related transaction on August 2, locking 700 million XRP in escrow . This sequence of events resembled earlier months in 2024 when the company’s escrow activity departed from its usual pattern, including instances where token releases were delayed and later compensated for within the same month. Similar timing anomalies occurred in previous months, such as May, when a scheduled 1 billion XRP release was delayed , surprising market watchers. These irregularities fueled further community scrutiny of Ripple’s escrow practices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz Explains Escrow Mechanism Addressing the matter directly, Schwartz confirmed that Ripple’s escrow releases are still programmed to occur on the first day of each month. He explained that while the funds are technically released on schedule, the XRPL does not automatically display or process these events until a transaction is submitted to activate them. This delay in visible on-chain activity, he said, is responsible for the apparent shift in release dates. Schwartz also dismissed concerns that Ripple could unilaterally release all escrowed XRP at once, emphasizing that the system’s structure prevents such action. Current Escrow Holdings and Market Response Following the latest release, XRPscan data shows that Ripple holds 35,608,394,748 XRP in escrow. The market reaction to the unlock was muted. XRP is trading at $3.2, down 2.07% over the past 24 hours. However, I had preserved some of the gains from its rally following the conclusion of the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, and it is currently up over 13% from last month.

49902927,552876,1754897437,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49902927.jpeg,"Raoul Pal Calls XRP, Cardano And Dogecoin The ‘Moron Trade’: Here’s Why",https://bitcoinist.com/raoul-pal-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-moron-trade/,"In his latest interview, Raoul Pal sharpened a long-running argument about how retail capital enters crypto markets, placing nominal price—what a single unit costs—at the center of early-cycle behavior. “Sorry, but people are going to buy XRP and Doge and Cardano, whether you like it or not. Because they’re cheap, in the absolute term of, you know, how much you pay for a token. So people will do that,” he said . He mapped the field into three risk buckets: large, adopted layer-1s he called “idiot-proof,” a harder “middle” composed of disparate DeFi names, and a mechanically simple momentum bet he labeled “the Moron Trade”—not as an insult to holders, he stressed, but as a description of what newcomers tend to do when faced with sticker shock at the top of the table. Why XRP, ADA And DOGE Are The ‘Moron Trade’ Pal walked through the on-ramp psychology in plain numbers. Newcomers, in his telling, open a screen and see “Bitcoin… $116,000… I can barely afford lunch,” and “Ethereum… well, that’s pretty expensive.” By contrast, they recognize brand-heavy mid-caps with low unit prices and accessible narratives: “Oh, XRP… it’s $3… Doge… Elon likes Doge… it’s $0.22… and Cardano… it’s $0.78.” The effect, he argued, is predictable: flows gravitate to coins that feel affordable in absolute terms, regardless of fully diluted value or liquidity profile. “I’m not saying that these are moronic and people are moronic for owning them,” he said, reiterating that he was describing a pattern he has “seen play out” whenever retail returns. The framework leaves space, in Pal’s view, for two parallel trades. On one side are what he called “big layer ones that get adopted,” where he explicitly cited Solana and Sui—“a few others, great”—as the sort of “idiot-proof” exposure that “go[es] up a lot and [is] less risky” when network activity and developer traction compound. On the other side sit the “middle part,” which he described as “the harder play,” typified by “I’ve got this DeFi token that could be amazing” but will demand better timing, patience, or specialist knowledge. Between those poles sits what he called “the Moron Trade… just buy the cheapest thing in the top 10,” a style he illustrated live—“I’m going to show you the Moron Trade now”—to make the point that unit bias remains a powerful magnet when retail re-engages. Pal tied the interview themes back to the cycle narrative he and his research businesses have promoted for a year. In an August 10 post on X, he reminded followers that Global Macro Investor and Real Vision Pro “called the start of the Banana Zone in August 2024,” adding that those who followed the “Don’t Fuck This Up” thesis and “hold the top tokens” would be “between 50% and 650% wealthier” since that call. He listed Sui at +650%, XRP at +630%, Dogecoin at +210%, Bitcoin at +140%, Ether at +105%, and Solana at +51%, before underscoring that Sui was his “best pick” and “remains so.” He attributed the broader framework to what he calls “ The Everything Code “. Taken together, the interview and the follow-up post sketch Pal’s current market map with unusual clarity. First, he expects retail behavior to continue clustering around low unit-price, high-recognition assets such as XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano as headline prices for Bitcoin and Ether rise. Second, he continues to favor adopted layer-1s where on-chain activity and developer momentum serve as tailwinds— Solana and Sui being the explicit examples he offered. Third, he remains skeptical of the mid-shelf, thesis-driven DeFi trade for non-specialists, calling it “harder” relative to broad-beta alternatives. At press time, XRP traded at $3.27.",Crypto News|ADA|Cardano|Cardano news|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|Raoul Pal|XRP|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,ADA|XRP|DOGE|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-11 07:30:37

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $806.26, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,867.35 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the price of solana within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors , driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price trajectory, as indicated by the technical analysis, solana price forecast and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond? Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $185 (+1.9%) Market Cap $98.5 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $6.57 Billion Circulating Supply 539.35 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $185.92 24-hour Low $178.00 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Neutral 50-Day SMA $164.46 200-Day SMA $160.33 Price Prediction $384.11 (110.48%) F & G Index 23.19 (extreme fear) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 14-Day RSI 46.60 Solana price analysis: SOL surges toward $185 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows recovery to $185 Resistance for SOL is at $185 Support for SOL/USD is at $160 The price analysis of Solana for August 11 shows that SOL has climbed back above $180 as bulls aim for higher levels. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL recovers to $185 Solana faced selling pressure as buyers failed to climb past $210. The bearish trend observed the price falling to $155 before recovering to the $185 level where it trades at press time. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 59.3, which reflects the recent trend, showing that the recovery pulls the indicator within the buying region. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line rises steadily, suggesting rising buying pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show falling bearish momentum in the market. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls face resistance at $185 The 4-hour chart for Solana revealed a steady decline as the bears aimed to move below the $160 price level. The recent rejection plunged the SOL price toward $156 support line before recovering back above $160. Now the price has recovered to $182 as the bulls seek to challenge higher levels but face resistance in crossing the $185 mark. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bullish momentum at 0.09, with the indicator showing rising buying demand with recent candles. This suggests that SOL will continue to rise to challenge the $185 resistance level. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) rose to 62.9, indicating that Solana has room for further movement in upwards direction in the short term and SOL needs to defend the $168 level to prevent a breakdown towards $160.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-11 07:35:00
49904089,https://invezz.com/?p=2833749,1754897891,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"XRP surges 16.5% after legal win, could a $0.035 coin be the next big rally?",https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/11/xrp-surges-16-5-after-legal-win-could-a-0-035-coin-be-the-next-big-rally/,"Ripple (XRP)’s recent 16.5% price surge following a decisive legal victory has once again shown how a single piece of news can ignite the market. But while courtrooms and headlines dominate some rallies, other projects are quietly building momentum through fundamentals that don’t rely on unpredictable legal outcomes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of them — a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that is already attracting attention in its presale phase for its dual lending models, stablecoin innovation, and investor-first incentives. Ripple (XRP) surges Ripple (XRP)’s XRP soared 16.5% to ~$3.45 on August 8, 2025, following the resolution of its four-year legal battle with the SEC, per CoinMarketCap data. Both parties dropped their appeals, cementing a July 2023 ruling that XRP is not a security for retail sales, though institutional sales violated securities laws. Ripple (XRP) agreed to a reduced $50 million fine, down from $125 million, boosting investor confidence. Trading volume spiked 168% to $11.74 billion, with Bloomberg analysts citing 95% odds for an XRP ETF approval. Technical indicators show XRP breaking $3.23 resistance, with support at $3.00 and RSI at 65, signaling bullish momentum. However, whale dumps of $1.9 billion and macro pressures like U.S. tariffs pose risks. A sustained break above $3.64 could target $5, but failure to hold $3.00 may see $2.65. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate with two core lending models — Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) — giving users flexibility in how they will deploy and profit from their assets. The P2C model will let lenders deposit into shared liquidity pools and earn variable interest based on utilisation. For instance, a user will deposit 20 SOL worth $1,800 into the protocol, set at a 65% Loan-to-Value ratio, and borrow $1,170 USDC at an 8.5% annual interest rate. By re-lending that USDC in the same P2C pool, the lender will earn an extra $99 in yearly interest without selling their SOL holdings. The P2P model will offer even greater customization. Here, interest rates will be negotiated directly between the lender and borrower. Picture lending $3,000 in DAI to a borrower using FLOKI as collateral, with both parties agreeing to a 14% fixed rate. This setup will allow lenders to target precise risk-reward profiles while borrowers secure terms that fit their needs. Right now, the project is deep in its presale Phase 6, priced at $0.035 per token. Over $14.30 million has already been raised, with 15% of the total presale allocation sold. Security has been a priority from the outset, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) undergoing a CertiK audit that delivered strong scores — 95 for Token Scan and 78 on the Skynet security framework. Early believers also stand to benefit from community-oriented programs. The $50,000 bug bounty rewards security researchers based on the severity of vulnerabilities they uncover, strengthening the protocol before its full launch. Meanwhile, the $100,000 giveaway will be distributed among ten winners, giving early participants a tangible reason to get involved now rather than later. Investors who have already engaged in earlier presale phases have seen notable gains. For instance, a Phase 2 participant who swapped 100 AVAX worth $3,500 into MUTM has already achieved a 133% increase in token value ahead of any exchange listing. That growth has been fueled entirely by the presale’s progressive price structure and strong demand, not external market shocks. CEX listings to multiply reach Once the presale concludes and the token is listed at $0.06, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to broaden its accessibility through major centralised exchanges. Platforms such as Binance, KuCoin, and OKX are being targeted for listings, which historically have acted as powerful catalysts for liquidity, brand recognition, and trading volume. This expansion will put MUTM in front of millions of active traders worldwide, accelerating the adoption of its lending protocol and stablecoin. What makes this moment so compelling for investors is that the foundation for this growth is already being laid during the presale. The beta launch, the dual-model lending flexibility, and the decentralised stablecoin are features designed to attract both DeFi power users and newcomers seeking yield opportunities without complex onboarding. Every completed roadmap milestone adds intrinsic value to the ecosystem, which in turn supports buy pressure once the token begins open-market trading. Ripple (XRP)’s rally showed that legal victories can light a short-term fuse, but projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrate that the next big rally can be built on something more enduring. With $0.035 still holding in Phase 6, a $0.06 listing ahead, and a roadmap filled with growth-driving deliverables, the groundwork is in place for a breakout that doesn’t need a courtroom headline to happen.

Whether you’re just dipping your toes into digital assets or are a seasoned trader, finding the right platform to suit your needs is paramount. With many options available, it can take time to discern which one aligns with your requirements. I have been trading crypto for the last 5 years, have personally used each of these exchanges, and have given my honest opinion on what I like about them and what I don’t. This guide transcends the usual data compilations, amalgamating my hands-on industry know-how, use experiences, and thorough investigative efforts. I have undertaken the detailed groundwork so that you can confidently navigate the cryptocurrency exchange landscape. Selection Criteria The United Kingdom plays a central part in the growth of cryptocurrency markets. Here are the factors I considered when selecting the top crypto exchanges in the UK. Assessing Cryptocurrency Diversity The range of cryptocurrencies offered plays a vital role. With user preferences varying widely, premier exchanges accommodate a spectrum of interests. Many assets allow traders to discover new investment opportunities and expand their investments. Listing top-tier cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), was a primary requirement. Reviewing Regulatory Adherence The exchanges had to comply with the UK’s financial regulations, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies. Such regulations protect user funds while ensuring exchange integrity; the exact specifics of the rules vary across countries. Compliance fosters trust with users and provides enhanced protection. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulates the platforms in the UK. Evaluating Fee Transparency I cannot overstate the impact of fees on trading profitability, particularly for active traders. My examination of the exchanges’ fee structures was thorough, covering trading, withdrawal, and deposit fees. Some platforms also impose minimum deposit and withdrawal amounts. It was imperative to find exchanges that offer straightforward and detailed fee information, eliminating surprise costs. Ensuring Robust Security Measures Security stands as the paramount concern. Exchanges have served as hotspots for bad actors allured by the vast amounts of money that move across the exchanges. A loophole in the system is a big payday for criminals. Due to the concern, the exchanges had to provide extra layers of security such as multi-layer authentication, cold storage, and data encryption techniques. My analysis focused on each platform’s dedication to protecting its users’ financial assets and personal data. Analyzing User Interface Design A smooth trading experience depends on an exchange’s interface design. My evaluation considered the interface’s simplicity, ease of navigation, and the availability of customization. The goal was to ensure that novices and seasoned traders found the interface conducive to their trading activities. Checking for Mobile Application Availability The necessity for dedicated mobile applications in today’s mobile-centric world was also a key consideration. My assessment looked into the availability of apps for both iOS and Android platforms, recognizing that mobile applications offer traders the flexibility to manage their investments on the go. Factors to Consider While Choosing the Best UK Crypto Exchanges Security: Security is non-negotiable. The exchange should have a track record of ensuring security and quick resolution of any security bugs. Bug bounties are also essential to help seal any loopholes that could otherwise affect the exchange significantly. Regulatory Compliance: Exchanges without operating licenses approved by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) cannot operate in the country. Engaging with such platforms puts funds at risk. The exchanges also risk putting themselves in regulatory problems. Transaction fees: Exchanges charge multiple types of fees. These include withdrawal fees, trading, and deposit fees/ commissions. A good exchange should have a transparent fee schedule with lower fees to minimize the impact on your net return. Ease of Use: A user-friendly interface is essential for efficient trading, especially for beginners. Check if the platform is accessible via different devices, including smartphones and tablets. Available cryptocurrencies: Millions are in the blockchain space today. The exchange should have listed high market cap cryptocurrencies, or else they should have credibility. Liquidity: Low liquidity means you cannot make large-volume trades due to slippage. A low volume of trades on an exchange often indicates little liquidity. Customer Support: 24/7 customer support should be available owing to the always active crypto economy. Customer service should be savvy and capable of resolving disputes quickly. Payment Methods: Choose an exchange that supports modes of payment available to you. Popular methods include bank transfers, e-wallets, and credit/ debit cards. Also, check on the deposit and withdrawal limits. Educational Resources: A good exchange with educational resources and trading guides should be beginner-friendly. The user interface should also be intuitive and easy to navigate. Reputation and Reviews: Check online reviews, forums, and other traders’ feedback. Feedback sentiment helps you gauge the exchange’s reputation among its users.

Top 10 cryptocurrency exchanges in the UK 1. Coinbase Great for: Beginners and Easy On-Ramp Coinbase trading interface Specification Details Available Cryptocurrencies 150+ listed cryptocurrencies Trading Fees Tiered based on 30-day trading volume. From 0.0% to 0.6%. Deposit Methods ACH, wire transfer, SEPA, SWIFT, cryptocurrency Withdrawal Methods ACH, wire transfer, SEPA, SWIFT, cryptocurrency Security Features Encryption, annual audits, 2FA, multi-approval withdrawals, User Interface Intuitive and a user-friendly interface suitable for both beginners and experienced users Mobile App iOS and Android Pros: Simple account setup Easy to use Buy and sell with fiat currency No monthly fees Staking rewards Cons: High fees for low-volume traders Desn’t have a large selection of coins Limited selection of cryptocurrencies No crypto-crypto trading pairs Features: Staking Debit and Credit Card payments NFT platform Here is my take: if it’s your first time buying and selling crypto, Coinbase is user-friendly and makes your first purchase easy. Like most other exchanges, you can buy crypto using a credit or debit card without depositing funds into the exchange account first. You can also use PayPal as a payment method. The verification step does not require downloading their app; you can complete the process on your browser. Coinbase Pro (Coinbase’s advanced trading platform) is free, has lower fees, and more trading options. If you are switching exchanges, Coinbase has a debit card that lets you spend crypto where Visa is accepted. Coinbase raised a fuss on the internet when it implemented the quiz requirement as directed by the FCA. Many traders cited difficult questions and long waiting periods to retake the test. Kraken’s version of the quiz was much simpler, and I was able to figure out the answers. I, therefore approached Coinbase with confidence. But no! I’ve failed it twice so far! I think I’ll have to enlist the help of ChatGPT… Coinbase have potentially shot themselves in the foot by using such complicated language. Or do they have a reason to bamboozle most of their customers?? – Michael Wimpy on an online forum. Another thing I like about Coinbase is how easy it is when it comes to calculating your capital gains tax; you can download full transaction reports, and there are some great educational resources to help you. The only slight drawback with Coinbase is that they don’t have a huge selection of coins, and many of the newer cryptocurrencies cannot be purchased. I would say for beginners and first-time buyers of crypto, this is the best UK crypto exchange to get started with.

It follows the conventional KYC sign-up process with a mandatory residence proof requirement. The platform is primarily a contract of difference (CFD) broker. Like the other platforms, it is FCA-regulated, with UK investors entitled to investor protection of up to £85,000 per person. All profits from CFD trading are subject to taxation. What I liked about the platform is its social trading approach to trading. The platform has a powerful and intuitive copy trading functionality, allowing you to copy a profitable trader based on your risk appetite.

The exchange boasts 120 million registered users globally. It stands out for its extensive product offerings, including spot, futures, copy, and bot trading. It also features advanced security features to protect user data and funds, including a $775 million protection fund and proof of reserves, which guarantee customer deposits. Another factor that stood out to me was the exchange’s rewards structure. Bitget rewards you for interacting with its products. Every activity earns you points, which you can then redeem for USDT. To be eligible, you only need to subscribe to trading or insight tasks accessible from the ‘Rewards’ page. Insight tasks include reading articles or interacting with published content.

Account creation on the exchange is straightforward. However, you must upload your identification document and proof of address for KYC verification, unlike other exchanges like Revolut, where verification occurs on a mobile app in real-time. I liked the platform’s lending and staking features. The functionalities allowed me to earn passive income on my idle digital assets.

The FCA regulates the platform’s operation in the UK. This regulation requires extra checks before being allowed to trade on the platform. When signing up as a UK user, I had to pass two questionnaires to confirm my understanding of crypto topics. After completing the questionnaire, there was a 24-hour ‘cooling-off’ period before they allowed me to purchase crypto. If you fail the questionnaire, you become ineligible to hold an Uphold account. Here is a quick prep from my experience: The first questionnaire will test your knowledge and experience with crypto assets. The second categorizes you into one of three types of crypto investors as classified by the FCA. Restricted investor- investors who have not invested more than 10% of their net worth in high-risk investments and do not plan to do so in the next 12 months. High net worth investor- investors with an annual income of +£100.000 or +£250.000 of assets. Certified sophisticated investor – investors certified within the last three years by an authorized firm confirming their knowledge in understanding the risks involved in crypto.

Features: Savings account Joint accounts Insurance fund Includes stock and commodity trading Revolut was originally a digital banking and financial services platform launched in 2015. It later expanded its services to accommodate cryptocurrency trading. My experience with Revolut was different compared to other exchanges. For instance, you must download the Revolut APP from the Google Play Store or Apple Store to sign up; you can’t do it on a PC. Also, the sign-up process for business and personal accounts differs, and they use different apps. Revolut will provide you with a range of accounts. The standard account is free; other accounts include Plus, Premium, Metal, and Ultra. They differ in aspects like the cost of ATM withdrawals, personalization of debit cards, insurance, interest rates, travel benefits, fees, lounge access, and car hire protection. It offers a whole different experience to the conventional centralised exchanges. Another factor to consider is that Revolut accounts are electronic money accounts, not bank accounts. Your deposits are not guaranteed under the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). Rating: User-Friendly: 4/5 Variety of Cryptocurrencies: 4/5 Customer Support: 4/5 Overall: 4/5 7.

Signing up on the platform also required me to complete KYC on their mobile app, which is available on iOS and Android Play Store. The process will require you to take a picture of your ID and a selfie. It also further checks your proof of address using verification databases such as the electoral register and credit files. In the case of these check files, you must provide the verification documents. Coinjar introduced the first full-service cryptocurrency card in the UK. The trading experience on Coinjar was smooth despite a limited number of features and cryptocurrencies. The platform makes up for the shortcoming with zero fees on all Stablecoin-to-Fiat, Stablecoin-to-Stablecoin, Crypto-to-Stablecoin, and Crypto-to-Crypto maker trades.

Crypto withdrawal fees Features: DeFI crypto wallet Savings Crypto launchpad Visa debit card Like Coinjar, I had to download the Crypto.com mobile app to facilitate KYC checks during the process to open an account. The platform extended its services to accommodate DeFi users through their web3 wallet. DeFi users have absolute control over their crypto and do not require permissions or usage oversight from Crypto.com. Another plus for the platform is its wide selection of cryptocurrencies, one of the largest available in the UK. The platform also has an intuitive trading interface and savings features for idle crypto assets. CRO, the platform’s native token, for instance, earned me 12.06% p.a. I would recommend the platform to both beginners and advanced buyers and sellers. Rating: User-Friendly: 4/5 Variety of Cryptocurrencies: 4.5/5 Customer Support: 4.5/5 Overall: 4.5/5 9.

I liked the platform’s approach to having two trading interfaces, one for beginners and the other for advanced traders. While I didn’t get to test my debit card, they mentioned that you can link your debit card with your account and buy crypto quickly and easily. You can also buy and sell NFTs on the platform. Not everyone wants to place their trades. Invest in crypto simply by spending with the Gemini Credit Card.

Paybis Great for: instant buy/payouts Paybis trading interface Specification Details Available Cryptocurrencies 150+ crypto and fiat currencies Trading Fees A $2 minimum service fee. Deposit Methods Bank transfer, credit/debit card, Skrill, Giropay, and ACH Transfer. Withdrawal Methods Cryptocurrency wallet or external accounts Security Features Multifactor authentication and encryption to protect user accounts and transactions User Interface User-friendly and straightforward interface Mobile App Android and iOS. Pros: Simple and intuitive Instant payouts Fast registration Transparent fee system Cons: No staking/ saving services No complex order types No crypto-crypto trading Features: Fast security checks Swap functionality Transparent fee system My experience with Paybis was straightforward; the platform does not have the conventional limit and market orders interface with an intuitive trading interface. The platform is more of a swap function; pay using your card and receive crypto in your wallet. The reverse happens when selling crypto. Here is how to trade on the platform: Select the crypto you need to buy. Verify email Verify phone number Enter destination address and payment details Complete KYC The verification process took me about 5 minutes. Once completed, your cryptocurrency purchase will be processed. I would not recommend the platform to advanced traders; however, it is a great option for beginners to learn their way around the crypto landscape. Rating: User-Friendly: 4.5/5 Variety of Cryptocurrencies: 4/5 Customer Support: 4/5 Overall: 4/5 Understanding Cryptocurrency Exchanges: Centralised vs. Decentralised Exchanges Centralised exchanges (CEXs) and decentralised exchanges (DEXs) are two sides of the same coin. The two have different architectures, but all seek to perform the same function. So why would you pick a CEX over a DEX? Or vice versa. CEXs are centralised, meaning they have a hierarchical structure where people at the top have absolute control over the platform. The platforms act as intermediaries who ease interaction with the blockchain. They provide a platform where you can sign up, entrust them with your digital assets, and connect you to more market makers and diversification opportunities. Their services come at a cost, which they deduct as transaction fees or commissions. These features make the platforms popular among both beginners and advanced traders. Conversely, security and using your funds by the platform are significant concerns. The platforms are susceptible to hacks and misappropriation of customer funds. DEXs are decentralized, meaning there are no intermediaries. Transactions occur on-chain, i.e., directly on the blockchain. Innovative models allow users to provide liquidity on these platforms in return for incentives. The codes for these platforms are generally in the public domain, encouraging critic and innovative feedback. Since the platforms are on-chain, users hold their private keys and sign (approve) transactions directly on their wallets. DEXs prioritize anonymity since they don’t require you to sign in. Instead, you just authorize a transaction to connect your wallet with the platform. On the flip side, DEXs are complex platforms. They are suitable for advanced traders who know how blockchain operates and the dynamics of self-custody wallets. The platforms are also prone to hacks resulting from vulnerabilities in their code. The choice between a CEX and a DEX hinges on several factors. These include trading goals, individual preferences, and expertise. Beginners should opt for CEXs. DEXs have a more extensive portfolio of listed cryptocurrencies but can be problematic due to low liquidity. Regulatory Compliance of Crypto Exchanges in the UK In the UK, crypto exchanges are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which oversees their operations. The FCA ensures that financial markets, including those for cryptocurrencies, are fair and transparent. To this end, they require all UK-based cryptocurrency businesses to comply with regulations such as the ‘Travel Rule,’ a part of the Money Laundering Regulations 2017 that aims to prevent illegal activities through information sharing. Under these regulations set forth by the FCA guidance on crypto assets financial promotions (FG23/3) practical from October 2023, regulated exchanges in the UK must adhere to standards related to anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorist financing (CTF), and customer care practices – making them safer for consumers. Recent changes have impacted certain products like leverage crypto CFDs explicitly offered to retail clients within this market segment. This impact is because brokers or similar entities operating under strict regulation cannot provide said products moving forward. Track Record of Hacks of UK Exchanges While the above are the best crypto exchanges in the UK, they are not immune to exploits. Here is a quick record of such occurrences: Gemini: In June 2022, hackers siphoned IRA clients’ accounts to $36 million before they spotted the attack. IRA Financial was using Gemini’s architecture to secure client crypto assets. Customers received phishing emails after a suspected Gemini data leak that exposed information from 5.7 million users. Bitstamp: Bitstamp experienced a significant hack when 19,000 bitcoins (worth $5 million then) were stolen. The hack resulted from a phishing scheme that compromised one of their Bitcoin wallets. A phishing attack in 2022 targeted 6 Bitstamp employees, leading to the theft of about $5 million worth of Bitcoin. Coinbase: In October 2021, hackers stole funds from about 6,000 customers by capitalizing on a flaw in Coinbase’s account recovery procedure. A white-hat hacker exposed a vulnerability in Coinbase’s trading system. The vulnerability could allow users to send all Coinbase order books to arbitrary prices. Revolut: In September 2022, Revolut confirmed a data breach on tens of thousands of customer details. The hackers used social engineering tactics to access the platform’s database. A flaw in their US payment system resulted in a $20 million loss in 2022. The hack came to light when a partner bank raised a flag on holding less cash than expected. Crypto.com In 2021, a compromise in 2FA resulted in about 6,000 accounts losing $34 million. While these incidents have occurred, the exchanges have taken proactive measures to address the challenges, including plans to reimburse affected users. Summary The UK crypto trading market presents a wide range of options, each with unique qualities and strengths. From Bitstamp’s high liquidity to Uphold’s altcoin variety, Bitget’s low fees, and Crypto.com’s offerings variety, an exchange caters to every trader’s needs. Exchanges like eToro, Gemini, Paybis, and Revolut offer secure trading environments and innovative features for enhanced trading experiences. When selecting an exchange in this ever-evolving crypto market landscape, it is essential to consider factors like security measures, rules imposed by regulatory bodies, costs associated with transactions, varieties of cryptocurrency offered, and user-friendliness ratings from clients. Besides, this understanding should extend to centralised versus decentralised platforms, the value placed on safety precautions taken by these mediums, and the structure behind the fee collection process. These considerations equip traders to make informed decisions while navigating UK crypto exchange markets. Such dynamism will continue shaping a captivating prospectus for investors and vendors, encouraging constant transformation within the industry.",Deep Dive - Crypto|Web3 & Market Insights,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-11 07:38:32

TRM Labs research identifies the group as a potential rebrand of the defunct BlackCat operation, with notable victims including American Associated Pharmacies, Memorial Hospital and Manor in Georgia, and Weiser Memorial Hospital in Idaho. Sophisticated RaaS Model Evades Detection Through Operational Restraint The group operates under a ransomware-as-a-service model, providing affiliates with advanced tools while maintaining control over core infrastructure and payment negotiations. TRM’s Graph Visualizer showing a small Embargo wallet cluster with incoming BlackCat (ALPHV) exposure. Source: TRMLabs Unlike prominent groups such as LockBit or Cl0p, Embargo avoids high-visibility tactics and overt branding, potentially helping it evade law enforcement detection while scaling operations across healthcare, business services, and manufacturing sectors. TRM Labs identified multiple technical similarities linking Embargo to BlackCat, including shared use of the Rust programming language, nearly identical data leak site designs, and on-chain overlaps through shared wallet infrastructure. Shared wallet cluster receiving Embargo and BlackCat funds. Source: TRMLabs Historical BlackCat-linked addresses have funneled funds to wallet clusters associated with Embargo victims, reinforcing the assessment of potential operational continuity. The discovery of Embargo coincides with a broader surge in sophisticated crypto-focused cybercrime operations. July 2025 saw crypto hack losses jump 27.2% to $142 million through seventeen major security breaches, while the first half of 2025 recorded over $2.2 billion in losses across 344 incidents. AI-Enhanced Operations Target Critical Infrastructure Embargo uses advanced tactics enhanced by artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to scale attacks and evade detection. The group typically gains initial access through exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities or sophisticated social engineering campaigns, including AI-generated phishing emails and drive-by downloads from malicious websites. Once inside networks, Embargo deploys a two-part toolkit that disables security tools and removes recovery options before encrypting files. The group uses double extortion tactics, encrypting files while exfiltrating sensitive data, then threatening to leak information or sell it on dark web markets if victims refuse payment. The group’s data leak site publicly names individuals and releases sensitive information to pressure victims into paying ransoms. Embargo directs victims to communicate through group-controlled infrastructure, allowing operators to retain control over negotiations while reducing exposure to law enforcement tracking. Several incidents featured politically charged messages and ideological references, leading analysts to assess potential state alignment or linkage. This combination of financial and ideological motivations complicates attribution efforts, as it follows broader trends of financially motivated actors engaging in politically themed campaigns. Complex Money Laundering Networks Exploit Global Exchanges Embargo launders ransom proceeds through sophisticated networks involving intermediary wallets, high-risk exchanges, and sanctioned platforms, including Cryptex.net. Embargo deposits to Cryptnex.net Source: TRMLabs TRM Labs traced hundreds of deposits totaling approximately $13.5 million distributed across multiple virtual asset service providers worldwide. Between May and August 2024, researchers observed approximately 17 deposits exceeding $1 million routed through the now-sanctioned Cryptex.net platform. The group typically avoids heavy reliance on mixers or cross-chain bridges, instead layering transactions across multiple addresses before depositing directly into exchanges. Approximately $18.8 million in victim funds remain dormant in unattributed wallets, likely representing deliberate evasion tactics to disrupt behavioral tracing patterns or delay movement until external conditions become more favorable. These delays may also result from operational factors, including downstream laundering support needs or internal disputes among actors. The complex laundering patterns coincide with other major crypto security incidents throughout 2025. Indian exchange CoinDCX suffered a $44.2 million attack linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group through compromised employee credentials. Similarly, the GreedyBear attack group utilized 150 weaponized Firefox extensions and nearly 500 malicious executables to steal over $1 million. July crypto hack losses surge 27% to $142 million with CoinDCX's $44 million insider breach and GMX's $42 million exploit leading victims. #July #CryptoHack https://t.co/4UCMKaxUvI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 1, 2025 GMX lost $42 million through a re-entrancy vulnerability exploit but recovered $40.5 million through white-hat negotiations , keeping a $5 million bounty.

This comes after a period of relative stagnation. This bounce back has reignited enthusiasm across the PI community and also led analysts to investigate which projects might be next to follow this momentum. The rise in the Pi coin value has come at a time that sees broader shifts in the layer-1 and layer-2 blockchain landscape, where throughput, user control, and cost-efficiency are increasingly decisive for investor attention. Layer Brett: Performance and Presale Momentum Among the projects analysts highlight, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) stands out due to its bold claims and rapidly growing presale. Boasting a reported throughput of over 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), Layer Brett dramatically outpaces the likes of Ethereum’s Layer 1 (at roughly 15 TPS) and even leading layer-2s like Optimism and Arbitrum, which hover around 20 TPS or below. Notably, Layer Brett also emphasizes “no KYC” and “full control” for users, echoing the decentralization ethos that attracts many to the PI ecosystem. Presale participation in Layer Brett is surging, with the current token price at just $0.004 per $LBRETT, payable via ETH, USDT, or BNB. The project’s “massive APY” staking incentives, combined with a headline-grabbing $1 million giveaway for early buyers, fuel robust community engagement. As with PI Network (PI), social sentiment and hype are powerful drivers—seen in active campaigns across Telegram and X. Polygon (POL): Scaling, Interoperability, and Next-Gen Use Cases The other crypto frequently cited by market observers as poised for a breakout is Polygon (POL). As a leading Ethereum scaling solution, Polygon (POL) offers improved transaction speed, lower gas fees, and extensive cross-chain compatibility. This positions it strongly against not only Ethereum Layer 1 but also meme coin-focused newcomers like Layer Brett . The continued integration of Polygon (POL) into DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 gaming ecosystems signals technical strength and growing utility, thus echoing many of the same drivers behind the recent Pi Network price spike. In a Competitive Landscape, How Do Cardano, Pepe, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Bonk Compare? To put the prospects for PI, Layer Brett, and Polygon (POL) into context, it is essential to compare them with some established competitors—Cardano, Pepe, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Bonk. Cardano is recognized for its academic rigor and robust proof-of-stake consensus, but it lags behind in transaction throughput relative to Layer Brett. Meme coins like Pepe, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Bonk have achieved viral community-driven valuations but generally lack the technical advancements and utility focus now characterizing the new wave of projects. The Outlook: What Comes After PI’s Rally? With the Pi coin rally setting a fresh benchmark, analysts argue that both Layer Brett and Polygon (POL) are strategically positioned to capture the next wave of capital inflows. Layer Brett’s combination of near-instant transactions, ultra-low fees, and strong community incentives mirrors many of the factors that propelled PI. In the meantime, Polygon (POL) continues to demonstrate resilience and versatility, making it a perennial contender for the next breakout. As wise investors’ focus intensifies on scalability, user empowerment, and ecosystem potential, the competition among Pi coin, Layer Brett, and Polygon (POL) is set to define the market’s next phase. For those monitoring the Pi Network price and searching for the next big move, these two cryptos stand at the forefront. Don’t Miss Out On Crypto’s Newest 100x Meme? Secure Your LBRETT Tokens Today!

In a sea of contenders, projects like Neiro and PNUT have captured attention, but a third, Layer Brett, is emerging with a technological edge that sets it apart. While Neiro and PNUT follow familiar paths, Layer Brett combines meme culture with powerful utility, making it a standout candidate for explosive growth. Evaluating today’s contenders like Neiro and PNUT In the search for the next breakout star, many traders look at emerging tokens like Neiro. Known for its community-driven approach, Neiro aims to build a strong following, which is a key ingredient for any successful meme project. Similarly, the speculative buzz around PNUT has made it a topic of conversation, as traders look for the next low-cap gem to ride a wave of hype. However, experienced investors are starting to look past the initial excitement surrounding Neiro and PNUT. While community is crucial, the long-term potential often lies in real-world utility. The critical question is whether projects like Neiro or PNUT can offer more than just hype. This is where a new type of meme coin enters the picture, one that is built differently from the ground up. Why Layer Brett surpasses Neiro and offers real utility While contenders like Neiro operate within the standard meme coin framework, Layer Brett is an evolution. It’s a Meme coin with a mechanism, built on a cutting-edge Ethereum Layer 2. This foundation gives it a fundamental advantage over almost every other Meme Token on the market. What does this mean for investors? Ultra-Low Gas Fees: Unlike many ERC-20 tokens, Layer Brett offers near-zero transaction costs, making it accessible to everyone. Massive Staking Rewards: Right now, during the Crypto Presale, early buyers can stake their $LBRETT tokens for enormous APYs—a clear, tangible benefit not always present with speculative tokens like PNUT. Real Utility: $LBRETT isn’t just for trading. It’s built for a future ecosystem of speed and scalability, giving it a purpose beyond the initial pump. $1M Giveaway: Early presale participants are automatically entered into a $1 million giveaway, adding even more incentive to get in early. The investment case: Layer Brett vs. PNUT and Neiro for the 2025 bull run When positioning for the 2025 crypto bull run, the choice becomes clearer. While the communities behind Neiro and PNUT could drive prices up, Layer Brett presents a more complete package. Its foundation on an Ethereum Layer 2 network provides a clear, sustainable advantage. The ongoing Crypto Presale offers a ground-floor entry point at a low market cap, creating a realistic path to 100x or even higher returns. For investors weighing their options between Neiro, PNUT, and other emerging projects, the choice comes down to hype versus substance. Layer Brett delivers both: the viral energy of a top Meme coin and the robust technology of a next-generation altcoin. The hunt for the next 10,000x opportunity is intense, but Layer Brett is making a compelling case. The presale won’t last forever, and with it, the chance to secure a stake in what could be the most explosive meme project of the year. Don’t Miss Out On Crypto’s Newest 100x Meme?

Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas described the move as “pretty sizable,” noting that university endowments tend to be conservative and slow to embrace ETFs, especially those tied to cryptocurrency.

Long-term buyers are positioning with growing treasuries, while sellers still try to lock in profits. Ethereum (ETH) is still flowing into treasuries, with large-scale whale buying. ETF are also adding to the demand, with up to 117K ETH bought up on the most active days. ETH rose to levels not seen since 2021, but caused older whales to take profits. | Source: Coingecko The buying did not stop as ETH recovered to levels not seen since 2021. ETH jumped additionally in a late Sunday rally, to trade at $4,320.55, stabilizing at 0.035 BTC. Even the local price peak has not stopped accumulation from several sources, far exceeding the new token creation from block producers. ETH has an inflation of 0.78% annualized, but at the current rate, the actual supply of available ETH is shrinking fast. Mysterious whale builds notable treasury As Cryptopolitan previously reported, a new treasury is taking shape in the past week, with constant buying from both OTC and open market sources. The institution kept buying from its previous commitment to hold 171K ETH . The same whale added another 49,533 ETH near the recent local top, to hold a total of 221,166 ETH. The ETH is then parked in several connected wallets , with addresses containing between 42,013 ETH and 29,772 ETH. The treasury is not entirely reflected on-chain among large holders, as the proceeds are not parked in the same address. Currently, the whale has not moved any of the ETH or staked it. The entity is not yet identified, but speculations connect it to the top treasuries of BitMine or SharpLink Gaming. Corporate buyers are taking a new approach to storing ETH, unlike early buyers or ICO treasuries, which keep all coins on the same address. Security concerns and traceability have also evolved, as ETH becomes a more valuable asset. On all exchanges, ETH reserves have fallen near an all-time low at 18.89M ETH . At the same time, Binance reserves have been climbing since May, suggesting a mix of whale deposits for trading or deposits to Binance’s liquid staking program. Over time, Binance has grown its share of liquid staking , with around 8.32% of the market share. Many of the recent treasuries are also considered a source of passive income, as buyers like SharpLink Gaming almost immediately wrap their ETH in liquid staking. ETH also sees selling pressure Despite the predictions for a rally to new all-time highs, some of the older whales have chosen to take profits. One ETH ICO participant sold 2,300 ETH, almost divesting the entire initial stake. An #Ethereum ICO participant who received 20,000 $ETH ( cost $6,200, now $86.6M) just sold another 2,300 $ETH ($9.91M) 20 minutes ago, leaving him with 1,623 $ETH ($6.99M). https://t.co/Rv0RcDPtgH pic.twitter.com/ffxwgXUDEg — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 11, 2025 The Ethereum ICO has appreciated the investment in nominal terms, but still trades near the lower range against BTC. At the time of the ICO, ETH peaked at 0.14 BTC. The current price range is seen as relatively risky, as whales may start making a plan to realize profits. ETH accumulation remained active at prices under $2,000, but this time around, some large holders may sell a part of their ETH. The recent market rally also comes with negligible retail buying. Institutions are capable of taking up much more ETH as a way to generate passive income. Retail, on the other hand, can use the DeFi infrastructure to gain a portion of the passive income.

Analysts are revising their Ethereum price predictions, saying the ETH price will increase as ETH 2.0 scaling upgrades continue to roll out. Also, recent upgrades and improvements in the blockchain and reduced gas fees have convinced many that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in the next leg of the bull market. Ethereum Price Prediction: What Analysts Are Seeing? Market sentiment is good at the moment. ETH price pushed past $3,500 resistance with more than $5 billion weekly inflows to ETH ETFs in the past month. According to analysts, if ETH 2.0 scales, Ethereum may revisit its all-time high of nearly $4,900 before the end of 2025. Other analysts believe the ETH price will peak at a new all-time high of 10,000 and as high as 12,000 by next summer. A few hours ago, Ali Martinez revealed that more than 1.8 million Ethereum tokens were purchased last month. This amount of purchase means the whales are buying and positioning ahead of a massive uptrend. Source: Ali_chart via X. All Ethereum price predictions from almost all ends are bullish. And beyond ETH 2.0, rapid adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and Layer 2 solutions is also one of the key drivers of a bullish sentiment While Ethereum price predictions are bullish, investors are instead investing in projects with smaller market caps and high-growth opportunities that can deliver massive returns.

According to prominent cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, XRP’s path to double-digit prices comes after the asset spent several months consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, he said in an X post on August 10. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Notably, XRP’s late-2024 rally led to a tightening between rising support and falling resistance, culminating in a July 2025 breakout above the triangle’s upper trendline. The token has since held above $2.60, indicating buyers have absorbed selling pressure and remain in control. At the moment, the token faces major resistance near $5, matching the 1.272 Fibonacci extension. A clear break could open the path to the 1.618 extension and the $11 target. XRP’s downward risk However, the analysis warned that this outlook relies on XRP holding above its breakout zone. A retreat into the triangle could signal a false breakout, potentially driving prices down to Fibonacci retracement levels near $1.90 or even $1.15. As things stand, XRP’s push toward $4 appears to have been derailed after Ripple moved a massive amount of the asset on August 9. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) hit the community after the release of 1 billion XRP tokens from escrow. Blockchain tracker Whale Alert reported three separate transactions, unlocking 500 million, 100 million, and 400 million XRP, with a combined value of about $3.28 billion. Ripple XRP tokens transfer. Source: Whale Alerts The large-scale release triggered speculation, with some viewing it as a routine, scheduled escrow unlock. In contrast, others raised concerns about potential selling pressure in a market still recovering from recent volatility. Overall, XRP’s recent bullish run was boosted by the conclusion of the Ripple and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) case, which triggered a wave of capital inflows and pushed the asset to a new resistance level at $4. This legal resolution has paved the way for possible institutional capital inflows, potentially through the launch of a spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) in the U.S.. As reported by Finbold, global interest in such a product has surged by over 730% in the past month. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $3.27, up 0.8% in the last 24 hours, and nearly 10% higher over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart.

The post reaffirms the analyst’s long-term wave structure for XRP and states that the market has completed Waves 1 and 2, a phase that required seven years to unfold. The update emphasizes that XRP has now entered what the analyst identifies as Grand Wave 3, and Dark Defender’s analysis suggests that XRP could be headed for triple digits. My Dear Friends, I promised earlier to everyone about the Grand Wave Structure Update. We first addressed the Masterpiece in February 2021. And I know many were telling me XRP cannot even surpass 30 cents. They called me Crazy, etc. And many crazy predictions boomed after that.… pic.twitter.com/qxkhbkBRN2 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) August 9, 2025 Unfolding Patterns on XRP’s Chart The chart overlays a multi-year ascending channel and an Elliott Wave pattern that has dictated XRP’s trajectory throughout its history. The analyst describes the recent movement as the beginning of Wave 3 and uses the earlier Masterpiece as the reference for projected extensions. The update repeats a point that was resisted by critics in previous cycles. Dark Defender referenced skeptics who told him in early 2021 that XRP would not cross $0.3. However, the asset experienced swift growth that year, reaching a multi-year peak of $1.96. The analyst now anticipates larger price expansions based on the Elliott Wave pattern and other bullish indicators. Adding to the ascending channel and multi-wave pattern, the chart also shows a rounding bottom formation , cementing XRP’s climb in Wave 3 and potentially supporting its growth. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Wave 3 Targets The post arrives amid persistent debate within the community about long-term token behavior and price targets. Ripple and the SEC recently settled their legal battle, but XRP’s price has yet to rally significantly, and some experts suggest that the end of the lawsuit will not kickstart XRP’s growth . Dark Defender’s analysis has reinforced the bullish sentiment shared by many analysts. He shows that the market has shifted into the next structural phase, and despite skepticism from some market participants, he has high expectations for the asset. While he did not provide a specific target, his chart suggests that Wave 3 could send XRP above $333 (Fib 161.8%). The analyst also highlighted crucial resistance levels that could become support as XRP grows. The first was $1.88 (Fib 161.8%), which the asset has surpassed. The other two levels are $5.8563 (Fib. 261.80%) and $18.2275 (Fib. 361.8%). Notably, Dark Defender has previously stated that he has no plans to take profit from XRP until it reaches $333 , and the current technical setup could help the asset reach that price target.

49904488,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=187404,1754899811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/49904488.jpeg,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Matrixport Sees Explosive ETH Surge to $4,892",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-price-prediction-matrixport/,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Price Prediction: Matrixport Sees Explosive ETH Surge to $4,892 Are you keeping an eye on the exciting movements in the crypto world? Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, is currently experiencing a significant rally. A leading financial services firm, Matrixport, has made a compelling Ethereum price prediction that’s capturing attention across the market. This surge isn’t just random; it’s driven by powerful forces. Matrixport’s Bold Ethereum Price Prediction According to Matrixport’s “Chart of the Day” post on X (formerly Twitter) from August 11, Ethereum’s recent upward momentum is set to continue. The firm projects an impressive short-term target of $4,362 for ETH, with an even more ambitious long-term forecast. They anticipate the token could climb to a staggering $4,892 . This optimistic outlook from Matrixport stems from a deep dive into various market indicators and fundamental shifts within the Ethereum ecosystem. The firm’s Matrixport ETH outlook suggests a strong underlying health for the asset. What’s Fueling This ETH Price Surge? Several key factors are contributing to this robust ETH price surge , painting a bullish picture for Ethereum. Matrixport highlights these drivers as pivotal to its upward trajectory: Institutional Buying Power: Large institutional investors are increasingly allocating capital into Ethereum. This influx of significant funds provides a solid foundation for price appreciation. Short Liquidations: A wave of short liquidations has further propelled ETH upwards. When traders betting against Ethereum are forced to close their positions, it creates buying pressure, accelerating the rally. Record On-Chain Activity: Ethereum’s network recently hit a new milestone, with daily on-chain transactions surpassing 1.8 million. This record high indicates robust network usage and demand. High Staking Percentage: Over 30% of the total ETH supply is now staked. Staking locks up tokens, reducing the circulating supply and creating scarcity, which can drive prices higher. These combined forces create a powerful tailwind for Ethereum, reinforcing Matrixport’s positive outlook. Regulatory Clarity and Corporate Confidence in Ethereum Beyond market mechanics, regulatory developments and corporate actions are also playing a crucial role in bolstering confidence and supporting the Ethereum market analysis . Matrixport specifically pointed out two significant bullish factors: SEC’s Staking Token Stance: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has indicated that liquid staking tokens are not considered securities. This clarity reduces regulatory uncertainty, making Ethereum more attractive to institutional and retail investors alike. Increasing Corporate Holdings: Publicly traded companies are steadily accumulating Ethereum. Their increasing holdings signal a growing belief in ETH’s long-term value and utility, further legitimizing the asset. Such endorsements from both regulators and corporations provide a strong vote of confidence for Ethereum’s future. Understanding the Institutional Ethereum Buying Trend The trend of institutional Ethereum buying is perhaps one of the most significant developments. Unlike retail investors, institutions typically conduct extensive due diligence, committing larger sums and holding for longer periods. Their entry into the market often signifies a maturing asset class and can provide stability and sustained growth. This increased institutional interest suggests that Ethereum is transitioning from a niche asset to a recognized component of diversified investment portfolios. It underscores a broader acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance. Matrixport’s latest analysis offers a compelling vision for Ethereum’s future, projecting an impressive climb to $4,892. This optimistic Ethereum price prediction is firmly rooted in tangible market dynamics, including robust institutional demand, significant short liquidations, surging on-chain activity, and growing regulatory clarity. As more institutions embrace ETH and the network continues to demonstrate strong utility, the path ahead for Ethereum looks remarkably bright. Keep an eye on these key indicators as ETH continues its journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Matrixport’s latest Ethereum price prediction? Matrixport predicts Ethereum (ETH) could climb to $4,362 in the short term and potentially reach $4,892 over the longer term. 2. What are the main drivers behind this ETH price surge? Key drivers include significant institutional buying, a wave of short liquidations, record daily on-chain transactions, and over 30% of the total ETH supply being staked. 3. How does regulatory clarity impact Ethereum’s price? The SEC’s decision that liquid staking tokens are not securities reduces regulatory pressure, making Ethereum a more attractive and less risky investment for institutions. 4. Is institutional Ethereum buying a new trend? While institutions have been exploring crypto for a while, their steady increase in Ethereum holdings signals growing confidence and acceptance, becoming a more prominent trend. 5. What does record on-chain activity mean for Ethereum? Record on-chain activity, like over 1.8 million daily transactions, indicates strong network usage, utility, and demand, which are bullish factors for Ethereum’s value.

Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Bonk (BONK) are gaining traction. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035 in phase 6 of its presale. Early investors in MUTM are set to reap 500% gains as the project continues to gain speed. Mutuum Finance has already secured more than $14.3 million with over 15020 investors. While BONK also attracts interest as an alternative speculative play, Mutuum Finance stands out by combining affordability with a robust infrastructure aimed at sustainable growth. BONK Rides Market Attention In Alternatives To Shiba Inu The trading price of BONK is around $0.00000085, and the asset shows a continuous trading indicator as the asset becomes active in the sphere of cheaper meme and utility tokens. BONK emerged as a Solana-based community project and carved a niche by focusing on user participation and governance. With a rising price and market cap in 2025, BONK is quickly building a following. However, greater attention is also turning to utility focused projects, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in the lead. Mutuum Finance Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance has organized a $100,000 giveaway . 10 fortunate people are going to win a token of $10,000 in Mutuum Finance Tokens. The giveaway is a proof of the great extent of commitment the project has towards gaining a long-term and dedicated base. As yet another move towards security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK. The project team is compensating the participants up to $50,000 USDT for reporting likely vulnerabilities in the project. The purpose of bounty program is to get a good coverage of all the classes of vulnerabilities; it is split into the four classes of severity; i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The project also demonstrates the team’s commitment towards security of ecosystem as well as investor confidence. Mutuum Finance Grows with Phase 6 Launch of Its Presale Mutuum Finance is doing amazingly well in presale, with stage 6 in progress at $0.035. Mutuum Finance is transforming the DeFi industry by creating a financial system that holds practical real-world applications. Presale has successfully onboarded more than 15020 token holders and achieved over $14.3 million. Investors buying the presale today can see their investment increase up to 5x on launch. Powerful Lending Protocol The platform has a double lending system for the provision of flexibility and efficiency that involves Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models. Peer-to-Contract makes use of a smart contract that lends automatically without any form of human intervention. Peer-to-Peer model removes middlemen so lenders can be in direct contact with borrowers. It is more prevalent in meme coins. Mutuum Finance has raised more than $14.3 million and attracted over 15,050 investors to its presale. Phase 6 is underway at $0.035. The next phase will include a 14.29% price increase to $0.04. Investors buying early into MUTM could see their holdings grow over 500% once the token goes live. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines affordability with real-world utility. With its $100,000 token giveaway and $50,000 bug bounty program, the project is building trust and expanding its community. Now is the time to secure MUTM tokens before the next price jump.

(TSLA) turned to the biggest holding of Cathie Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). However, Roku Inc. and Coinbase Global Inc. also made it to the top 3 holdings of the ETF, suggesting a solid upward trajectory for these companies. This comes in when ARKK recorded its biggest single-day cash injection ever of $800 million at the beginning of August. This inflow helped the fund snap a brutal run of 18 consecutive months of net outflows. The Innovation ETF has managed to surge by almost 22% over the past 6 months. Tesla is still ARKK’s biggest bet ARK Invest’s data shows that ARKK holds $771 million worth of Tesla shares , which makes 10.37% of the fund. It further carries $468 million worth of Roku (6.41%) and $458 million worth of Coinbase (6.28%) shares. Roblox Corp. (worth approx. $416.5 million) and Shopify Inc. (worth approx. $403.6 million) are two other major assets in the portfolio. ARKK has also been adding BitMine (BMNR) to its portfolio. This crypto miner had recently shifted focus to Ethereum and aims to acquire 5% of the total ETH supply. Ark Invest has been building its BMNR stake across multiple ETFs, signaling strong conviction. However, Robinhood is still in the top 10 tally as ARKK owns $341 million worth of HOOD shares . Source: ARK Invest . This year has been a different story for ARKK as it is up by more than 32% in 2025 on a total return basis. It has outpaced the S&P 500’s 8.6% gains. The ARK Innovation ETF came into the light in the pandemic-era tech mania and soared nearly 150% in 2020, but tumbled hard during the 2022 tech wreck. ARKK traded at an average price of $74.76 in the last session. Crypto market in ‘Greed’ mode Tesla’s share price is also on a surge, which has pushed Cathie Wood’s ARKK to perform well. Tesla is up by over 6% in the last 5 trading sessions. Coinbase is another stock that has maintained its position in the fund. Despite the recent dump, COIN price is up by 16% over the last 6 months, trading at $310.54. Wood’s trademark strategy of buying dips and trimming winners remains intact. In the past week, she has sold portions of a popular tech stock despite its rally, while increasing exposure to other high-growth plays. Analysts hint that the renewed investor appetite isn’t just about ARKK, it’s part of a broader rotation back into high-growth, high-risk plays. The global digital asset market cap regained $4 trillion as Bitcoin rallied to trade above $122K. The BTC price remains up by 7% in the past 7 days after witnessing a dip to $112K levels. The biggest altcoin, Ethereum, is running hot on an upward rally. ETH price zoomed by more than 20% over the last 7 days. It is trading at an average price of $4,280 at press time.

Built on Ethereum Layer 2 for speed and low fees, and packing huge staking rewards with a $1 million giveaway, it’s attracting traders chasing outsized returns. Many see it as the top crypto pick now, with potential to multiply those XRP and ETH gains by 150x before year’s end. Ethereum price hits $4,300 as breakout fuels talk of new all-time highs As of August 10, 2025, the Ethereum price is trading at $4,212 after hitting $4,330 less than 24 hours before—its highest level since December 2021. The move wiped out over $215 million in short positions within 24 hours. ETH’s clean break above the $4,000 resistance marks the start of a potential new all-time high, following its breakout from a 4-year wedge in July. Source: Sosovalue The chart shows strong momentum, with on-balance volume (OBV) breaking higher and whale accumulation adding fuel to the rally. Continued inflows into ETH exchange-traded funds are reinforcing bullish sentiment. With technicals and fundamentals aligned, many traders see August as a possible launchpad for ETH’s next major leg up, making it one of the top altcoins to watch right now. XRP holds strong after SEC win as futures volume surges As of August 10, 2025, XRP is trading around $3.24, holding firm after a historic legal win. On August 7, Ripple and the SEC jointly dismissed their appeals, cementing the decision that XRP is not a security in secondary market sales. Ripple will pay a $125 million penalty for past institutional sales but avoids future federal litigation, a ruling that provides rare regulatory clarity in crypto. Source: Sosovalue This outcome has sparked speculation about new products, including a spot XRP ETF, with analysts giving it a 95% approval chance before October. Futures markets are already heating up: volume has surged 208% in 24 hours to $12.4B, overtaking Solana’s $9.6B. XRP open interest is up 15% to $5.9B, showing heavy capital commitment. With funding rates positive, the market is leaning bullish, but overexposure could cut both ways. Layer Brett combines meme energy with real utility and big community incentives Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is quickly earning a spot on traders’ watchlists as one of the top altcoins to watch in the 2025 crypto bull run. Built on Ethereum Layer 2, it delivers lightning-fast transactions, low fees, and the scalability needed for long-term growth. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Layer Brett offers real utility while keeping the culture and community energy that make meme tokens so appealing. Layer Brett’s staking program is a major draw, offering over 20,000% APY for early participants. The project is fully self-custodial, meaning holders maintain complete control without KYC requirements. Add in gamified staking, NFT integrations, and a $1 million giveaway, and it’s easy to see why momentum is building. Here is why $LBRETT stand out in the crypto market: Runs on Ethereum Layer 2 for fast transactions and minimal fees Staking rewards exceeding 20,000% APY for early participants Full asset control with no KYC requirements Interactive, gamified staking to keep users engaged With these unique features, $LBRETT is shaping up to be the next big crypto everyone wishes they bought before the market caught on. $LBRETT presale offers an affordable alternative to Ethereum and XRP With the presale price set at just $0.004, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) offers an entry point that’s a fraction of what traders would pay for heavyweights like Ethereum and XRP. While ETH and XRP are established and carry strong market positions, $LBRETT brings Ethereum Layer 2 speed, high staking rewards, and a $1 million community giveaway and all at a cost accessible to everyday investors—with analysts predicting it could climb 150x in 2025.

S&P Rates USDS ‘Constrained’ With Score of 4 in First Evaluation In its first evaluation, S&P gave USDS a “4” on its stability scale — labeled “constrained” — for maintaining its dollar peg. Sky Protocol, a decentralized lending platform, facilitates crypto-backed loans and uses USDS to support lending and borrowing activity. USDS ranks as the fourth-largest stablecoin by market cap, with $5.36 billion in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap. S&P defines a default in this context as a “haircut imposed on token holders.” The agency highlighted potential triggers, such as mass withdrawals exceeding available liquidity or credit losses outpacing capital reserves. S&P Global Ratings has published its first-credit rating for any stablecoin system: Sky Protocol. pic.twitter.com/xiQE8YyecG — Sky (@SkyEcosystem) August 8, 2025 Weaknesses flagged include high depositor concentration, centralized governance, reliance on founder Rune Christensen, regulatory uncertainty, and limited capitalization, its risk-adjusted capital ratio was just 0.4% as of July 27. Andrew O’Neil, S&P’s digital assets analytical lead, told Cointelegraph that a B- rating indicates the protocol “can meet its financial obligations” but remains “vulnerable in adverse business, financial and economic conditions.” The governance issue was underscored by S&P’s observation that decision-making remains highly centralized, partly due to low voter participation, despite Christensen holding nearly 9% of governance tokens. Sky’s Asset-Liability Committee said the review allowed it to re-examine traditional counterparty risk models and assess DeFi-specific risks such as smart contract vulnerabilities, oracle dependencies, bridge security, and governance issues. These were identified as areas requiring ongoing monitoring and mitigation. The rating also lowered Sky’s anchor score to “bb,” four notches below the U.S. banking anchor of “bbb+,” citing the broader regulatory uncertainty facing DeFi. S&P Ranks USDC Strong, Puts USDT and USDS in ‘Constrained’ Category S&P’s stablecoin assessment ranked Circle’s USDC at 2 (strong), Tether’s USDT at 4 (constrained), and USDS also at 4, with O’Neil noting that Tether’s main issue is transparency while USDS faces complexity in its asset base and weaker capital reserves. S&P launched its stablecoin stability framework in December 2023, and in June, awarded its first blockchain-based mortgage securitization, by Figure Technology Solutions, an AAA rating for a $355 million pool of mortgage assets. Globally, stablecoin regulation is accelerating. In the US, President Donald Trump signed the first federal stablecoin bill on July 18, calling it a “giant step” toward securing American dominance in global finance and crypto technology. As reproted, Western Union is positioning itself for a new phase of digital transformation, signaling strong interest in using stablecoins to modernize its global remittance operations.

Namely, the world’s largest cryptocurrency surged 3.6% in 24 hours, pushing past $122,000 and almost approaching its all-time high (ATH) of $123,091. What’s more, Bitcoin saw 364,126 new addresses created on Saturday, August 9, the highest number in a year, as per Glassnode data reported by Ali Martinez. New Bitcoin addresses.

Polymarket , a cryptocurrency-oriented prediction market, also shows a 40% probability of two September Fed cuts.

FLOKI and LBRETT Price Set To Soar",https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/bnb-price-prediction-as-1k-nears-could-binance-coin-hit-2k-in-2025-floki-and-lbrett-price-set-to-soar/,"For months, Binance Coin (BNB) has been quietly edging upward, now sitting just over $800. Traders have noticed. The conversation isn’t just about whether it can hold this level—it’s whether the next leg higher is already in motion. Near-term estimates point to $806 within days, maybe $824–$825 before the year wraps up. This current BNB Price Prediction draws strength from steady order books, an intact uptrend, and no shortage of bullish conviction. Stretch that timeline to 2025 and the outlook gets even more interesting. BNB’s Price Prediction: Can It Reach $2,000 in 2025? Yes, there are caution flags—overbought conditions, a few weeks of heavier selling in late July—but they haven’t derailed the broader trend. Technical analysts still highlight upside targets around $1,600 for next year. Some, with bolder forecasts, talk about the possibility of $2,000 if global sentiment in crypto shifts back into high gear. The 200-day moving average remains pointed north, and support in the $540–$550 range has held through multiple tests. Those levels matter; they’re what keep the bigger picture bullish. FLOKI and $LBRETT: Competitor Coins Poised for Growth Of course, BNB isn’t moving in a vacuum. Other tokens are carving out their own storylines. FLOKI, still flying the meme-coin banner, trades near $0.000119 with a market cap pushing $1.13 billion. The Floki Inu Price can turn on a dime, often reacting faster to a viral tweet than to a macro shift. That volatility is part of the appeal for retail traders. Then there’s Layer Brett ($LBRETT) , priced at just $0.004. It’s small, speculative, and exactly the kind of project some early-stage investors seek out before the crowd shows up. With a 10 billion token supply and a presale narrative that positions it as a fresh rival to BNB and FLOKI, $LBRETT has started to build momentum. The question is how quickly it can scale that interest. Comparative Analysis: BNB vs. FLOKI and $LBRETT Side by side, the differences stand out. BNB is the seasoned player with utility baked into the Binance ecosystem. Its price behavior is more predictable, its support zones well-defined. FLOKI runs on a different fuel—community buzz and the kind of cultural moments that send the Floki Inu Price surging. Layer Brett is the wildcard. With $LBRETT at $0.004, entry costs are low, but so is the visibility compared to its larger peers. That dynamic could shift quickly if presale hype grows or meme-coin enthusiasm returns. For some, it’s not about choosing between BNB and FLOKI or $LBRETT—it’s about holding a mix to balance stability with high-risk, high-reward bets. Outlook and Final Thoughts Hitting a BNB Price Prediction of $2,000 isn’t a given, but it’s not far-fetched either. Sustained demand, strong technicals, and broader market optimism could make it happen. Meanwhile, both $LBRETT and the Floki Inu Price could break higher if we see a repeat of the meme-coin and presale surges that drove past cycles. Each token has its own identity: BNB with its utility and track record, FLOKI with community-powered bursts, and Layer Brett with its early-stage speculative edge, no KYC and $1 million giveaway. Watching them move—especially as BNB pushes closer to that $1,000 mark—will be essential for traders looking to ride the next big wave. Don’t miss the Layer Brett presale —your best shot at the next big crypto surge.

Security and privacy The tool should offer features that protect user data and funds. Security features to look out for include data encryption, multi-factor authentication, and third-party audits. Check whether the platform is custodial or non-custodial. Custodial platforms hold and control your funds, while non-custodial platforms give you complete control. Functionality and features Based on your needs, check the platform’s features and functionalities. Features like automation help streamline your process. Check for extra features like wallet integration and live chat customer service. Decentralization and control Check the platform’s governance model. Open-source platforms are more transparent and usually have a loyal community of users and developers. Decentralized platforms run on DAOs, meaning no single authority controls the platform. User experience Many Web3 tools have multiple features that make navigating difficult for new users. The Web3 ecosystem may also consist of terms that may confuse new users. Take time to learn the functionalities. Also, check whether the platform has a mobile application or is compatible with your browser. Fees and cost structure Most crypto tools start free but have a tiered fee structure for more detailed services or products. Based on your needs, compare the fee structure of different platforms and what each subscription offers. Reputation and community For reputation, you can check user reviews from third-party platforms like TrustPilot. Look for repeated complaints and whether raised concerns were resolved. You can also check developer activity by checking the platform’s GitHub repository for improvements. What are the tools a crypto trader should use? Every trader needs a tool to track crypto prices, measure market sentiment, and check the authenticity of a crypto project. Without the right tools, it can be challenging to determine these factors. Crypto tools use both on-chain and off-chain data to create dashboards that can be interpreted to assist in trading decisions or tracking progress. So, traders will need a tool like CoinGecko to track cryptocurrency prices in real time and TradingView to analyze crypto prices on different timeframes with price and trend indicators. For the experienced trader, CoinGlass will give you deep insights into the futures market, while Tokenomist will help you gauge the authenticity of a project’s tokenomics. A beginner-friendly tool like CoinStats will help you manage your crypto and NFT portfolio. Conclusion Crypto tools, like any other tool, help you meet a goal. The more experience you have with a tool, the better it can serve you. Therefore, every trader must learn about the best crypto tools in the market to make better moves. Tools help traders gauge market sentiment, which is critical in determining whether to enter or exit the market. Wrong judgment could mean losses on your hard-earned money.","Deep Dive - Crypto, Web3 & Market Insights|CoinStats",EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-11 09:39:19

Fresh on-chain analysis reveals that an address, deeply rooted in the origins of Ethereum through its participation in the 2015 Ethereum ICO , appears poised to offload a substantial amount of its holdings. This development is not just a data point; it’s a potential catalyst that could influence the immediate future of the ETH price . Let’s explore the intricate details of this unfolding story and what it means for you. Who is This Ethereum Whale and What Are They Doing? This particular Ethereum whale is no ordinary investor. They are a participant from the very first public sale of Ethereum in 2015, known as the Ethereum ICO . At that time, they acquired an impressive 100,000 ETH for an average cost of just $0.311 per token. This represents an incredible long-term hold and a monumental profit. According to insights shared by the respected on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, this address recently initiated a significant transfer. They moved 10,000 ETH, which translates to approximately $42.73 million at current valuations, to a newly created address. Crucially, a portion of this, specifically 2,000 ETH (valued at around $8.55 million), has already been deposited onto the Kraken crypto exchange. Such a move typically indicates an intention to sell. Whales often use exchanges to convert their large crypto holdings into fiat currency or other digital assets. This immediate deposit signals that a portion of the offload might happen very soon. Why Does an Ethereum Whale’s Move Impact the ETH Price? The actions of an Ethereum whale can significantly influence the ETH price due to the principles of supply and demand. When a large quantity of a cryptocurrency is deposited onto an exchange, it effectively increases the available supply for sale. If buying demand does not absorb this increased supply, the price tends to fall. This specific whale’s history, being an early Ethereum ICO participant, adds another layer of psychological impact. Their decision to sell, after holding for so many years, can be interpreted by some as a lack of long-term conviction, even if it’s simply profit-taking. This sentiment can sometimes lead to panic selling among smaller investors, exacerbating any price dips. However, it is also important to remember that the Ethereum market is vast and liquid. While 10,000 ETH is a substantial sum for an individual, it represents a small fraction of Ethereum’s daily trading volume and overall market capitalization. Therefore, the impact might be temporary or limited, depending on market conditions. Understanding the Broader Crypto Market Implications The ripple effect of a major Ethereum whale transaction extends beyond just ETH. The entire crypto market often takes cues from the performance of its leading assets, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum. A notable downturn in ETH could potentially drag down other altcoins, particularly those within the Ethereum ecosystem. Conversely, if the market absorbs this selling pressure without a significant price drop, it could signal underlying strength and robust demand for Ethereum. This kind of event also highlights the power of on-chain analysis , providing transparency into market movements that were once opaque. It empowers investors with data to make more informed decisions. Challenges and Considerations: Market Sentiment: Large sales can trigger fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among investors. Liquidity: While exchanges are liquid, very large orders can still cause slippage if not handled carefully. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: This is a short-term market event; Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals remain strong. Actionable Insights: Navigating Potential ETH Price Volatility Given the potential for increased volatility, what steps can investors take? Firstly, avoid impulsive decisions. Panic selling during a perceived dip often leads to losses. Instead, rely on thorough on-chain analysis and fundamental research. Consider setting stop-loss orders if you are trading short-term, but be aware of potential market volatility that could trigger them. For long-term holders, such events can sometimes present buying opportunities if the ETH price dips temporarily below its intrinsic value. Staying informed is key. Follow reputable on-chain analysts and news sources. Understand that profit-taking by early investors is a natural part of any maturing asset class. This particular Ethereum whale has held for years, and realizing profits is a logical step for any investor. In summary, the movement of 10,000 ETH by a long-standing Ethereum ICO participant is a significant development for the crypto market . While it introduces potential selling pressure and could affect the ETH price in the short term, it also underscores the transparency offered by on-chain analysis . By understanding these dynamics and reacting thoughtfully, investors can navigate such events with greater confidence and make informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is the Ethereum whale mentioned in the article? An Ethereum whale refers to a very large holder of ETH. In this case, it’s an address that participated in the 2015 Ethereum ICO, purchasing 100,000 ETH at a very low price. Q2: What does it mean for an Ethereum whale to “offload” ETH? “Offloading” ETH means selling or preparing to sell a large quantity of Ethereum. This often involves moving funds from a private wallet to a cryptocurrency exchange, where they can be traded for other assets or fiat currency. Q3: How might this specific move impact the ETH price? When a large amount of ETH is deposited onto an exchange, it increases the potential supply available for sale. If buying demand does not match this increased supply, it could lead to a temporary downward pressure on the ETH price. However, the overall impact depends on market liquidity and sentiment. Q4: What is the significance of the Ethereum ICO? The Ethereum ICO (Initial Coin Offering) in 2015 was the initial public sale of Ethereum tokens. Participants who bought ETH during the ICO acquired them at a very low price, making them early and often very profitable investors if they held their assets. Q5: Should I be concerned about my ETH holdings due to this whale activity? While whale movements can cause short-term volatility, it’s crucial to distinguish between temporary fluctuations and long-term fundamentals. For long-term holders, such events can be opportunities to accumulate more ETH if prices dip. Always conduct your own research and consider your investment strategy. Q6: Where can I track such Ethereum whale movements? You can track significant whale movements through various on-chain analysis platforms and services. These platforms monitor large transactions on the blockchain and often provide insights into the wallets involved and their historical activity. Following reputable on-chain analysts on social media can also keep you informed. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Each is gaining ground quickly, from Solana’s and Cardano’s gradual rise to Layer Brett’s spectacular presale development. This article talks about their most recent price changes, important technical signs, and why experts say they are some of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now. Solana price records strong comeback The Solana price has gone up more than 10% over the past week. Additionally, Solana rallied approximately 15% over the past month. The Solana price chart shows that this growth is following a strong bullish pattern, with higher highs and higher lows. Earlier, the price of Solana fell from $205 in late July to $155 in early August because of significant bearish pressure. Nonetheless, the price is going up again, and experts think it could hit the $300 mark this year and potentially rally beyond $500 in this bull run. As a result, Solana has found its way on the best crypto to invest in list for several analysts. Cardano price sees increased bullish momentum Over the past month, the Cardano price has surged by more than 25%. Moving Averages and the MACD are two of the technical indicators that suggest further rallies for Cardano. Meanwhile, some Cardano holders believe that it’s the best crypto to invest in right now because it’s still a long way from its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10. While some are of the opinion that Cardano could hit its ATH this year, analysts like BitMonty are being more conservative. BitMonty thinks the best time to buy Cardano this period is between $0.68 and $0.61, with a short-term goal of $1.20. The overall trend for the Cardano price is still bullish, nevertheless. Layer Brett– The best crypto to invest in for speed and utility Layer Brett is a new Layer 2 memecoin that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It combines the culture of viral memes with real blockchain use. This indicates that Layer Brett is both useful and amusing. Transactions on the network happen very quickly, and gas fees are quite minimal. Holders can also get big rewards for staking. Layer Brett is different from a lot of memecoins that don’t have any real utility. It’s made to be scalable and secure on Ethereum. It aims to compete with big Layer 2 projects like Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync. Because it puts the community first, has lots of benefits for holders, and has massive growth potential, Layer Brett is the best crypto to invest in this year. Layer Brett is now in its presale stage, which means you can get early access. The $LBRETT coin costs only $0.0042, which is a low price for early investors. In just weeks, more than $120,000 has already been raised. This suggests that there is a lot of demand and that investors are becoming more confident. Don’t miss the next big crypto breakout Cardano and Solana are both in a bullish trend. However, Layer Brett is the new altcoin that is getting the most attention right now. The $LBRETT price is still only $0.0042, but it won’t stay that way for long. This could be your best chance to get into a project that competes with the top Layer 2 networks. Don’t wait until the price skyrockets; accumulate your $LBRETT now and be part of the next major crypto success story!

Some of the well-known altcoins are also well in the green. Ethereum (ETH) surged to a level last seen in 2021, with its market capitalization surpassing $520 billion. BTC on the Run Again Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed a gradual price pump last week, followed by a substantial green candle over the last 24 hours. It briefly spiked above $122,200 (or less than 1% from its all-time high), whereas it currently trades at around $121,600. Source: TradingView A potential factor triggering the latest pump is the upcoming meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The primary focus of the discussion is supposed to be the eventual peace between Russia and Ukraine, but we have yet to see whether a deal will be made . Meanwhile, important economic events, such as the US CPI report for July ( released on August 12), may propel additional volatility in the coming days. BTC’s market capitalization soared to $2.42 trillion, solidifying its spot as the sixth-biggest asset in the world. Its dominance against the altcoins remains rather unchanged at approximately 58%. ETH Leads the Altcoin Rally ETH continues its bull run as it temporarily surpassed $4,300. This represents a 44% monthly increase, marking its highest point since December 2021. Furthermore, its market capitalization exceeded $520 billion, thus flipping well-known companies like Netflix and Mastercard. Other altcoins registering significant price increases over the last 24 hours include XRP (3%), LTC (4%), HYPE (6%), CRO (7%), ENA (10%), and more. Among the few witnessing some minor losses are Pi Network’s PI, Bittensor (TAO), and Official Trump (TRUMP).

The goal? Ride the next meme coin wave while ensuring a mix of long-term growth and short-term hype exposure. His verdict is clear: Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is the front-runner and primary bet for wealth-building in the coming bull cycle. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) Dominates Analyst’s 2025 Strategy Pepe Dollar (PEPD), currently available on pepedollar.io , has already raised over $1.2 million in its presale — a figure that continues to grow rapidly. With Ethereum whales reportedly watching its progress and meme communities rallying behind its Layer-2 infrastructure, it’s quickly becoming Crypto Twitter’s favorite pick for 2025. $7,000 Into Pepe Dollar (PEPD): Best Crypto Presale for Meme Utility Of the total $10,000 investment, the analyst commits a decisive $7,000 to Pepe Dollar (PEPD). Why the confidence? Pepe Dollar (PEPD) combines multiple drivers of success: Deflationary tokenomics with scheduled burns Staking rewards tied to Pepedollar.fun’s meme ecosystem A future GameFi and mobile integration on Layer-2 Ethereum Parody positioning as a “Federal Reserve of Memes” The result is more than just speculation — it’s structured meme economics with real engagement loops. With a projected launch price significantly higher than its current presale rate, the upside is substantial. Analysts highlight PEPD’s blend of culture, scarcity, and function as key reasons why it’s the Top Crypto Presale to hold ahead of listings.

With over $1.3 million raised, T6900 is making waves across Telegram, TikTok, and Twitter. Unlike PEPD, however, its value lies in short-term virality rather than long-term utility. Token6900 doesn’t offer staking, Layer-2 tech, or ecosystem utility — but it does promise momentum. Its low entry price and meme-heavy appeal make it ideal for high-risk traders hoping to catch a fast 5x–10x before the hype dies down. The analyst views this position as a “momentum hedge,” noting that while Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is the foundation of the strategy, Token6900 adds short-term upside during the volatile presale window. Why PEPD Beats All Other Best Crypto Presales Across the board, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is outperforming most other meme presales by key metrics: Presale Funding: $1.2M+ already raised Staking Mechanics: Allows holders to earn while waiting for listings Burn System: Ensures long-term supply pressure Community Engagement: PEPD memes, Telegram, and Twitter growth exceed expectations Compared to other contenders like BlockchainFX (BFX), JetBolt (JBOLT), or even Punisher Coin (PUN), Pepe Dollar offers the strongest combination of meme utility, staking rewards, and cultural relevance . $10,000 Breakdown: Analyst’s Final Portfolio $7,000 in Pepe Dollar (PEPD) — Best Crypto Presale for staking, virality, long-term upside $3,000 in Token6900 (T6900) — Meme-fueled short-term pump potential This analyst’s strategy isn’t just about riding hype — it’s about investing in projects that understand meme culture while delivering value.

According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, the “mysterious institution” purchased $212 million worth of ETH in the past 24 hours alone. The buyer is reportedly using six separate wallets to store the funds, with holdings sourced from Galaxy Digital, FalconX, and BitGo. The largest wallet contains ETH worth $181 million, while the smallest still holds $128 million. On-chain data from Glassnode shows that addresses holding over 10,000 ETH climbed to 868,886 on Saturday — the highest level in a year. Institutional Buying Pushes Ether Market Cap Higher The aggressive accumulation comes as Ethereum’s market capitalization hit $523 billion on Monday, surpassing payments giant Mastercard’s $519 billion valuation. ETH is currently trading at $4,332, buoyed by strong institutional interest and a week-long rally. Publicly traded companies with Ether treasuries have also increased their holdings significantly . CoinGecko data reveals that more than 304,000 ETH — worth over $1.3 billion — was added in the past week alone. BitMine Immersion Technologies led the charge, purchasing more than 208,000 ETH valued at over $900 million. SharpLink Gaming followed, adding $303 million worth of ETH to its reserves. These moves signal growing institutional confidence in Ethereum, even as its price approaches historically significant resistance levels. Bullish Price Targets and Cautionary Warnings Technical analysts are becoming increasingly optimistic about ETH’s trajectory. Nilesh Verma predicts that Ether could reach $20,000 within the next six to eight months , citing historical price fractals. Merlijn The Trader, another well-known market analyst, has gone further, suggesting ETH could surpass that milestone entirely. However, not all voices are without caution. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed support for companies adding ETH to their treasuries but warned against excessive leverage. He emphasized that turning Ether accumulation into an “overleveraged game” could have damaging consequences for the asset’s stability. For now, Ethereum’s price momentum, coupled with institutional inflows and whale accumulation, is keeping bullish sentiment high. Whether the current rally will continue toward analysts’ ambitious price targets — or face a sharp correction — will likely depend on the balance between sustained buying pressure and prudent risk management across the market.

Last week, the landscape of digital asset investment products saw a remarkable turnaround, attracting a substantial $572 million in total net inflows. This significant shift, highlighted in the latest CoinShares report , signals a renewed investor confidence after a period of outflows. It’s a clear indication that the market is resilient and continues to draw considerable interest from both institutional and retail players. What’s Fueling These Impressive Crypto Market Inflows? According to CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, this surge in capital marks a strong reversal from previous weeks. The report indicates that earlier outflows were largely triggered by weak U.S. payroll data, which had created a cautious sentiment. However, the latest figures suggest a robust recovery, with investors actively re-engaging with the digital asset space. This positive momentum is certainly a welcome development for those monitoring the health of the crypto ecosystem. The data underscores a broader trend of increasing adoption and a growing belief in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies. It shows that even in the face of macroeconomic headwinds, the underlying appeal of digital assets remains strong. Ethereum Investment Leads the Charge, Bitcoin Inflows Strong When we look at which assets are attracting the most capital, two major players stand out. Ethereum investment products led the pack with an impressive $268 million in net inflows. This substantial figure highlights the continued interest in Ethereum’s ecosystem, driven by its ongoing developments and its pivotal role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. Hot on Ethereum’s heels were Bitcoin inflows , which secured a solid $260 million. As the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin often serves as a barometer for the overall market sentiment. Its strong performance in attracting capital reinforces its position as a preferred asset for institutional allocation. The consistent demand for both Ethereum and Bitcoin underscores their perceived value and stability within the volatile crypto landscape. Beyond the Giants: Broader Digital Asset Investment Products See Traction While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominated the inflows, it wasn’t just a two-horse race. Other notable digital assets also recorded positive, albeit more modest, inflows. This diversification of interest suggests a maturing market where investors are looking beyond just the top two cryptocurrencies. Solana (SOL): Saw positive inflows, reflecting growing interest in its high-performance blockchain. XRP: Also recorded modest inflows, indicating continued support for the remittance-focused cryptocurrency. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Attracted capital, highlighting emerging interest in newer, innovative blockchain projects. These varied inflows demonstrate a healthy appetite across the spectrum of digital asset investment products , indicating that investors are exploring a wider range of opportunities within the crypto market. What Do These Inflows Mean for Investors? The significant crypto market inflows reported by CoinShares offer several key takeaways for investors. Firstly, they signal a potential shift in market sentiment from caution to cautious optimism. Secondly, the sustained interest in structured investment products suggests that traditional investors are finding more accessible and regulated ways to gain exposure to digital assets. For those considering entering or expanding their positions in the crypto space, these trends provide valuable context. It’s important to remember that while inflows are positive, the crypto market remains dynamic. Always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making investment decisions. A Resilient Market: The Latest CoinShares Report Confirms Momentum In conclusion, the latest CoinShares report paints a remarkably positive picture for the digital asset market. The combined net inflow of $572 million into digital asset investment products last week is a powerful indicator of renewed investor confidence and the enduring appeal of cryptocurrencies. With Ethereum leading the charge and strong support for Bitcoin, coupled with growing interest in altcoins, the market appears to be on a robust recovery path. This significant capital injection underscores the market’s resilience and its continued evolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-ledger-tops-rwa-league-table-heres-what-it-means/,"Phil Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, has highlighted the rapid expansion of real-world assets (RWAs) on the XRP Ledger . In a post on X, Kwok described the growth as “very impressive” and noted that the ledger has seen the fastest increase in RWAs compared to any other blockchain. He attributed this surge to Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and added that developments underway at EasyA Labs are expected to push growth even further. Data from the RWA league table attached to his post shows the XRP Ledger ranking first for percentage growth in RWAs over the past 30 days. The ledger recorded a 32.27 percent increase, bringing its total RWA value to $243.2 million. This growth was achieved with only nine listed RWAs, indicating that the network is attracting a smaller number of but higher-value tokenizations. very impressive growth of the xrp ledger. fastest increase in real world assets compared to any other blockchain. driven by @ripple ’s $RLUSD . and this is just the beginning. what we’re working on @easya_labs will send this skyrocketing. pic.twitter.com/SQXR6lPSfc — Phil Kwok | EasyA (@kwok_phil) August 10, 2025 Comparison with Other Networks The same table places Arbitrum in second place, recording a 19.47 percent increase with 113 RWA listings and a total value of $8.45 billion. Plume follows with a 12.62 percent increase and 107 listings valued at $246.2 million. Other major networks in the ranking include zkSync Era, Ethereum, Stellar, Polygon, Base, Avalanche, and Mantle, all of which recorded lower 30-day percentage gains than the XRP Ledger, despite in some cases having hundreds of RWA listings. The figures show that while many networks are active in the RWA sector , the XRP Ledger’s short-term growth rate outpaces all others in the list, with its expansion concentrated in high-value assets rather than in the number of tokenized projects. Community Analysis of the Growth X user SonOfaRichard provided further insight into the data, noting that the XRP Ledger’s 32.27 percent monthly increase demonstrates that tokenized assets are finding their settlement speed, low transaction costs, and reliability appealing for practical adoption. He pointed out that the network’s growth is not being driven by speculation but by its suitability for real-world settlement use cases. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He also identified RLUSD as the central growth driver, explaining that the stablecoin is becoming the preferred settlement layer on the XRP Ledger . Increasing liquidity in RLUSD is directly enabling more RWA onboarding and supporting higher daily transaction volumes. Additionally, he emphasized the significance of the “low count, high value” model, with nine listings supporting over $243 million in value — an indicator of institutional-grade tokenization. Kwok’s remarks, combined with the data and community commentary, point to a strong upward trajectory for RWA adoption on the XRP Ledger. The ledger’s performance in the past 30 days shows that it can compete with and surpass larger networks in growth rate, even with fewer listings. With RLUSD continuing to gain traction and further developments from EasyA Labs in progress, observers suggest that the network’s RWA market share could expand significantly in the near term.

This renewed focus on altcoins is largely driven by Ethereum’s ( ETH ) sustained bullish run as the cryptocurrency attempts to establish itself above the $4,000 support zone. To help pinpoint potential winners for the second half of 2025, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which highlighted the following two assets. Optimism (OP) According to ChatGPT, Optimism ( OP ), a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, shows strong growth potential. The model cited cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe, who projects a potential 280–380% rally within months, noting that an OP breakout may be imminent. This can basically be seen on all #Altcoins . They are all facing a crucial resistance and trends are flipping bullish. The breakout on $OP is around the corner (crucial level at $0.90 and $W at $0.10. What's the upside? 200-400% for the coming 4-6 months. pic.twitter.com/isRr37SMLA — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) August 10, 2025 ChatGPT emphasized that Optimism is gaining traction as Ethereum’s climb above $4,000 drives more DeFi users toward cost-efficient Layer-2 platforms. Institutional interest in scaling solutions and the rollout of Optimism’s ambitious “Superchain” vision could further accelerate adoption. However, competition from rivals like Arbitrum and Base, along with the risk of a broader market pullback, remain key factors to watch. At press time, OP was trading at $0.79, up 0.8% in the past 24 hours and over 20% in the past week. OP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Chainlink (LINK) For its second pick, ChatGPT selected Chainlink ( LINK ), the market leader in decentralized data feeds and cross-chain interoperability. The model noted that LINK is riding a surge in demand tied to tokenized real-world assets, a sector expected to expand rapidly in late 2025. ChatGPT pointed to LINK’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) as a key driver, unlocking new liquidity flows across multiple blockchains, with major banks and enterprises exploring integration. Historically, LINK has posted strong gains in the later stages of bull cycles, though slower RWA adoption or competing oracle solutions could limit upside potential. Over the past week, LINK has gained more than 33% to reach $22.12, with a 1% rally in the past 24 hours. LINK seven-day price chart.

Accordingly, an Ethereum developer using the pseudonym “Fede's Intern” was reportedly detained in Izmir, Türkiye, for allegedly “abusing the Ethereum network.” Fede's Intern, an Argentinian independent kernel developer focusing on ZK and infrastructure, wrote in a post from his X account that he was detained in Izmir. The ETH developer stated that Turkish authorities claimed he was facilitating the exploitation of the Ethereum network. The developer denied the accusations against him and emphasized that he and his team are only infrastructure developers and expressed his willingness to cooperate with authorities. The ETH developer, who continued to share content from his X account, announced that despite being detained, he was taken to a private room and given food, and that he would travel to Europe on a private jet with his legal team to present his defense. The developer, Fede's Intern, recently stated that he liked Ehereum and ZK and added that important names in the Solana (SOL) community contacted him to help. *This is not investment advice.

Alongside rising activity on cross-chain DeFi project platforms like Remittix , TRX is now forecast to hit $0.45 in 2026, up from its current range near $0.32. Analysts point to stronger TVL metrics , rising dApp usage, and stablecoin growth. Momentum in the Tron ecosystem has pushed some to revisit the idea of TRX becoming the next 100x crypto. Projections for 2025 cite average highs around $0.34, with extreme cases placing the price closer to the $0.89 mark . Investors are eyeing Tron’s DeFi projects for crypto with passive income potential as liquidity continues surging. Remittix Is Quietly Becoming the Breakout Presale of 2025 Remittix is drawing major interest as a high-growth crypto that tackles real-world problems. The project’s focus on fast, low gas fee crypto payments makes it a standout across the best DeFi projects of 2025. It recently revealed its wallet interface, launching in Q3, with a 40% token bonus as it has achieved its $18M softcap. At a price of just $0.0895, Remittix has already raised over $18.4 million with over 585M+ tokens sold. The Remittix DeFi project offers massive potential in early-stage crypto investment sectors, particularly for users seeking fast crypto-to-fiat transfers and global remittances. Key reasons why Remittix is leading the pack: Cross-border payments settle in under 60 seconds Powerful use cases in DeFi and crypto staking tools Upcoming listings and wallet beta may boost visibility Real-world adoption across Africa and South Asia Smart investors are rushing to buy the RTX token early Analysts agree: Why Remittix is the best crypto presale of the year isn’t just a marketing phrase. It’s a reflection of on-chain metrics and adoption speed. TRX Price Prediction Supports Bullish Mid-Term Target Short-term TRX price prediction models suggest a slow but stable climb into Q1 2026. Several market analysts, including Binance and Bitget, now see $0.45 as a feasible target if TVL maintains upward momentum. Platforms like Changelly and Kraken highlight that increased DeFi activity could act as a strong price driver. Source: TradingView With new stablecoin options, meme coin integrations, and growing dApp incentives, Tron is being seen as a top crypto under $1 . This makes it especially attractive to retail investors looking for undervalued crypto projects with real utility. Conclusion: Remittix May Still Be the Better Bet While TRX price prediction data supports future gains, Remittix may offer a more powerful asymmetric opportunity. Its low gas fee crypto project model, combined with early-stage traction, could position it as the next big crypto launch of the cycle.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin ($BTC) is up a solid 2% today and is now tantalizingly close to its all-time high of $123K. The day kicked off with an explosive rally, pushing short-term EMAs, like the 10, 20, and 50, sharply upward and widening the gaps between them – a classic sign that consolidation was likely ahead. And consolidate it did. $BTC has just broken down from a rising wedge pattern, but that might actually be good news, as it’s now bouncing off the 50 EMA on the 10-minute chart, hinting at a possible continuation of bullish momentum. Even if it breaks down further, there’s still ample support levels nearby, including the 15-minute 50 EMA and the 50% Fibonacci retracement. As for the upside, if Bitcoin can break back above the 10 and 20 EMAs with strong momentum, there’s a high chance it could create a new all-time high before the day is over. Bitcoin Hyper Could Ride Latin America’s Crypto Adoption Wave August 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bolivia’s decision to team up with El Salvador on a long-term crypto cooperation deal marks a major shift in Latin America’s digital asset landscape. The partnership will see both nations share a regulatory expertise, blockchain intelligence tools, and oversight strategies – aimed at boosting adoption for remittances, small businesses, and cross-chain border payments. With crypto transactions in Bolivia already up 500% in six months to $294M , the region is signalling a strong appetite for practical crypto solutions. This environment plays directly into Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) strengths. As a fast, low-fee Bitcoin Layer 2, it could become a go-to option for remittances and everyday payments in emerging markets. Check out our Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) price prediction to see why we think this project could reach $1.50. Bitcoin Nears All-Time High, as Bitcoin Hyper Presale Tops $8M August 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin is nearing its ATH of $122,838, up 4.5% since Saturday. Rising open interest and speculative long bets suggest strong bullish momentum. If CPI numbers show cooling inflation, it could prompt the Fed to ease rates, potentially driving Bitcoin even higher. ‘There’s still plenty of fuel left for this bull run,’ Sean Dawson, head of research at on-chain options platform Dervie, told Decrypt . Based on volatility data, he added that Bitcoin could hit ‘$150,000 before the end of the year,’ This surge in Bitcoin’s price and investor optimism boosts visibility for Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , which has raised over $8M in presale. As a Layer-2 BTC solution using the Solana Virtual Machin e, it offers fast, programmable transactions and cross-chain support. As Bitcoin gains momentum, demand for scalable $BTC infrastructure grows.

In 2025, Dogecoin stands shoulder-to-shoulder next to Bitcoin. One is the first cryptocurrency, while our doggo friend is widely recognized as the first meme coin. Launched in 2013, $DOGE is up by over 38,000% today, looking at a price of over $0.21 and a trading volume in the billions of dollars. If anything, Dogecoin proves that ‘anything is possible’ in crypto, and even underdogs can become industry giants. With endorsements from industry moguls like Elon Musk and official investment vehicles like the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, $DOGE seems to be going nowhere but up. Click to learn more about Maxi Doge Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is Dogecoin’s bodybuilder cousin chugging Red Bull and scalping cryptos at 3AM in the morning. Embodying full-send chaos and pump potential 2.0, $MAXI is for degen traders who don’t hesitate and keep diamond hands on some of the riskiest plays. While meme coins are a dime a dozen, Maxi Doge is max-commitment, max cojones, and aiming for legend status in the memecoin land. Simply put, if rat poison squared took form, it would probably look like Maxi Doge. And this meme coin is still in presale.

We may earn affiliate commissions at no extra cost to you. Today’s Dogecoin Technical Analysis Having gained over 16% in the past week , Dogecoin ($DOGE) is firmly in bullish territory. The biggest technical confirmation of this comes from the 4-hour chart, where it’s bouncing off the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone. This suggests the token has undergone a healthy correction following its initial parabolic rally and is now perfectly positioned to continue its bullish trend. With the 10, 20, and 50 EMAs neatly stacked and pointing upward, the $0.24673 target, i.e., the high of the Fib range, looks achievable within the next couple of days. That said, a deeper pullback to around $0.21125 is also possible, which would then ignite ‘buy the dip’ sentiment among $DOGE holders. Even with such a correction, though, the larger trend would remain overwhelmingly bullish. ‘Asia’s Doge’ ($PENGU) Targets $0.044 Breakout as $DOGE Rivalry Heats Up and $MAXI Joins the Race August 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) is closing in on a bullish cup-and-handle breakout at $0.044, with technicals pointing to a potential surge toward $0.082. This is around double its current price of $0.04009 . The hype is backed by a pending CBOE-supported ETF filing and growing dominance in Asian markets, where it’s dubbed “Asia’s $DOGE.” If $PENGU’s rally continues, it could ignite a turf war with $DOGE itself, as communities rally behind their token for the coveted best meme coin spot. When these battles kick off, other contenders often fly just as high. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , the ultra-ripped, 1000x-leverage-trading final form of the Shiba Inu family tree, is gearing up to ride this momentum. With its extreme meme appeal and Doge narrative, could it be the next crypto to moon? See our full breakdown of the next 1000x crypto contenders here. From $SHIB & $DOGE to Maxi Doge: Is Meme Coin Momentum Shifting? August 11, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Shiba Inu (SHIB) has dropped 43% since the start of 2025, even as Bitcoin and other major cryptos rally. Dogecoin , the original meme coin, is also down 36% this year, though it remains in the top 10 coins by market cap. Experts suggest this could be a prime buying opportunity, as both dog meme coins have seen explosive comebacks before. On the other hand, it could signal meme coin fatigue, where legacy tokens are losing momentum. Nonetheless, the shift makes way for fresh contenders like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which blends potent meme appeal with staking rewards, contests, and community-driven features. With over $650K raised in presale, Maxi Doge positions itself as the next Alpha dog, perfect for traders who live for the pump and aren’t afraid of the dump. As Dogecoin’s dominance fades, Maxi Doge could be the low-cap entrant meme you’ve been waiting for.

Tokens like Pepe (PEPE) generally surge and crash within hours, creating excitement but leaving many traders questioning the sustainability of these quick wins. In contrast, projects with lasting DeFi infrastructure, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), are steadily attracting those who want more than daily speculation. With its decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines real utility with a growth-focused presale, offering both stability and upside for committed investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Building Through Dual Models While meme coin prices will continue to dance to the beat of viral trends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will develop around two lending frameworks that will directly serve users’ needs: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) models. In the P2C model, lenders will deposit assets into liquidity pools and borrowers will draw overcollateralized loans, with interest rates adjusting automatically to match pool utilization. For example, a user will deposit 500 LINK at $14 each with a 70% loan-to-value ratio, borrowing $4,900 USDC at 8% APY. That arrangement will deliver $392 in yearly income for the lender, with funds stored securely in non-custodial smart contracts and represented by ERC-20 compliant mtTokens. The P2P model will connect borrowers and lenders directly, with rates negotiated case-by-case. A lender might provide $3,200 USDT secured against BONK, earning 15% annual interest. This flexibility will let users engage in custom lending deals while still retaining on-chain security. Together, these models will create a broad service offering that will appeal to both active and passive participants in the future DeFi economy. The presale is currently in Phase 6, with the token price at $0.035. Over $14.30 million has been raised and 15% of available tokens have already been sold. Early participants have been positioning themselves ahead of the projected listing price of $0.06, seeing the current stage as a discount entry point. Security and community incentives are equally prioritized. A $50,000 bug bounty program rewards white-hat developers based on the severity of reported issues, ensuring ongoing protocol security. Meanwhile, a $100,000 giveaway will see ten winners benefit directly, building engagement among early adopters. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already delivered notable returns for early-phase participants. A Phase 1 buyer who swapped SOL, then worth $1500, is now sitting on a 250% increase. Projections for post-listing growth suggest gains of five to 6X for those entering before the conclusion of the presale, driven by expected onboarding of mass DeFi users, beta platform exposure, and exchange listings. Utility Wins in the Long Run The combination of lending services and stablecoin-based liquidity creates a consistent demand engine for Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ecosystem. Borrowers can access funds without selling their holdings, avoiding taxable events and preserving exposure to asset appreciation. Lenders, in turn, earn steady interest without needing to time the market around short-lived meme coin spikes. This cycle of lending, borrowing, and yield accrual ensures the MUTM token has ongoing demand beyond initial speculation. Platform revenue will also be used to buy MUTM on the open market, distributing rewards to those who stake mtTokens in the smart contracts — adding a direct buyback mechanism that supports long-term value. With the roadmap moving toward beta platform launch, exchange listings, and further feature rollouts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building for lasting adoption. Phase 6 pricing leaves room for considerable upside before the listing price, creating an attractive proposition for traders looking to diversify away from meme coin chaos into structured DeFi growth. In the same way meme coins thrive on short bursts of attention, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) thrives on the steady accumulation of real users and real capital. The volatility-driven stories will keep coming from the meme sector, but investors focusing on yield, stability, and structured market expansion are increasingly looking to MUTM as their next move.

49908882,553248,1754906555,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49908882.jpeg,Analyst Foresees BTC Breaking Past $150K – $HYPER Hits $8.3M Amid Scaling Demand,https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-btc-to-surpass-150k-hyper-rises/,"Macroeconomist Lyn Alden believes $BTC has what it takes to hit $150K or ‘much higher’ this cycle. But when $BTC attracts increased demand, there’s often a hitch: The Bitcoin network becomes congested, slowing transactions and driving up fees. Fear not. Bitcoin Hyper is preparing to boost the network’s reliability this quarter. And the timing of the Bitcoin Layer 2 network’s launch, perhaps, couldn’t be any better. Alden Predicts $BTC to Climb Like Big-Tech Giants In a recent Cryptoslate interview , Alden explained how $BTC – currently valued at $121K – might experience a longer, less extreme cycle. One of which is similar to big-tech giants, as opposed to typical crypto volatility. ‘If you look at what used to be called FANG stocks, and now it’s the Mag7 stocks , basically large-cap U.S. tech stocks, they kept grinding up longer than people thought,’ she explained. She added that they sometimes face corrections or choppy years, but resume climbing once momentum rebuilds. Then, that $BTC could follow the same path. ‘I think Bitcoin could resemble that model to some extent. Maybe it’s still more volatile than that, but I do think we should expect maybe longer and less extreme cycles on average,’ continued Alden. Alden then dismissed concerns that Bitcoin treasury companies could trigger a market-wide collapse. As an example, she explained how Microstrategy (which holds 628,791 $BTC worth $74.21B ) has relatively low leverage compared to its Bitcoin holdings. Because the company buys $BTC through a mix of internal cash and external financing , it avoids aggressive debt positions that could cause a large-scale sell-off if prices fall sharply. Still, she believes that ‘we’ll see a lot of altcoin treasury companies get washed out, and some Bitcoin ones that are poorly managed are going to be at risk in the next downturn.’ Such a warning stems from the fact that excessive leverage and poor management can force treasuries to liquidate holdings during downturns. Nevertheless, if Alden’s outlook proves correct, $BTC could be set for a steadier, more sustained climb. Suppose this environment surfaces, Bitcoin Hyper ’s mission to keep the network efficient and affordable during peak demand could prove more essential than ever. Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2 to Boost Bitcoin’s Programmability Bitcoin Hyper , a Layer 2 scaling solution, is being built to fix Bitcoin’s bottleneck woes. By processing transactions off-chain while securing them to Bitcoin’s mainchain, it boasts throughput and lower costs. As a consequence, it’ll enable you to send $BTC quickly and cheaply during heavy network load. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , it’ll also bring smart contract capabilities to Bitcoin. By doing so, developers will be able to build DeFi protocols and dApps directly on the network. It’ll leverage a Canonical Bridge to process transactions through the SVM. This way, it can mint equivalent wrapped $BTC on the Layer 2 network for use in DeFi and dApps. But don’t worry, you’ll still be able to redeem your $BTC on the mainnet whenever you wish. Additionally, Bitcoin Hyper will integrate a Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to verify transactions quickly and securely without overloading Bitcoin’s base layer. This makes it suitable for high-volume payments, cross-border transfers, and on-chain applications. And then there’s the Layer 2 network’s native token, $HYPER, which offers additional perks: reduced transaction fees, governance rights, and staking rewards at a 130% APY. Since its presale launch on May 16, 2025, $HYPER has already raised over $8.3M, backed by major whale buys independently investing $74.9K , $54.1K , and $53.9K . Given this strong investor confidence, it’s no wonder that it’s poised to be the next crypto to explode . Verdict – Alden’s $BTC Outlook Enhances Bitcoin’s Hyper’s Relevance Alden’s outlook frames $BTC experiencing steady, sustained gains as opposed to volatile spikes and crashes. Say her prediction proves correct, the Bitcoin network’s demand could remain high for an extended period. In turn, this would make scalability solutions increasingly important. This is where Bitcoin Hyper shines bright. By combining off-chain transaction processing, Solana-level performance, and smart contract capabilities, it’s a clear answer to Bitcoin’s programmability challenges – especially if $BTC continues to rise, like Alden predicts. To get the most out of the Layer 2, consider scooping up some $HYPER, available on presale for just $0.012625. Once Bitcoin Hyper officially launches on mainnet, it’s anticipated to jump to $0.32 this year. So, why not purchase $HYPER now for possible gains surpassing 2,400%? This isn’t investment advice.

In his recent video, he explored hypothetical returns on investments of $500, $1,000, and $5,000 in XRP under different price scenarios, while also highlighting Ripple’s pursuit of a Special Purpose National Bank Charter in the United States. According to CryptoSensei, if XRP were to reach $100 per token, a $500 investment today could be worth over $16,000, with returns rising substantially at higher price targets. At $500 per token, that same investment would reach $81,000, and if XRP ever hit $10,000 per token , the value could exceed $1.6 million. Similar projections were calculated for higher initial investments, with a $5,000 purchase potentially exceeding $16 million at the highest target. He noted that while such figures depend on XRP meeting ambitious adoption goals, the speculative exercise shows the transformative potential for long-term holders . Here is Why 1000 $XRP Will Change Your Life… (Act Now Before It's to Late) pic.twitter.com/9Y9xhmXZRa — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) August 9, 2025 Ripple’s Potential Direct Integration into the U.S. Financial System A significant portion of the discussion centered on analysis from crypto researcher Smoke , who highlighted excerpts from a State Bank of India document describing a growing movement by non-depository fintech companies to gain Special Purpose National Bank Charters. Firms, such as Ripple, Circle, Wise, and BitGo, are reportedly seeking these licenses, which would allow them to bypass intermediary banks and integrate directly into the U.S. financial system. CryptoSensei explained that Ripple currently works through partner banks to access the Federal Reserve’s systems. Securing its banking charter could give Ripple direct access, enabling it to operate as a fully licensed banking entity without functioning as a traditional depository institution. Smoke’s interpretation suggested this could be the mechanism by which XRP enters the “banking mainframe,” providing regulatory legitimacy for its use within established financial infrastructure. Political and Regulatory Considerations CryptoSensei connected the development to political factors, noting that President Trump has been vocal against banks accused of debanking conservatives and may be inclined to approve banking charters for crypto companies as a way to promote competition. He referenced reports that the White House is preparing an executive order to penalize banks that engage in such discriminatory practices. This political backdrop, he argued, could improve Ripple’s chances of obtaining a charter. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Utility, Partnerships, and Regulatory Milestones Beyond the banking charter, CryptoSensei highlighted Ripple’s ongoing work to expand utility on the XRP Ledger. He cited projects such as the Dubai Land Department issuing property title deeds on XRPL and tokenized commercial paper initiatives with Guggenheim Treasury Services. He also mentioned Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin , which has already surpassed $600 million in market capitalization, although most of its activity remains on Ethereum rather than XRPL. He emphasized that the current market remains largely speculative, with true utility-driven price action likely to emerge when large-scale tokenization of assets and regulated institutional adoption become widespread. Regulatory developments, such as the anticipated SEC clarity update on August 15, were noted as potential catalysts for XRP’s future positioning. Basel III and XRP’s Role in Banking Efficiency The video also referenced Basel III banking regulations, which aim to strengthen global banking standards. According to the discussion, XRP could serve as a bridge asset in cross-border transactions, reducing costs for banks holding it on their balance sheets. The ability to provide liquidity directly through XRP was presented as a potential advantage under the new framework. In closing, CryptoSensei acknowledged that while the regulatory path remains uncertain, the convergence of political support, regulatory opportunities, and expanding utility creates a scenario where XRP could achieve substantial market value over time. He reiterated that any investment decisions should be made carefully, ideally with professional financial guidance, but maintained that XRP’s long-term prospects remain compelling if Ripple’s integration strategies succeed.

Recently, all eyes turned to Lista DAO as it announced a crucial development: a vote on LIP-021, a proposal for a substantial Lista DAO token burn . This move isn’t just about reducing numbers; it’s about potentially redefining the very foundation of LISTA’s economic model and its long-term viability. What Does the Lista DAO Token Burn Proposal Entail? Lista DAO, a prominent player in the decentralized finance ecosystem, made waves with its announcement via X (formerly Twitter) regarding LIP-021. This proposal calls for the permanent incineration of 200 million LISTA tokens. To put this into perspective, that’s a significant 20% of the maximum supply. Total Burn: 200 million LISTA tokens. Impact on Supply: Reduces the maximum supply cap from 1 billion to 800 million tokens. Permanence: This is a permanent reduction, designed to create scarcity. Such a substantial reduction directly impacts the overall crypto token supply , a key factor influencing a token’s value proposition. How Will LISTA Tokenomics See a Revamp? Beyond the immediate token burn, LIP-021 introduces a significant overhaul to LISTA tokenomics . The existing model included a fixed 40% permanent freeze, which limited flexibility. The new proposal aims to replace this with a more dynamic approach. The proposed change involves a flexible split of revenue. This revenue will be strategically distributed between two critical areas: veLISTA Holder Rewards: This benefits those who lock up their LISTA tokens, aligning incentives for long-term participation. DAO Operations: Funds will be allocated to support the ongoing development, maintenance, and expansion of the Lista DAO ecosystem. The remaining 60% of the token distribution remains unchanged, focusing on other aspects of the protocol’s growth and utility. This shift allows for greater adaptability in how the protocol manages its resources and rewards its community. Why is This Lista DAO Governance Vote Crucial? The period for this pivotal vote runs from August 11th to August 14th on Snapshot, a widely used platform for decentralized governance. The very act of voting on such a fundamental change highlights the power of Lista DAO governance and the principles of decentralized autonomous organizations. Community participation in these votes is essential. It ensures that decisions reflect the collective will of token holders, fostering a truly decentralized environment. This empowers the community to directly influence: The economic health of the protocol. The reward mechanisms for participants. The long-term strategic direction of Lista DAO. Such transparency and direct involvement are hallmarks of a robust decentralized finance project. What Are the Potential Impacts of This Token Burn? A successful Lista DAO token burn could have several significant implications for the protocol and its token holders. One immediate effect often seen with supply reductions is increased scarcity. When fewer tokens are available, assuming consistent demand, the value of each remaining token can potentially rise. According to CoinMarketCap, Lista DAO was trading at $0.3727, experiencing a notable 24.66% increase in the 24 hours leading up to the announcement. While market movements are complex and influenced by many factors, news of a potential token burn often generates positive sentiment, reflecting investor anticipation of reduced crypto token supply and improved value propositions. The proposed changes to LISTA tokenomics could also make the token more attractive to long-term holders and stakers, further stabilizing its market position. In conclusion, the LIP-021 vote represents a critical juncture for Lista DAO. It showcases the dynamic nature of decentralized finance and the power of community-led decisions. The proposed Lista DAO token burn and tokenomics revamp could significantly reshape the protocol’s future, potentially enhancing value for holders and strengthening the ecosystem. The outcome of this vote will undoubtedly be closely watched by the wider crypto community, serving as a testament to the evolving landscape of on-chain governance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary purpose of the Lista DAO token burn? A1: The primary purpose of the Lista DAO token burn is to permanently reduce the total supply of LISTA tokens by 20% (200 million tokens), aiming to create scarcity and potentially enhance the value of the remaining tokens. Q2: How does the new LISTA tokenomics plan differ from the old one? A2: The new LISTA tokenomics plan replaces a fixed 40% permanent freeze with a flexible revenue split. This split allocates funds between veLISTA holder rewards and DAO operations, offering more adaptability in resource management compared to the previous fixed structure. Q3: What role does Lista DAO governance play in this decision? A3: Lista DAO governance is central to this decision. Token holders participate in a vote (LIP-021) on Snapshot, directly influencing the protocol’s economic structure and demonstrating the power of decentralized decision-making in decentralized finance. Q4: When is the voting period for LIP-021? A4: The voting period for LIP-021 runs from August 11th to August 14th on the Snapshot platform. Q5: How might a reduced crypto token supply affect LISTA’s market value? A5: A reduced crypto token supply, assuming consistent or growing demand, can lead to increased scarcity. This often results in a potential increase in the value of each individual token, as seen in the initial positive market reaction.

Key Takeaways: The ASX queried DigitalX over director Ieva Guoga’s 3 million share purchase ahead of a Solana acquisition. DigitalX said she sought trading approval but couldn’t log in due to system updates. The company deemed the announcement non-price-sensitive. According to The Australian Financial Review , the ASX sought clarification over Ieva’s acquisition of 3 million DigitalX shares shortly before a May 29 announcement on an $11.6 million Solana token purchase . The exchange questioned whether the timing complied with DigitalX’s securities trading policy and also asked about transactions involving Antanas, a former Lithuanian MEP and ex-professional poker player. DigitalX Appoints Ieva Guoga to Board Amid Leadership Reshuffle Ieva, 26, joined the board in mid-May alongside new chairman Leigh Travers, replacing outgoing chair Toby Hicks and non-executive director Davide Bosio. In a letter dated July 28, the ASX asked whether her trades met policy requirements. DigitalX responded that she had sought permission from both the chair and company secretary but was unable to log the trades through its internal platform due to system updates following the closure of the CHESS clearing system. While admitting she “did not comply strictly” with all provisions of the trading policy, the company said no laws or listing rules had been breached. It argued the May 29 announcement was not price-sensitive, describing it as confirmation of an already disclosed Solana acquisition strategy. The stock moved only marginally that day, closing at $0.068 after a brief 3% rise, and ended last week at $0.073. DigitalX Launches the 21 Hundred Strategy.

ASX Probes DigitalX Dealings With Major Shareholder Antanas Guoga The ASX also examined the company’s dealings with Antanas Guoga, who signed a strategic advisory agreement with DigitalX in December 2024, before Ieva’s appointment. He was granted 25 million options exercisable in two years and began buying shares in January, now holding roughly 15% of the Perth-based firm. He is also chairman and major shareholder of Canadian-listed SOL Strategies, which in May secured a 12-month exclusive Solana staking agreement with DigitalX. DigitalX defended the partnership, saying SOL Strategies offered better performance, higher staking rewards, and lower fees than competitors. “The non-conflicted directors of the company are comfortable that the transaction undertaken was in the interests of DigitalX shareholders,” the spokesman said, adding that Antanas has invested significant capital but holds no operational role in the company. In July, DigitalX secured AU$20.7 million ($13.5 million) in strategic investment from global crypto players to expand its Bitcoin treasury. The strategic investment saw major participants including Animoca Brands, UTXO Management and ParaFi Capital.

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has proposed a cross-border regulatory sandbox allowing firms to test blockchain-based technologies under unified conditions across the US and UK jurisdictions. The initiative targets digital securities, real-world asset tokenization, stablecoins, and decentralized finance protocols through coordinated regulatory experimentation. Analyst MartyParty highlighted Peirce’s proposal and noted that crypto innovation is becoming increasingly global in scope.

He denies any wrongdoing and says his work is focused on building blockchain infrastructure. On Aug. 11 he told followers on X that authorities had informed his lawyer of the allegation and that he planned to leave Turkey to fight the charge from abroad. Detention Draws Industry Reaction Based on reports , the case stirred quick reactions across crypto circles. Ryan Sean Adams called the situation “very troubling,” and some community members pointed out the irony that Istanbul had been discussed as a possible host city for Devcon 2026. I’m in Turkey, Izmir. They are telling my lawyer that I helped people to misuse @ethereum and I might have a charge. You can imagine what it means. It’s obviously wrong, we are just infra builders. I can’t say much because I don’t have information and I don’t know if I will… — Fede’s intern (@fede_intern) August 10, 2025 Others, including Turkish commentator Cenk, argued there was “zero legal basis” for detaining someone on such a vague claim. The story has spread fast. Friends and colleagues are reportedly making calls on his behalf. Vague Charge, Few Details According to Fede, the allegation centers only on the idea that he helped people misuse Ethereum , but no formal charge sheet or legal provision has been made public. He later said Turkey’s Minister of Internal Affairs had mentioned the claim, but no further details were offered. Fede wrote that “privacy is not a crime” and emphasized that he runs businesses in more than a dozen industries under a European holding company. Ethereum developer being held in turkey – “Ethereum misuse” being given to him as the reason. Still developing. Very troubling.

He reported being moved to a private room, served food, and that arrangements were being made for a private jet to take him to Europe within hours. Turkey Tightens Rules On Crypto The timing of the detention comes as Turkish regulators tighten oversight of the digital-asset sector. Since March, the Capital Markets Board has issued rules that force platforms to keep detailed transaction records and issue monthly statements.

This follows months of speculation that the firm could soon file to offer this fund. BlackRock Has No Plans For An XRP ETF For Now A BlackRock spokesperson told The Block that they have no plans to file for an XRP ETF at this time. This ends speculations that it will join eight other asset managers who have already filed to offer this fund. The world’s largest asset manager already offers Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and based on the statement, the firm plans to stick with only the two largest crypto assets. Related Reading: BlackRock To File For XRP ETF After Ripple-SEC Settlement? Market Expert Answers NovaDius Wealth President Nate Geraci was one of those who had speculated that BlackRock was going to file for an XRP ETF soon. Prior to the asset manager’s statement, Geraci opined that the firm was waiting for the Ripple SEC lawsuit to end before filing for an iShares XRP ETF. He made this prediction following Ripple and the SEC’s filing of a joint dismissal to end the XRP lawsuit. Geraci further remarked that it makes “zero” sense for BlackRock to ignore crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. He added that if they do that, they are basically saying that BTC and ETH are the only crypto assets that will ever have value. Following BlackRock’s statement, the NovaDius Wealth president said that the firm’s decision not to file for an XRP ETF will be looked on as a mistake. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas also weighed in on BlackRock’s decision not to file for an XRP ETF. He asked Geraci if an XRP filing is enough or if he feels the world’s largest asset manager should also file for SOL, Tron ETFs. He further questioned where exactly the line should be drawn on how many crypto ETFs asset managers should offer. Potential Demand For These Funds Nate Geraci believes that there will be significant demand for the XRP ETFs, which is one reason why he thinks BlackRock is making a mistake by not filing for one. He noted that futures-based XRP funds have taken in over $1 billion since their launch this year. He opined that this proves that there will be “real” demand for the spot funds. Related Reading: XRP Price Projection: 5 Key Things To Watch Out For As The Bull Market Unfolds Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton is confident that BlackRock will still file for an XRP ETF. He said that he is willing to bet that this happens within a year. BlackRock’s failure to file for this ETF now and opt to do so later could prove costly since the pending applications could have the first-mover advantage. According to Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, there is a 95% chance that the SEC approves these funds this year. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.26, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

SOL has surged through $170 amid macro tailwinds and bullish retail interest. But experts say the rally may hit its limit near the $270–$280 zon, which is just under long-term resistance levels. Even so, savvy investors are now eyeing projects that go beyond price action, those building real-world impact. Among these, a rising star is stealing the spotlight not with hype, but with functional payments and momentum. While Solana navigates technical ceilings, this token is breaking records with real utility. Solana Price Prediction: Nearing the $280 Top? Analysts continue to flag the $270–$280 range as a major resistance area for SOL. According to recent Solana price predictions, that mark could likely be the high point before consolidation or correction sets in. More conservative Solana price prediction shows that Solana is in the early stages of a bullish breakout , eyeing a move to $187. As caution mounts, on-chain metrics show sell pressure and weak on-exchange flows, hinting at potential retracement if volume fades. Why Remittix Is Grabbing All the Headlines Right Now While SOL may face resistance, Remittix (RTX) is advancing rapidly, achieving consecutive all-time highs as interest grows in its real-world utility. This is not mere hype; Remittix is creating something significant. The Remittix Ecosystem Offers a Powerful Alternative Wallet Coming Q3: Clean mobile-first interface with real-time FX rates Security First: Fully audited by CertiK, giving users confidence Built for Everyday Use: Streamlined cross-border payments, low gas fees 20% Referral Rewards: Incentivizing community growth 40% Bonus Live: Time-sensitive opportunity before listings spike With over $18.4 million raised, 585 million tokens sold, and a live $250,000 giveaway pushing community interest even higher, analysts see real promise, especially compared to speculative altcoins that lack user-friendly tools. Fading Hype vs. Forging Utility Solana price prediction of up to $280 shows strength, but risks of a stall loom large. On the other hand, Remittix isn’t banking on chart moves; it’s building solutions that people can use right away. If you’re asking what is truly the next big crypto launch, consider one that focuses on function, not flash. Remittix might just be the next big altcoin 2025 that outpaces SOL, not due to hype, but because it’s solving problems. Smart money should look ahead, not behind.

The CEO of Bitcoin adoption firm Jan3 argued on Sunday that most major ETH holders — particularly those with significant Bitcoin from early ICO days — are deliberately moving BTC into ETH to drive prices higher under fresh narratives, such as the rise of Ethereum treasury companies . According to Mow, once Ether reaches attractive price levels, these investors will offload their holdings, leaving behind “new generational bagholders” while transferring profits back into Bitcoin. “No one wants ETH in the long run,” he said, adding that it will be difficult for ETH to surpass its all-time high because the closer it gets to that psychological barrier, the stronger the urge to sell — a scenario he calls the “Bagholder’s Dilemma.” ETH/BTC Ratio Rebounds Strongly Mow dismissed concerns about the ETH/BTC ratio breaking its long-term downward trendline, stating, “Ethereum has always been a vehicle for those people to get more Bitcoin. It was true for the ICO, and it’s true now.” The ETH/BTC ratio — which measures Ether price relative to Bitcoin — currently sits at 0.036, double its April low of 0.018. This rebound comes as ETH price has climbed sharply while Bitcoin has remained relatively steady. Ethereum supporter Anthony Sassano characterized Mow’s comments as typical “old school Bitcoin maxi” rhetoric and argued that such criticism is actually a bullish signal for ETH. Possible Ether and Altcoin Rally Ahead? Not everyone shares Mow’s outlook. Investor and entrepreneur Ted Pillows predicted that Ether will break its previous record price and ignite a brief altseason before capital flows back into Bitcoin, potentially pushing BTC toward $140,000. He expects a final rotation into ETH and other altcoins afterward — a sequence that has occurred in past crypto bull markets, where Ethereum and altcoins often peak after Bitcoin. Bitcoin dominance has dropped 10% since late June, reflecting the ongoing rotation into altcoins. Meanwhile, ETH has posted its strongest weekly close since November 2021, touching $4,300 on Sunday after gaining 21% over the week. The token now sits just 13% below its all-time high of $4,878, with bullish Ether momentum persisting despite skepticism from Bitcoin maximalists.

BlockDAG ’s 10 BTC Auction is pulling in heavy participation as its $0.0016 Global Launch release price hits the August 11 cutoff. The Ethereum (ETH) rally is closing in on $4,000, a level that could trigger fresh highs. Meanwhile, a new XRP update showcases rising adoption, with cloud mining platforms adding ways for users to generate income directly in XRP. For those tracking the top crypto coins right now, this mix of presale urgency, bullish technical setups, and real-world utility is hard to ignore. Ethereum (ETH) Rally Moves Toward a Key Breakout The Ethereum (ETH) rally is inching closer to the $4,000 threshold, a point many see as both psychological and technical resistance. Analyst Lark Davis says a clear break above could set ETH on course for new highs, while a rejection could see pullbacks to the 20-day EMA near $3,600 or the 50-day EMA around $3,300. Davis highlights that ETH’s movement is part of a broader bullish sentiment across the market, with major players positioning strategically. Examples include MARA Holdings securing $850 million to buy Bitcoin, showing how institutional money is flowing into crypto. For traders, $4,000 is the immediate hurdle. A strong close above it could firmly place ETH among the top crypto coins right now, supported by active on-chain engagement and steady market confidence. XRP Update Shows Expanding Utility & Income Options XRP’s appeal continues to grow thanks to its quick transaction speeds and broad use cases. A notable XRP update comes from LET Mining, now letting users start cloud mining contracts using XRP directly, skipping conversions to BTC or DOGE. These contracts offer fixed daily payouts, with some reaching as much as $2,530 a day. Payments are automated, withdrawals are instant, and no technical know-how is needed. For instance, a $1,500 contract over 10 days generates $19.50 daily, while a $10,000 contract over 43 days delivers $174 daily. The service is available globally, with participation from Europe, America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. This mix of speed, accessibility, and income potential is helping cement XRP’s reputation as one of the top crypto coins right now for both traders and those looking for steady returns. BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction & Final Hours at $0.0016 BlockDAG has topped $370 million in presale sales, with its $0.0016 Global Launch release price set to expire in 12 hours. After that, pricing jumps to the Batch 29 rate of $0.0276 before hitting the confirmed $0.05 launch price. This steep price climb is designed to reward those who act early. The 10 BTC Auction is fueling demand in these final hours. Every BDAG purchase before August 11 is entered into the prize pool, with larger buys increasing the chance of winning. The format adds a competitive edge that’s boosting activity as the clock runs down. BlockDAG’s Dashboard V4 is setting a new standard for presale transparency, with real-time price data, instant buy and sell functions, a live order book, and referral tracking. Extras like leaderboards and bonus calculators keep the process interactive. On the tech side, the X1 and X10 Live Demo has showcased active mining hardware. The X10 miner produces up to 200 BDAG daily, while the X1 mobile app generates 20 BDAG a day, both designed for ease of use. Visibility is growing through partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas, bringing NFTs, fan tokens, and interactive content into mainstream sports. With 20 confirmed exchange listings, a hybrid blockchain-DAG structure, and more than 2.5 million X1 app users, BlockDAG is already functioning like a live network. With the deadline looming, high-value auction rewards, and working products, BlockDAG is firmly in the conversation for the top crypto coins right now . The Bottom Line Ethereum’s push toward $4,000 could open the door for a breakout that changes its market trajectory. XRP’s latest update shows how adoption is expanding alongside new income models. BlockDAG, meanwhile, offers a rare combination: a $0.0016 price point about to reset, a 17× price jump after the deadline, a 10 BTC Auction, and an already functional ecosystem. For those balancing short-term technical setups with presale opportunities, these three names are worth keeping on the radar, but only BlockDAG comes with a ticking clock on its current price.

But right now, the XRP price prediction points to a narrow trading band between $2.98 and $3.10, offering little clarity for a breakout. Meanwhile, Dogecoin price analysis shows stubborn resistance at $0.21, with every attempt to push higher quickly fading. These stalls are pushing investors to consider fresh opportunities with stronger upside. Cold Wallet is stepping into that gap. Its Stage 17 presale offers entry at $0.00998 with a projected launch price suggesting a staggering 4,900% ROI. Backed by a built-in cashback rewards system and a secure self-custody setup, it’s quickly becoming a hot pick for those seeking both profit and practicality in 2025. XRP Price Prediction: Tight Range Restricts Growth The current XRP price prediction shows the asset stuck between $2.98 support and $3.14–$3.34 resistance. While it recently broke out of a downward channel, the absence of strong follow-through signals weak momentum, making a lasting rally unlikely in the short term. Analysts say without a major jump in trading activity and institutional interest, XRP could remain locked in this range. XRP still holds appeal as a long-term option, but its capped movement stands in sharp contrast to high-potential entries like Cold Wallet’s presale. For anyone deciding on what could be the next big crypto, XRP offers stability, but not the explosive upside Cold Wallet is preparing to deliver. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Struggle Beyond $0.21 Dogecoin’s chart hints at promise, yet the $0.21 barrier remains unbroken. Even with increased whale buying and higher volume, momentum is fragile. And if DOGE does manage to clear $0.21, the next ceiling between $0.22 and $0.24 could limit further gains without stronger market demand. This underlines a recurring point in Dogecoin price analysis, its potential moves take time, with no guarantee of rapid returns. For those hunting for the next big crypto, DOGE’s momentum is encouraging but falls short of the immediate upside offered by reward-driven projects like Cold Wallet. Cold Wallet’s Rewards-Driven Launch & 4,900% ROI Cold Wallet turns every single blockchain interaction into profit with its built-in cashback rewards system. Whether it’s a swap, fee, or transfer, users receive CWT tokens in return, essentially getting paid to stay active on the network. This rewrites the wallet experience, making regular usage a source of income instead of an expense. At Stage 17, the presale price is locked at $0.00998. So far, Cold Wallet has generated $5.9 million from 700 million tokens sold. With a projected 4,900% ROI at launch, it’s offering a return potential that outshines typical speculative plays. The tokenomics are engineered for lasting impact. Forty percent of tokens go to presale buyers, while 25% are dedicated to cashback reserves, driving adoption and rewarding consistent use. The setup ensures that as usage grows, so do the benefits for participants. On top of that, its self-custody model keeps users in full control of their keys while still collecting rewards. For those wondering what is the next big crypto, Cold Wallet offers more than just hype, it’s a shift toward a usage-based value system with substantial long-term upside built right into its core. The Bottom Line XRP price prediction suggests it will stay range-bound, and Dogecoin price analysis confirms persistent resistance at $0.21. Both have brand strength but face technical ceilings. Cold Wallet, however, combines lucrative cashback incentives, strong security, and a presale model aiming for 4,900% ROI.

Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView According to TradingView analyst MasterAnanda in an August 11 post , Bitcoin’s 3-day chart reveals compelling bullish momentum that positions the asset for its next major price milestone at $137,000. “Bitcoin is now trading at is highest price ever since the all-time high. At resistance, challenging resistance, ultra-bullish.” MasterAnanda’s analysis incorporates altcoin market behavior as a key directional indicator. When Bitcoin consolidates at high prices, rising altcoins typically signal that consolidation will lead to additional growth, while declining altcoins suggest potential breakdown. “If the altcoins are rising while Bitcoin is consolidating, this means that the consolidation will lead to additional growth,” the analyst stated, pointing to recent strength in Ethereum ( ETH ) reaching new multi-year highs as a positive signal. Additional technical analysis from TradingShot indicates Bitcoin could reach $148,000 by late September 2025, based on a bull flag pattern and 2.0 Fibonacci extension levels. Supporting the technical bullish case, fundamental metrics show strong network adoption. In fact, on Saturday, August 9, Bitcoin saw 364,126 new addresses created, marking the highest single-day count in a year. This surge in new addresses typically indicates growing retail and institutional interest, providing additional momentum for price appreciation as the network effect strengthens. Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $120,512 with a 5.36% gain in the last 7 days and 1.71% in 24-hour volume. The asset is currently testing resistance levels near its previous all-time high of $123,091, with technical indicators suggesting room for further gains. BTC 24-hour price chart.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-army-sees-this-500m-western-union-acquisition-as-big-news-for-xrp-heres-why/,"Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem first brought attention to the development on X, confirming that Western Union has signed a definitive agreement to acquire International Money Express (Intermex) in an all-cash deal valued at approximately $500 million. The agreement, priced at $16.00 per share, represents both equity and enterprise value. Western Union says the acquisition will provide access to Intermex’s roughly six million customers across the Americas. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2026, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. Intermex and Ripple: The Connection Intermex publicly joined Ripple’s ecosystem in February 2020, announcing a partnership to test RippleNet’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) — a payment solution that uses XRP as a bridge asset to enable faster, cheaper cross-border transactions without the need for pre-funded accounts. Today, Western Union has just snagged, in an all-cash deal of $500M, the @Ripple $XRP ODL user (announced in 2020), @IntermexWire – to capture growth in all the Americas. https://t.co/fe9pXrd5Kb . pic.twitter.com/d9a9HltrP2 — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) August 11, 2025 While details of the pilot’s scope were never fully disclosed, the connection between Intermex and Ripple remains a notable part of the company’s recent history. Why the XRP Community is Excited For XRP enthusiasts, the implications are clear. A global remittance leader has just purchased a company with a proven history of experimenting with XRP-powered settlement technology. Intermex’s dominance in the U.S.–Latin America remittance corridor — one of the most active and costly in the world — aligns perfectly with Ripple’s core use case. Adding to the optimism is Western Union’s recent interest in digital payments innovation. The company has been exploring blockchain-based settlement methods and even stablecoin integrations as part of its long-term strategy. The hope within the XRP community is that technology once tested by Intermex could be scaled across Western Union’s vast network, potentially amplifying XRP’s role in real-world payments. Why Caution is Still Necessary However, history tempers some of the enthusiasm. Shortly after announcing its Ripple partnership in 2020, Intermex clarified that ODL would not be deployed in its core markets, such as Mexico, its largest remittance corridor. Similarly, past industry experiments, such as MoneyGram’s ODL integration, show that trials do not always lead to sustained adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Western Union , while technologically exploratory, has yet to commit publicly to XRP or RippleNet at scale. Strategic, regulatory, and operational factors will ultimately determine whether ODL is incorporated into its post-acquisition settlement infrastructure. Bottom Line Western Union’s $500 million acquisition of Intermex is a strategic move that could reshape payment flows in the Americas. For the XRP community, it represents a fresh opportunity for Ripple’s technology, and possibly XRP itself, to reach a much wider market. As with all major industry deals, the true impact will only become clear once integration plans are announced and the new owner reveals whether ODL will be part of the future payments mix. This is a development worth watching closely, not as a promise of immediate XRP adoption, but as a credible opening for expansion if the right strategic decisions follow.

Strategy (MSTR) adopted a bitcoin standard five years ago today, on Aug. 11, 2020, with its first purchase of 21,454 BTC for $250 million. The acquisition marked a historic shift in corporate treasury strategy. To that point, former AI and software development company had seen its share price stagnate for two decades after the early 2000 tech boom-and-bust, falling over 95% from its peak. However, since August 2020, MSTR has delivered 100% average annual returns, compounding to over 3,000% cumulative gains, while bitcoin itself has returned nearly 1,000% over the same period. To fund its BTC accumulation, the company has employed diverse strategies, raising $46 billion via equity and credit, which includes $8.2 billion in outstanding convertible debt and four perpetual preferred stock offerings, STRK, STRF, STRD, and STRC, designed to appeal to different segments of the y ield curve . Fresh buys continue The company Monday morning disclosed the purchase of another 155 BTC for $18 million — a rather small weekly buy, but nevertheless bringing its total stoack to 628,946 coins valued at about $76 billion. That representis 3% of bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply. With an average cost of about $74,000 per BTC, the company sits on unrealized gains of roughly $30 billion, or 65%. MSTR is today one of the most actively traded stocks , posting $4.4 billion in daily trading volume just behind Google (GOOG) at $4.9 billion. Open interest in MSTR options totals $90 billion, also second to Google at $99 billion. Despite a $112 billion market cap compared to Google’s $2.4 trillion, the trading activity reflects the intense focus on MSTR. Its success has inspired a wave of bitcoin treasury strategies among other corporations. The top 100 public companies now collectively own 964,314 BTC, much of it financed through capital raises that follow the MSTR playbook.",Markets|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy|top news|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-11 12:06:44

The suggestion ignited the prices of the native tokens of the protocol and the bridge. The Offer In a Sunday forum announcement , the foundation behind the Layer Zero Protocol and the Stargate Bridge has made an offer to the Stargate DAO in the form of a token buyback from their native STG bridge token. If approved, this will effectively dissolve the autonomous organization. The bridge, launched over three years ago, has reportedly generated over $70 billion in trading volume and hosts the majority of OFT’s (Omnichain Fungible Tokens), a universal token standard used to send, receive, and compose assets across all blockchains. The current offer is $0.1675 per token, compared to $0.1637, which was applicable at the time of the foundation’s post, as the data at press time differs. The conversion was intended to swap all circulating STG (including staked/voting tokens) for ZRO (Layer Zero’s native token) at a ratio of 1 STG: 0.08634 ZRO, reflecting a value of $0.1675 per STG and $1.94 per ZRO. Following this, the bridge will be integrated into the Layer Zero ecosystem, and any future revenue generated by it will be utilized in a buyback program aimed at reducing the circulating supply of ZRO. The discussion period will be open for 7 days, after which the proposal will be moved to Snapshot (voting platform) for a three-day period. Quorum is set at 1.2M veSTG (staked STG), and the approval threshold is 70% for the vote to pass. There is already commentary from governance holders on the forum announcement and from the community on the post on X, with a mix of positive and negative sentiment, as well as discussion on how this would affect STG holders. Price Reaction As noted above, after the proposal went live both tokens have posted some signifcant gains from yesterday, with STG up 20% to $0.1965 and ZRO at $2.42, up 26%, respectively, at the time of writing. If we are to take the original bid of 1 STG to 0.08634 ZRO with current prices, that would correlate to $0.1961 per STG and $2.42 per ZRO. Naturally, the deal itself is now more expensive, taking into account the overall increase in both token prices; it is now approximately $137 million, which is a respectable jump of $27 million in just under 24 hours. Given the positive price action from the buyout proposal, along with varied feedback on its potential impact on the community, it will be interesting to see how the deal unfolds.

Growing exchange reserves and upcoming unlocks of millions of tokens could add selling pressure. TransFi joined as a KYB-verified fiat on-ramp partner via Onramper, enabling direct PI purchases with local currency, while the .pi domain auction was extended to September, letting users create simpler wallet addresses similar to .eth or .bnb. What Now? Pi Network’s native cryptocurrency finally managed to post some substantial gains. It spiked above $0.46 on August 10 before retreating to its current value of $0.40 (according to CoinGecko’s data), representing a 13% increase on a weekly basis . PI Price, Source: CoinGecko The community now seems split on their predictions regarding PI’s next potential move. X user Friedrich said he opened a long position, envisioning a “deviation” that would result in big gains. However, the analyst with the moniker “pinetworkmembers” was not as bullish. They advised investors to “sit down and wait,” claiming the $1 target the community has been hoping for seems “unlikely to happen.” Meanwhile, the amount of PI stored on crypto exchanges continues to rise. As of this writing, over 407 million tokens are held on such platforms, with Gate.io alone accounting for 194 million. The shift towards centralized exchanges may not lead to mass exit, but it surely increases the immediate selling pressure. The upcoming unlocks may also negatively impact the price. Data shows that almost 170 million PI will be freed up in the next 30 days, which will allow investors to offload tokens they have been waiting for a long time. August 16 will be a record day, with 9.8 million coins released. PI Token Unlocks, Source: piscan.io Recent Pi Network Advancements PI’s price pump in the last week coincides with some major developments associated with the project. Just a few days ago, the X account Pi News disclosed that TransFi has completed its KYB (Know Your Business) process as a verified third‑party fiat on‑ramp partner. Integrated with the Pi Wallet via Onramper, the platform lets users buy and convert PI tokens directly with local currency using various payment methods. Other KYB-verified partners include Onramp .money and Banxa. Prior to that, Pi Network reminded users that the .pi Domains Auction has been extended to the end of September, giving them more time to innovate, build, and bid for their applications. These domains let Pioneers customize their Pi Wallets with simple, name-based addresses ending in .pi, making payments and interactions easier – much like Ethereum’s .eth or BNB’s .bnb.

According to the company, the purchases were made at an average price of $116,401, totaling approximately $18 million in investments. With this new acquisition, Strategy further strengthens its Bitcoin reserves. The company has adopted Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset since 2020, making it one of the market's largest institutional BTC investors. These recent acquisitions reinforce Strategy's long-term confidence in Bitcoin, despite both price volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. CEO Michael Saylor has previously described Bitcoin as “digital gold,” stating that they view it as a store of value against inflationary pressures. This approach is one of the main reasons the company regularly accumulates BTC. Cryptocurrency market analysts believe Strategy's move could rekindle interest in Bitcoin among institutional investors. This purchase, made at a time when BTC prices are fluctuating due to the US Federal Reserve's interest rate policy and global economic developments, is seen as a significant vote of confidence in the market. The strategy's total Bitcoin holdings and average cost will be revealed in the company's next official financial statement. This acquisition further demonstrates the company's consistent stance on its BTC strategy. *This is not investment advice.

In his fresh trade, Hayes spent around $8 million to buy Ether and a handful of DeFi blue-chip tokens. This move comes in when Ethereum regained the much-anticipated $4,000 level and went on to hit $4,300 amid the rally. Hayes, who is popular for posting and pumping several major altcoins and meme coins, didn’t say much about his recent trade. Arthur Hayes loads up on ETH, LDO, ETHFI As per on-chain data , Arthur Hayes scooped 1,500 ETH at an average $4,233 ($6.35 million). His latest accumulation included 425K Lido DAO (LDO) ($557K), 420K ETHFI ($517K), and a combined $1.53 million in Pendle (PENDLE) across two tranches. Hayes’ return to the market is contrary to his past crypto trades and shows a sharp pivot from last week. Last week, he sold 2,373 ETH worth $8.32 million at around $3,507, warning that macro headwinds could drag ETH to $3,000. However, he also exited other positions, unloading $4.62 million in Ethena and $414K in Pepe. Later, he moved out 10.5 million USDC to buy back ETH. Following the surge of $ETH , Arthur Hayes ( @CryptoHayes ) bought $7.93M worth of 4 #Ethereum ecosystem tokens in the last 19 hours, including: • 1,500 $ETH ($6.35M) at $4,233 • 424,863 $LDO ($556.6K) at $1.31 • 420,000 $ETHFI ($516.6K) at $1.23 • 92,005 $PENDLE ($507K) at… pic.twitter.com/oL0EyEjNI9 — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) August 11, 2025 The Maelstrom’s CIO returned to buying Ether at nearly 20% higher prices. Ethereum is running high on the bullish momentum, outperforming Bitcoin. ETH price surged by 42% over the last 30 days, keeping altcoin season hopes alive. Ethereum is trading at an average price of $4,235 at press time. Other Ethereum ecosystem tokens, such as Ethena’s price spiked by 30% over the last 7 days. ENA is trading at an average price of $0.807 at press time. Lido DAO posted a massive jump of 55% in the same period. LDO is trading at an average price of $1.43. 97% of ETH holders are in profit This is not just a sway that has renewed Hayes’s conviction in the biggest altcoin. It aligns with a broader wave of institutional ETH accumulation. Data shows that an unidentified whale has grabbed 221,166 ETH ($946 million) in the past week via Galaxy Digital, FalconX, and BitGo. Public companies are also joining the moment. BitMine Immersion Technologies now holds 833,137 ETH ($3 billion), SharpLink Gaming controls 521,900 ETH, and is raising $200M to buy more. As of now, 17 public companies hold 1.74 million ETH valued at nearly $6.9 billion. The wave of demand is also evident in ETFs. US spot Ethereum funds saw $461 million in net inflows on Friday, beating Bitcoin ETFs’ $403 million. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF alone took in over $245 million. ETH ETFs have now posted four consecutive days of inflow, 13 weeks of continuous inflow and 4 months of printing green indexes. Sentora mentioned that 97% of the Ethereum addresses are currently in profit. DeFiLlama data shows that Ether’s total value locked (TVL) is up by almost 30% over the last month to stand at $91.99 billion. Meanwhile, its market cap has hit $510 billion.

49913996,553362,1754914362,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49913996.jpeg,Bitcoin Analysis Shows an ATH Is Imminent as Bitcoin Hyper Breaks $8.2M in Presale,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-this-week-bitcoin-hyper-reaches-8-2m/,"Bitcoin’s run-up to fresh all-time highs of $123K in July was the spark that lit the current crypto boom. Now, the OG token is back to painting green candles, signaling that its consolidation phase may well be in the rearview. With nearly 4% gains over the last two days , Bitcoin is once again trading tantalizingly close to its ATH, and speculation is swirling over whether a new record could arrive this week. And if the current fundamental and technical strength is any indication, it very well could be. The biggest catalyst? President Trump has just signed a landmark policy enabling Americans to allocate part of their 401(k) retirement savings into digital assets . While the language covers crypto broadly, Bitcoin remains the beating heart of the industry and is, therefore, set to be the primary beneficiary. Read on as we unpack $BTC’s price forecast for this week, the key drivers behind its historic run, and how you can maximize your gains this bull run by investing in the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale. Technical Analysis Points to $125K Bitcoin Target How high could $BTC climb in its current rally? We turned to some good-old technical analysis for clues. On the 4-hour chart, $BTC has just blasted through a long-standing downward-sloping trendline with strong momentum and volume. With the token now deep in uncharted territory – its ATH the only real resistance left – we used the average width of its recent consolidation range to set a target. Even on the conservative side, the pattern points to Bitcoin hitting $125K in this rally, possibly even within this week. Additionally, the 10, 20, and 50 EMAs ( Exponential Moving Averages ) are just beginning to spread apart. This is a classic bullish signal that the current rally is only in its early stages. Top Factors Fueling Bitcoin’s Rise Bitcoin’s recent surge has triggered the liquidation of over $30M worth of shorts . This is a classic short squeeze that will add fuel to the bullish fire and push prices even higher. In addition to the U.S. democratizing access to alternative assets for 401(k) investors, new policy initiatives like the GENIUS Act and Project Crypto are set to further legitimize and expand the digital asset space, creating a more welcoming regulatory environment for crypto adoption. Meanwhile, large corporations continue buying $BTC left, right, and center. Interestingly, institutional Bitcoin holdings have steadily increased over the past few months regardless of short-term price fluctuations. This proves that long-term investors remain unfazed by market volatility and are firmly backing Bitcoin’s journey to the moon. Speaking of which, Michael Saylor, whose company MicroStrategy holds the largest corporate Bitcoin stash, recently projected that Bitcoin could reach $21M within the next 21 years . Similarly, industry expert Tom Lee believes Bitcoin has the potential to surpass $200K in the near term on its path toward an eventual valuation north of $1M. Even though Bitcoin may be poised for an explosive rally from here, the potential returns for new investors aren’t exactly mind-boggling, especially in the short term. That’s why savvy investors are looking beyond $BTC itself – toward low-cap, Bitcoin-themed presale cryptos that could offer a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . $HYPER Delivers Real Utility to the Bitcoin Blockchain Bitcoin Hyper is building a brand-new Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, one that will integrate with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to bring blazing-fast transactions, ultra-low fees, and top-tier programmability to the network. In simple words, it will turbocharge the Bitcoin ecosystem, allowing developers to build smart contracts, launch dApps, and create complex Web3 projects with the same speed and scalability Solana is known for – but backed by Bitcoin’s unmatched security and brand power. Why’s this game-changing? Because Bitcoin, despite its unprecedented aura as an investment vehicle, is not exactly a big name in blockchain technology like Ethereum or Solana. These rivals are, in fact, hundreds of times faster than Bitcoin, plus they support cutting-edge Web3 innovations. How Does $HYPER Work? Step 1 : It all starts with you sending $BTC to a non-custodial, decentralized canonical bridge connecting Bitcoin’s Layer 1 and Hyper’s Layer 2. Step 2 : Then, upon verification by an SVM smart contract, the bridge mints an equivalent amount of $BTC tokens on Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer 2. Step 3 : These L2-compatible $BTC tokens can be used to seamlessly interact with Hyper’s Web3 ecosystem, including DeFi trading platforms, NFT marketplaces, lending and staking protocols, DAOs and governance systems, and even next-gen gaming dApps. Step 4 : The final step is the withdrawal back to L1. Once you’re done using Hyper’s Layer 2, simply raise a withdrawal request, and your ‘wrapped’ $BTC will be converted back into Layer 1 $BTC and sent directly to your original wallet address. Buy $HYPER Before It’s Too Late The best thing about $HYPER is that, unlike $BTC, it hasn’t exploded yet. And “explode” it can, as it’s adding real-world utility to Bitcoin and is currently in presale at some of its lowest-ever prices. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the token can surge up to 2,434% and hit $0.32 by the end of 2025. Even better? Thousands of investors, including crypto whales ( $74.9K , $54.1K , $37.9K , and $19.6K ), have already poured in a staggering $8.3M during its early funding rounds. Right now, 1 $HYPER is priced at just $0.012625. And here’s a quick step-by-step guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper before the next price jump. Visit $HYPER’s official presale website for more information. Wrapping Up Bitcoin is gearing up for another strong rally, one that could push it past $150K and potentially toward the $200K mark by year’s end. And the smartest way to ride this wave? Getting into Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – a pro-Bitcoin altcoin built to bring the blockchain up to modern standards of speed, cost-efficiency, and programmability.

The partnership adds ICE’s Consolidated Feed, a dataset sourced from over 300 exchanges and marketplaces worldwide, to Chainlink Data Streams, which serve over 2,000 on-chain applications, financial institutions and infrastructure providers. By incorporating ICE’s data, Chainlink aims to deliver pricing feeds that meet the accuracy and latency requirements of traditional capital markets. That standard could help support a new generation of tokenized assets, automated settlement systems and other institutional-grade blockchain applications. The move fits into a broader trend of connecting blockchain rails and traditional financial instruments as large banks, asset managers tokenize real-world assets (RWA) like bonds, commodities and funds. Maurisa Baumann, VP of Global Data Delivery at ICE, said in a statement that the collaboration with Chainlink offers ""trusted, structured multi-asset class data"" from traditional markets for crypto applications, a key step toward growing the blockchain economy. ""This collaboration signals a pivotal shift towards a unified, globally accessible on-chain financial system, with hundreds of trillions in assets on a clear path to tokenization,"" said Fernando Vazquez, president of capital markets at Chainlink Labs.

XRP also makes a splash in the payments space, and Remittix quietly steals the show as a bridge between crypto and traditional banking. With its upcoming beta wallet release and ambitious roadmap, Remittix can be the leader of the next big wave of crypto adoption. Solana and XRP Numbers Indicate Health of Market Solana remains strong in year-over-year market performance with a market cap of $96.84 billion and a daily trading volume over $6.6 billion. Its speed and low transaction fees make it attractive to developers and institutional investors. By contrast, XRP is worth $3.19 and still has a strong position in global remittance corridors. While it remains the market leader in cross-border payments, newer platforms like Remittix are beginning to catch up with it — especially in those markets where payment settlement must be accelerated and more fiat-linked. These figures show what investors expect from real-world crypto utility, and that’s where Remittix finds its niche. Remittix’s Unique Payment Focus Remittix (RTX) is taking on the $19 trillion global remittance market by enabling crypto-to-bank transfers to over 30 countries. Remittix supports 40+ cryptocurrencies and offers real-time FX conversion, which makes it a convenient choice for freelancers, small businesses, and frequent remitters. The project beta wallet will launch in Q3 2025, providing mobile-first convenience at low fees and on-the-fly conversion of crypto to fiat and vice versa. The approach places Remittix in the “top crypto under $1” for investment by investors focused on utility growth. Project Momentum and Incentives Remittix presale can be purchased at $0.0922 and has already raised over $18.7 million in sales with 588 million tokens already sold. Offers currently available are: 40% bonus tokens during presale $250,000 incentive for participants Early beta release of wallet functionalities Launch with global crypto and fiat support They are gaining notice as incentives, according to problem-solving attention, aside from those researching the best crypto project 2025. Positioning for the Next Bull Cycle By bringing blockchain to a real-world financial issue, Remittix is in the running with Solana and XRP in shaping the future of payments. With its speed, fee structure, and fiat bridge, it could be a contender to be watched in both retail and institutional markets. As it builds momentum and it nears rolling out its beta wallet, Remittix could be the next altcoin behemoth to emerge out of 2025’s competitive landscape.

That’s exactly what drew us to CoinFutures – a gamified betting platform built for speed, simplicity, and zero friction. No KYC, no spreadsheets. Just pure price action. We’ve spent time on both desktop and mobile, testing leverage, stop-loss settings, and even leaderboard competition. And yes, we also took a closer look at the vendor’s privacy policies and track record, so you don’t have to. Whether you’re looking for a fast-paced crypto game or a simple way to simulate high-leverage futures trading, this review will help you decide if CoinFutures is right for you. What is CoinFutures? CoinFutures is a crypto futures trading platform simulator that strips back the complexity of traditional exchanges and reimagines trading as a real-time prediction game. Built by the team behind CoinPoker , it’s a standalone feature within the CoinPoker app ecosystem. It’s designed for anyone who wants to speculate on short-term crypto price moves without linking wallets, submitting ID, or navigating clunky interfaces. Launched in late 2024, CoinFutures quickly carved out a niche for itself thanks to its zero Know Your Customer (KYC) setup, up to 1,000x leverage, and live-action trading simulation. It’s not a full-blown crypto exchange ; you’re not buying or selling real crypto or contracts. But its algorithm mimics actual crypto market volatility with impressive realism, and you can still play and cash out in $BTC, $ETH, $USDT, and other supported coins. Overall, it offers a compelling middle ground between trading simulation and real-time crypto action. Players simply choose long (betting on price increases) or short (betting on price decreases) positions, set a multiplier, and watch the chart unfold. The built-in leaderboard, based on Return On Investment (ROI) and profit, adds a competitive edge that keeps things engaging, especially for users who enjoy tracking their performance. TRY COINFUTURES NOW How Does CoinFutures Work? CoinFutures turns futures trading into a simplified prediction game, but the mechanics still echo the core dynamics of crypto leverage trading platforms . Here’s how it works– First, you pick a supported crypto – like Bitcoin ($BTC), Ethereum ($ETH), Dogecoin ($DOGE), Litecoin ($LTC), or Tron ($TRX). Once selected, you’ll be shown a live chart that mirrors real-time price movements. Then, it’s your call: do you think the price will go up or down? Select ‘Up’ for a long position, or ‘Down’ for a short. Next, you get to choose your multiplier. CoinFutures offers leverage up to 1,000x, so you can greatly amplify your prediction for a potentially larger payout. You can also enter your desired price manually or use sliders to set your target. Once your prediction is live, you can track it in real time. If things are going your way, you can cash out anytime (or hold out for a bigger win). If the market turns and hits your bust price, you lose your stake. In short, it’s a risk-reward game powered by simulated crypto volatility that closely mirrors real market moves, but without any of the usual trading headaches like KYC, wallets, or complex order books. In our experience, the entire process from launching the app to placing your first trade takes less than five minutes. No wallet setup, no exchange accounts, and no onboarding friction. Just straight to the action. CoinFutures Pros and Cons Here are the main pros and cons we’ve picked out after testing CoinFutures: Pros No KYC needed – sign up and start playing instantly Up to 1,000x leverage on supported assets Fast, clean interface with real-time price simulation Cash out anytime before hitting the bust price Cons Limited range of cryptocurrencies compared to exchanges Simulated markets only – no real asset exposure or contract settlement CoinFutures’ Key Features CoinFutures has several simple yet convenient features that shape what makes it fun, fast, and genuinely engaging. But as with anything, there are a few quirks and limitations you’ll want to know about. Here’s a balanced overview of what Coinfutures has to offer. Support for Multiple Cryptocurrencies CoinFutures currently supports a modest but well-rounded list of Bitcoin and over a dozen top altcoins , including: Ethereum ($ETH), Solana ($SOL), Binance Coin ($BNB), Avalanche ($AVAX), Tron ($TRX), XRP ($XRP). The platform is also expanding into meme coins, with Dogecoin ($DOGE), Dogwifhat ($WIF), SPX6900 ($SPX), and Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) first on the list. During testing, switching between assets was seamless, with charts updating instantly and no delay in opening new positions. While we liked the streamlined selection (it keeps the UI clutter-free), it’s worth noting that advanced traders might find the asset range limited compared to platforms like MEXC or Binance , which offer hundreds of derivative pairs. Still, for casual or high-speed players, the core options cover most needs. Moreover, the platform is constantly expanding its offer. The most recent additions included $SOL, $TRX, and $XRP. CoinFutures is also now moving onto meme coins like $DOGE and $PENGU. Up to 1,000x Leverage CoinFutures’ biggest hook is its wild 1,000x leverage cap. You can select your multiplier before entering a round (anywhere from 2x to 1,000x), and the interface immediately displays your potential profit or bust range. With 1,000x leverage, a single wrong tick can wipe your stake, but it also means even small price moves can generate serious upside. We appreciated the transparency of the interface, especially how it adjusts bust price in real time based on your chosen multiplier. However, there’s no margin call system – if the price hits your bust point, your trade closes instantly with no warning or chance to recover. Real-Time Simulated Charts CoinFutures futures contracts run on a smart algorithm that mirrors real crypto volatility, and from our experience, it does a solid job. The price charts felt authentic, closely mirroring the pace and general direction of the real market. We tested it side-by-side with $BTC’s chart on TradingView, and the movements weren’t perfectly identical (nor are they meant to be), but they reflected the same trend direction. Since the simulated charts reflect real market movement, there’s room for genuine strategy. Players who track trends and set smart multipliers can improve their odds, making CoinFutures part luck, part skill – rather than a coin toss every round. The UI is also clean: clear candlestick visuals, timer, position info, and cash-out options all in one place. Everything you need is visible on a single screen, which we found helpful for high-speed play. Cash Out Anytime This feature stood out to us. Once your position is live, you’re in full control, and you can cash out at any time before hitting the bust line. The system calculates your current ROI in real time, so you can lock in profits or cut losses quickly. We liked how this added a layer of strategy. For example, you could place a small long position on $BTC with a 10x multiplier. You could be in the green just 30 seconds later. Instead of risking it further, you could cash out for a smaller, guaranteed win. It’s very much about timing and discipline. Unfortunately, there are no trailing stop or partial cash-out options. You either exit the whole position or let it ride until you’re ready. Stop Loss, Take Profit & Auto Mode CoinFutures includes risk controls like stop-loss (SL) and take-profit (TP) settings, which can be toggled before entering a round. These can give you the same kind of position management you’d find on a real exchange – letting you lock in profits or cap losses automatically, so you’re not glued to the screen waiting for the perfect exit. Auto Mode lets you automate both SL and TP orders, and we found it useful for testing preset strategies. Set your exit limits, walk away, and let the system handle the rest. We found that Auto Mode worked reliably. There were no glitches, and it exited the round exactly as expected. That said, you’ll want to double-check your limits before confirming your position, since there’s no option to edit them mid-round. Transparent Pricing Structure Unlike exchanges that bury you in hidden spreads, CoinFutures has a clean and versatile fee system. You choose between two types of fees: Flat Fee : Fixed cost for entering and exiting a round (1–3% of your stake), with the percentage depending on your position size and chosen multiplier. PnL Fee : A small cut you pay only if your trade is profitable (around 5% of total profit), plus an extra 0.5% for every additional hour your position stays open after the first. In our testing, we preferred the PnL fee as it felt fairer on losing trades and encouraged more strategic entries. The percentage can vary slightly depending on the size and duration of your position, so using the built-in fee calculator before placing a bet is worthwhile. CoinFutures fees are displayed clearly before you place a position, so there’s no confusion about what you’re being charged. And since this isn’t real futures trading, there’s no collateral, funding rates, or margin calls to worry about. It’s a simple pick-your-fee model that’s easy to understand. Note that you can’t toggle the fee type mid-session. Once you select one, it sticks for the round. Fast, Flexible Deposits Funding your account is refreshingly easy. We tested both crypto ($ETH, $USDT) and credit card deposits. Each worked seamlessly, and we were fully loaded and ready to play within minutes. Crypto options include: Bitcoin, Stablecoins: $USDT, $USDC, Other altcoins: $ETH, $BNB, $SOL, $POL. As for payment services, the platform supports Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PIX , which is great for global accessibility. There are no deposit fees from CoinFutures, but network fees still apply depending on the chain you use. Leaderboard & Community Ranking The CoinFutures leaderboard is a fun touch. It shows the top traders ranked by ROI or total profit. We checked it regularly during our review and found it encouraged some friendly competition. This feature adds a bit of stickiness: it’s not just about one win, but climbing the ranks and refining your strategy over time. We would’ve liked an option to filter by timeframes (e.g., 24h, weekly). But even without it, it’s a solid motivator. You can even view your past predictions to analyze your performance and adjust your approach. The only negative here is that the leaderboard can be a bit buggy and slow to load on mobile, though this is certainly not a dealbreaker. VISIT COINFUTURES TODAY Is CoinFutures Trading Platform Safe to Use? Based on our testing and background research, CoinFutures appears to be a safe and well-managed platform. At least in terms of operational integrity and data handling. It’s not just a standalone experiment; it’s part of the broader CoinPoker ecosystem, which has been around since 2017 without any major hacks, scandals, or rug pulls. That kind of track record matters, especially in an industry where trust is often fragile. CoinFutures benefits from the same infrastructure that powers CoinPoker, including secure custody of funds via Fireblocks , a reputable institutional-grade wallet provider. Funds are ringfenced , with poker balances and futures balances managed separately. That means if one side of the business hits turbulence, it doesn’t impact the other. As for user data, everything runs over encrypted channels. Although there’s no mandatory KYC, the platform still protects the limited information you do provide (such as your email), and there’s no evidence of data leaks or breaches to date. Note that CoinFutures doesn’t ask for KYC to create an account, though its terms and conditions state that KYC verification may be requested for withdrawals if required by its gaming license. Overall, the risk here isn’t security; it’s leverage. A 1,000x multiplier can wipe you out in seconds. So while CoinFutures is a legitimate and technically secure platform, how “safe” it is will ultimately come down to how you use it. Is CoinFutures Easy to Use? Our CoinFutures platform review went smoothly so based on our experience, the app really is easy to use from the get-go. With no need for KYC, wallet connection, or juggling convoluted menus, it takes just a few clicks and you’re live. Everything from coin selection to setting your multiplier is laid out clearly on a single screen, making it ideal for beginners or anyone who wants fast access without the usual exchange friction. We also liked how the platform instantly shows your bust price and potential return as you adjust your settings – a small but helpful detail. On mobile, it ran smoothly overall, though we did hit minor lag when loading leaderboards on slower connections. Still, overall, it’s intuitive, fast, and genuinely easy to pick up, even if you’re new to crypto futures. How Does CoinFutures Compare to Other Futures Trading Platforms? If you’re trying to decide whether CoinFutures is the right choice for your trading style, it helps to see how it stacks up against the bigger names in crypto futures. We’ve put together a quick comparison below to give you a clear view of what each platform brings to the table – from asset variety to trading features and ease of use. Wallet Top Choice For Asset Support Markets Standout Features CoinFutures Fast, no-KYC futures betting game 15+ cryptos (including $BTC, $ETH, & $DOGE) Simulated futures only – No KYC– Up to 1,000x leverage– Cash out anytime MEXC Altcoin hunters & leverage traders 3K+ spot, 350+ derivatives Spot, futures, staking, copy trading – 500x leverage– 0.00% maker fees– Huge altcoin range Binance High-volume trading & pro features 500 spot, 487 futures Spot, futures, options, staking – Highest liquidity CEX– Insures users’ assets– Trading bots OKX All-in-one DeFi and CEX experience 300+ coins Spot, futures, options, staking, NFTs – DeFi & NFT wallet– Earning via staking– TradingView integration BloFin Rewards & gamified trading 250 spot, 300+ futures Spot, futures, copy trading – Optional KYC– Copy trading– Frequent giveaways As you can see, CoinFutures offers something pretty different: it’s not trying to replace the big exchanges. It’s carving its own lane with a futures-like game interface, real-time simulated volatility, and zero-friction entry. If you’re after real futures trading, with complex order types and hundreds of markets, you’ll want the likes of MEXC or Binance . But if you want to ride the $BTC chart with 1,000x leverage, no KYC, and no margin headache? CoinFutures nails it. CoinFutures’ Reputation – What Are People Saying? Since CoinFutures is a newer addition to the CoinPoker ecosystem, we couldn’t find any direct reviews for this platform specifically. However, we looked into public feedback on CoinPoker itself (the parent platform, active since 2017) across poker forums and crypto communities. From what we saw, the feedback is mixed. The main positive we’ve seen mentioned is ease of use, with users lauding the interface design and fast gameplay. Several people praised the clean UI, ease of onboarding, and lack of intrusive verification steps. That said, we did come across a few criticisms related to CoinPoker’s games – mostly around delays during crypto withdrawals. Such withdrawal issues may be related to KYC and CoinPoker’s compliance with regional laws. Although the platform doesn’t generally require KYC to sign up, it’s worth reading the terms and conditions first to ensure you’re not in a potentially restricted region. For now, CoinFutures seems to benefit from CoinPoker’s established infrastructure, but it will be important to monitor user feedback as adoption of the trading product grows. We’ll update this review as more verified CoinFutures reviews appear. How to Use CoinFutures Trading Platform – A Step-By-Step Guide Getting started with CoinFutures is simple and fast. The whole setup – from landing on the site to placing the first trade – takes under five minutes. Here’s how you can use the platform: 1. Visit the CoinFutures Website and Click ‘Register Now’ Head over to the official CoinFutures website and hit the ‘Register’ button. You’ll be directed to a short sign-up form. 2. Enter Your Email, Password, and Nickname To create your account, just fill in: A valid email address, A strong password, A nickname (used on the leaderboard). As there’s no KYC or wallet connection needed, you can just accept the terms and click register. Prefer not to register with an email? You can download the CoinPoker app instead and connect your crypto wallet to play anonymously. This gives you full access to the futures game without creating a traditional account. 3. Make a Deposit Once logged in (or connected via wallet), it’s time to fund your account. From the dashboard, look for the wallet icon in the top-right corner – this is where the deposits and withdrawals are managed. Choose the currency you want to deposit and paste your public wallet address to confirm the transfer. You can deposit using crypto like $BTC, $ETH, $USDT, or $SOL. If you prefer fiat, you can also deposit via card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay. We tested both options, and funds showed up within a couple of minutes. 4. Open the Crypto Futures Tab and Place a Bet Inside the CoinPoker interface , navigate to Crypto Futures from the main menu to launch the trading game. The layout is consistent across both desktop and mobile, so you’ll find it easy to navigate. Pick a supported asset (e.g., $BTC, $ETH, $DOGE, $LTC, etc.), choose Up (long) or Down (short) to open a long/short position, and set your leverage. You can set your multiplier anywhere from 1x (no leverage) up to 1000x for higher risk/reward plays. Once your position is live, you’ll see it update in real time on the chart. You can cash out early (locking in profits) or cut losses (before the bust price is reached) in your active trade panel. TRY COINFUTURES NOW CoinFutures Review – Final Thoughts If you’re looking for a simplified way to practice futures trading without diving headfirst into complex derivatives platforms, CoinFutures is a strong contender. It’s built for speed, requires no KYC or wallet connection, and strips away the friction that usually comes with crypto exchanges. During our testing, we found the interface intuitive, the leverage settings clear, and the gameplay surprisingly strategic, especially when using tools like stop-loss, take-profit, and Auto Mode. That said, it won’t suit everyone. Because it simulates real price action rather than offering actual contract settlement, traditional traders might find it lacking in depth. But if you’re after instant access, flexible cash-outs, and a no-strings-attached way to ride crypto volatility, it delivers exactly what it promises. This isn’t financial advice. Please do your own research, manage your risk, and only trade what you can afford to lose. FAQs 1. Can I use CoinFutures in the US?

Yes, CoinFutures is a legitimate platform operated by the team behind CoinPoker, which has been active since 2017.

This notable transaction involved 5,000 ETH, valued at approximately $20.9 million. Lookonchain, a prominent blockchain analytics firm, reported this crucial Binance ETH transfer on X, citing data from Arkham. This kind of movement is often indicative of larger trends and can provide valuable insights into institutional crypto moves and overall crypto whale activity . When such a considerable amount of Ethereum changes hands, especially moving onto a major exchange like Binance, market watchers pay close attention to understand the potential ramifications. What Does This Metalpha ETH Deposit Signify? The Metalpha ETH deposit of 5,000 ETH to Binance is more than just a large number; it represents a key event in the digital asset landscape. Typically, large deposits to centralized exchanges can precede various actions by the wallet owner. These actions might include: Liquidity Provision: The funds could be intended for trading activities, such as taking advantage of market fluctuations. Selling Pressure: A common assumption is that large deposits might lead to selling, potentially increasing supply on the exchange and exerting downward pressure on price. Rebalancing Portfolios: Institutional players often rebalance their holdings across different assets or platforms. OTC Deals: Sometimes, these transfers are for over-the-counter (OTC) deals, where large blocks of assets are traded directly between parties without affecting the open market. Monitoring this kind of crypto whale activity is crucial for understanding market sentiment and potential shifts. It allows analysts to gauge the intentions of major holders. Understanding Institutional Crypto Moves: Who is Metalpha? Metalpha is a digital asset wealth management firm based in Hong Kong, focusing on professional and institutional investors. Their involvement in the crypto space signifies a growing trend of traditional financial entities entering the digital asset market. When we observe institutional crypto moves like this substantial Binance ETH transfer , it underscores several key aspects: Maturing Market: It highlights the increasing participation of sophisticated financial players in cryptocurrencies. Transparency: Blockchain technology offers unprecedented transparency, allowing platforms like Lookonchain and Arkham to track these significant transactions. Strategic Intent: Firms like Metalpha execute trades and manage assets with strategic objectives, whether it’s capital deployment, risk management, or yield generation. Their actions are often viewed as indicators of broader market confidence or shifts in investment strategies among large players. The Metalpha ETH deposit is a prime example of such an observable strategic move. What’s the Potential Ethereum Market Impact? While a single Binance ETH transfer of $20.9 million is significant, its direct Ethereum market impact might vary. The cryptocurrency market is vast and highly liquid, especially for a major asset like Ethereum. However, sustained or multiple large deposits from institutional wallets could signal a shift in selling pressure or a re-evaluation of positions. It is important to remember: Not Always Selling: A deposit does not automatically mean a sell-off. Funds can be used for various purposes, as mentioned earlier. Market Context: The impact depends heavily on the prevailing market conditions, overall trading volume, and broader economic factors. Sentiment Driver: News of significant crypto whale activity can influence market sentiment, prompting other traders to adjust their strategies. This specific Metalpha ETH deposit serves as a data point that analysts will integrate into their broader market assessments, contributing to the overall narrative surrounding Ethereum’s short-term outlook. In conclusion, the Metalpha ETH deposit of $20.9 million to Binance is a clear signal of ongoing institutional crypto moves within the digital asset space. While the immediate Ethereum market impact remains to be seen, tracking such substantial Binance ETH transfers and understanding the context behind crypto whale activity provides invaluable insights for anyone navigating the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape. These large-scale transactions are a testament to the growing maturity and institutional adoption of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Metalpha? Metalpha is a Hong Kong-based digital asset wealth management firm that caters to professional and institutional investors, offering various services related to cryptocurrencies. Q2: Why would a large wallet like Metalpha make a significant Metalpha ETH deposit to an exchange? Large wallets often deposit funds to exchanges for various reasons, including preparing for trading, providing liquidity, rebalancing portfolios, or facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) deals. It doesn’t always imply an immediate sell-off. Q3: What does ‘crypto whale activity’ mean? Crypto whale activity refers to the large transactions made by individuals or entities holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency. These movements are closely watched as they can indicate potential market shifts or influential trading strategies. Q4: How might this Binance ETH transfer affect the Ethereum market? While a single large Binance ETH transfer might not drastically alter the market, it can contribute to market sentiment. If the ETH is sold, it could add selling pressure. However, it might also be for other purposes like OTC deals or strategic rebalancing, which have less direct Ethereum market impact on open order books. Did you find this analysis helpful?

This recovery, alongside steady accumulation by crypto treasury firms now holding nearly $90 billion in digital assets, has restored short-term confidence, price has broken past range highs near $119,500, but it remains to be seen if this breakout over resistance sustains. The price is oscillating around the short-term holder cost basis of $106,709, keeping conditions “warm but not overheated” and consistent with mid-cycle bull phases. With 70 percent of short-term holder supply still in profit and profit-taking activity cooling to 45 percent, the market is balanced but highly sensitive to macro catalysts, meaning key US inflation data this week could decide whether BTC pushes for new all-time highs or slips back toward $110,000. After months of calm in financial markets, a confluence of shifting trade policies, evolving bond market dynamics, and softening economic data is setting the stage for a more volatile close to the year. Pending US tariffs threaten to raise costs, disrupt supply chains, and pressure employment, while the bond market’s rising term premium — now at 0.65 percent — signals heightened uncertainty over future Fed policy, especially if inflation accelerates post-tariffs. Manufacturing orders fell 4.8 percent in June , underscoring uneven demand and the challenges businesses face in securing goods ahead of holiday season disruptions. The labour market is also cooling , with job growth slowing, significant downward revisions to prior employment data, and services sector activity stagnating just above contraction levels. Rising service-sector input costs add inflationary pressure, yet improving worker productivity — up 2.4 percent in Q2 — offers a crucial buffer, suggesting that technology-driven efficiency gains may help sustain growth in a softer hiring environment. In the crypto space, BitMine Immersion Technologies has rapidly built the world’s largest Ethereum treasury , amassing over 833,000 ETH worth $2.9 billion in just five weeks, positioning itself as a major institutional player alongside backers such as ARK, Pantera, and Galaxy Digital. Policy shifts under President Trump are also reshaping the industry’s landscape. A recent executive order opens the door for 401(k) and other retirement plans to include alternative assets , including digital assets, potentially driving mainstream adoption.

Based on past cycles, I expect significant upward movement for bitcoin at the end of summer and into early fall. My earlier prediction that bitcoin would outperform the broader market in 2025 has proven accurate so far this year. Bitcoin has gained 22% year-to-date, significantly outpacing the S&P 500's gain of below 9%, supporting my bullish outlook. I'm providing a key update on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) since we could be heading into the final leg of this halving cycle. If bitcoin acts similarly to the way it did in the final leg of past cycles, we could see significant gains in the price at the end of the summer and the beginning of the fall. The price of bitcoin tends to make significant increases in the final leg of the cycle. I expressed my previous theory that bitcoin could significantly outperform the broader market in 2025 in a December 2024 article . That turned out to be true so far this year, as bitcoin increased 24% year-to-date as compared to the S&P 500's ( SPY ) gain of under 9% . Institutional Demand One of the key drivers in the current cycle for bitcoin is institutional demand. This includes large companies such as Strategy ( MSTR ) buying large quantities of bitcoin. As of August 3, 2025, Strategy held 628,791 bitcoins . Strategy tends to have an ongoing bitcoin purchasing plan. There are other companies that also hold bitcoin, such as MARA Holdings ( MARA ) with 50,000 bitcoins, Twenty One Capital with 43,514 bitcoins, and many others. This demand also includes large institutional investors (hedge funds, wealth managers, etc.), such as those buying bitcoin through ETFs. Spot bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $100 billion in assets . SEC filings show that numerous institutional investors purchased bitcoin ETFs. The reason why this is an important driver for the price of bitcoin is because the price of anything is determined by supply and demand. Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins that will ever be mined. With a fixed supply, growing demand would drive the price higher over time. Large institutional investors have the big money that can move markets. Therefore, growing demand from these entities is likely to help drive the price of bitcoin higher. Of course, retail investors can add to the institutional demand, helping to drive the price higher. Favorable Government Actions On August 7, 2025, U.S. President, Donald Trump signed an executive order to allow cryptocurrencies, private equity, and other alternative assets into 401k plans. If this is implemented on a widespread basis, it could lead to even more demand for bitcoin. Self-directed retirement plans already provide options for investing in bitcoin through ETFs. More widespread offerings throughout a variety of retirement plans would most likely increase demand for bitcoin, putting upward pressure on the price. Various countries creating strategic bitcoin reserves can also help the cryptocurrency. The United States (200,000 BTC) and China (190,000 BTC) are two large countries that established strategic bitcoin reserves. Smaller countries such as the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC), Bhutan (13,000), and El Salvador (6,262 BTC) also have reserves. These strategic reserves involve countries holding bitcoin as part of their investment strategies. Strategic reserves can help create acceptance for bitcoin among more investors due to more awareness of the cryptocurrency. The reserves can also help keep more supply out of circulation, putting upward pressure on prices. If these countries implemented regular purchases of bitcoin, it could also put upward pressure on the price. Bullish Technical Outlook Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) Daily Chart w/ RSI & MACD (TradingView) Beginning with the daily chart above, a hidden bullish divergence exists as the price of bitcoin made a higher low, while the purple RSI line (middle of the chart) made a lower low. This type of set-up typically results in the price moving higher from what I have observed. The MACD at the bottom of the chart looks like it is recovering from the recent sell-off from July into August. This is indicated by the histogram, which shows the red bars turning pink and shortening in length. This shows that the recent negative momentum is lessening. The blue MACD line looks like it is about to cross above the red signal line. If the crossover occurs and the histogram bars turn green, a new positive trend will be confirmed on the daily chart. Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) Monthly Chart w/ RSI & MACD (TradingView) I provided bitcoin's monthly chart above to provide a longer-term perspective. We can see that the previous two cycles in 2017 and 2021 didn't peak until the RSI (middle of the chart) went deep above 90 into overbought territory. Actually, the last cycle in 2021 had a double top where the 2nd top went slightly higher than the first top. The RSI didn't move above the 70s yet in the current halving cycle. Of course, there is no guarantee that the price moves the RSI into the 90s in this cycle. However, this has been the case in each cycle so far. I want to point out that previous cycles have been consistent in length of days. For example, the past two halving cycles lasted exactly 1,064 days from the price bottom to the price peak. The first cycle lasted a bit longer at 1,148 days. So, if we use 1,064 days, the current cycle would take us to October 2025. It is also possible that this cycle goes longer or shorter than previous cycles. An educated guess based on previous cycles says that this cycle should last at least until October. The Risks For Investing In Bitcoin One risk for my investment thesis is that the buying volume has been declining from April through July on the monthly chart while the price has been increasing. It is not clear if volume will pick up in August and September. So, the possibility exists that the price already peaked at about $123,000 for this cycle. The price of bitcoin is highly volatile. After the price peaks in each cycle, bitcoin can decline by 70% or more. The good news is that the price made all-time highs in each new cycle after these large sell-offs. Many investors point this out and are advocates of buying and holding bitcoin. However, it can be painful for investors to take such a large hit like that. It can cause them to sell at the wrong time and discourage further investing in bitcoin. I think investors can do better by closely watching the technicals and having an exit strategy close to the peak of each cycle. This would involve selling when the price moves deep into overbought territory on the RSI on the monthly chart. The best purchasing times were when the price dipped below the 50 level on the RSI on the monthly chart. You may not be able to time it perfectly, but buying near the low points and selling near the highs can be feasible. Final Thoughts On Bitcoin My theory is that the rally in bitcoin's price will continue in August and September. I think the rally will last at least 1,064 days in-line with the past two cycles taking us to October 2025. The length of this cycle could be different this time, but the cycles have been fairly consistent. I'm sticking with my forecast for a peak price of at least $150,000 for this cycle, which would be 10x the low price of $15,000 from 2022. The peak price is based on the 2.618 Fibonacci level, which looks reasonable for this cycle.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-11 13:41:59

However, as the 2025 bull run gets closer, Cardano might be unable to give investors the enormous gains they want. ADA might not be able to get the same kind of returns as other new coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) because it has a high market cap, slow growth in DeFi, and its ecosystem isn't growing. Dogecoin and LILPEPE might be better investments for higher returns and faster development. Let's discuss why Cardano might not do well in the next bull run and why Dogecoin and LILPEPE are better set up for big price jumps. Cardano (ADA): The Blockchain That Doesn't Have Much Room To Grow In The Short Term There are many good things about Cardano (ADA). It is one of the most respected cryptocurrencies because it has a proof-of-stake system, is environmentally friendly, and has a lot of academic support. The Hydra scaling solution for Cardano is supposed to improve the network's transaction throughput. Cardano was made with security and scalability in mind. Cardano may not see the kind of quick returns that many investors are looking for in the upcoming 2025 bull run, even though it has a lot of potential in the long term. Here are the main reasons why ADA might let you down: A lot of money in the market: Cardano has already taken much of its market share, with a market cap of several billion dollars. Even though its price will increase from $0.7539, the percentage gains will be smaller than those of smaller, newer coins. Slow Adoption in DeFi: Even though Cardano's ecosystem is getting bigger, it hasn't taken over the DeFi space as much as competitors like Solana and Ethereum. This slower adoption makes it harder to grow in the short term. Stagnation in Ecosystem Growth: Cardano is becoming more popular in Africa and other developing areas. However, its use and growth in DeFi and NFTs are still behind other Layer-1 blockchains. Because of these things, Cardano (ADA) will unlikely see the massive percentage growth many investors expect shortly. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme Coin That Will Last Although Cardano might not perform as expected in terms of returns, Dogecoin (DOGE) will have a significant rally during the next bull run. The first meme coin, Dogecoin, has become a staple in the crypto world with the help of the community and celebrity fans, notably Elon Musk. Dogecoin currently trades at $0.2090 and is expected to increase fivefold to an estimated price of $1 by the end of 2025. At that, DOGE remains an auspicious meme coin to keep an eye on in 2025 since it has an active community, is well-established, and has seen increased utility in the space of NFTs and gaming, as well as in retail payments. Although Dogecoin is not as technology-oriented or promising as some leading coins, it possesses a huge market cap, brand recognition, community contribution, and nature, which is likely to result in a significant rally soon. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin That Works Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is another coin likely to do better than Cardano in the next bull run. LILPEPE's community may not be as big as Dogecoin's, but it's quickly becoming a meme coin with real use. LILPEPE is trading at $0.0018, raised $15.7 million in presale across blockchain layers, and is built on Layer-2. So transactions are done quicker with lower fees, and the network can support more users than Cardano and Dogecoin. This tech edge makes it more usable and durable for long-term growth. LILPEPE is supported by the Pepe Pump Pad, which gives meme token developers a safe place to start their projects with anti-rug pull features and liquidity locks. This is in addition to its blockchain infrastructure. Analysts say that LILPEPE could reach $0.40 by 2025, a significant return on its current price. Whale investors are starting to buy up LILPEPE, and the community is growing. Why LILPEPE and DOGE Will Do Better Than Cardano Lower starting points and more potential for growth Compared to Cardano, LILPEPE, and Dogecoin have lower entry points and more room for growth. Because Cardano has a high market cap, it can't grow considerably. On the other hand, LILPEPE and DOGE have a lot more room to grow. Usefulness in the real world and support from the community Cardano is a long-term investment, but LILPEPE and Dogecoin are already part of the meme coin culture and can be used for NFTs, gaming, and DeFi. LILPEPE is especially good because it has faster transactions and lower fees, which makes it more useful in the growing DeFi space. The potential for explosive growth LILPEPE has a low market cap, which means that early investors could make significant returns as the coin becomes more popular. Dogecoin is also in an excellent position for substantial growth because it has a huge community and is well-known. Retail investors keep buying the token. How to Put Money into LILPEPE Are you ready to invest in Dogecoin or pits? Here's how you can get started: Get MetaMask or Trust Wallet for your computer or phone. Put ETH or USDT (ERC-20) in your wallet. Go to littlepepe.com to see the official presale page for LILPEPE. Connect your wallet and buy some tokens. The price of LILPEPE will go up as the presale stages move forward, so the best time to invest is early. In Conclusion, Dogecoin And LILPEPE Are Better Choices Than Cardano. Cardano is still a good long-term investment because it is sustainable and has been peer-reviewed, but it has limited room for growth in the short term. Instead, Dogecoin and LILPEPE are better choices for investors who want to make a lot of money quickly in the next bull run. LILPEPE has real use, a low entry point, and a community that spreads the word about it, so it should do better than Cardano in 2025. Dogecoin and LILPEPE are the meme coins to watch if you want to make more money. Go to littlepepe.com right now to get your tokens before the price increases!

Futures-based Solana ( SOL ) and XRP ETFs, for instance, have seen over $1 billion in total inflows since their debut in March and April, respectively, as suggested by recent data provided by FactSet . XRP and SOL ETF flows. Source: FactSet The milestone comes just months after the funds’ debut in the U.S., as speculations about a potential BlackRock XRP ETF continue to mount. Crypto futures ETFs beat all expectations The first U.S. Solana futures ETF was launched by Volatility Shares in March. XRP made its way to the market a month later, with Teucrium’s 2x leveraged fund, followed by Volatility’s non-leveraged futures product in May. In July, both assets saw around $350 million in inflows. Recently, ETF Store president Nate Geraci argued that strong futures demand could lead to BlackRock vying for a share of the market, despite the fund’s denial of any such plans. Yes, I think BlackRock was waiting to see this before filing for iShares XRP ETF… I’ll own it if I’m wrong. IMO, makes *zero* sense for them to ignore crypto assets beyond btc & eth. Otherwise, they’re basically saying btc & eth are only ones that will ever have value. Bold. pic.twitter.com/FtBqMRFpOl — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 8, 2025 Whatever the case may be, swift capital accumulation and ten-digit milestones do indeed signal sustained investor appetite for diversified crypto exposure beyond Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). Geraci further noted that the figures also factor in REX-Osprey’s Solana staking ETF, which has amassed $150 million in assets under management (AUM). The momentum, he argued, suggests strong demand for eventual spot SOL and XRP ETFs. “And I’m being told BlackRock doesn’t want a piece of this? Ok.” Geraci wrote on X. Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also weighed in on the discussion, asking Geraci where he would “draw the line” on launching crypto ETFs and questioning whether an XRP ETF alone would suffice or if funds like BlackRock would rather explore other alternatives, such as Tron ( TRX ).

El Salvador Approves Law Allowing Investment Banks to Hold Bitcoin Accordingly, financial institutions with a capital of at least $50 million will be able to gain “investment bank” status and offer Bitcoin and crypto asset-based financial services to qualified investors. The new regulation allows investment banks to add Bitcoin service provider, digital asset service provider or digital asset issuer licenses to their existing bank licenses. This will allow institutions with strong capital to hold Bitcoin, issue tokens, and offer crypto-related financial products. “The institutional structure of El Salvador’s financial system will be expanded with a new regulated and supervised structure, complementary to the traditional banking system,” said Deputy Dania González. The law was also supported by the Ministry of Economy. El Salvador, which mandated businesses in the country to accept payments with Bitcoin in 2021, lifted this requirement in early 2025 to receive a $1.4 billion loan from the IMF, slowing down public sector Bitcoin initiatives. However, low adoption rates have attracted attention; it was found that crypto usage in remittance transactions is only at 1% level and only 20% of the public has adopted crypto. Although it was officially announced that 1 BTC was purchased per day, the information given to the IMF showed that this was not a new purchase, but transfers from existing government wallets to the reserve wallet. If you'd like, I can expand this article into a more analytical version focusing on El Salvador's institutional transformation of Bitcoin.

This upward movement across major indices suggests a prevailing sense of market optimism , a welcome sight for many. Understanding these shifts in traditional markets is crucial, even for those primarily focused on digital assets, as they often signal broader economic trends that can influence the cryptocurrency space. What’s Driving This Market Optimism? Today’s positive opening is not by chance; several factors contribute to this surge in investor sentiment . Market participants often react to a mix of recent economic data, corporate earnings reports, and expectations regarding central bank policies. Economic Indicators: Strong employment figures or better-than-expected inflation data can fuel confidence. When key economic indicators show resilience, investors tend to feel more secure about future corporate profits. Corporate Earnings: Positive earnings reports from major companies often act as a significant catalyst. They signal robust business health and potential for growth. Federal Reserve Outlook: Speculation around interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve also plays a huge role. A perceived dovish stance or a pause in rate hikes can make equities more attractive. These elements collectively paint a picture of cautious optimism, encouraging more capital to flow into the stock market. The Immediate Impact of US Stock Market Open Higher The numbers speak for themselves, illustrating the immediate gains observed across the board. When the US stock market open higher , it typically means broad-based gains for various sectors. The S&P 500, a benchmark for large-cap US equities, registered a gain of +0.03% . This indicates a healthy, albeit modest, start for a wide array of companies. The tech-heavy NASDAQ composite climbed +0.01% . Technology stocks often lead the charge during periods of strong growth expectations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing 30 significant US companies, also saw an increase of +0.02% . This signals stability and positive momentum in traditional industrial sectors. These early gains suggest that investors are reacting favorably to the current financial landscape, anticipating continued stability or growth. How Investor Sentiment Influences Crypto Market Impact While the cryptocurrency market operates independently in many ways, it is not entirely immune to the forces driving traditional finance. The ripple effects of investor sentiment in the stock market often extend to digital assets. When the US stock market open higher and shows sustained strength, it can have a twofold crypto market impact : Increased Risk Appetite: A strong stock market often means investors have a higher tolerance for risk. This can lead to capital flowing into more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Correlation vs. Decoupling: Historically, Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have shown some correlation with tech stocks. A positive day for the NASDAQ might, therefore, translate into a positive sentiment for crypto. However, some argue for a growing decoupling, where crypto moves on its own unique drivers. Monitoring these traditional market movements provides valuable context for understanding potential shifts in the digital asset space. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors For both stock and crypto investors, the current climate calls for informed decisions. While the US stock market open higher is a positive sign, it is important to remain strategic. Consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on key economic indicators and global news. These factors provide context for market movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: A well-diversified portfolio helps mitigate risks. Do not put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s stocks or crypto. Long-Term Perspective: Short-term fluctuations are normal. Focus on your long-term investment goals rather than reacting to every daily market swing. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Before making any investment decisions, assess your comfort level with risk, especially when considering more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. These principles help you navigate the dynamic financial landscape effectively. Today’s US stock market open higher is a clear signal of prevailing market optimism . While modest, these gains across the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow highlight robust investor sentiment driven by various economic indicators . This positive momentum in traditional finance often has a notable crypto market impact , influencing risk appetite and capital flows. As always, staying informed and adopting a strategic approach to your investments remains paramount. The financial world is interconnected, and understanding these relationships empowers better decision-making. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “US stock market open higher” mean for the average investor? It generally means that major stock indices, like the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow, started the trading day with positive gains. For the average investor, this can signal a healthy economic outlook and potentially higher returns on their stock investments. Q2: How quickly can the stock market change after a positive opening? Market conditions can change rapidly throughout the trading day. While a strong opening sets a positive tone, various news events, economic data releases, or shifts in investor sentiment can lead to reversals or further gains. Q3: Is a strong US stock market always good for the crypto market? Not always, but often there’s a correlation. When traditional markets perform well, investor risk appetite tends to increase, which can lead to more capital flowing into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. However, crypto also has its own unique drivers and can sometimes decouple. Q4: What are “economic indicators” and why are they important? Economic indicators are statistics about economic activity, such as GDP, inflation rates, employment figures, and consumer confidence. They are important because they provide insights into the health and direction of the economy, influencing investor decisions and market movements. Q5: Where can I find reliable information on US stock market performance? You can find reliable information from reputable financial news outlets, official stock exchange websites, and financial data providers. Always cross-reference information to ensure accuracy.

49918325,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=782576,1754920611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49918325.jpeg,Elon Musk expands free tier Grok 4 access in push to gain Ai market share,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musk-thrills-x-with-free-grok-4/,"Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, is offering free global access to its newest model, Grok 4, on X. The news has thrilled millions of users who now get to experience Musk’s latest AI model at no cost. According to xAI, Grok 4 is open to all users with its free tier. New features in this model include an “Auto” mode for difficult queries and an “Expert” mode for those who would rather activate it themselves. While this service has traditionally been limited to certain users or territories, opening Grok 4 to a global audience means that anyone on X can now reap the benefits of its capabilities. Elon Musk says the Grok model free version will allow a few queries per day Earlier, access for non-subscribers was capped at five daily requests under a tiered system, and subscribers had to pay $30 per month to gain unrestricted access to the platform. xAI is now providing free access to its AI model , describing the move as part of its mission to expand the availability of advanced AI. Musk posted on X, “Grok 4 is now free for all users. The free tier allows a small number of queries per day. Beyond that requires subscription.” The move closely follows the release of Grok Imagine, an image and video generation tool previously exclusive to subscribers. Grok Imagine thus simplifies the entry level for novices in this ecosystem of xAI by making it available free anywhere on iOS and Android. The service transforms natural language prompts into visual media like videos and images. xAI previously wrote that the model’s availability would be limited, but did not provide details on when it would withdraw the offer. This lack of a definitive roadmap lends itself to a speculative rollout rather than any built-in analyst forecasts. This time-limited access window might indicate a more significant departure from the path to monetization in favor of longer-term user retention to reintroduce subscription fees eventually. Users have asked for revisions to the model’s tiers Some users on X have asked the platform to update its pricing or offerings for premium users now that it’s allowing free use. One user commented that they would like a higher-tier option beyond the free version, explaining that heavy demand sometimes overwhelms the AI, causing generated images to appear as a green screen. Another user inquires why Premium Plus members are still being billed $40 a month for Grok. Some supporters of the Grok model were pleased with xAI’s decision, claiming that the company is offering “perfection for free” and calling the AI model a real game changer. One user even asked Musk when they would release the next version, possibly named Grok 5. In July, xAI secured a contract worth nearly $200 million with the US Department of Defense to create and implement artificial intelligence solutions. At that time, the United States Department of Defense, working with the General Services Administration, issued similar $200 million–cap contracts to other prominent US AI companies like Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI. Before the contract announcement, Grok was facing backlash for publishing responses that promoted Nazi ideology and rape fantasies. However, the company later said it had resolved the problem and apologized to those affected. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The ETF's unique allocation gives Cronos USD a 5% weight, far above its market share, making it the biggest beneficiary if the ETF succeeds. A spot CRO-USD ETF is expected to follow, potentially driving CRO's price 20x higher, though a planned token reissue poses dilution risk. Buying CRO on Crypto.com ahead of these events offers a compelling opportunity to benefit from the ETF's launch and subsequent market effects. Disclaimer / Disclosure : long BTC, ETH, and CRO Crypto.com’s Cronos Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. ( DJT ) was taken public by Digital World Acquisition Corp. For background, I discussed it a half dozen times from here to here , with my most recent rating consistent with my original view. Earliest call Latest call I was more skeptical of the stock at $94.20, but would still stay away at $16.99. Sporting a $4.75 billion market cap, each quarter I do a double take reading their revenue because the number is in the thousands, not millions. $90. Probably not worth >$10."" contenteditable=""false""> Definitely not worth >$90. Probably not worth >$10. Last month, Trump Media filed a registration statement for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, B.T. The ETF will hold Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ether (ETC-USD), Solana (SOL-USD), Cronos USD (CRO-USD), and Ripple (XRP-USD). The exclusive digital asset custodian and prime execution agent, as well as staking and liquidity provider, is Crypto.com . 70% of its assets will be invested in Bitcoin, 15% in Ether, 8% in SOL, 5% in CRO, and 2% in XRP. First things first: I fully expect the SEC to approve this new ETF. The new chairman is pro-crypto, and this would be wholly in keeping with recent SEC priorities. An IPO could come this quarter. Secondly: I expect the launch to be wildly successful. Every major sovereign wealth fund will have a convenient plug-and-play way to get in President Trump’s good graces. The Qatar Investment Authority has over half a trillion dollars for such things. This could easily be a $50 billion ETF and then grow from there. Thirdly: approval from the SEC and the market would have a strong signaling effect. This is, after all, the list of cryptocurrencies the president’s eponymous company designated as “blue chip.” So they should get their own individual spot ETF approved by the SEC when applications are made. The president recently signed an executive order to allow crypto in 401(k)s—certainly all blue chips should qualify for his standard. In the first quarter, Trump signed an executive order to establish the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile out of assets the government gets in forfeitures. While it has a slightly different list of candidates than the proposed ETF, it is likely that discrepancy will be reconciled in the future. So the ETF could have a cascading effect that could amplify the demand for component crypto. One of these things is not like the others Cronos is off the charts overweighted — the ETF would give it ~45× the weight it has in the overall crypto market. It will get the most impact from the ETF's potential approval, success, and signaling. It is the native cryptocurrency of… Crypto.com, the ETF’s exclusive digital asset custodian and prime execution agent. If the ETF is successfully approved and launched, CRO could rise 20x from here to over $3 and still be the smallest market share in this blue-chip index. In short, the 5% allocation is a wild outlier of an overweighting. Right after the basket ETF hits the market, Crypto.com will follow up with a dedicated spot CRO ETF in the fourth quarter. Spot CRO ETF coming Caveat Crypto.com wants to reissue 70 billion CRO tokens, or 70% of their original supply, to help fund their ambitious goals. This is massively dilutive to CRO owners, whose circulating supply is currently 27 billion. Conclusion DJT’s new cryptocurrency ETF will be an optimal tool for enriching everyone involved. People will be able to signal their support for President Trump by buying it. Ideologically or personality-driven fans can buy a few shares, or favor seekers can rise to the top of the 13G list. Trump is a professed deal guy. Here’s where one can pay to play. TL; DR Get on Crypto.com to buy CRO before these events unfold in the months ahead.",DJTWW|BTC-USD|ETC-USD|SOL-USD|XRP-USD|DJT|CRO-USD,EN,0,0,CRO|REGULATION|MARKET|ZRX|BTC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-11 14:00:00

In 2026, it will range between $0.5404 and $0.6531, with an average price of $0.5558. In 2030, it will range between $2.21 and $2.73, with an average price of $2.29. Algorand’s capabilities make it an interesting prospect for investors and developers interested in smart contracts and blockchain interoperability. Will ALGO go up? Can it reach $10? Where will ALGO be in 5 years? We explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Algorand Symbol ALGO Current Algorand price $0.2574 Market cap $2.24B Trading volume $127.41M Circulating supply 8.69B All-time high $3.28 on Jun 21, 2019 All-time low $0.08761 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $0.2796 24-hour low $0.2603 Algorand price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 8.30% 50-day SMA $0.2350 200-day SMA $0.1879 Sentiment Bullish Green days 16/30 (53%) Fear and Greed Index 70 (Greed) Algorand price analysis: ALGO faces resistance at $0.27 On Aug 11, ALGO’s price rose by 17.89% in the last 30 days but dropped 1.63% in the last 24 hours, underperforming the broader crypto market (+0.36%). Its trading volume rose by 23.92% in 24 hours to $126.08 M, signaling market conviction in the current trend. Algorand’s total value locked (TVL) rose by 1.01% in 24 hours to $83.14M. Algorand 1-day chart analysis ALGOUSD chart by TradingView Algorand crossed into overbought territory last month. At its highest, it reached $0.34. The trend reversed in August, and an attempted recovery failed to break above $0.27. The technicals show rising volatility and low market momentum. Algorand 4-hour chart analysis ALGOUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights ALGO’s rejection at $0.27. The level remains critical to whether it will continue with the earlier bull run. At current levels, the candles have formed an engulfing bearish trend with rising negative momentum as shown by the MACD indicator. Algorand technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 0.2362 BUY SMA 5 0.2512 BUY SMA 10 0.2441 BUY SMA 21 0.2573 BUY SMA 50 0.2350 BUY SMA 100 0.2212 BUY SMA 200 0.1879 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 0.2502 BUY EMA 5 0.2399 BUY EMA 10 0.2238 BUY EMA 21 0.2106 BUY EMA 50 0.2173 BUY EMA 100 0.2409 BUY EMA 200 0.2452 BUY What to expect from the Algorand price analysis next? Per our technical indicators, ALGO is bullish, with the fear and greed index showing a greed sentiment among investors. The charts show market diversion as the negative momentum continues to rise over the short term. Recent news Robinhood and Gemini exchanges recently launched tokenized stocks, sparking investor interest in this new type of asset. Against this backdrop, the blockchain chosen by issuers could become a fresh opportunity for investors. Right now, Algorand commands over 66% of the market share. However, the picture of market share in tokenized stocks could change if this trend keeps gaining momentum. Why is ALGO up? Algorand turned bullish last month as altcoins continued to outperform Bitcoin. Algorand, however, faced resistance at $30. Algorand’s rising RWA adoption also contributed to the rise. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Algorand price forecast, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can ALGO reach 100 dollars? At $100, Algorand’s market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorand is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025? For the last month of 2025, ALGO’s price will range between $0.2960 and $0.3313. The average price for the period will be $0.2500. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term. ALGO price prediction August 2025 The Algorand network price forecast for August is a maximum price of $0.2350 and a minimum price of $0.1860. The average price for the month will be $0.1970.

Algorand historic price sentiment ALGO price chart by CoinGecko Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January, $0.35 in February, $0.21 in March, and $0.20 in May and June. It crossed into August, trading at $0.22.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-11 14:00:00

This strategic decision involved a substantial increase in their Mill City Ventures SUI holdings, signaling a strong belief in the future of decentralized finance and specific digital assets. For investors tracking institutional involvement in crypto, this update offers valuable insights into evolving investment strategies. What Propelled Mill City Ventures’ SUI Investment? Mill City Ventures, a publicly traded company, announced an impressive accumulation of SUI tokens. As of August 10, their total SUI crypto holdings reached a staggering 81.87 million tokens, valued at approximately $316 million. This substantial figure comes after a recent acquisition of 5.6 million additional SUI tokens, purchased at an average price of $3.65 each. This strategic acquisition underscores a deliberate MCVT investment strategy focused on expanding their digital asset portfolio. The company’s decision to increase its SUI position reflects a calculated approach to capitalize on the potential of emerging blockchain technologies. By investing in SUI, a relatively new but promising cryptocurrency, Mill City Ventures positions itself to benefit from its growth and adoption within the ecosystem. Understanding the Power of Cryptocurrency Staking for Earnings What makes this investment even more compelling is Mill City Ventures’ approach to managing these substantial holdings. Nearly all of their SUI tokens are now staked. Staking is a process where cryptocurrency holders lock up their assets to support the operations of a blockchain network. In return, they earn rewards, similar to earning interest in a traditional savings account. This cryptocurrency staking strategy is generating significant passive income for MCVT. The company reports an approximate 3% yield on their staked assets, translating to an impressive $26,000 in earnings per day. This consistent income stream highlights the attractive returns possible through thoughtful digital asset management. Moreover, it demonstrates how institutions can leverage crypto assets not just for capital appreciation but also for recurring revenue. MCVT’s Strategic SUI Holdings: A Deep Dive The scale of Mill City Ventures’ SUI crypto holdings makes this a notable event in the institutional crypto landscape. A $316 million commitment to a single altcoin suggests extensive due diligence and confidence in SUI’s long-term viability. This move could potentially influence other traditional financial entities to explore similar avenues in the digital asset market. However, like all investments, risks exist. The volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets means that the value of these holdings can fluctuate. Nevertheless, the decision to stake a vast majority of their SUI mitigates some of this risk by generating a steady yield, providing a buffer against price swings and enhancing the overall staked SUI earnings . What This Means for Institutional Digital Asset Yields Mill City Ventures’ proactive engagement with SUI and its staking mechanism sets a precedent. It illustrates a growing trend where traditional companies are not just buying cryptocurrencies but are actively participating in network security and earning yields. This evolution in MCVT investment strategy could pave the way for broader institutional adoption of decentralized finance protocols. The consistent daily yield from their staked SUI exemplifies a new frontier for generating income from digital assets. As more companies explore these opportunities, the demand for robust and secure staking platforms will likely increase, further professionalizing the crypto ecosystem. In conclusion, Mill City Ventures’ substantial Mill City Ventures SUI holdings and strategic staking position mark a significant moment. Their commitment to SUI and the impressive daily earnings from staking underscore the potential for institutional players in the evolving digital asset landscape. This move not only highlights MCVT’s foresight but also provides a compelling case study for the viability of generating consistent yields from cryptocurrency investments.

The move marks a strong bullish continuation after weeks of upward momentum, fueling hopes among traders that a new record could be imminent. However, seasoned investors are approaching the rally with caution, warning that current price action could represent a relief rally before another consolidation phase. Related Reading: Altseason Still On Hold – Metrics Reveal BTC Outpaces Large, Mid, Small Caps Fresh data from CryptoQuant adds a layer of complexity to the market outlook. After a sharp rise in average weekly open interest to over 20% — peaking on July 14 — the metric has since dropped significantly, now turning negative. This shift suggests that short-term risk appetite has diminished, potentially reducing speculative momentum in the near term. While open interest declines are not inherently bearish, they can indicate a cooling phase after periods of aggressive leverage. In some cases, such pullbacks in open interest, especially when paired with increased liquidations, have preceded attractive buying opportunities. For now, Bitcoin’s position near record highs offers both promise and risk, with the next few sessions likely to determine whether the market pushes higher or pauses for consolidation. Open Interest Signals Cooling Risk Appetite Top analyst Darkfost has shared fresh market insights, highlighting a notable shift in Bitcoin’s derivatives landscape. According to his analysis, the current weekly average for open interest change sits at -2.2%, marking a sharp reversal from the +20% levels seen just weeks ago. This drop signals that short-term risk appetite among traders has clearly diminished, with many participants reducing leveraged positions after an extended bullish run. Liquidations are a key factor in this development. Darkfost points out that when open interest experiences a sharp short-term drop alongside a spike in liquidations, it often presents a window for profitable long entries. This setup typically occurs when overleveraged positions are wiped out, allowing stronger hands to accumulate at more favorable levels. While not a precise buy signal, it remains a valuable tool for gauging market conditions and identifying potentially favorable entry zones. The current backdrop is particularly intriguing as Ethereum pushes toward all-time highs, drawing increased attention to the broader crypto market. Bitcoin’s stability above the $120K level, combined with improving sentiment across altcoins, sets the stage for potentially strong follow-through in the coming weeks. However, traders will be watching derivatives metrics closely for signs of renewed leverage or further cooling before committing to larger positions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Near All-Time High – Market Not Overheated Yet, Data Shows Bitcoin Tests Key Resistance Just Below All-Time High Bitcoin has surged to $121,337, marking a strong breakout from its recent consolidation phase and pushing to its highest level since setting the all-time high at $123K. The daily chart shows a decisive move above the $119K zone, confirming bullish momentum after holding support at the 50-day moving average near $114,155. This rally brings BTC within striking distance of the $123,217–$124,000 resistance area, a critical zone that previously capped upside attempts in July. A clean break and daily close above this level could open the door for a new all-time high, potentially triggering further upside momentum as traders chase the breakout.

49918059,553119,1754920822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49918059.jpeg,Are Ethereum Treasury Companies A Threat To Bitcoin? Michael Saylor Reveals His Stance,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-treasury-companies/,"Michael Saylor , the executive chairman and co-founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), says Ethereum (ETH) treasury adoption is no threat to the Bitcoin (BTC) dominance. Currently, institutional interest in cryptocurrency treasuries is expanding beyond Bitcoin, with some companies now adding Ethereum and other digital assets to their balance sheets. The trend has sparked debate over whether Bitcoin could face serious competition in the corporate treasury space. Bitcoin Dominance Tested By Rising Ethereum Treasuries In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Saylor made it clear that he does not view Ethereum treasury adoption as a genuine threat to Bitcoin’s dominance . The Strategy chairman acknowledged that Ethereum and other altcoins are attracting attention from corporate treasuries. However, he stressed that the overwhelming flow of institutional capital remains concentrated in Bitcoin. When asked if he thinks the recent shift into altcoin treasuries like Ethereum could overshadow Bitcoin, Saylor responded by citing statistical data. He reported that the number of companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheets has more than doubled in just six months, jumping from around 60 to 160. He described this acceleration as evidence that BTC is cementing its status as “digital capital”. In his view, companies adopting Ethereum for treasury purposes may be experimenting with blockchain technology, but they are not displacing Bitcoin’s role as the premier macro asset. The Strategy chairman also argued that Bitcoin offers the lowest risk profile in the entire digital asset space while delivering superior return potential compared to traditional benchmarks like the S&P 500. He predicted that over time, BTC would not only outperform the S&P 500 but also continue to attract the majority of institutional investment inflows. While Ethereum and other crypto assets may see innovation and niche adoption, Saylor sees this as complementary rather than competitive. He characterized the expansion of the broader crypto economy and treasury as beneficial for the entire sector. Still, he maintained that Bitcoin’s unique monetary qualities and liquidity keep it firmly in the lead. Strategy Marks Five Years Of BTC Adoption Strategy has recently marked the fifth anniversary of its landmark Bitcoin strategy , which began with its first BTC purchase in August 2020. At the time, the company had acquired a whopping 21,454 BTC for $250 million. Since then, Strategy has spent approximately $46 billion to accumulate 628,791 BTC, giving it the largest Bitcoin treasury among public companies. At current prices, this holding is worth about $76.7 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.Net. Notably, Saylor’s bold decision to adopt a Bitcoin strategy has paid off dramatically for both the company and its shareholders. Over the past five years, the MSTR stock price has surged over 3,000%, climbing from under $15 in 2020 to over $395 as of last Friday’s close. For a company that had previously endured decades of stagnant performance, its Bitcoin pivot has not only transformed its balance sheet but also redefined its position in the market as one of the leading institutional holders of the world’s largest cryptocurrency.",Bitcoin News|Altcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Strategy|Bitcoin's Dominance|btc|btc price|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|michael saylor|MicroStrategy|mstr|S&P 500,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-11 14:00:22

With strong institutional interest and potential for further growth, Cardano is looking to break through key resistance levels and possibly reach $3. However, while ADA’s future is promising, emerging projects like Remittix (RTX) are quietly catching the attention of analysts and investors alike. In this article, we’ll delve into the Cardano price prediction and explore why investors should also consider high-potential presales like Remittix. Cardano Price Prediction: Will ADA Hit $3? Cardano (ADA) is currently priced at $0.79731, and many analysts are keeping a close eye on its performance as it approaches crucial resistance levels. ADA has been experiencing a steady downtrend over the past two weeks, but is now moving into a critical zone between $0.72–$0.75. This range has proven to be a key turning point in the past, either resulting in a strong breakout or a significant rejection. Cardano’s recent price action has demonstrated resilience despite the broader market’s volatility. With increasing adoption, network upgrades, and expanding decentralized applications (dApps), ADA continues to attract institutional interest. Cardano’s price prediction for 2025 shows it could reach as high as $3, provided it breaks key resistance levels and capitalizes on the overall positive sentiment around Layer 1 blockchains. The bullish outlook is also supported by upcoming technical developments on the Cardano network, which could boost investor confidence and drive prices higher. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Amid Cardano’s Growth Potential While Cardano has potential for substantial growth, another crypto asset, Remittix (RTX), is quietly capturing investor attention as a high-potential presale project. Remittix (RTX) provides real-world use cases, offering cross-border crypto-to-fiat payments with next-day settlement across 30 countries. With its growing utility, Remittix could be on the verge of significant growth, drawing attention from those looking for more predictable, utility-driven investments. Here’s why Remittix could be the next big player in the crypto space: Global Settlement : Remittix allows seamless and secure crypto-to-fiat conversions across 30 countries with next-day settlement, making it a practical solution for cross-border payments. Transparent Fees : Flat pricing with no hidden fees ensures investor clarity. Security & Stability : Remittix uses CertiK-audited smart contracts, ensuring the security and reliability of transactions. Enterprise Adoption : Remittix’s mobile wallet beta and merchant tools are designed to drive mainstream adoption. Conclusion: Why Investors Should Look Beyond Cardano While Cardano price prediction suggests it could reach $3 in the near term, there is growing interest in alternative projects like Remittix (RTX). As the presale continues to gain momentum and more institutional players enter the market, Remittix is positioning itself as an attractive investment for those seeking solid, utility-based growth. Investors looking to diversify their portfolios should consider Remittix as an ideal addition, especially as the crypto market continues to evolve and demand for real-world blockchain solutions rises.

The result was nothing short of staggering: a theoretical price of $2,070 per XRP. Revisiting the 2017 XRP Surge Grok’s analysis began by revisiting XRP’s historic rally during the last major crypto boom. In January 2017, XRP was trading at roughly $0.006. Over the following twelve months, investor enthusiasm, speculative demand, and a broader market frenzy propelled the token to an all-time high of around $3.84 by December 2017 and January 2018. This represented an astonishing 63,900% increase, a level of growth rarely seen in any asset class. Applying the Growth to Today’s Market To project XRP’s potential price under a similar rally, Grok took the percentage gain from the 2017 cycle and applied it to the current market value. At the time of its analysis, the AI model referenced a current XRP price of approximately $3.24. Using the same 63,900% surge seen in 2017, the model arrived at a theoretical price of $2,070.36. This figure, while mathematically derived, serves more as an illustrative exercise than a concrete forecast. It underscores the magnitude of XRP’s past rally and how those gains, if repeated, could lead to astronomical valuations. Factors That Could Influence the Outcome Grok was clear that market dynamics in 2025 differ sharply from those in 2017. The previous rally was driven largely by retail speculation, with minimal institutional involvement and far less regulatory oversight. Today’s environment is shaped by evolving global regulations, the potential for institutional adoption, and developments such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and on-demand liquidity expansion. While some market watchers believe XRP could still achieve notable price milestones, with speculative targets ranging from $30 to $99 under bullish scenarios, matching the 2017 percentage surge would require unprecedented market conditions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Risks and Realities The AI model also emphasized that historical patterns do not guarantee future results. Price trajectories depend on numerous factors, including investor sentiment, regulatory clarity, global economic conditions, and XRP’s practical adoption in cross-border payment systems. Volatility remains an inherent risk, and traders are urged to approach such projections with caution. Grok’s projection that XRP could reach $2,070 if it mirrored its 2017 bull run serves as a striking reminder of the explosive growth potential cryptocurrencies have displayed in the past. However, it is also a reality check: the conditions that fueled the 2017 surge may never be fully replicated. For investors, the takeaway is clear — while past performance can inspire optimism, future gains will depend on a complex interplay of innovation, regulation, and market sentiment.

According to Whale Alert, a wallet believed to belong to crypto market maker Cumberland moved a whopping 471 BTC, valued at approximately $56.39 million, directly to Coinbase Institutional. This massive movement of funds often signals interesting developments in the digital asset space, sparking discussions about market dynamics and institutional strategies. What Does This Bitcoin to Coinbase Institutional Move Imply? When large sums of Bitcoin move from a known entity like Cumberland to an institutional exchange, it’s rarely for long-term storage. Instead, such transfers are typically preparatory steps for trading activities. This particular Bitcoin to Coinbase Institutional deposit suggests that Cumberland might be gearing up to facilitate significant transactions or manage liquidity for its clients. Facilitating Liquidity: Market makers need substantial capital on exchanges to fulfill buy and sell orders efficiently. Preparing for Trading: The funds could be poised for immediate trading, potentially involving large block trades. Responding to Demand: Cumberland might be reacting to increased institutional demand for Bitcoin, requiring more readily available assets on an institutional platform. Understanding the Role of a Crypto Market Maker Like Cumberland Cumberland is a prominent crypto market maker , playing a vital role in the digital asset ecosystem. Market makers provide liquidity to exchanges, ensuring that there are always buyers and sellers available for various cryptocurrencies. They do this by simultaneously quoting both bid (buy) and ask (sell) prices for a given asset. This activity narrows the spread between buying and selling prices, making markets more efficient and less volatile for other traders. Their operations are crucial for maintaining healthy trading environments, especially for institutional clients who require deep liquidity for large transactions. Therefore, a large deposit from such an entity is always noteworthy. Decoding Whale Bitcoin Movement: What Are the Signals? Any large-scale transaction, often referred to as whale Bitcoin movement , captures the attention of the market. These movements, especially from known institutional players, are frequently interpreted as indicators of upcoming market action. While not always a direct predictor of price changes, they do provide insights into the intentions of major holders. For instance, a deposit to an exchange could signal an intent to sell, while withdrawals often suggest a move to cold storage for long-term holding. In this case, the destination, Coinbase Institutional, strongly implies trading-related activities. The Significance of an Institutional Crypto Deposit An institutional crypto deposit to a platform like Coinbase Institutional highlights the growing maturity and adoption of digital assets by professional entities. Coinbase Institutional caters specifically to institutions, offering advanced trading tools, custody solutions, and high liquidity. The choice of this platform by Cumberland reinforces the professional nature of the transfer. Such large transfers contribute to the overall liquidity of the market, which is beneficial for all participants. They also underscore the increasing integration of traditional financial practices within the cryptocurrency space. What Does This Strategic Transfer Mean for the Market?

Secondly, it suggests that Cumberland anticipates active trading, which could mean increased volatility or opportunities for arbitrage. Lastly, it reinforces the narrative of growing institutional engagement, a long-term positive for Bitcoin’s adoption. While the exact intentions behind this specific transfer remain private, the general consensus is that it’s a move to enable active participation in the market rather than signaling a bearish outlook. Market participants will undoubtedly watch for subsequent trading activity from this address. FAQs What is Cumberland?

Вторая по капитализации криптовалюта обошла Mastercard с рыночной стоимостью почти $520 млрд благодаря стремительному увеличению объемов торгов. ETH стал 22-м крупнейшим активом по рыночной капитализации. По данным CoinMarketCap , на момент публикации цена составляет $4 312. Кроме того, ETH находится всего в 13% от своего исторического максимума $4 878, установленного в ноябре 2021 года. По данным прогнозов трейдеров Polymarket , вероятность достижения ценой Ethereum уровня $4 400 оценивается в 96%, а вероятность преодоления предыдущего рекорда и роста до $5 000 до конца года в 76%. Аналитики: цена ETH может резко вырасти в ближайшие месяцы Трейдеры, институциональные инвесторы и аналитики уверены, что текущий рост может стать началом более крупного и продолжительного ралли. По словам технического аналитика Лорда Хокинса, Ethereum выходит из классической модели Wyckoff Accumulation . Это означает, что недавний рост цены становится “признаком силы” (Sign of Strength, SOS) в зоне сопротивления, за которым обычно следует небольшое коррекционное движение для подтверждения нового восходящего тренда. Если этот сценарий реализуется, ETH может войти в фазу активного роста, что подтолкнет цену к $6 000. Аналитик Titan of Crypto отметил, что ETH выглядит “чрезвычайно бычьим”, указав на прорыв из многолетнего симметричного треугольника. По оценке аналитика Crypto Rover, размеры этой фигуры указывают на потенциальную цель в $8 000. Нилеш Верма добавил, что ETH демонстрирует повторяющийся паттерн, уже наблюдавшийся в 2017 и 2020 годах, когда криптовалюта резко росла после повторного теста ключевого уровня поддержки. «Минимум $10 000, в бычьем сценарии – $16 000-$20 000 в течение ближайших 6-8 месяцев», – спрогнозировал Верма.

Futures liquidations surpass $361M, reflecting intense market activity. Crypto Fear and Greed Index rises to 62, signaling strong investor greed. On August 11, Bitcoin’s price surpassed $122,000, closing in on its near-month-long record high of $123,000 set on July 14, 2025. According to TradingView, Bitcoin was trading around $122,317. This price surge fueled a crypto market rally that triggered over $361.83 million in futures contract liquidations. Traders holding short positions lost approximately $215.75 million, while long position holders incurred losses of $146.09 million. Overall, 110,524 traders suffered liquidations, with Bitcoin and Ethereum traders accounting for roughly $115.29 million and $94.69 million, respectively. The crypto market's Fear and Greed Index rose to 62, indicating a prevalent mood of greed among investors—up 18 points from the prior week.

This renewed momentum reflects growing investor confidence, increased trading activity, and a bullish market environment. The high liquidation volume highlights both the volatility and the strong engagement of traders in the current rally phase. The elevated Fear and Greed Index suggests optimism but also signals caution, as greed-driven markets can precede corrections.

This particular event highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset movements and the crucial role of platforms like the Ethereum Name Service in the broader blockchain ecosystem. What Exactly Happened with This ENS Wallet Activity? In a notable move, an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) multi-signature wallet recently transferred a substantial amount of tokens. Reports from EmberCN on X indicate that 141,937 ENS tokens, valued at approximately $4.02 million, were moved within a short timeframe. This immediate and significant ENS wallet activity quickly became a point of discussion among crypto enthusiasts. Recipient 1: 72,437 ENS tokens were sent to FalconX. Recipient 2: 69,500 ENS tokens were transferred to Coinbase. Such large-scale transfers often signal strategic decisions by the wallet’s controllers, prompting questions about their underlying motivations and potential future actions. Why Does This Large ENS Transaction Matter? Understanding the implications of a large ENS transaction like this is crucial for anyone tracking the crypto market. When millions of dollars worth of tokens shift hands, especially to major exchanges, it can have various ripple effects. This particular transfer involves ENS, a fundamental component of the Ethereum ecosystem, which adds another layer of interest and importance. Firstly, the movement of tokens to exchanges like FalconX and Coinbase often precedes potential selling activity. While not always the case, it suggests that the tokens are being positioned for increased liquidity or distribution. Secondly, it showcases the operational security and capabilities of an Ethereum Name Service multi-signature wallet, designed to manage significant digital assets securely and efficiently. Analyzing the Crypto Exchange Movement to FalconX and Coinbase The choice of destinations—FalconX and Coinbase—is particularly noteworthy in this crypto exchange movement . Coinbase is a globally recognized retail and institutional exchange, known for its broad user base and strong regulatory compliance. FalconX, on the other hand, operates primarily as an institutional prime broker, facilitating large-volume trades for professional investors and institutions. This dual destination strategy could indicate several things about the wallet’s intentions: Diversification of Liquidity: Spreading tokens across different platforms might aim to minimize market impact if a large sale occurs. Strategic Partnerships: It could reflect ongoing relationships or specific trading agreements with these reputable platforms. Operational Efficiency: Utilizing established exchanges ensures efficient execution for such a significant ENS token transfer , allowing for swift action. The inherent transparency of blockchain allows us to observe these movements, even if the exact reasons behind them remain speculative. What Are the Broader Implications for Ethereum Name Service? The Ethereum Name Service is more than just a token; it’s a decentralized naming system for wallets, websites, and more on the Ethereum blockchain. This infrastructure is vital for making crypto more user-friendly and accessible. While this specific ENS wallet activity is a token transfer, it indirectly highlights the health and active management of assets associated with a key project in the decentralized space. Large movements of native tokens like ENS are often watched by the community as indicators of project health, potential development funding, or even shifts in governance strategies. For instance, if the funds are being moved to cover operational costs or to fund new initiatives, it could be a positive sign. Conversely, if it signals a large sell-off, it might prompt market adjustments and re-evaluations. The recent $4 million ENS token transfer to FalconX and Coinbase serves as a compelling reminder of the constant flow of value within the cryptocurrency landscape. Such significant crypto exchange movement events underscore the transparency of blockchain technology, allowing us to track substantial shifts in digital assets. While the precise motives behind this large ENS transaction remain speculative, its observation provides valuable insights into the strategic operations of major blockchain entities and their interaction with leading exchanges. As the Ethereum Name Service continues to evolve, keeping an eye on these on-chain activities remains essential for understanding market dynamics and potential future trends. Frequently Asked Questions About ENS Token Transfers Here are some common questions regarding significant cryptocurrency movements: What is an ENS token transfer? An ENS token transfer refers to the movement of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) tokens from one digital wallet address to another. These tokens are integral to the decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain. Why did the ENS wallet move tokens to FalconX and Coinbase? While the exact reasons are not publicly disclosed, moving tokens to major exchanges like FalconX and Coinbase often indicates an intention to increase liquidity, prepare for potential selling, or engage in strategic trading activities. This is a common crypto exchange movement strategy for large holders. What is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS)? The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to translate human-readable names (like ""yourname.eth"") into machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, making crypto interactions simpler. How do large crypto exchange movements impact the market? Large crypto exchange movement events can signal potential market shifts. If a large amount of tokens moves to an exchange, it might suggest an impending sell-off, which could put downward pressure on the token’s price. Conversely, movements from exchanges to private wallets might indicate long-term holding intentions. Is this ENS wallet activity a common occurrence? Significant ENS wallet activity , especially large transfers to exchanges, occurs periodically in the crypto space. While not an everyday event for every token, large holders and project treasuries often manage their assets through such transfers to optimize liquidity or fund operations.
