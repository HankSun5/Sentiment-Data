56006672,646680,1766098844,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56006672.jpeg,Mixed Signals for XRP as Price Weakness Collides With Bold Analyst Targets,https://bitcoinist.com/mixed-signals-xrp-as-price-weakness-analyst-target/,"XRP is closing out 2025 caught between two opposing forces. On one side, price action has weakened, technical indicators are flashing caution, and liquidity has thinned as the holidays approach. On the other hand, analysts continue to publish ambitious upside targets, while fresh narratives around utility, adoption, and yield generation keep the token in focus. The result is a market struggling to reconcile near-term pressure with longer-term expectations. After spending much of the year underperforming other large-cap cryptocurrencies, XRP has slipped below the closely watched $2 level. That breakdown has sharpened debate over whether the market is entering a deeper correction or simply extending a prolonged consolidation phase. XRP Price Structure Shows Growing Strain Technical analysts point to mounting downside risks. XRP has formed what some describe as a higher-timeframe double-top near the $3.30–$3.40 region, with momentum indicators rolling over. The $1.85–$1.90 zone is now acting as a critical support area. A confirmed break below that range could expose XRP to a deeper pullback toward the $1.60–$1.65 region, aligning with key Fibonacci retracement levels. Additional on-chain metrics add to the cautious tone. XRP continues to trade well above its realized price, a condition that in previous cycles has preceded mean-reversion pullbacks. Meanwhile, moving averages and momentum indicators, such as the MACD, remain tilted to the downside, reinforcing the view that sellers retain control in the short term. Analysts Split Between Caution and Optimism Despite the weak chart structure, some analysts argue that the broader narrative has not changed materially. Vincent Van Code has noted that while XRP’s price performance disappointed in 2025, there has been no clear fundamental shock to explain the decline. Legal clarity around Ripple, ongoing institutional interest, and XRPL development remain intact, suggesting the disconnect may be driven more by market structure and liquidity than by fundamentals. Others are more explicit with upside targets. Analyst Dark Defender , who previously identified the $1.88 support zone, argues that XRP has completed a corrective phase under Elliott Wave analysis. From that perspective, targets around $5.85 remain possible in the next major advance, though timing depends heavily on broader market conditions. Utility Narratives and Speculation Add Noise Beyond price charts, new narratives are complicating sentiment. Reports highlighting XRP-based yield strategies, including mining-related platforms, have circulated widely; however, these claims vary in transparency and risk, and are not directly tied to XRP’s core protocol. Separately, unconfirmed rumors suggesting that EA Sports may explore XRP for in-game payments have briefly reignited discussion around mass adoption, even as no official confirmation has emerged. XRP currently sits at an uncomfortable crossroads. Technical pressure is real, downside risks remain, and patience is being tested. At the same time, bold analyst targets and recurring adoption stories ensure the token remains one of the most closely watched assets heading into early 2026.

He said the faster team will take Americans back to the lunar surface for the first time in more than fifty years. He made the point during a Bloomberg TV interview on his first day, right after meeting President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. He said both companies understood the rule clearly and that the one that finishes first will carry US astronauts under the Artemis program. Isaacman juggling SpaceX, Blue Origin and delays at NASA SpaceX and Blue Origin already have contracts with NASA to develop their lunar landers. SpaceX holds more than $4 billion in NASA deals to move astronauts to the moon using its Starship spacecraft. That plan, at least for now, puts SpaceX in the lead. But this advantage is not locked in, because NASA’s former acting administrator Sean Duffy announced in October that the agency would “open up” the SpaceX contract to competition. He said he grew frustrated by delays in Starship’s timeline. Starship has hit several technical issues over the past year.Those setbacks have drawn critics who say the slow pace could allow China to land its astronauts on the moon before the United States. Jared made it clear that whichever lander becomes available first will be the one NASA uses to push forward the Artemis mission. Jared also founded Shift4 Payments Inc., and he becomes NASA’s leader at a time when the agency faces funding questions tied to proposals from both Congress and the White House. He pushed back on concerns and said NASA can work with either a $20 billion or $25 billion yearly budget, and that both numbers are meaningful enough to carry out the agency’s plans. Trump signs executive order for Artemis 2028 project Jared said Trump approved a new executive order during their meeting. The order restates the core of the Artemis program and tells NASA to return astronauts to the moon by 2028 and build a lunar base by 2030. Jared told Bloomberg that the order “takes things to a whole other scale.” He said NASA is not returning to the moon only to leave footprints. He said the goal is long-term infrastructure that supports science, economic activity, and national security interests. The order does more than that.It directs the government to remove the National Space Council and move its authority to the Office of Science and Technology Policy.That council was set up in 1989 to advise presidents on space policy. The order also launches work on next-generation missile-defense systems under Trump’s Golden Dome plan, which calls for new tools to find and track threats from low-Earth orbit to cislunar space. Artemis relies on Boeing’s Space Launch System and Lockheed Martin’s Orion capsule. The program is expected to cost $93 billion by 2025 and so far has flown only one mission. NASA has delayed the first Artemis landing several times, most recently pushing the target year to 2027. In July, Congress approved almost $10 billion for Artemis as part of Trump’s major tax and spending package. The money supports the fourth and fifth SLS flights that the administration once considered cutting in favor of cheaper commercial options.

XRP has not been immune to these conditions, as heightened volatility and broader macroeconomic pressures have weighed on prices. Despite this environment, several market observers argue that sharp intraday swings point to structural issues rather than purely organic trading activity. While price declines have unsettled many participants, others interpret the turbulence as a tactical opportunity. Within the XRP community, certain commentators maintain that abrupt moves are being driven by large players seeking to exploit leverage and liquidity, and that patient accumulation during these periods could be advantageous. Indicators Fueling Manipulation Claims Concerns around market conduct were amplified by observations shared by The Kobeissi Letter, a platform that monitors global capital markets. You can’t make this up: Bitcoin just surged +$3,000 in 1 hour and reclaimed $90,000 as $120 million worth of levered shorts were liquidated. Minutes later, $200 million worth of levered longs were liquidated, with Bitcoin now down to $86,000. That’s a $140 BILLION swing in… pic.twitter.com/R1KLZq6iqs — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 17, 2025 The group highlighted an unusual episode involving Bitcoin, where the asset recorded a rapid increase of roughly $3,000 within a single hour on December 17. During that window, Bitcoin moved from the high-$80,000 range to briefly trade above $90,000. This sudden advance triggered significant liquidations among traders positioned for downside movement, with losses estimated at over $120 million. Shortly after these positions were cleared, Bitcoin reversed direction and retreated sharply toward the mid-$80,000 range. According to The Kobeissi Letter, the entire sequence resulted in a dramatic swing in Bitcoin’s market capitalization, estimated at approximately $140 billion within two hours. Observers noted that such an abrupt expansion and contraction in valuation raised questions about whether the move was engineered to force liquidations, rather than reflecting a shift in long-term market sentiment. The scale of the fluctuation drew particular attention, as it exceeded the entire market capitalization of several major altcoins. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Impact on XRP Price Action The turbulence in Bitcoin markets quickly spread to other digital assets, including XRP. Although XRP’s market capitalization is significantly smaller, it still experienced notable volatility during the same timeframe. XRP rose from around $1.90 to nearly $2.00 within two hours before reversing course and falling below $1.90 shortly thereafter. This sequence translated into billions of dollars added to XRP’s valuation in a brief period, followed by an even larger contraction. Such rapid changes reinforced claims that liquidity-driven strategies employed by large trading entities may be influencing price behavior across multiple assets, not just Bitcoin. Some market participants referenced previous downturns as evidence of similar dynamics, arguing that sharp corrections have often coincided with periods of elevated leverage and thin order books. These episodes, they contend, tend to disadvantage retail traders while benefiting institutions capable of moving substantial capital. Community Response and Accumulation Strategy Against this backdrop, prominent XRP commentator Digital Asset Investor expressed a willingness to continue increasing his holdings during price weakness. He suggested that repeated volatility episodes reflect strategic actions by institutional players and indicated that he intends to take advantage of lower prices rather than reduce exposure. This perspective aligns with comments from other analysts who have previously encouraged accumulation during downturns. In recent months, several market watchers have stated that retracements below key psychological levels could offer renewed entry points for long-term investors who missed earlier opportunities. As of the latest data, XRP trades near the lower end of recent ranges, a development that some interpret as validating these earlier expectations. Nevertheless, analysts continue to emphasize that such views represent personal opinions rather than guarantees of future performance. While allegations of market manipulation remain unproven, the recent sequence of rapid price movements has intensified debate around trading practices in the crypto market. For certain XRP proponents, these conditions reinforce a long-term accumulation approach, even as uncertainty persists across the broader financial landscape.

Meta wants both models in the first half of 2026, according to Alexandr Wang, the company’s chief AI officer, during an internal Q&A with Chris Cox. Alexandr also said Meta is starting work on early world models, which means AI systems that learn by taking in visual data from their environment. Meta changed its whole AI structure in the summer.The company hired Alexandr to run a division called Meta Superintelligence Labs. Zuck then went on a hiring spree and grabbed more than twenty researchers from OpenAI. He built a group of over fifty people with deep AI skills. Meta is trying to load up on specialists because image generation is now one of the main battlegrounds between big model companies. Google and OpenAI models are going to be tough to compete with Meta released a video generator called Vibes in September. The tool was made with Midjourney. A few days later, OpenAI rolled out its own product, Sora, to keep up. The back-and-forth showed how fast each company reacts. Google had already kicked off another wave earlier in the year with Nano Banana, which boosted monthly users of Gemini from 450 million in July to more than 650 million by late October. That jump placed even more pressure on the other players. The tension rose again in November when Google launched the third version of Gemini.Right after that, people inside OpenAI said Sam Altman declared a “code red” to push the company to win back top scores on model tests.OpenAI then released a new version of ChatGPT Images. Sam later met journalists and said image creation is now one of the biggest reasons users return to AI apps, calling it a “sticky” feature. The message was clear: the image fight is not slowing down. Google announced Gemini 3 Flash on Wednesday. The model is built to run faster and at lower cost, and it is meant for wide use. It carries many of the reasoning skills found in Gemini 3 Pro but in a smaller system. The whole plan is simple. Instead of keeping the best tools locked behind enterprise plans, Google wants these models inside mass-market apps. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said, “With this release, Gemini 3’s next-generation intelligence is now rolling out to everyone across our products including Gemini app + AI Mode in Search. Devs can build with it in the Gemini API, Google AI Studio, Gemini CLI, and Google Antigravity and enterprises can get it in Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Tech|Meta,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-18 23:54:43

The news that Synthetix returns to Ethereum mainnet marks a pivotal moment, suggesting that the foundational blockchain has overcome its past struggles and is ready to reclaim its throne for high-performance financial applications. Let’s explore what this homecoming means for traders, the DeFi ecosystem, and the future of on-chain derivatives. Why is Synthetix Returning to Ethereum Now? For years, the narrative around Ethereum centered on high gas fees and network congestion, pushing many DeFi projects to seek alternatives. Synthetix, a leader in derivatives trading, was no exception. However, the landscape has transformed. According to the project’s founder, the extreme congestion that once plagued Ethereum has been “significantly resolved.” This isn’t just about lower fees; it’s about proven capacity. The founder emphasized that Ethereum now possesses the robust infrastructure needed to support the complex, high-volume world of synthetic assets reliably. What Does This Mean for DeFi and Derivatives Trading? The decision for Synthetix returns to Ethereum mainnet is a powerful vote of confidence. It tells us that after a period of exploration across various Layer 2 and alternative networks, core financial innovation is recentering on Ethereum’s unparalleled security and liquidity. For users, this consolidation offers significant benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: Unifying activity on the mainnet pools liquidity, potentially leading to better prices and tighter spreads for synthetic asset traders. Simplified User Experience: No more bridging assets between chains. Users can interact with Synthetix directly within the vast Ethereum ecosystem. Stronger Security: Ethereum mainnet remains the most secure and battle-tested environment for managing valuable financial contracts. This move could trigger a domino effect, encouraging other DeFi derivatives platforms to reaffirm their commitment to the Ethereum base layer. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the return is a cause for optimism, it doesn’t mean the journey is without its watchpoints. The success of this move hinges on Ethereum’s ability to maintain its improved performance as adoption grows. Furthermore, Synthetix must successfully reintegrate its sophisticated system, ensuring a seamless experience for stakers (SNX holders) and traders alike. However, the opportunities are immense. A high-performance Synthetix on Ethereum mainnet could act as a catalyst, attracting more institutional interest in on-chain derivatives. It solidifies Ethereum’s position not just as a settlement layer, but as a live, functioning global financial marketplace. Conclusion: A New Chapter for On-Chain Finance The announcement that Synthetix returns to Ethereum mainnet is more than a technical migration; it’s a symbolic homecoming. It underscores Ethereum’s remarkable evolution and resilience. For the DeFi community, it represents a maturation—a move towards consolidating innovation on the most secure and liquid foundation available. This strategic pivot by a leading protocol could very well mark the beginning of a new, more unified and powerful era for decentralized derivatives trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is Synthetix? A: Synthetix is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to mint and trade synthetic assets (synths). These synths track the value of real-world assets like currencies, commodities, and cryptocurrencies, all on the blockchain. Q: Why did Synthetix leave Ethereum in the first place? A: Primarily due to high transaction fees (gas costs) and network congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, which made frequent trading and interactions prohibitively expensive for users. Q: What has changed on Ethereum to allow this return? A: Key upgrades, particularly “The Merge” to Proof-of-Stake and the implementation of proto-danksharding (EIP-4844), have significantly improved network capacity and reduced base transaction costs, resolving much of the prior congestion. Q: Will my SNX tokens or synths be affected? A: The protocol will manage the migration. Users should follow official Synthetix announcements for specific instructions, but typically, such returns are designed to be smooth for token holders. Q: Is this good for the price of SNX? A> While price predictions are uncertain, the return to Ethereum mainnet is fundamentally positive. It could increase protocol usage, attract more liquidity, and strengthen SNX’s value proposition within the core DeFi ecosystem. Q: Does this mean Synthetix is abandoning other chains like Optimism? A> Not necessarily. Many protocols operate a multi-chain strategy. The return to mainnet likely means Ethereum will host the primary, canonical version, while Layer 2 solutions may still be used for specific scaling or experimental features.

Since early October, declining investor sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty have weighed heavily on cryptocurrencies, with the total market capitalization falling by more than $1.3 trillion during this period. XRP has followed this trend, giving up tens of billions of dollars in market value as selling pressure intensified. After managing to stay above the psychologically important $2 level for much of the decline, XRP eventually slipped below that support in mid-December. The loss of this level accelerated downside movement and reinforced bearish sentiment. Despite this, some market analysts argue that the current structure does not necessarily signal long-term weakness. Instead, they believe XRP may be entering a phase that has historically preceded strong recoveries. Every cycle, when $XRP breaks below the 50-week SMA and stays there for roughly 50–84 days, a strong rally has followed. History: – 2017: 70 days below → +211% – 2021: 49 days below → +70% – 2024: 84 days below → +850% – Now: 70 days below the 50-week SMA Right now, XRP… pic.twitter.com/Ii5ewdZjQu — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 17, 2025 XRP’s Position Relative to the 50-Week Moving Average According to market analyst Steph, XRP’s recent behavior around the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) deserves close attention. This indicator is widely used to assess long-term market trends. XRP has now spent several consecutive weeks trading below this level, a condition that typically reflects sustained selling pressure. However, historical chart data suggests that extended periods beneath the 50-week SMA have often been followed by sharp upward moves. Steph’s analysis indicates that XRP has previously remained below this moving average for periods ranging from roughly 50 to 84 days before staging notable recoveries. These past instances form the basis of current speculation that XRP may again be approaching a turning point. Historical Precedents Since 2018 Weekly price data shows that this setup has appeared multiple times over the past several years. Following XRP’s major decline from its early 2018 peak, the asset spent several weeks trading below the 50-week SMA during the middle of that year. After establishing a low during that period, XRP later recorded a substantial rebound within a few months. A comparable pattern emerged again toward the end of 2021. XRP dropped below the same long-term average and remained there for several weeks before recovering in early 2022. While the resulting price increase was more modest than in 2018, it still represented a meaningful recovery from the local low. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 More recently, a similar structure was developed in 2024. XRP fell below the 50-week SMA and stayed under it for nearly three months. When prices eventually recovered, the rally that followed was significantly stronger than previous instances, pushing XRP to new cycle highs. This episode has become a key reference point for analysts assessing the current market phase. Assessing the Current Setup As of now, XRP has been trading below the 50-week SMA for approximately 10 consecutive weekly candles, equating to just over two months. If the duration aligns with prior cases, analysts suggest the asset could remain under pressure for several more weeks before a clearer trend reversal emerges. Some projections estimate that matching the longest historical duration would extend this phase toward the end of the year. Based on prior percentage gains, speculative price targets vary widely. Analysts emphasize that these figures are theoretical and depend heavily on market conditions, liquidity, and broader investor sentiment. Even so, the repetition of similar technical structures continues to attract attention from long-term traders. Additional technical indicators have also entered the discussion. Analyst Chart Nerd has noted that momentum tools such as the Relative Strength Index and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence suggest selling pressure may be easing. These signals are often associated with stabilization phases, though they do not guarantee immediate price appreciation. While XRP remains under technical strain, historical data show that comparable periods of weakness have previously preceded strong recoveries. Analysts caution that past performance does not ensure future results, but the recurring interaction with the 50-week SMA remains a focal point for market participants monitoring XRP’s next major move.

56008517,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=867974,1766102415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56008517.jpeg,Legendary Bitcoin OG Deepens Ethereum Bet Despite Losses Exceeding $70 Million,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/legendary-bitcoin-og-deepens-ethereum-bet-despite-losses-exceeding-70-million/,"Ethereum is facing renewed selling pressure as the broader market struggles with fear, uncertainty, and growing bearish expectations. After weeks of weakness, many analysts are now openly calling for a prolonged bear market stretching into 2026, arguing that Ethereum remains below key structural levels and lacks strong momentum. Related Reading: From Cycles To Continuity: Why Bitcoin’s 4-Year Pattern May Be Breaking Bulls are attempting to defend the $2,800 mark, a level that has become critical for maintaining short-term confidence, but price action continues to reflect hesitation rather than conviction. Volatility remains elevated, and market sentiment is dominated by caution rather than optimism. Against this fragile backdrop, on-chain data reveals a notable divergence between price action and behavior from experienced market participants. According to data from Hyperdash, the Bitcoin OG, known for shorting the market during the October 10 crash, has once again increased his exposure to Ethereum. This trader, widely followed for his high-conviction and well-timed positioning, just added another 12,406 ETH to his long positions, signaling confidence at current price levels despite the prevailing bearish narrative. While retail sentiment weakens and analysts debate deeper downside scenarios, strategic accumulation by seasoned players suggests that Ethereum may be approaching a decisive phase. Whether this marks early positioning ahead of a recovery or a high-risk bet in a deteriorating market remains the key question ahead. A High-Conviction Bet Under Pressure Lookonchain reports that the Bitcoin OG continues to hold substantial, high-conviction positions across multiple assets, despite the ongoing market weakness. According to the latest data, his current exposure includes 203,341 ETH valued at approximately $577.5 million, 1,000 BTC worth around $87 million, and 250,000 SOL valued near $30.7 million. This level of concentration highlights a willingness to endure significant volatility rather than reduce risk in an increasingly uncertain environment. That conviction, however, has come with meaningful drawdowns. The wallet is now down more than $70 million from its peak. At one point, unrealized profits exceeded $120 million, but recent price declines have reduced that figure to less than $30 million. The swing illustrates how quickly market conditions can shift, even for traders with a strong track record and well-timed entries in the past. From a broader market perspective, this positioning reflects a sharp contrast between sentiment and behavior. While many participants have turned defensive and analysts debate the likelihood of a prolonged bear market, this wallet remains heavily exposed, suggesting a belief that current levels may still offer asymmetric upside. At the same time, the drawdown serves as a clear reminder that size and conviction do not remove risk in a structurally fragile market.

Price is currently trading below the 50-week moving average and hovering near the 100-week MA, a level that historically acts as an important inflection point for medium-term trend direction. The failure to hold above the short-term averages confirms that sellers have regained control of the structure. From a trend perspective, ETH remains above the rising 200-week moving average, which continues to define the long-term bullish framework. However, the widening gap between the faster and slower averages has started to compress, signaling a transition phase rather than trend continuation. Volume has expanded on down weeks, reinforcing the idea that recent downside moves are driven by active distribution rather than passive consolidation. Related Reading: XRP Liquidity Dries Up: Futures Buy Volume On Binance Falls from $5.8B to $250M The $2,800 area now represents a critical demand zone. A sustained hold above this level would suggest that the correction is a controlled pullback within a broader range. Conversely, a weekly close below it would expose ETH to a deeper retracement toward the $2,400–$2,500 region, where the 200-week MA and prior consolidation converge. Overall, the chart reflects a market caught between long-term structural support and short-term bearish momentum. Ethereum needs a decisive reclaim of the 50-week moving average to neutralize downside risk and restore confidence in trend continuation.

56008518,646635,1766102417,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56008518.jpeg,Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Make Coinbase’s List In Latest Product Launch,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shib-in-coinbase-list/,"Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have secured a place in Coinbase’s latest product expansion, a notable moment for meme coins within the regulated crypto derivatives market. Coinbase confirmed the launch of US perpetual-style futures trading in an announcement on X for a range of altcoins on Coinbase Derivatives, available around the clock. Coinbase Expands Derivatives Access With Meme Coins Included According to a recent announcement on X , US Perpetual-Style Futures are now live on Coinbase Derivatives. Among a lineup dominated by established layer-one networks and infrastructure tokens, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu stood out as the only meme-based assets included, showing how these tokens are being positioned within institutional-grade trading environments. The new product rollout allows both retail and institutional traders to access US-regulated perpetual-style futures through approved Futures Commission Merchants. Coinbase is effectively placing both meme coins alongside assets such as Cardano, Chainlink, and Polkadot in its derivatives ecosystem with its extension of this offering to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. In the case of Shiba Inu, the newly listed futures contract comes with a 1,000x multiplier. This means that demand for structured exposure to these leading meme coins has grown beyond spot trading, with traders increasingly seeking hedging and leverage tools tied to them. What This Means For DOGE And SHIB Moving Forward Recent price action for both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has offered little encouragement. Both cryptocurrencies are currently locked in an extended declining price action and low whale activity, except for a spike in whale activity witnessed by Shiba Inu earlier in the month. This occurred in tandem with a +1.06 trillion net change to the amount of SHIB on exchanges, which is also another sign of the intense selling pressure surrounding the meme coin. However, behind the scenes, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu might be working towards a bullish momentum in their fundamentals. For one, the availability of perpetual-style futures for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu could add to how traders interact with these assets. Futures markets often attract higher trading volumes and more sophisticated participants, which can influence price discovery and volatility patterns. As the largest crypto exchange in the United States, Coinbase provides the best regulated gateway for institutional traders. Therefore, this development may increase institutional visibility for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in the US market while also providing traders with new ways to manage risk. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.000007523, down by 3% in the past 24 hours. Notably, the meme coin is currently trading at its lowest price point in over a year. Dogecoin is also trading at its lowest price point in over a year. The king of meme coins is currently trading at $0.1256, down by 3.2% in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|altcoins|Cardano|chainlink|coinbase|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Futures Commission Merchants|meme coins|Polkadot|shib|Shiba Inu,EN,0,0,DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-19 00:00:17

Whale Alert, the blockchain tracking service, reported that a colossal 80,000 ETH was transferred from an unknown wallet directly to a Beacon Depositor. Valued at approximately $226 million, this single move has sent ripples through the crypto community, prompting urgent questions about its origin and intent. What Does This Massive 80,000 ETH Transfer Mean? When 80,000 ETH is transferred in one go, it’s not a routine transaction. It’s a statement. The destination—a Beacon Depositor—is a critical clue. This address is specifically designed to receive Ether for staking on the Ethereum 2.0 network. Therefore, this transfer strongly suggests a major player, or ‘whale,’ is committing a vast fortune to secure the network and earn staking rewards. This action demonstrates profound confidence in Ethereum’s long-term proof-of-stake model. Who Could Be Behind the $226 Million Whale Move? The sender’s identity remains a mystery, hidden behind an ‘unknown wallet.’ However, we can analyze the possibilities. The sheer scale points to a deep-pocketed entity. Potential actors include: A Crypto Investment Fund: Institutional capital moving into staking for yield. A Large Exchange: Consolidating user funds for institutional staking services. An Ultra-Wealthy Individual: A private whale making a strategic, long-term bet on Ethereum. The anonymity fuels speculation, but the destination reveals a clear strategic direction: staking. Why Is Staking 80,000 ETH a Big Deal for the Network? Committing 80,000 ETH transferred to staking is a powerful vote of confidence. It provides several key benefits to the Ethereum ecosystem: Enhanced Security: This large stake makes the network more expensive and difficult to attack. Increased Decentralization: While large, it adds another significant validator to the pool. Price Stability Signal: Staked ETH is locked up, reducing immediate sell pressure and signaling long-term holder belief. This move goes beyond personal gain; it actively strengthens the infrastructure of the entire network. What Are the Risks and Rewards for the Whale? Staking such a monumental sum is not without its challenges. The whale now faces a classic risk-reward scenario. On the reward side, they will earn consistent staking yields, currently estimated between 3-5% annually on their 80,000 ETH . However, the primary risk is illiquidity. Staked ETH is locked until a future network upgrade enables withdrawals. This means the $226 million is committed for the foreseeable future, exposing the holder to market volatility without the option for a quick exit. How Should Retail Investors Interpret This Signal? For everyday crypto enthusiasts, this 80,000 ETH transferred event is a masterclass in market signaling. You don’t lock up a quarter-billion dollars in an asset you believe is failing. This whale’s action suggests a bullish long-term outlook on Ethereum’s value and the sustainability of its staking economy. However, it’s crucial to remember this is one data point. Smart investors should see it as a strong, positive indicator to be weighed alongside broader market trends, not as a sole trigger for investment decisions. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Ethereum Staking The transfer of 80,000 ETH to a Beacon Depositor is more than just a large number on a screen. It is a definitive, capital-intensive endorsement of Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake. This whale has placed a $226 million bet on the network’s future security and success. While the identity remains secret, the message is transparent: institutional-grade confidence in Ethereum is not just growing; it’s being actively staked. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Beacon Depositor in Ethereum? A: A Beacon Depositor is a smart contract address on the Ethereum network specifically designed to receive and process Ether that users want to ‘stake’ or lock up to help secure the newer, proof-of-stake Ethereum blockchain (often called Ethereum 2.0). Q2: Why would someone transfer 80,000 ETH to stake it? A: The primary motivations are to earn passive staking rewards (like interest) and to support the security and operation of the Ethereum network. For a holder of such a large amount, the annual rewards can be substantial. Q3: Can the whale access this 80,000 ETH now? A> No. Once ETH is staked via a Beacon Depositor, it is locked and cannot be withdrawn or traded until a future Ethereum upgrade enables staking withdrawals. This is a long-term commitment. Q4: Does this large transfer affect the price of ETH? A: It can have an indirect effect. By locking up a large supply (80,000 ETH), it reduces the amount of ETH readily available for sale on exchanges, which can help reduce selling pressure. It also signals strong holder confidence, which can influence market sentiment. Q5: What is Whale Alert? A: Whale Alert is a popular blockchain tracking and analytics service that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions (typically over $1 million) and reports them publicly via social media, providing transparency into major market movements. Q6: Is staking ETH safe? A: Staking on the official Ethereum network is generally considered safe from a protocol perspective. However, it involves locking funds for an indeterminate period and carries smart contract risk (though the deposit contract is heavily audited) and the market risk of ETH price fluctuation during the lock-up period.

White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks posted to X, noting that Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and Agriculture Committee Chair John Boozman had confirmed that the bipartisan crypto bill will reach the Senate next month. ”We are closer than ever to passing the landmark crypto market structure legislation that President Trump has called for. We look forward to finishing the job in January!” Sacks says negotiators are hoping the House-approved CLARITY Act will be sent to the Senate for debate and amendment in January, the official start date of the legislative process, ahead of a potential floor vote. The announcement arrives as lawmakers and industry leaders scramble to develop a common regulatory framework for digital asset markets. Sacks’ revelation comes as the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) says it is granting banks the ability to conduct riskless principal transactions related to crypto assets. TradFi banks that had been dipping their toes in via pilots now have the approval to go for full-scale crypto integration. The OCC has, over time, reversed the cautionary approach it took between 2021 and 2024, when it imposed strict guardrails and joined the Fed in warning about crypto risks, such as liquidity and volatility. According to the letter from the OCC, traditional banks are explicitly permitted to engage in riskless principal crypto-asset transactions, where the banks act as matched intermediaries in trades without the need to hold assets. As it stands, only a few purely crypto banks , such as Anchorage Digital, hold OCC charters. With approval, more hybrids could emerge soon. CFTC set to take lead as CLARITY Act redraws U.S. crypto rulebook The CLARITY Act, now enacted by the House in July 2025 (H.R. 3633), will grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) a key regulatory role across most digital assets. It also aims to establish clearer meanings for “digital commodities” and reduce the regulatory perimeter that has kept the industry in legal limbo for years. Supporters of the bill argue that it will reduce regulatory uncertainty for crypto firms by establishing clearer compliance pathways, encourage innovation, and strengthen investor protections. “The CLARITY Act might offer the clear rules of the road that the industry in America needs to innovate,” Sacks said, underscoring the Biden and Trump administrations’ mutual focus on strengthening American competitiveness in the emerging markets. While the House delivered the CLARITY Act on a bipartisan basis over the past year, the Senate has constructed its own drafts of legislation. The Senate Agriculture and Senate Banking Committees have circulated drafts of discussions similar to those in the House legislation, but on topics such as decentralized finance and anti-money laundering standards. U.S. regulators continued to work on the CLARITY Act during the record 43-day government shutdown in October and November, meeting with executives from companies such as Coinbase, Ripple, Kraken, Circle, and tech-focused venture capital firms a16z and Paradigm . Industry cheers clearer crypto rules Cryptocurrency companies and investors have generally welcomed signs that Congress is leaning toward clearer regulatory guardrails. Industry advocates have also stated that a firm market structure framework could help mitigate some of the legal uncertainty that has prompted innovation abroad, as well as deter institutions from engaging in such activities. Yet a handful of consumers and investor watchdog groups have argued that a faster stream towards regulation should also guarantee firm protection from fraud and market manipulation, especially in the area of decentralized finance (DeFi), where regulatory limits are often unclear.

This significant event, sourced from leading exchange Deribit, has the potential to influence short-term price volatility and trader sentiment across the entire crypto landscape. Understanding the mechanics and implications of this expiration is crucial for any informed market participant. What Does Today’s Massive Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean? At 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 19th, a critical deadline arrives for thousands of derivative contracts. Options give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a predetermined price. When these contracts expire, it forces a final settlement, often leading to increased trading activity as market makers hedge their positions. The sheer scale of today’s Bitcoin options expiry makes it a focal point for analysts. Simultaneously, Ethereum options valued at $460 million will also expire, adding another layer of complexity to the market’s movements. However, the spotlight remains firmly on Bitcoin due to the staggering notional value involved. Decoding the Key Metrics: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain To gauge market sentiment, experts look at two vital metrics from the expiring batch. First is the put/call ratio. For today’s Bitcoin options , this ratio is 0.77. A ratio below 1 indicates more call options (bets on price increases) than put options (bets on decreases), suggesting a generally bullish sentiment among options traders. In contrast, the Ethereum batch has a put/call ratio of 1.06, showing a slightly more cautious or bearish tilt for ETH. The second critical metric is the “max pain” price. This is the strike price at which the maximum number of options would expire worthless, causing the most financial loss to options buyers. For Bitcoin, the max pain is $88,000, and for Ethereum, it’s $3,100. Market forces often, but not always, gravitate toward this price at expiry as sellers try to minimize their payouts. How Could This Expiry Impact Bitcoin’s Price Action? While options expiry does not directly dictate long-term price trends, it can create short-term volatility and liquidity events. Here’s what traders are watching for: Increased Volatility: The hours leading up to and following the expiry can see heightened price swings as large positions are closed or rolled over. Pin Risk: The price may experience “pinning” near the max pain price ($88,000 for BTC) as the expiry deadline approaches. Gamma Exposure: Market makers who sold these options will adjust their Bitcoin hedge positions, which can amplify price moves in either direction. Therefore, retail traders should be prepared for potential choppiness. However, it’s essential to remember that this is a scheduled event, and its effects are typically absorbed by the market within a day or two. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Navigating an options expiry requires a calm and strategic approach. Instead of reacting to every tick, consider these insights: Don’t Chase the Noise: Short-term volatility is not a reliable indicator of long-term direction. Avoid making impulsive trades based solely on expiry-related moves. Watch Key Levels: Monitor the max pain prices ($88,000 for BTC, $3,100 for ETH) as potential short-term support or resistance zones. Review Your Strategy: Use this event as a reminder to check your own portfolio’s risk exposure and ensure your stop-losses are in place. In conclusion, the expiry of $2.65 billion in Bitcoin options is a significant market event that highlights the growing sophistication and scale of the crypto derivatives space. While it may stir short-term turbulence, the underlying market fundamentals remain the primary driver for Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Informed traders who understand these mechanics can better position themselves to navigate the waves rather than be swept away by them. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are Bitcoin options? A: Bitcoin options are financial derivatives that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a specific price on or before a certain date. They are used for hedging risk or speculating on price movements. Q: What does a put/call ratio of 0.77 mean? A: A put/call ratio of 0.77 means there are 77 put options for every 100 call options set to expire. This indicates that, among this batch of options, more traders were betting on a price increase (calls) than a decrease (puts), suggesting bullish sentiment. Q: What is the “max pain” price? A: The max pain price is the strike price at which the total financial loss for all options buyers (of both calls and puts) is maximized at expiration. It’s a theoretical level where the most options expire worthless. Q: Do options expiries always cause a big price move? A> Not always. While they can increase volatility due to hedging activity, the effect is often short-lived. The market usually anticipates these scheduled events, and major price movements depend on broader market conditions. Q: Where does the $2.65B data come from? A: The data is reported by Deribit, which is the world’s largest cryptocurrency options exchange by volume and open interest. Their metrics are widely watched as a benchmark for the market. Q: Should I change my long-term investment strategy because of this expiry? A> Generally, no. Options expiries are short-term technical events. Long-term investment decisions should be based on fundamental analysis, project development, and macroeconomic factors, not single derivative expiry dates.

The latest reading from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index confirms it. Sitting at a mere 16, this crucial sentiment gauge has plunged deeper into ‘extreme fear’ territory. For investors, this number is more than just a statistic—it’s a powerful signal flashing in the emotional storm of the market. Let’s decode what this extreme reading truly means and, more importantly, how you can respond. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Now? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index just dropped to 16, a one-point fall from the previous day. This firmly places market psychology in the ‘extreme fear’ zone. Think of this index as the market’s emotional heartbeat. It ranges from 0 (maximum fear) to 100 (maximum greed). A score of 16 is a stark indicator that negative sentiment is overwhelming traders and investors. This pervasive fear often creates opportunities, but it also signals high risk. Understanding the mechanics behind this number is your first step to smarter decisions. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This index isn’t a guess; it’s a data-driven composite. Alternative.me compiles it using six key market factors. Each factor gives us a piece of the overall sentiment puzzle. Here is the breakdown: Volatility (25%): Sharp price swings, especially downward, increase fear. Market Volume (25%): High sell-off volume signals panic. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of discussions on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct polls of market participant sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A flight to Bitcoin often indicates a ‘safe-haven’ fear trade. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’ spikes during fear. Therefore, the current score of 16 reflects a perfect storm where most of these metrics are flashing red. Should You Buy When There’s Extreme Fear in Crypto? The famous Warren Buffett quote, ‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,’ is often cited in crypto circles. A low Crypto Fear & Greed Index can signal a potential buying opportunity for long-term believers. Historically, periods of extreme fear have preceded significant market rebounds. However, this is not a guaranteed ‘buy’ signal. It simply means assets may be oversold from an emotional standpoint. You must pair this data with your own research, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Never invest based on sentiment alone. Actionable Insights for Navigating Market Fear Seeing a 16 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be unsettling. Here is how to channel that information into a strategy: Review, Don’t React: Use this time to review your portfolio’s fundamentals, not to make panic sells. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): If you believe in the long-term thesis, consider spreading buys over time to average your entry price. Secure Your Holdings: Ensure your assets are in secure wallets. Fear-driven times can see increased phishing and scam activity. Set Alerts: Watch for a sustained rise in the index as an early sign of sentiment improvement. Remember, the index measures crowd emotion. Your goal is to understand the crowd, not necessarily follow it. The Bottom Line on Today’s Crypto Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 16 is a clear snapshot of a market gripped by anxiety. While it highlights short-term pain and volatility, it also provides a valuable contrarian data point for disciplined investors. The key takeaway is to use this tool as a gauge of market psychology, not as a crystal ball. By separating emotion from analysis, you can make clearer decisions whether you choose to wait, accumulate, or simply hold steady. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 16 mean? A: A score of 16 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’ in the market. It suggests that negative sentiment and panic selling are currently dominant among investors. Q: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is compiled and published by the data provider Alternative.me. It has become a widely referenced benchmark for crypto market sentiment. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time look at shifting market emotions. Q: Is it safe to buy cryptocurrency when the index shows extreme fear? A> It can present opportunities, as prices may be oversold. However, ‘extreme fear’ can also precede further declines. It should be one factor in a broader, research-based investment strategy, not a standalone signal. Q: Has the index been this low before? A: Yes. The index has hit single digits during major crypto winters, such as the end of 2018 and mid-2022. These periods were followed by eventual recoveries, though timing is unpredictable. Q: Does the index predict Bitcoin price? A> No, it does not predict price. It measures current sentiment, which is a driver of price volatility. It is a complementary tool for understanding market psychology. Share Your Thoughts Does the ‘extreme fear’ reading change your outlook on the market? Share this article with your network on Twitter or LinkedIn to discuss whether this is a moment of danger or opportunity.

The issue centers on a proposed “de minimis” tax exemption, a rule meant to spare small crypto payments from capital gains taxes. Under current IRS guidance, digital assets are treated as property. That means every purchase made with crypto, even a cup of coffee, counts as a taxable event that requires tracking cost basis and reporting gains or losses. Supporters of the exemption say this framework makes daily use impractical and discourages crypto from functioning as money. Bitcoin Groups Warn of Flawed Crypto Tax Exemption The debate intensified this week after representatives of the Bitcoin Policy Institute, a nonprofit advocacy group, said lawmakers are considering limiting the exemption to stablecoins only. Conner Brown, the group’s head of strategy, said on X that limiting a de minimis exemption to stablecoins would be a “severe mistake,” arguing that it would exclude ordinary Bitcoin payments from relief while favoring assets that rarely generate capital gains in the first place. I’m hearing very concerning news out of Capitol Hill today. De Minimis tax legislation may be limited to only stablecoins, leaving everyday Bitcoin transactions without an exemption. This would be a severe mistake. BPI will be publishing a response. Stay tuned. — Conner Brown (@BitcoinConner) December 17, 2025 The idea behind the exemption is straightforward, allowing small personal crypto transactions to be excluded from capital gains reporting, similar to how foreign currency transactions are treated. Most proposals have suggested a per-transaction threshold of around $300, paired with an annual cap of roughly $5,000 in total tax-free gains. The concern raised by Bitcoin advocates is that recent drafts or negotiations may narrow the scope of the exemption to stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a steady price , usually pegged to the U.S. dollar, which means most transactions do not produce capital gains. Critics argue that granting them a de minimis exemption offers little practical relief while leaving Bitcoin users facing the same reporting burden. Why would you even need a de minimis tax exemption for stablecoins? They don't change in value. This is nonsensical. The wealth effect that would be unleashed via a de minimis tax exemption for bitcoin would be material. It should be the sole focus. Stablecoins shouldn't even… https://t.co/FS5JW8vhTB — Marty Bent (@MartyBent) December 18, 2025 Some commentators have questioned the logic of prioritizing stablecoins. Marty Bent, founder of media outlet Truth for the Commoner, wrote on X that stablecoins “don’t change in value,” making a small-gain exemption unnecessary. Can Bitcoin Be Used Like Cash? Lummis Thinks Taxes Are the Problem Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming has been one of the most vocal supporters of the idea. In July, she introduced legislation proposing a $300 exemption for crypto transactions, along with a $5,000 annual limit. Her proposal also included exemptions for digital assets donated to charities and tax deferral for crypto earned through mining or staking. Lummis has long argued that the exemption would make Bitcoin practical for everyday use, instead of something people are forced to treat only as a long-term holding. That argument resurfaced in October when Block founder Jack Dorsey pressed lawmakers to lift tax rules that make daily Bitcoin payments difficult. Lummis replied publicly, saying she was working on the issue and urging supporters to speak up. @SenLummis has responded to @jack 's call for a Bitcoin tax exemption for small transactions, stating she is ""Working on it."" #CryptoTax #Bitcoin https://t.co/6S4GtW7Vpf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 9, 2025 The exchange put fresh focus on a problem the crypto industry has raised for years. Bitcoin was introduced as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Over time, however, transaction fees, slow settlement, and tax obligations have pushed most users toward holding rather than spending it. As discussions continue, Congress appears closer than it has been in years to revisiting crypto tax rules. In December, Representative Max Miller, who sits on the House Ways and Means Committee, said a draft bill on digital asset taxation has already circulated among lawmakers and could advance before the August 2026 recess. U.S. lawmakers target August 2026 for a comprehensive crypto tax bill to clarify reporting, staking, and small-transaction rules. #CryptoTax #CryptoNews #Blockchain https://t.co/Gr8rKi9NF6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 10, 2025 Starting in 2026, the IRS plans to introduce new reporting rules , including 1099-DA forms from centralized exchanges, giving tax authorities a clearer picture of crypto activity.

Onchain data reveals this early holder deposited a colossal 5,152 BTC, worth approximately $440 million, to the Binance exchange. This single action by a Bitcoin OG immediately raises critical questions about market sentiment and potential price implications for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Who Is This Mysterious Bitcoin OG? The entity, identified by the address ‘1011short’, represents the classic profile of a Bitcoin OG. These are the early believers who accumulated Bitcoin long before it became a mainstream asset. According to reports from Onchain Lens, this particular whale isn’t just a Bitcoin holder. The address also maintains significant long positions in Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), painting a picture of a diversified but currently pressured crypto investor. Notably, the portfolio shows an unrealized loss of $76.6 million, adding a layer of intrigue to the massive Binance deposit. Why Would a Bitcoin OG Move $440M to an Exchange? When a Bitcoin OG of this magnitude moves funds, the market pays attention. Such a large deposit to a centralized exchange like Binance typically signals one of a few intentions. The immediate assumption is often preparation for a sale, which can exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. However, the reasons can be more nuanced. Let’s break down the potential motives behind this whale’s move: Profit-Taking or Loss Mitigation: The OG might be locking in gains from earlier prices or seeking to cut the $76.6 million unrealized loss on other holdings. Portfolio Rebalancing: Moving assets to exchange wallets is often the first step in reallocating a portfolio, possibly shifting weight between BTC, ETH, and SOL. Use of Exchange Services: The funds could be destined for Binance’s earn products, staking, or as collateral for lending. OTC Deal Preparation: Large holders frequently use exchanges to facilitate private, over-the-counter trades to minimize market impact. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Market? The action of this Bitcoin OG serves as a powerful on-chain signal. While a single transaction doesn’t dictate market direction, it provides valuable insight into the behavior of major players. The fact that this early adopter chose to move such a significant sum to a liquid exchange suggests a potential shift in strategy. For retail investors, monitoring these flows is crucial. It highlights the importance of on-chain analytics in understanding market dynamics beyond just price charts. Therefore, while concerning on the surface, it’s a data point that requires context from broader market trends. How to Interpret Whale Movements Like a Pro Seeing a Bitcoin OG move half a billion dollars can be alarming. However, savvy investors know to look deeper. First, check if this is part of a larger trend. Are other OGs moving funds? Second, analyze exchange net flows. Is Binance seeing more deposits than withdrawals overall? Third, consider the macro context. Is the move likely related to broader financial conditions or Bitcoin-specific news? By asking these questions, you move from reactive speculation to informed analysis. In conclusion, the $440 million deposit by a Bitcoin OG is a stark reminder of the influence early holders still wield. It underscores the market’s sensitivity to whale activity and the critical role of transparency through on-chain data. While the short-term price impact remains to be seen, the event reinforces a key lesson: in crypto, watching the wallets of the pioneers can be as important as watching the charts. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin OG? A: “OG” stands for “Original Gangster” or “Original.” In crypto, a Bitcoin OG refers to an early investor or miner who acquired Bitcoin in its first few years, often before 2013. Q2: Does a large deposit to Binance always mean a sell-off? A: Not always. While it increases the likelihood, large deposits can also be for trading, staking, using financial services, or preparing for an OTC (Over-The-Counter) deal that may not immediately hit the public order books. Q3: How can I track whale movements like this? A: You can use on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers that track large transactions (often labeled “whale alerts”) from known early adductor or exchange wallets. Q4: Should I sell my Bitcoin if I see a whale depositing to an exchange? A: One transaction should not be the sole reason for an investment decision. Use it as one data point among many, including technical analysis, market sentiment, and your own investment strategy. Q5: What is an ‘unrealized loss’? A: An unrealized loss is a decrease in the value of an asset that you still hold. It becomes a “realized” loss only if you sell the asset at the lower price. The reported $76.6M loss for this OG is based on current market prices versus their acquisition cost. Q6: Why is the address called ‘1011short’? A: Blockchain addresses are alphanumeric strings. “1011short” is likely a label or identifier given by the analytics platform (Onchain Lens) to make tracking this specific, notable wallet easier for its users.

Hoskinson’s statement drew the interest of many reporters who sought to extract more details from this prominent figure in the crypto industry. Therefore, they made attempts to invite him to an interview to comment on the topic. During the interview, several questions were raised. However, Hoskinson pointed out that this matter is a delicate topic about which one cannot say anything. What he chose to comment on was the question of why there is no one else in the industry who has raised this concern. He argued that he had a strong feeling that some individuals in the crypto ecosystem were reluctant to discuss the issue. Hoskinson cautions about Trump’s move in the crypto industry Earlier, when Trump decided to launch his own meme coin just three days after being sworn in as the US president, Hoskinson issued a warning , claiming that this move could significantly harm the cryptocurrency industry, particularly in the United States. At this time, he noted that what was initially perceived as a careful and bipartisan effort to establish straightforward regulations for digital assets in America had swiftly turned into a partisan issue . This situation presented a significant obstacle to crucial legislation and provided a convenient target for critics in the cryptocurrency industry. At this particular moment, the 2026 midterm elections were drawing closer. “The moment the Trump coin was introduced, the perception shifted from ‘crypto is bipartisan’ to ‘crypto means Trump, which is bad and corrupt,’” Hoskinson explained further, noting that the situation changed into a campaign slogan for the midterm elections scheduled next year. Hoskinson called on other crypto founders to weigh in on the topic of discussion. However, very few of them voiced this view. This shocked the Cardano founder. According to him, these crypto founders were instructed not to comment on this matter. He added that they were threatened that if they said anything about it, their access would be cut short. This meant that one would not have the opportunity to participate in the legislative process or meet with Trump. Hoskinson admitted that many individuals initially accepted this idea. Nonetheless, he highlighted that the US president’s connection to the crypto ecosystem ultimately blurred the line between policy and personal interests, thereby harming the industry’s image in Washington. This move came at a time when lawmakers were discussing strategies to regulate digital assets. Following this outcome, Hoskinson claimed that Trump caused a significant shake-up in the crypto market, arguing that he could be called to testify if Democrats regained power. Hoskinson disapproves of Trump’s World Liberty Financial project Even before the introduction of the meme coin, Trump, his family members, and business partners initiated a big crypto project known as World Liberty Financial . At that time, he was still holding campaigns and making pledges for the upcoming November election. The Cardano founder raised concerns regarding this crypto project. According to him, the timing set for this initiative was questionable. Hoskinson argued that as a private citizen of the United States, he can perform such actions, but he must also consider the fact that people are still watching his decisions. “You shouldn’t just jump into something and then create rules around it.

CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index has dropped to a mere 17, down one point from the previous day. This crucial metric acts as a barometer for the entire altcoin market, and its current reading suggests a challenging environment for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. If you’re wondering what this means for your portfolio, you’re in the right place. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does It Matter? The Altcoin Season Index is a simple yet powerful tool. It measures whether altcoins, as a group, are outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Think of it as a scorecard for the ‘risk-on’ sentiment in crypto. The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, to see how many have beaten Bitcoin’s returns. A score of 75 or above officially signals an ‘altcoin season’—a period where investors confidently rotate capital into smaller, riskier assets for potentially higher gains. Conversely, a low score like 17 indicates Bitcoin dominance is strong, and capital is flowing towards perceived safety. What Does a Score of 17 Truly Signal for the Market? A score of 17 is far from the 75 threshold needed for an altcoin season. This number tells a clear story: the vast majority of major altcoins are struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. For traders and long-term holders, this environment presents specific challenges and opportunities. Challenges for Altcoin Investors: Low momentum across the board can lead to stagnation or underperformance compared to simply holding Bitcoin. Potential Opportunities: A low index can sometimes precede a market rotation. Savvy investors might use this time to research fundamentally strong projects at lower valuations. Market Sentiment Gauge: The index reflects broader risk appetite. A low score often correlates with cautious or fearful sentiment in the wider crypto market. How Should You Navigate a Weak Altcoin Season Index? So, the Altcoin Season Index is low. What actionable steps can you take? First, avoid panic. Market cycles are normal. This is a time for strategy, not reaction. Consider reviewing your portfolio’s balance between Bitcoin and altcoins. You might also focus on dollar-cost averaging into projects with solid fundamentals, rather than chasing short-term pumps. Furthermore, use this period for education and due diligence. When the index eventually turns, you’ll be prepared with a researched watchlist. Remember, the goal isn’t to time the market perfectly, but to make informed decisions based on clear data like this index provides. Conclusion: Patience and Perspective Are Key The drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 17 is a significant data point, highlighting the current strength of Bitcoin and the relative weakness of the altcoin market. It serves as a reminder that crypto investing requires patience and an understanding of market cycles. While it may not be a classic ‘altcoin season’ right now, these periods of consolidation often set the stage for the next major move. By monitoring tools like this index and maintaining a disciplined strategy, you can navigate both seasons of boom and bust with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a good score for the Altcoin Season Index? A: A score above 75 is considered the threshold for an ‘altcoin season,’ indicating widespread altcoin outperformance. A score closer to 100 signals a very strong season. Q: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A: The index is typically updated daily, tracking the 90-day performance window on a rolling basis. Q: Does a low index mean all altcoins are losing money? A: Not necessarily. It means most are underperforming Bitcoin. Some individual altcoins may still post positive gains, just at a slower rate than Bitcoin. Q: Should I sell all my altcoins when the index is low? A: A low index is a signal, not a sell command. Your decision should be based on your investment thesis for each asset, risk tolerance, and portfolio strategy. It may be a time for caution and rebalancing. Q: Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? A: You can find the index on the CoinMarketCap website under their market data or research sections.

The price has held firm within a well-defined area of support. However, it is being seen that there is interest in early investment options as investors seek the best cryptocurrency to invest in, weighing calculated risks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale token at $0.035 has seen investment flows due to uncertainty with Dogecoin. Dogecoin Price Activity: Warning Signs and Prospects Dogecoin had been showing signs of a recovery after the market downturn while testing the $0.1332 support level. Derivatives market information had been showing that Open Interest had risen to $1.49 billion, showing that market participants had been opening longs on the expectation of a recovery. The long position had been seen to rise above 51% despite the information that the market had been experiencing liquidation. Additionally, the MACD has been approaching a bearish crossing, and this has been maintaining the possibility of downward reversals in case of a failure of support levels. Nonetheless, institutional inflows have been restricted, as Dogecoin inflows for the Dogecoin ETF have been very low, amounting to $171,920 in a single session. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off as Phase 6 Looms Close Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently being considered one of the most undervalued cryptos available. Investors have little time left for the currently available price of $0.035 for the coins before the next level at Phase 7 kicks in and drives the price towards $0.04 with a 20% surge. To date, they have managed to raise $19.5 million, while the total number of holders of the total MUTM has climbed to 18,520 since inception. This valuation marks an incredible 250% jump from Phase One’s launch price of $0.01, showing just how quickly prices can move. This launch price will be $0.06, leaving incoming investors poised for a possible return of 420% when prices open. Mutuum Finance has an increasing opportunity of being classified amongst the next big cryptos. Utility, Transparency, and Buyer Confidence Mutuum Finance is following through on its fundraising efforts by announcing the confirmation of its V1 protocol launch on the Sepolia testnet in 2025. The launching of the V1 protocol will enable the project to have its first Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot, including ETH and USDT lending, on the first day of its operation making Mutuum Finance the best cryptocurrency to invest in. Now, a live dashboard features the top 50 token holders, and a leaderboard replenishes daily, increasing engagement by awarding a $500 MUTM bonus for those in the top rankings after making a transaction within a 24-hour period after a minimum transaction has been performed. The leaderboard resets at 00:00 UTC daily. As Phase 6 ends, the opportunity to claim tokens at $0.035 gets narrower. With the pricing mechanics of Phase 7 and the valuation emphasis, those looking for the best crypto to buy now and the best cheap crypto to buy now will instead be attracted to something with progress to offer instead of simple projections. Looking Ahead in a Shifting Market Focus on Dogecoin challenges the conviction level of traders on support levels, while the capital is flowing towards a presale that contains milestones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a promising next big crypto in the world of cryptocurrencies for those who put a premium on timing, transparency, and early entry into the crypto space.

In a recent interview, he pointed directly at former President Donald Trump’s actions as a source of significant damage to the crypto market . Hoskinson argues that what should be a bipartisan effort for clear regulation has devolved into partisan conflict, creating uncertainty that hurts every investor and builder in the space. How Did Trump’s Memecoin Launch Disrupt the Crypto Market? Hoskinson identified a key moment of disruption: the launch of a Trump-branded memecoin just before the presidential inauguration. This move, according to Hoskinson, transformed cryptocurrency legislation from a technical policy discussion into a political football. The result? Vital conversations about consumer protection and innovation stalled as the focus shifted to partisan loyalty over substantive debate. This politicization injects volatility and fear into the crypto market , making it harder for serious projects to thrive. The Controversial Plan for a Government Bitcoin Reserve Another major point of criticism centers on Trump’s mentioned proposal for a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. Hoskinson calls this “the government picking winners and losers,” a fundamental breach of the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency. He suggests the plan is not a thoughtful economic strategy but a political tool. The inclusion of certain altcoins like Cardano (ADA) in discussions about this reserve seemed, to Hoskinson, more like an attempt to quiet critics than a genuine policy evaluation based on technology or utility. This approach creates several problems for the crypto market : Market Distortion: Government favoritism can artificially inflate or suppress specific assets. Eroded Trust: It undermines trust in the market’s organic, merit-based dynamics. Regulatory Uncertainty: It signals that future regulation may be arbitrary and politically motivated. Standing Up for Integrity in the Crypto Market Hoskinson revealed that his outspoken criticism likely cost him an invitation to a high-profile presidential dinner. However, he emphasized that protecting the industry’s integrity is more important than access. His stance highlights a crucial conflict in the crypto market : the tension between seeking legitimacy through political engagement and maintaining the core principles of decentralization and neutrality. For founders like Hoskinson, the long-term health of the ecosystem depends on resisting short-term political games. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Regulation? The current situation presents a clear challenge. The crypto market needs sensible, clear, and fair regulation to achieve mass adoption and protect users. However, when political figures intertwine their personal brand or agenda with the industry, it corrupts the process. The path forward requires a return to focus on the technology’s potential, its risks, and frameworks that foster innovation while ensuring security—free from the damaging influence of partisan spectacle. In conclusion, Charles Hoskinson’s critique serves as a crucial alarm bell. The politicization of cryptocurrency, exemplified by recent actions, poses a genuine threat to market stability and ethical development. The industry’s future growth depends on navigating these political waters without compromising its foundational values. For the crypto market to mature, it must be driven by technology and community, not political maneuvering. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly did Charles Hoskinson criticize about Trump’s crypto actions? Hoskinson criticized two main actions: the launch of a Trump memecoin, which he says turned crypto legislation into a partisan issue, and the proposal for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which he views as inappropriate government market manipulation. Why is a government Bitcoin reserve considered damaging to the crypto market? It is seen as “picking winners and losers,” which goes against cryptocurrency’s decentralized nature. It can distort prices, create unfair advantages, and set a precedent for politically-driven intervention rather than rules-based regulation. How does political partisanship hurt the cryptocurrency industry? It creates regulatory uncertainty, scares away institutional investment, and stalls important policy discussions. When crypto becomes a partisan tool, achieving balanced, effective legislation becomes much harder. Did Hoskinson’s comments have any personal consequence for him? He believes they led to him not being invited to a presidential dinner, but he stated that defending the industry’s integrity was more important than that access. What is the solution for better crypto market regulation? The solution involves developing clear, technology-neutral rules through transparent, bipartisan collaboration that focuses on consumer protection, innovation, and market stability, without political favoritism. Should crypto projects engage with politicians at all? Engagement is necessary for education and sensible lawmaking, but it must be done carefully to avoid co-option and to ensure the industry’s core principles of decentralization and fairness are not compromised.

That sounds catastrophic if you’ve never watched XRPL governance do its thing. But the important nuance is right there in the name: amendment blocking is a safety feature, not a network failure mode. When new protocol rules activate, old software can’t reliably interpret ledgers anymore, so the network forces those servers into a non-participating state rather than letting them guess. Related Reading: XRP Price Falls To Critical Support Level, Is It Time To Panic? So does “almost half the servers” going amendment-blocked matter if activity spikes? “Not at all,” Krippenreiter replied to one user. “All dUNL validators are safe, so all ‘trusted’ validators will continue to validate as expected. (and behave under load)… For everything else there is ‘FeeEscalation’.” The point he’s making: consensus comes from a trusted validator set, and fee escalation is designed to push transaction costs higher as the ledger gets busy, throttling spam and overload attempts. Other XRPL watchers mostly treated it as routine maintenance, not an existential moment. “Is this unusual or dangerous? No. This happens almost every amendment cycle,” another user wrote, listing prior change windows and noting that lagging nodes typically upgrade later. The XRPL amendment process itself is built around a long lead time: an amendment needs sustained supermajority support from trusted validators for two weeks before it flips on. Related Reading: Best XRP Buy Zone? Analyst Breaks Down The Key Levels Still, the optics aren’t nothing. Having hundreds of public servers fall behind at once can be a real-world nuisance for wallets, explorers, and businesses that lean on third-party infrastructure. Even if consensus is fine, fewer up-to-date nodes can mean less redundancy at the edges — more brittle public endpoints, more support tickets, more “why is my transaction not going through?” posts. And there is a concrete upgrade path. XRPL.org’s release notes for rippled 2.6.2 describe a new fixDirectoryLimit amendment plus a critical bug fix — the kind of stuff you don’t want to procrastinate on if you run production infrastructure. The short version: no, XRPL isn’t “going down.” But if you’re still running old rippled in late 2025, the network is about to remind you that upgrades aren’t optional. At press time, XRP traded alongside the broader market wide sentiment, down -1.5% over the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) Shows Downside Signals Despite Fresh Inflows,https://bitcoinist.com/are-bears-still-control-bitcoin-btc-shows-downside/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price action has entered a conflicted phase, with renewed institutional inflows clashing against clear signs of market stress. After peaking above $126,000 earlier this year, the world’s largest crypto has retreated sharply and is now trading more than 30% below its all-time high. Related Reading: Bipartisan SAFE Crypto Act Unveiled: New Task Force To Combat Digital Asset Scams While some capital has returned through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), broader market signals suggest that selling pressure and weak participation continue to weigh on sentiment. Consequently, recent weeks have shown that Bitcoin’s recovery attempts remain fragile. Long-Term Holders Drive Persistent Supply Pressure A major source of downside pressure has been sustained selling by long-term holders. Data from K33 Research shows that roughly 1.6 million BTC that had been dormant for at least two years has been sold since early 2023. In 2025 alone, more than $300 billion worth of long-held Bitcoin has re-entered circulation. Analysts note that this type of distribution creates gradual, grinding declines rather than sharp capitulation events. With fewer active buyers in the market, the reactivated supply has proven difficult to absorb. Blockchain data indicates that the past month marked one of the heaviest long-term holder sell-offs in over five years, reinforcing the idea that structural selling remains unresolved. ETF Inflows Return, But Demand Remains Uneven Institutional demand has shown brief signs of recovery. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded roughly $457 million in net inflows on December 17, snapping a multi-day outflow streak. Fidelity’s Bitcoin fund accounted for the majority of the inflows, with BlackRock also posting gains. Despite this rebound, ETF activity has been inconsistent. December inflows remain modest compared with earlier in the year, following nearly $3.5 billion in ETF outflows in November. Market observers say these inflows, while supportive, have not yet been large or sustained enough to offset ongoing sell-side pressure from long-term holders and cautious retail participation. Technical Signals and Market Structure Favor Bears From a technical perspective, Bitcoin continues to flash bearish signals. The price has traded within a broad $82,000–$95,000 range for over a month, forming patterns such as an inverse cup and handle on the daily chart. Bitcoin has also slipped below key moving averages, while momentum indicators suggest sellers remain in control. Recent liquidation events have reinforced this weakness. Around $152 million in Bitcoin positions were liquidated in a single day, and derivatives open interest has declined since the October market crash tied to macroeconomic shocks and tariff-related concerns.

Until selling from long-term holders eases and liquidity improves, downside risks are likely to remain part of the market’s near-term outlook.

This appointment signals a significant shift in how America approaches digital asset oversight, bringing specialized crypto expertise directly to the helm of one of the nation’s key financial regulators. For investors and industry participants, this leadership change could accelerate the clarity everyone has been waiting for. Who Is Mike Selig and Why Does His CFTC Chairmanship Matter? The Republican-led Senate officially appointed Mike Selig to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to reports from Coindesk. Selig brings crucial experience from his previous role as senior legal advisor to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto task force. His background positions him uniquely to navigate the complex intersection of traditional finance and emerging digital assets. This appointment comes at a critical juncture. The CFTC is actively developing proposals that could reshape how cryptocurrencies operate within regulated markets. Selig’s leadership is expected to provide the momentum needed to move these initiatives from discussion to implementation. What Immediate Changes Can We Expect from the New CFTC Chairman? Industry observers anticipate Selig will accelerate key tasks within the agency’s ongoing “crypto sprint.” This initiative represents an intensive review of digital asset issues aimed at establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework. The new CFTC chairman inherits several pressing matters that demand attention. The agency currently focuses on two major proposals: Including stablecoins in tokenized collateral systems Integrating blockchain technology into regulatory oversight mechanisms These developments could create more structured pathways for cryptocurrency integration into mainstream finance. However, they also present challenges in balancing innovation with investor protection. How Will the Crypto Sprint Benefit from New Leadership? The “crypto sprint” initiative gains substantial momentum with Selig’s appointment. As the new CFTC chairman, he brings firsthand understanding of regulatory challenges from his SEC experience. This perspective could help bridge gaps between different regulatory approaches to digital assets. Several factors make this leadership transition particularly significant: Regulatory Coordination: Selig’s SEC background facilitates better inter-agency cooperation Technical Understanding: Direct experience with crypto legal issues informs practical rulemaking Timely Action: The crypto sprint receives focused leadership during a crucial development phase Market participants should watch for increased regulatory clarity in coming months. The new CFTC chairman has both the expertise and mandate to advance concrete proposals. What Challenges Face the New CFTC Chairman? Despite the promising outlook, significant hurdles remain. Regulatory frameworks must address diverse digital assets while maintaining market integrity. The new CFTC chairman must navigate complex jurisdictional questions, particularly regarding which assets fall under CFTC versus SEC oversight. Additionally, technological integration presents practical challenges. Blockchain-based regulatory systems require robust infrastructure and industry cooperation. Selig’s success will depend on building consensus among commissioners, industry stakeholders, and other regulatory bodies. Conclusion: A New Era for Cryptocurrency Regulation The appointment of Mike Selig as CFTC chairman represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency regulation. His specialized background and the timing of this transition create ideal conditions for meaningful regulatory progress. As the new CFTC chairman accelerates the crypto sprint, market participants can anticipate clearer guidelines that balance innovation with necessary safeguards. This leadership change comes when the industry desperately needs regulatory certainty. With stablecoin frameworks and blockchain integration on the agenda, Selig’s tenure could define how America regulates digital assets for years to come. The path forward requires careful navigation, but the direction seems clearer than ever. Frequently Asked Questions What is the CFTC’s role in cryptocurrency regulation? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates commodity futures, options, and swaps markets in the United States. For cryptocurrencies, the CFTC typically oversees derivatives products like Bitcoin futures and has authority over commodities spot markets involving fraud and manipulation. How does Mike Selig’s background help him as CFTC chairman? Selig previously served as senior legal advisor to the SEC’s crypto task force, giving him direct experience with digital asset regulation from another major financial regulator. This background helps him understand both the technical aspects of cryptocurrencies and the regulatory challenges they present. What is the “crypto sprint” mentioned in the article? The crypto sprint is a CFTC initiative focused on intensively reviewing digital asset issues to establish a regulatory framework. It involves concentrated efforts to address pressing questions about how cryptocurrencies should be regulated within existing financial systems. How might stablecoins be affected by new CFTC proposals? The CFTC is developing proposals to include stablecoins in tokenized collateral systems. This could create new use cases for stablecoins within regulated financial markets while establishing clearer rules for their operation and oversight. What immediate changes should cryptocurrency investors expect? While immediate changes may be limited, investors should anticipate accelerated regulatory clarity in coming months. The new CFTC chairman is expected to advance concrete proposals that could affect how cryptocurrencies are traded, stored, and integrated into traditional finance. How does this appointment affect the relationship between CFTC and SEC? Selig’s SEC background could improve coordination between the two agencies regarding cryptocurrency regulation.

56012161,646674,1766109616,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56012161.jpeg,Ethereum Retail Participation Vanishes: Hits One-Year Low In Network Activity,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-retail-participation-vanishes-one-year-low/,"Ethereum is struggling to maintain a convincing bullish narrative as market conditions continue to deteriorate and a growing number of analysts begin to call for a broader bear market. After months of heightened volatility and repeated corrective phases, price action alone has failed to restore confidence, leaving participants increasingly cautious. This hesitation is now being reflected clearly in on-chain data, reinforcing the idea that the current weakness is not purely technical, but structural. According to a recent CryptoQuant report, Ethereum’s network activity has dropped to levels that strongly suggest a withdrawal of retail participation. Active sending addresses have fallen toward the 170,000 mark, a threshold historically associated with reduced engagement from smaller investors. In past cycles, retail activity typically expands during bullish phases as new participants enter the market, then contracts sharply once confidence fades and price momentum weakens. Prolonged volatility and corrective price action have likely eroded Ethereum’s short-term conviction , pushing retail participants either to the sidelines or out of the market entirely. This absence matters. Retail flow often plays a critical role in sustaining momentum during recoveries, and without it, upside moves tend to stall quickly. On-Chain Signals Point to Exhaustion, Not Capitulation According to CryptoOnchain’s analysis , Ethereum’s sharply depressed on-chain activity aligns with a classic phase of seller exhaustion rather than active capitulation. In this regime, selling pressure gradually diminishes as participants willing to exit have largely done so, yet fresh demand has not meaningfully returned. The result is a fragile equilibrium where price may stabilize, but upside remains limited in the absence of new buyers. The lack of retail participation plays a central role in this dynamic. Retail flow typically provides the initial momentum during early rebounds, amplifying price moves once confidence begins to recover. With active sending addresses at one-year lows, that catalyst is currently missing, which helps explain why upside attempts have been shallow and short-lived. However, this same environment has historically attracted larger, long-term participants. Institutional and high-conviction holders often accumulate during periods of low activity, when liquidity is thin, and sentiment is decisively negative. Importantly, a credible recovery signal would not emerge from price action alone. CryptoOnchain emphasizes that a sustainable shift would require a gradual rebound in active sending addresses alongside price stabilization. That combination would point to returning demand and improving network utilization. Conversely, continued stagnation or further declines in address activity would increase the risk of Ethereum entering a deeper consolidation or even a demand-destruction phase. While current conditions highlight clear short-term weakness and retail disengagement, similar on-chain setups have historically formed near structural bottoms, creating the potential for medium-term trend shifts if activity begins to recover. Ethereum Price Struggles at Key Structural Support Ethereum’s price action on the 3-day chart reflects a market caught between structural support and persistent bearish pressure. After failing to hold above the $3,200–$3,300 region, ETH has rolled over and is now consolidating near the $2,850 area, a zone that aligns closely with the 200-day moving average. This level has historically acted as a medium-term inflection point, making it critical for bulls to defend in order to avoid a deeper trend shift. The recent rejection from the $4,000–$4,800 highs marks a clear lower high within the broader structure, reinforcing the idea that momentum has weakened since late 2025. While price briefly reclaimed the 100-day moving average during the mid-year rebound, it failed to sustain acceptance above it, and ETH has since slipped back below the shorter-term averages. This suggests that rallies are still being sold into rather than accumulated aggressively. Price action aligns with a market transitioning into consolidation rather than immediate capitulation. If ETH loses the $2,800–$2,750 support zone decisively, downside risk opens toward the $2,400 region, where the long-term trend support converges. Conversely, any bullish recovery would require ETH to stabilize above the 200-day moving average and reclaim the $3,200 level with expanding volume. Until then, the chart favors a cautious, range-bound outlook with downside risks still present.

On Wednesday, BTC briefly surged from the $86,000 area toward $90,000, offering short-term investors a moment of relief after weeks of downside volatility. That rebound, however, proved short-lived. Price quickly retraced back to the $86,000 level, once again stalling bullish momentum and reinforcing the perception that sellers remain firmly in control. Related Reading: From Cycles To Continuity: Why Bitcoin’s 4-Year Pattern May Be Breaking This failed recovery attempt has weighed heavily on sentiment, particularly among short-term holders who entered positions at higher levels during the previous consolidation range. According to a report by Axel Adler, on-chain data reveals that this cohort has entered a clear stress regime. Bitcoin’s price has fallen below the average purchase price of short-term holders, a condition that historically increases the probability of reactive selling behavior. The stress is further reflected in the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR, 30-day), which has declined to 0.98. This reading indicates that short-term holders are, on average, realizing losses when they sell. Such environments often coincide with deteriorating confidence and heightened sensitivity to further downside moves. With BTC unable to hold recent relief rallies and short-term participants increasingly underwater, the market enters a fragile phase. The coming days will be critical in determining whether this pressure evolves into deeper capitulation or stabilizes into a base-building process. Short-Term Holders Under Stress as Loss-Taking Accelerates Adler explains that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR 30D) is a critical gauge of short-term market stress, as it measures whether recent coin sales are occurring at a profit or a loss. Values above one indicate that short-term holders are selling profitably, while readings below one signal loss realization. Historically, sustained periods below one reflect deteriorating confidence and raise the risk of further downside, as loss-taking behavior can cascade into additional sell pressure. A continued decline in SOPR would likely intensify this dynamic and open the door to new local lows. By contrast, a meaningful recovery would require the metric to reclaim and hold above the one level, signaling that selling pressure is being absorbed and losses are no longer dominant. This stress is reinforced by the Short-Term Holders Positive vs Negative Sentiment chart. The indicator classifies holders based on whether they are in profit or at a loss. Over the past five weeks, sentiment has shifted decisively toward the orange and purple zones, representing negative positioning. The growing dominance of underwater holders increases the probability of panic-driven selling. Together, both charts deliver a consistent message: short-term participants are under pressure, and the current environment remains fragile until clear signs of relief emerge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Structure Turns Bearish As Structural Indicators Flip Negative Bitcoin Tests Critical Support as Bears Persist Bitcoin continues to trade under pressure, with the chart showing price consolidating around the $87,000 area after a sharp corrective move from the October highs near $125,000. The rejection from the upper range marked a clear shift in market structure, as BTC lost the 50-day and 100-day moving averages and failed to reclaim them on subsequent rebounds. The blue moving average has now turned downward, reinforcing the short- to medium-term bearish bias. Price is currently hovering just above the 200-day moving average, plotted in red, which sits near the $86,000–$88,000 zone. This level represents a critical area of long-term demand and structural support. Historically, sustained closes below the 200-day average tend to coincide with deeper corrective phases or prolonged consolidation. Related Reading: XRP Liquidity Dries Up: Futures Buy Volume On Binance Falls from $5.8B to $250M Volume dynamics add to the cautious outlook. Selling pressure expanded significantly during the breakdown in October and November, while recent rebound attempts have occurred on relatively muted volume. This suggests that short-covering and tactical buying, rather than strong spot demand, are driving price stabilization. Structurally, Bitcoin is forming lower highs since the peak, keeping the broader trend vulnerable. A recovery scenario would require BTC to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 region and hold above the declining moving averages. Until then, the chart favors continued consolidation or further downside risk around the long-term support zone.

This development marks a pivotal moment for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, granting the DEXE token direct access to one of Asia’s most active trading markets. For investors and crypto enthusiasts, understanding the implications of Bithumb lists DeXe is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape. What Does It Mean When Bithumb Lists DeXe? The announcement that Bithumb lists DeXe on its Korean Won (KRW) market is more than just another exchange listing. It represents a bridge between decentralized protocol governance and a massive, regulated centralized exchange. Trading commenced at 7:00 a.m. UTC, providing Korean investors with a new avenue to participate in decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance. This move significantly boosts liquidity and mainstream visibility for the DEXE project. Why Is the DEXE Token Gaining Attention? DeXe operates as a decentralized social trading and governance protocol. Its native token, DEXE, serves several core functions that make this listing noteworthy: Governance Power: Holders can vote on key protocol decisions. Staking Rewards: Users earn rewards for securing the network. Utility in Trading: The token integrates with DeXe’s copy-trading and strategy mirroring features. Therefore, the decision that Bithumb lists DeXe validates its utility beyond typical speculative assets. It acknowledges the growing demand for tools that blend sophisticated trading with community-led governance. How Does This Benefit the South Korean Crypto Market? South Korea maintains one of the world’s most enthusiastic and technologically adept crypto communities. By choosing to list DeXe, Bithumb provides its users with early access to innovative DeFi primitives. This action has several immediate benefits: Enhanced Access: Korean traders can now use KRW to buy DEXE easily. Increased Legitimacy: A Bithumb listing acts as a stamp of approval, fostering trust. Market Diversification: It expands the portfolio of DeFi assets available to local investors. The event where Bithumb lists DeXe demonstrates the exchange’s commitment to curating a forward-thinking asset portfolio for its users. What Are the Challenges and Considerations? While the news is positive, investors should proceed with informed caution. Listing on a major exchange like Bithumb often leads to increased volatility as new money enters the market. Furthermore, users must remember that the core value of DEXE is tied to the adoption and security of the DeXe protocol itself, not just its exchange presence. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) and understand the project’s fundamentals, roadmap, and the risks associated with DAO governance. Conclusion: A Strategic Step for DeFi Adoption The move where Bithumb lists DeXe is a strategic inflection point. It signals a growing convergence between centralized finance (CeFi) giants and the decentralized world.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.02. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $3.04 and $3.29, with an average value of $3.16. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.2571 Market Cap $499.58M Trading Volume $81.91M Circulating Supply 1.94B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2544 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-hour High $0.2852 24-hour Low $0.2561 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.05% (High) 50-Day SMA $0.3555 14-Day RSI 35.28 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 17 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.6627 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is trading near support, but momentum remains bearish. A price fall below $0.25 opens the door for a deeper drop. Optimism (OP) key resistance lies at $0.28. Optimism 1-day price chart On the daily timeframe for December 19, OP is trading around $0.256, sitting near the lower Bollinger Band at $0.262, which confirms persistent downside momentum rather than a healthy mean reversion. The price remains firmly below the mid-band, near $0.304, maintaining the broader structure’s bearish tone. The RSI is weak around 32, hovering just above oversold, showing sellers still dominate without meaningful bullish divergence yet. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative and is expanding slightly, reinforcing that downside pressure has not yet fully exhausted. A clean daily close below $0.250–$0.255 risks accelerating losses toward the $0.22–$0.23 demand zone, while recovery attempts are capped below $0.30 unless momentum flips decisively. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, OP continues to trend below the Alligator averages, with price rejected near $0.28 and currently consolidating weakly around $0.256–$0.260. Volume flow remains bearish, as OBV keeps making lower lows and CMF stays negative near -0.21, confirming capital outflows rather than accumulation. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The lack of strong bullish candles after the sharp drop suggests this is a pause, not a reversal. As long as OP stays below $0.27–0.28, sellers retain control, and another push toward $0.25 remains likely before any meaningful bounce attempt. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4303 SELL SMA 5 $0.3814 SELL SMA 10 $0.3653 SELL SMA 21 $0.3401 SELL SMA 50 $0.3555 SELL SMA 100 $0.4927 SELL SMA 200 $0.6627 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3290 SELL EMA 5 $0.3651 SELL EMA 10 $0.4505 SELL EMA 21 $0.5541 SELL EMA 50 $0.6327 SELL EMA 100 $0.6769 SELL EMA 200 $0.8248 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is still in a bearish continuation phase, with momentum favoring sellers unless $0.28–$0.30 is reclaimed convincingly. Short-term relief bounces are possible, but structurally weak. Traders must take caution until clear accumulation or bullish divergence appears. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

On-chain trading infrastructure startup aPriori has announced a strategic partnership with blockchain oracle network Chainlink. This collaboration aims to fundamentally enhance cross-chain functionality and data reliability for users. For traders and developers, this means more secure and efficient movement of assets across different blockchain ecosystems. Why is the aPriori Chainlink Partnership a Game-Changer? This partnership directly tackles one of the biggest challenges in decentralized finance: fragmented liquidity and isolated data. By integrating Chainlink’s proven infrastructure, aPriori is building a more connected and trustworthy trading environment. The core of this aPriori Chainlink partnership focuses on two critical components: secure token transfers and tamper-proof market data. This move signals a strong commitment to building robust, user-centric DeFi solutions. How Does Chainlink CCIP Power aPriori’s aprMON Token? A central element of the collaboration is the integration of Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). aPriori’s Monad-based token, aprMON, will utilize CCIP as its exclusive cross-chain solution, launching as a Cross-Chain Token (CCT). This integration allows for: Secure Cross-Chain Transfers: Users can move aprMON tokens between blockchains with enhanced security, minimizing risks associated with bridge vulnerabilities. Reliable Price Data: The integration includes Chainlink Price Feeds for both APR and aprMON, providing accurate and manipulation-resistant market data. Simplified User Experience: It creates a seamless pathway for users to interact with aprMON across multiple networks without complex manual processes. This technical foundation is crucial for scaling adoption and utility. What Does This Mean for Swapr and Monad Network Growth? Separately, aPriori’s AI-based DEX aggregator, Swapr, is demonstrating impressive traction. Since its soft launch on December 5th on the Monad network, Swapr has surpassed $15 million in total trading volume . The platform maintains an average daily trading volume exceeding $1 million, establishing itself as the highest-volume DEX aggregator on Monad. The aPriori Chainlink partnership will likely further accelerate this growth by improving the underlying data and interoperability that Swapr relies on, potentially attracting more liquidity and users to the Monad ecosystem. What Are the Broader Implications for DeFi Interoperability? The strategic alignment between aPriori and Chainlink represents a broader industry trend. Projects are moving beyond single-chain limitations to build interconnected financial systems. This partnership leverages Chainlink’s established reputation for secure oracle services to bolster aPriori’s innovative trading tools. For the wider market, it sets a precedent for how infrastructure projects can collaborate to solve complex problems like cross-chain communication and data integrity, making DeFi more accessible and reliable for everyone. Conclusion: A Strategic Step Towards a Unified DeFi Future The aPriori Chainlink partnership is more than just a technical integration; it’s a strategic move to build a more resilient and connected decentralized finance landscape. By combining aPriori’s on-chain trading infrastructure with Chainlink’s battle-tested oracle and cross-chain solutions, the collaboration addresses critical needs for security, reliability, and seamless asset movement. As Swapr’s early success on Monad shows, there is strong demand for sophisticated DeFi tools. This partnership provides the foundational infrastructure to meet that demand at a larger scale, paving the way for the next wave of cross-chain innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the main goal of the aPriori and Chainlink partnership? A: The primary goal is to enhance aPriori’s interoperability and data infrastructure using Chainlink’s secure oracle networks and cross-chain protocol, enabling safer and more efficient multi-chain operations. Q: What is Chainlink CCIP, and how is aPriori using it? A: CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) is Chainlink’s solution for secure cross-blockchain communication. aPriori is using it as the exclusive cross-chain solution for its aprMON token, allowing it to move securely between different networks. Q: How does this partnership benefit an average crypto user? A: Users benefit from more secure cross-chain token transfers, reliable price information for trading decisions, and a smoother experience when using aPriori’s products like Swapr across multiple blockchains. Q: What is Swapr, and why is its volume significant? A: Swapr is aPriori’s AI-powered DEX aggregator on the Monad network. Surpassing $15 million in volume quickly indicates strong user adoption and validates the demand for advanced trading tools in emerging ecosystems. Q: Does this partnership involve any new token launches? A: The partnership involves the existing aprMON token being launched as a Cross-Chain Token (CCT) using CCIP. It does not announce a brand-new token creation. Q: How does this affect the broader Monad ecosystem? A: It brings proven, high-security infrastructure from Chainlink to Monad, potentially increasing developer confidence, attracting more applications, and boosting overall liquidity and activity on the network.

56013241,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=247903,1766111411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive Move: Anonymous Whales Withdraw $14.2 Million in Ethereum from Binance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/anonymous-whales-withdraw-eth/,"BitcoinWorld Massive Move: Anonymous Whales Withdraw $14.2 Million in Ethereum from Binance In a move that has captured the attention of the crypto community, two anonymous whales have executed a significant withdrawal from Binance. On-chain data reveals they pulled a combined 4,664 ETH, worth approximately $14.2 million. This substantial movement of Ethereum from a major exchange to private wallets often signals a shift in holder strategy, prompting analysts and investors to ask: what do these anonymous whales know? What Does It Mean When Anonymous Whales Withdraw ETH? When large, unidentified entities—commonly called ‘whales’—move cryptocurrency off exchanges, it typically suggests a long-term holding strategy. This action reduces the immediate selling pressure on the market. According to on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, one address withdrew 2,656 ETH ($7.55 million), while another took out 2,008 ETH ($5.65 million). The analyst provided deeper insight, noting the second address has been accumulating for months. Is This a Sign of Bullish Confidence? The data suggests a strong vote of confidence in Ethereum’s future. The second whale address has withdrawn a total of 6,411.4 ETH, valued at $24.83 million, over the past four months. Crucially, the analyst noted that most of these funds are being staked . Staking involves locking up ETH to help secure the network and earn rewards, which is a definitive long-term play. This pattern indicates these anonymous whales are not looking for a quick profit but are positioning for the long haul. Let’s break down the potential implications of this move: Reduced Exchange Supply: Large withdrawals decrease the liquid supply available for trading, which can positively impact price stability. Increased Staking: Moving ETH into staking contracts supports network security and demonstrates holder commitment. Market Sentiment: Whale accumulation is often viewed as a bullish signal, suggesting ‘smart money’ expects future price appreciation. How Can Retail Investors Interpret Whale Activity? While whale movements are noteworthy, they are just one piece of the puzzle. Retail investors should use this information cautiously. Whale watching can provide clues about market sentiment, but it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. The key takeaway is the demonstrated shift from exchange-held assets to staked, long-term holdings. This aligns with a broader trend of Ethereum maturation post-Merge, where earning yield through staking becomes a core value proposition. Therefore, the decision by these anonymous whales to withdraw ETH en masse points to a strategic, network-supportive accumulation phase. It underscores a growing divergence between short-term traders on exchanges and long-term believers in the Ethereum ecosystem. Conclusion: A Strategic Vote for Ethereum’s Future This $14.2 million withdrawal is more than a simple transaction; it’s a strategic statement. The consistent accumulation and subsequent staking by one of the whales reveal a calculated bet on Ethereum’s long-term viability and value. For the market, it highlights the ongoing narrative of supply consolidation and growing institutional-grade confidence in proof-of-stake Ethereum. While the identities of these anonymous whales remain secret, their on-chain footprints tell a clear story of commitment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are ‘crypto whales’? A1: Crypto whales are individuals or entities that hold large amounts of a cryptocurrency. Their trades can significantly influence market prices due to the size of their holdings. Q2: Why is withdrawing crypto from an exchange considered significant? A2: Withdrawing to a private wallet usually indicates a intent to hold long-term (HODL) or stake, reducing immediate selling pressure on exchanges. It’s often interpreted as a bullish signal. Q3: What is Ethereum staking? A3: Staking is the process of locking up cryptocurrency to support the operations of a proof-of-stake blockchain network. In return, participants earn rewards, similar to interest. Q4: Should I buy Ethereum because a whale did? A4: Not necessarily. Whale activity is a useful data point, but it should be combined with your own research, risk assessment, and investment strategy. Never invest based solely on another entity’s actions. Q5: How can I track whale movements myself? A5: You can use on-chain analytics platforms like Etherscan, Nansen, or Glassnode. These tools track large wallet transactions and provide insights into whale behavior. Q6: Does this withdrawal guarantee an Ethereum price increase? A6: No single event guarantees a price move. While reducing exchange supply is generally positive, price is influenced by many factors including broader market trends, adoption news, and macroeconomic conditions.

According to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham, mining giant Bitmain is estimated to have purchased over $229 million worth of Ethereum in just a few days. This massive Bitmain Ethereum purchase represents one of the most significant institutional moves into ETH this quarter, sending a powerful signal to the entire market. What Does Bitmain’s Massive Ethereum Investment Mean? Let’s break down the numbers. Blockchain data shows an address linked to Bitmain executed two major transactions. First, it withdrew 48,049 ETH (worth $141.78 million) from institutional platform FalconX on December 17. Then, just two days later, it pulled another 30,075 ETH ($88.31 million) from the same platform. Combined, this represents a strategic accumulation of nearly 80,000 ETH tokens. This isn’t random trading activity. The scale and timing suggest a deliberate, calculated investment strategy. When a company like Bitmain—known for its deep industry expertise—makes such a substantial move, market participants pay close attention. Why Is Bitmain Betting Big on Ethereum Now? Several factors could explain this aggressive accumulation. First, Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake has fundamentally changed its investment thesis. The network now burns transaction fees, making ETH potentially deflationary during high-usage periods. Second, consider these upcoming developments: Ethereum ETF applications are pending with the SEC The network continues to dominate in decentralized finance and NFTs Major protocol upgrades are on the roadmap Bitmain’s timing suggests they see current prices as an attractive entry point before these catalysts potentially drive value higher. Their Bitmain Ethereum purchase demonstrates conviction that goes beyond short-term speculation. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? Institutional moves of this magnitude create ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. When a mining hardware manufacturer diversifies into Ethereum holdings, it validates ETH as a store of value alongside Bitcoin. This could encourage other mining companies and traditional institutions to reconsider their crypto allocation strategies. Moreover, removing nearly 80,000 ETH from circulation reduces available supply on exchanges. This technical factor, combined with the psychological impact of seeing a major player accumulate, often creates upward price pressure. The market interprets such moves as smart money positioning for future gains. What Challenges Could Bitmain Face With This Strategy? While the Bitmain Ethereum purchase appears strategically sound, no investment is without risk. Ethereum’s price remains volatile, subject to broader market sentiment and regulatory developments. As a proof-of-stake asset, ETH doesn’t generate yield unless staked, which introduces different considerations than Bitcoin mining. Additionally, Bitmain must manage this substantial position carefully. Large holders often face scrutiny regarding their influence on network governance and price stability. However, their expertise in blockchain technology likely gives them unique insights into managing these challenges effectively. Key Takeaways From Bitmain’s Ethereum Accumulation This development offers several actionable insights for investors and observers. First, institutional accumulation often precedes major price movements. Second, diversification within the crypto space is becoming standard practice even for Bitcoin-focused companies. Finally, the sheer scale of this Bitmain Ethereum purchase suggests confidence in Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals despite short-term market fluctuations. As we conclude, remember that Bitmain didn’t become a mining giant by making reckless bets. Their substantial Ethereum investment likely results from careful analysis of technology, market dynamics, and risk-reward calculations. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, when industry leaders put hundreds of millions behind an asset, it’s worth understanding why. Frequently Asked Questions How was Bitmain’s Ethereum purchase discovered? Blockchain intelligence platform Arkham identified the transactions through on-chain analysis, linking the wallet addresses to Bitmain based on transaction patterns and known associations. Why would a Bitcoin mining company buy Ethereum? Bitmain is diversifying its portfolio. Ethereum represents a different value proposition than Bitcoin, with strong utility in decentralized applications and a transitioning economic model that may offer different growth opportunities. Does this mean Bitmain is moving away from Bitcoin? Not necessarily. This appears to be a diversification strategy rather than a replacement. Many institutional investors hold multiple cryptocurrencies to balance risk and exposure to different blockchain innovations. How might this affect Ethereum’s price? Large accumulations typically reduce available supply on exchanges, which can create upward price pressure. More importantly, they signal confidence that can influence market sentiment and attract other investors. Should retail investors follow Bitmain’s move? While institutional moves provide valuable market signals, every investor’s situation is different. Consider your own risk tolerance, investment horizon, and research before making any decisions based on this news. Where did Bitmain purchase the Ethereum? The transactions occurred through FalconX, an institutional cryptocurrency trading platform designed for large-volume transactions with minimal market impact.

The mood improved after a shock slowdown in US consumer price inflation to 2.7%, although analysts cautioned the reading looked clearly distorted lower by the government shutdown and should not be taken at face value. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $85,811, down 1% Ether : $2,836, down 0.1% XRP : $1.79, down 3.8% Total crypto market cap: $2.97 trillion, down 1.4% Bitcoin Pullback Reframes Debate Around Dormant Capital And DeFi Use Crypto traders focused on positioning and flows rather than the headline macro print. Bitfinex analysts said current data shows institutional buyers absorbing around 13% more Bitcoin than the about 450 newly mined coins produced daily on a rolling basis. “This marks the first meaningful supply flip since early November, despite recent concerns around ETF outflows.” “From a technical perspective, there is strong buying support in the $82,000–$85,000 range,” they said. “A sustained hold in this zone would reinforce bullish momentum by strengthening buyer confidence. This, in turn, could attract fresh liquidity through higher ETF inflows and reduced selling pressure, supporting further accumulation to the upside.” U.S. asset manager Bitwise forecasts a surge in crypto-linked ETFs, predicting 100+ new products could launch in the U.S. by 2026. #ETFs #Bitwise https://t.co/R4eJ2LV8Yb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 18, 2025 Some market watchers used the pullback to push a longer-term use case story. Dom Harz, co-founder of BOB, said Bitcoin’s fluctuations this week do not diminish its long-term potential. “Despite holding almost $2 trillion in market capitalization, the vast majority of BTC remains dormant, with about 0.3% actively deployed in native Bitcoin DeFi,” he said. “This untapped liquidity represents a transformative opportunity to put the asset to work for lending, borrowing, and yield generation, while BTC collateral remains natively secured on Bitcoin.” Inflation Keeps Pressure On BOJ As Yen Stability Hangs In Balance In rates, Fed pricing moved only marginally after the inflation data, with a January cut implied at 27%, while March nudged up to 58% from 54% before the release. Japan took centre stage in Asia. Markets implied around a 90% chance the BOJ would lift its policy rate by a quarter point to 0.75% later Friday, and traders watched closely for guidance on how far policymakers may want to go next. Investors currently wager on just one additional move to 1.0% in 2026. Any hint of a steeper path could steady the embattled yen, while adding pressure to government bonds. Data released on Friday showed Japan’s core CPI rose 3.0% in November, unchanged from the previous month, keeping inflation in focus heading into the BOJ decision. Equities tracked the improving tone. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.6%, South Korea climbed 1.2% after strong results from chipmaker Micron Technology, and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.2%. Central Bank Signals Complicate Global Bond And FX Trades In the US, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures held flat after the overnight rebound, and bond markets reacted cautiously to the CPI report. Ten-year Treasury yields sat around 4.126%, below a recent 3-1/2-month high of 4.2%. Central bank divergence added another thread for global markets. British bonds fell after the Bank of England cut rates as expected, but only after a tight 5-4 vote, while policymakers signalled caution on the pace of future easing and markets pushed the next fully priced cut out to June. The European Central Bank took an even tougher line, holding rates at 2.0% and signalling a likely end to its easing cycle, with markets implying only a small chance of any cut through 2026. Sweden and Norway also kept policy steady, although Norway left the door open to one or more cuts.

From an April low of $75,000 to an early October high of $126,000, Bitcoin moved about 68%. Nvidia, by contrast, swung roughly 120% from a low near $94 in April to $207 in late October. Those numbers show a clear gap in how rough the ride has been this year. Volatility Comparison Shows Shift Based on reports from Bitwise, Bitcoin will likely be calmer than Nvidia in 2026. “BTC already less volatile than Nvidia in 2025 … thanks to institutional inflows & ETFs,” Bitwise said in an X post. That change is linked to more traditional money coming in through products such as spot ETFs and other institutional channels. In short: more big, steady investors are in the mix now, and that tends to smooth out wild swings. Bitcoin maturing fast!

It expects a new all-time high and a break from the old four-year cycle. The firm listed several reasons: the halving, shifts in interest-rate cycles, and weaker boom-and-bust forces than in past runs. The company named big institutions — Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch — as potential new entrants, and it said allocations to spot crypto ETFs should rise. Bitwise added that onchain work could speed up too, and that crypto equities might beat tech stocks in returns. Long-Time Holders Are Selling Reports have disclosed heavy selling from long-term holders, a trend that complicates the bullish story. K33 Research found about 1.6 million coins that had been idle for at least two years moved since early 2023. That amount is worth roughly $140 billion. In 2025 alone, nearly $300 billion of coins that had been dormant for over one year returned to the market, according to K33 and CryptoQuant data. CryptoQuant also flagged one of the heaviest long-term holder distributions seen in more than five years in the past 30 days. Chris Newhouse, director of research at Ergonia, described the flow as a “slow bleed” caused by steady selling into thin bids, which can create a long, grinding fall that is not easy to reverse. Market Divergence And Near-Term Pressure The split with equities is clear. Nvidia shares are up about 27% year-to-date. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is down roughly 8% so far this year and has dropped nearly 30% from its record above $126,000. That gap shows crypto is not always moving with big tech. Selling by long-term holders is one reason prices are under pressure even while some investors push for fresh gains.

Metals Rally, Hit New Highs Silver’s advance has been dramatic. It is up roughly 120-130% year-to-date, a jump that outpaces gold by a wide margin. Traders point to a mix of stronger industrial demand from solar and electronics, tighter supplies, and flows into safe assets as reasons behind the move. Gold buyers have also been encouraged by signs that US inflation may cool and by shifting expectations for central bank policy, which tends to support non-yielding assets when real yields fall.

Others want exposure linked to real economy needs. Both forces are at work. Analysts say silver’s dual role — as an industrial metal and as a store of value — is amplifying moves. Energy prices and supply reports have added pressure on markets, and that has upped demand for physical metal in several trading hubs. Bitcoin Slips Under Key Level Bitcoin fell below $89,000 and was trading nearer to $88,450 in mid-session, giving back gains from earlier months. Based on reports and market feeds, BTC is about 7% lower year-to-date and roughly 30% below its October 2025 peak above $126,000. Some crypto funds recorded outflows recently, and several traders described market tone as risk-off, which has weighed on digital assets this week. Liquidity, ETF Flows And Sentiment ETF flows played a role. Where money leaves ETFs, prices can feel the impact quickly. Margin calls, profit taking after a volatile run, and investors moving to what they see as safer stores of value have all been cited by sources watching the tape. Technical levels near $84,000 to $85,000 are now being watched for support, while resistance sits close to $90,000 to $92,000.

The bankruptcy estate of Terraform Labs has launched an explosive $4 billion lawsuit against market maker Jump Trading. This Terraform Labs lawsuit alleges that secretive trading actions directly fueled the catastrophic collapse of the Terra ecosystem, sending shockwaves through the entire crypto market. What is the $4B Terraform Labs Lawsuit About? According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the administrator overseeing Terraform Labs’ bankruptcy has filed a monumental complaint. The core accusation is stark: Jump Trading allegedly engaged in undisclosed, large-scale interventions to prop up the price of TerraUSD (UST) during its de-pegging events in 2021 and 2022. The lawsuit claims these actions were not a rescue mission but a profitable scheme that ultimately made the ecosystem’s failure inevitable. How Did Jump Trading Allegedly Profit? The complaint paints a detailed picture of the alleged manipulation. Here are the key actions Jump Trading is accused of taking: Massive Secret Purchases: Executing huge buy orders of UST whenever its price fell below the $1 peg. Artificially Inflating Value: These purchases created a false impression of stability and demand. Extracting Enormous Profits: The lawsuit states Jump earned roughly $1 billion from these activities, profiting from the very volatility it was secretly managing. Therefore, the Terraform Labs lawsuit argues that these actions were not neutral market making. Instead, they were a form of manipulation that deceived the public and contributed to a massive, systemic risk. Why Does This Terraform Labs Lawsuit Matter for Crypto? This case extends far beyond a simple financial dispute. It strikes at the heart of two critical issues in decentralized finance: transparency and market integrity. The allegations, if proven, suggest a major player exploited its position and inside knowledge at the potential expense of millions of retail investors. This Terraform Labs lawsuit could set a powerful legal precedent for how market manipulation is defined and punished in the crypto space, influencing future regulation and exchange practices. What Are the Potential Outcomes of This Legal Battle? The path forward is complex and will be closely watched. First, Jump Trading will vigorously defend against these allegations. The discovery process could unveil private communications and trading data, providing unprecedented insight into the events leading to Terra’s collapse. A ruling in favor of the Terraform Labs estate could lead to massive financial penalties and stricter oversight for market makers. However, a victory for Jump would reinforce the current, often opaque, operational norms in crypto trading. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Accountability This explosive $4 billion Terraform Labs lawsuit is more than a claim for damages. It is a direct challenge to the shadowy operations that can thrive in crypto’s less-regulated corners. The case forces the industry to confront difficult questions about the role of large, influential firms and the true meaning of a free and fair market. Its resolution will undoubtedly leave a lasting mark on the future of cryptocurrency regulation and investor protection. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Terraform Labs suing Jump Trading for? A1: Terraform Labs’ bankruptcy estate is suing for $4 billion, alleging Jump Trading secretly manipulated the price of TerraUSD (UST) for massive profit, which contributed to the ecosystem’s collapse. Q2: How much did Jump Trading allegedly make? A2: The lawsuit claims Jump Trading earned approximately $1 billion in profits from its alleged market-making activities around UST. Q3: What is a “de-pegging” event mentioned in the lawsuit? A3: A de-pegging event is when a stablecoin like UST, which is supposed to maintain a 1:1 value with the US dollar, falls below or rises above that $1 price. Q4: Could this lawsuit affect other crypto companies? A4: Yes. The legal arguments and outcome could set a precedent for defining market manipulation in crypto, potentially affecting how all large trading firms and exchanges operate. Q5: Has Jump Trading responded to the lawsuit? A5: As of the initial filing reported by the Wall Street Journal, Jump Trading has not issued a public statement. A legal defense is expected. Q6: What happens to the money if Terraform Labs wins? A6: Any funds recovered would likely go to the bankruptcy estate to pay back creditors and investors who suffered losses in the Terra/LUNA collapse.

According to Schiff, $DJT constantly invents many things, reflecting that it has no true underlying value. Trump Media and Technology Group Corp (TMTG) was founded by Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss in 2021. On March 26, 2024, TMTG came to the market as a result of a merger with the special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC). The union company was worth $8 billion and began trading under the symbol $DJT. Peter Schiff denounces the financial pivot’s motive DJT began as a social media startup but shifted and became a BTC treasury. $DJT , a company owned by Donald Trump, has little intrinsic value beyond its connection to the President. It began as a social media company, pivoted into a Bitcoin treasury company, and is now merging with a fusion energy company. The constant reinvention makes clear that the… — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 18, 2025 Peter Schiff believes that in the case of $DJT, the transformation of a failed social media platform into a self-assured Bitcoin strategy and a currently merging partner with Fusion Energy proves that the product has never been about the financial underpinnings, but rather about access to political power. In July, $DJT announced that it had amassed approximately $2 billion in bitcoin and assets to track bitcoin as a part of its previously announced bitcoin treasury plan. As reported by Trump Media, the company suffered a net loss of $54.8 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to a $19.3 million loss in the same quarter of 2024, due to an increase in expenses, of which $20.3 million was attributed to legal fees. The third-quarter report showed that revenue fell to $972,900, compared to nearly $1 million in the previous quarter. The stock dropped 61 percent over the year to a share price of $13.10. As of September 30, the company had gained on Bitcoin options worth $15.3 million and owned 11,542 Bitcoins, worth nearly $1.3 billion, which is equivalent to approximately $1.3 billion. Schiff disputes Trump’s claims of a “booming economy.” Peter Schiff warned that U.S. output is “going bust.” He criticized Trump for claiming that the economy was “booming.” Schiff contested the claim. “Donald Trump claims the U.S. has a booming economy. Well, maybe the stock market is booming …the real economy is going bust,” Inflation continues to rise, and every week we learn about more layoffs.” – Peter Schiff , CEO and Chief Global Strategist of Euro Pacific Capital. The S&P 500 has increased by 16% so far this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen by 20%. Schiff stated that the stock market has, in fact, had a great run. Schiff’s concerns about inflation and job losses reflect fundamental economic factors. The U.S. consumer price index rose by 3.0% yearly in September compared to 2.3% in April, when Trump first announced his broad tariffs. In the first 10 months of 2025, companies reported 1,099,500 job cuts, according to a poll. Meanwhile, the news is still dominated by layoff announcements. In reference to the boom of Trump, Schiff called it a fiction and listed the reasons that the economy was going down, including the fact that deficits were exploding. The fiscal year 2025 government expenditure in the U.S. totaled $7.01 trillion, and the government received $5.23 trillion. The 5.23 million led to a deficit of 1.78 trillion. The imbalance has led to the rise in the U.S national debt. The National debt is currently close to $38 5 trillion. According to Schiff, the tract is “completely unsustainable.” He insisted that America’s creditors are getting the same information, which is detrimental to both the dollar and the Americans who hold it. Schiff claimed that foreign creditors of the US are aware that the national debt has reached close to $38.5 trillion. He further claimed that the foreign investors are selling their U.S. dollars and Treasury bonds for this reason. Schiff mentioned that foreign central banks are selling Treasury bonds and purchasing gold instead. Schiff claimed that the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency is about to expire, which will significantly lower living standards in the United States.

The most shocking detail? The vast majority of these crypto liquidations —where exchanges automatically close leveraged positions—hit traders betting on prices going up. This event serves as a stark reminder of the extreme risks in leveraged futures trading. What Are Crypto Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Before we dive into the numbers, let’s clarify a key concept. In perpetual futures trading, you can use leverage to amplify your bets. However, if the market moves against you and your collateral value falls below a certain point, the exchange forcibly closes your position. This is a crypto liquidation . It protects the exchange from loss but can create cascading sell-offs, accelerating price drops. Therefore, understanding these events is crucial for any active trader. The $344M Bloodbath: A Breakdown by Asset The data from the past day paints a clear and painful picture. Long positions—bets that an asset’s price will rise—were overwhelmingly on the wrong side of this move. Here are the key figures that highlight the scale of the crypto liquidations : Bitcoin (BTC): $178 million liquidated, with a staggering 65.59% of those being long positions. Ethereum (ETH): $132 million liquidated, where 58.32% were longs. Solana (SOL): $34.29 million liquidated, with longs making up a massive 82.51% of the total. This pattern shows that a sudden market downturn caught a huge number of optimistic traders off guard, triggering a domino effect of automatic selling. Why Did Longs Account for the Majority of Liquidations? You might wonder why bullish traders suffered so disproportionately. Several factors typically converge in these events. First, a sharp, unexpected price decline can happen due to macroeconomic news or large sell orders. Second, high leverage magnifies losses. A trader using 10x leverage only needs a 10% price move against them to face crypto liquidations . Finally, clustered liquidity at certain price levels means once liquidation begins, it can feed on itself, pushing prices lower and triggering more long liquidations in a vicious cycle. How Can Traders Navigate and Mitigate Liquidation Risk? While crypto liquidations are a market reality, you can take steps to protect your capital. The goal is not to avoid risk entirely, but to manage it intelligently. Use Lower Leverage: Higher leverage offers greater reward but exponentially increases your risk of liquidation. Using 3x-5x instead of 10x or more provides a much larger safety cushion. Set Strategic Stop-Losses: Don’t rely on the exchange’s liquidation price. Set your own stop-loss orders at a level you are comfortable with to exit a trade before a forced closure. Monitor Funding Rates: Extremely high positive funding rates can signal overcrowded long positions, which often precede a squeeze and a wave of long crypto liquidations . Never Over-allocate: Only risk a small percentage of your total portfolio on any single leveraged trade. The Bottom Line: Respect the Power of Leverage The recent $344 million liquidation event is a powerful lesson in market dynamics. It underscores that in volatile crypto markets, leverage is a double-edged sword. While the majority of this pain was felt by longs, the mechanics work both ways. A sharp rally can trigger equally brutal short squeezes. The key takeaway is to trade with caution, manage your risk proactively, and always understand that crypto liquidations are an ever-present danger in the futures market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly triggers a crypto liquidation? A: A liquidation is triggered when the value of your collateral in a leveraged futures position falls below the maintenance margin requirement set by the exchange. The system then automatically closes the position to prevent further loss. Q: Are liquidations always bad for the market? A: They can exacerbate volatility. A wave of long liquidations forces sell orders, pushing prices down further, which can trigger more liquidations in a negative feedback loop. Q: Can I get my money back after a liquidation? A: No. Once your position is liquidated, the loss is realized, and any remaining collateral (if any) is returned to your account. The process is automatic and irreversible. Q: Do liquidations happen on spot trading? A> No. Liquidations are specific to margin and futures trading where you borrow funds (use leverage) to trade. In spot trading, you only lose value if the asset price falls, but your coins are not forcibly sold. Q: Why were Solana (SOL) long liquidations so high at 82.51%?

You must maintain a minimum balance of 444 ASTER tokens across your Aster spot and perpetuals accounts for the entire duration of the RTX listing campaign . Dropping below this balance or transferring tokens to an external wallet will result in immediate disqualification. Therefore, it’s essential to verify your balance before the event starts and monitor it throughout. Once the campaign begins, you can check your eligibility status directly on the official Aster event page. Why Should You Consider Participating?

According to live data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, Bitcoin is currently trading at $86,085.56. This surge isn’t just a number; it represents a powerful wave of optimism washing over the digital asset landscape. But what’s fueling this impressive climb? Let’s dive into the factors behind Bitcoin’s latest price action and explore what it could signal for the future. What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Rally? Several converging factors are likely contributing to Bitcoin’s strong performance. First, institutional adoption continues to grow, with major financial firms increasing their exposure to digital assets. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often lead investors to seek alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Furthermore, positive regulatory developments in key markets can provide the clarity and confidence needed for significant capital inflows. This perfect storm of sentiment and fundamentals is creating a powerful tailwind for the BTC price . Is This a Sustainable Move for Bitcoin? While breaking $86,000 is a bullish signal, investors naturally wonder about sustainability. Key metrics to watch include trading volume and market depth. A rally supported by high, genuine volume is more robust than one driven by thin order books. Additionally, the behavior of Bitcoin in relation to traditional markets provides clues. If it continues to demonstrate a decoupling or acts as a hedge during stock market volatility, the case for a sustained higher BTC price floor strengthens. However, the market remains volatile, and prudent risk management is essential. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors This price movement offers valuable lessons and reminders for everyone in the crypto space. Volatility is Inherent: Sharp moves are standard in cryptocurrency markets. This rally highlights both the potential and the risk. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on price headlines. Understand the underlying technology and market drivers. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For long-term investors, a consistent investment strategy can help navigate unpredictable price swings. Secure Your Assets: As values rise, ensuring your Bitcoin is stored in a secure, non-custodial wallet becomes even more critical. What Does the Future Hold for BTC Price Action? Predicting the exact future BTC price is impossible, but we can analyze the trajectory. The breakthrough past $86,000 sets a new psychological resistance level that could now turn into support. The market’s focus will shift to the next key thresholds. Continued development on the Bitcoin network, such as Layer-2 scaling solutions, also enhances its utility and long-term value proposition. Therefore, while short-term corrections are always possible, the fundamental narrative for Bitcoin appears resilient. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s surge above $86,000 is a significant event that underscores its growing prominence in the global financial system. This isn’t just about a number on a screen; it’s a testament to increasing adoption, evolving market structures, and shifting investor sentiment. The journey reminds us of cryptocurrency’s dynamic nature, offering immense opportunities alongside its inherent volatility. Staying informed, disciplined, and focused on long-term fundamentals is the key to navigating this exciting landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why did Bitcoin’s price jump above $86,000? A: The rally is likely due to a combination of increased institutional buying, positive market sentiment, and Bitcoin’s perceived role as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Q: Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price is so high? A: Investment decisions should be based on your financial goals and risk tolerance, not just current price. Many investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging to invest consistently over time, regardless of price fluctuations. Q: Could the BTC price drop back down quickly? A> Yes, cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. While the trend is currently positive, prices can experience sharp corrections. It’s important to only invest what you can afford to lose. Q: Where is the safest place to buy and hold Bitcoin? A> Reputable, regulated exchanges are good for purchasing. For long-term holding, consider moving your Bitcoin to a private, non-custodial hardware wallet for maximum security. Q: How does this price affect other cryptocurrencies? A> Bitcoin often sets the trend for the broader crypto market. A strong BTC price can lead to increased investor confidence and capital flowing into other digital assets, a phenomenon known as “altcoin season.” Q: What’s the next major price target for Bitcoin? A> Analysts often watch round numbers as psychological barriers. Following $86,000, markets may look toward the $90,000 or even $100,000 levels, but this depends entirely on ongoing market dynamics.

The exchange is challenging their authority to regulate prediction markets, setting the stage for a pivotal conflict between state power and federal oversight. This lawsuit isn’t just about legal technicalities—it’s about who gets to control the emerging world of decentralized finance. Why is Coinbase suing over prediction markets? Coinbase filed lawsuits against Connecticut, Michigan, and Illinois because these states attempted to regulate prediction markets under existing gambling laws. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, made the company’s position clear on social media platform X. He argued that state governments are overstepping their authority by treating these innovative financial tools as casino games rather than legitimate markets. The core issue revolves around jurisdiction. Grewal asserts that prediction markets fall exclusively under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) regulatory umbrella. This federal agency oversees derivatives markets, including futures and options. Therefore, state gaming commissions should have no say in how these markets operate or who can participate in them. What exactly are prediction markets in crypto? Prediction markets allow users to trade contracts based on the outcome of future events. Think of them as financial instruments that let you bet on real-world occurrences using cryptocurrency. For example, you might purchase a contract predicting that a certain candidate will win an election, or that a company’s stock will reach a specific price by a certain date. These markets serve several important functions: Price discovery : They aggregate information from many participants to forecast probabilities Risk management : They allow hedging against various outcomes Information aggregation : They create collective intelligence about future events Innovation testing : They provide data about emerging trends and technologies Unlike traditional gambling, where outcomes are purely games of chance, prediction markets often involve skill, research, and analysis of real-world information. The legal battle over prediction markets jurisdiction This lawsuit represents more than just a regulatory dispute—it’s a fundamental question about how America regulates emerging technologies. Coinbase’s argument rests on the Commodity Exchange Act, which gives the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over futures contracts and similar instruments. The states’ position, however, focuses on consumer protection. They argue that prediction markets resemble gambling because participants risk money on uncertain outcomes. State regulators worry about addiction, fraud, and financial harm to vulnerable populations. This creates a classic tension between innovation and protection that courts must now resolve. Historical context matters here. Similar battles occurred when online poker emerged, with courts struggling to apply old gambling laws to new technologies. The outcome of this case could establish precedent affecting not just prediction markets, but potentially other crypto innovations waiting in the wings. What’s at stake for crypto innovation? The implications extend far beyond Coinbase’s immediate legal concerns. If states prevail, innovation could suffer significantly. Companies might hesitate to develop new financial products knowing that 50 different state regulators could impose conflicting rules. This fragmentation would create compliance nightmares and likely push innovation offshore to more welcoming jurisdictions. Conversely, if Coinbase wins, it could accelerate development in several areas: Decentralized prediction platforms could flourish without state interference New financial instruments based on event outcomes might emerge Research and forecasting tools could become more sophisticated Mainstream adoption of crypto for practical purposes beyond speculation The outcome will signal whether America embraces or resists financial innovation in the digital age. How will this affect everyday crypto users? For regular cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, this legal battle has practical implications. If states regulate prediction markets as gambling, you might face: Geographic restrictions : Services could block users from certain states Additional compliance : More identity verification and reporting requirements Limited access : Fewer platforms willing to offer these services in the U.S. Higher costs : Compliance expenses passed on to users However, if federal jurisdiction prevails, you’ll likely see more innovation, better products, and clearer rules. The CFTC’s approach would probably focus on market integrity and anti-fraud measures rather than treating participants as gamblers needing protection from themselves. The path forward for prediction markets regulation This lawsuit will likely take months or years to resolve, possibly reaching appellate courts or even the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, several developments could influence the outcome: First, Congress might intervene with new legislation specifically addressing prediction markets and similar crypto innovations. Second, the CFTC could issue clearer guidance about its jurisdiction. Third, other states might join the lawsuit or pass their own laws, creating even more legal complexity. The most probable scenario involves a negotiated settlement where states agree to defer to federal authority in exchange for certain consumer protections. However, given the strong positions on both sides, a definitive court ruling seems increasingly likely. Conclusion: A defining moment for crypto’s future Coinbase’s lawsuit represents a crucial test for cryptocurrency regulation in America. The outcome will determine whether innovative financial tools can develop under coherent federal rules or get bogged down in contradictory state regulations. This isn’t just about prediction markets—it’s about whether America can create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation while protecting consumers. The battle lines are drawn between state consumer protection concerns and federal market oversight priorities. Whichever side prevails will shape the next decade of financial innovation. For crypto enthusiasts, this legal drama deserves close attention because its resolution will either open doors to new possibilities or reinforce existing barriers. Frequently Asked Questions What are prediction markets in simple terms? Prediction markets are platforms where people can buy and sell contracts based on whether specific future events will happen. They use crowd wisdom to forecast probabilities, similar to how stock markets reflect collective opinions about company values. Why do states want to regulate them as gambling? States see prediction markets as gambling because participants risk money on uncertain outcomes. Traditional gambling laws are designed to prevent addiction, fraud, and financial harm, so states apply these existing frameworks to new technologies. What authority does the CFTC have over prediction markets? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates futures, options, and derivatives markets in the United States. Since prediction markets involve contracts based on future events, the CFTC claims they fall under its jurisdiction rather than state gambling commissions. How could this lawsuit affect other crypto services? The legal precedent could extend beyond prediction markets to other innovative crypto products. If states gain authority here, they might try to regulate decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, or other services under gambling or money transmission laws. What happens if Coinbase loses the lawsuit? If Coinbase loses, prediction markets might become unavailable in Connecticut, Michigan, and Illinois. Other states might follow with similar restrictions, potentially leading to a patchwork of regulations that makes offering these services nationally very difficult. Can I currently use prediction markets on Coinbase? As of this writing, Coinbase hasn’t launched prediction market services in the United States due to regulatory uncertainty. The lawsuit aims to clear this uncertainty so they can potentially offer these services in the future. Found this analysis helpful?

This historic pivot from its long-standing ultra-loose policy sends powerful ripples across global markets, including the cryptocurrency landscape. For investors worldwide, understanding the implications of this Bank of Japan interest rate decision is now more crucial than ever. What Did the Bank of Japan Just Do? The Bank of Japan increased its key policy rate by 25 basis points, moving it from 0.5% to 0.75%. This seemingly small adjustment carries immense symbolic weight. It represents the highest level for the rate since 1995, effectively closing a chapter on Japan’s decades-long battle with deflation and stagnant growth. This hike is the latest step in a carefully orchestrated normalization process. The journey began in March of last year when the central bank ended its groundbreaking 17-year negative interest rate policy with an initial increase to 0.1%. Gradual hikes followed, reaching 0.25% in July and 0.5% in January, culminating in this latest move to 0.75%. Why Is This Bank of Japan Interest Rate Hike So Significant? For years, Japan stood alone among major economies with its negative rates and aggressive monetary easing. This policy was a cornerstone of global liquidity. Therefore, its reversal is a seismic event. Let’s break down the key reasons this matters. End of an Era: It signals a definitive shift away from crisis-era stimulus policies that have defined global finance since 2008. Global Liquidity Shift: As Japanese yields rise, it may encourage capital to flow back into yen-denominated assets, potentially reducing liquidity in riskier global markets. Currency Market Volatility: A stronger yen can impact global trade dynamics and currency pairs, creating new winners and losers. How Could This Impact Cryptocurrency Markets? Cryptocurrency markets are deeply interconnected with global macro trends. A rising Bank of Japan interest rate influences this ecosystem in several direct and indirect ways. First, tighter monetary policy in Japan could reduce the “carry trade” liquidity that has often found its way into high-risk, high-return assets like crypto. Second, a stronger yen might pressure dollar strength, which historically has an inverse relationship with Bitcoin’s price. However, cryptocurrencies could also act as a hedge against the currency volatility this shift may trigger. For savvy investors, this environment underscores the importance of diversification and understanding macro drivers. It’s no longer enough to watch the Federal Reserve; the Bank of Japan interest rate decision is now a critical piece of the puzzle. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? This policy normalization is not without risks. The Bank of Japan must walk a tightrope. Raising rates too quickly could stifle Japan’s fragile economic recovery and trigger market instability. Moving too slowly, however, risks falling behind inflation and weakening the yen excessively. For global investors, this creates both challenges and opportunities. The challenge lies in navigating increased market correlation and volatility. The opportunity exists in identifying assets that benefit from a stronger yen or those that are resilient to shifting liquidity conditions. Cryptocurrencies, with their non-traditional correlation patterns, may offer unique strategic advantages in this new landscape. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Global Finance The Bank of Japan’s decision to lift its key rate to a 30-year high is more than a routine policy tweak; it is a historic turning point. It closes the book on an unprecedented period of monetary experimentation and opens a new, uncertain chapter for global markets. For cryptocurrency participants, this reinforces that digital assets do not exist in a vacuum. They are part of a complex, interconnected financial world where a Bank of Japan interest rate change can echo from Tokyo to the blockchain. Staying informed and adaptable is the ultimate key to navigating this evolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Bank of Japan’s key interest rate now? The Bank of Japan’s key policy rate is now 0.75%, following a 25 basis point increase from 0.5%. Why is this rate hike considered historic? This hike brings the rate to its highest level since 1995, marking a decisive end to the ultra-loose monetary policy that has defined Japan’s economy for decades. How does this affect the average cryptocurrency investor? It may influence global market liquidity and risk appetite. Tighter policy in Japan could reduce the flow of “cheap” money into risk assets, potentially increasing volatility across all markets, including crypto. Will the Bank of Japan continue to raise rates? The central bank has indicated a gradual, data-dependent approach. Future hikes are likely, but their pace will depend on inflation trends and economic growth. What does a stronger yen mean for Bitcoin? Historically, Bitcoin has an inverse relationship with the US Dollar Index (DXY). A stronger yen could contribute to dollar weakness, which has sometimes been a supportive factor for Bitcoin’s price, though this relationship is complex and not always consistent.

Bitcoin & Ethereum Funding Rates Are Showing Opposite Values In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the Funding Rate has developed for Bitcoin and Ethereum amid the latest market volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Slide To $2,000 If December Closes Below This Level: Analyst Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies saw some sudden price swings during the past day, with BTC’s price first rallying to $90,300 in a blink, but then crashing back toward $86,000 just as quickly. The coin’s decline later extended to $85,300. While BTC returned to about the same levels as before the flash surge, the same wasn’t true about Ethereum. After its rally to $3,000, ETH plummeted to $2,830, before another leg down to about $2,790. Before the volatility storm, the cryptocurrency was trading around $2,920. The difference in price action could be a potential factor behind the divergence that has formed in the derivatives market sentiment as gauged by the Funding Rate. The Funding Rate keeps track of the periodic amount of fees that derivatives traders are paying on all centralized exchanges. A positive value on the indicator is a sign that long investors are paying the short ones, while a negative one implies bearish positions outweigh the bullish ones. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the Funding Rate has changed for Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Funding Rate has been positive for the last few days, indicating that a bullish mentality has been dominant among the traders. This sentiment has been maintained even after the price volatility. Ethereum was also observing a positive value on the Funding Rate prior to the volatility, but unlike for BTC, the trend didn’t last. Since ETH has gone through its quick surge and flash crash, the indicator has turned red, a sign that shorts have started outpacing longs. The fact that bullish sentiment around ETH has weakened, however, may not actually be negative. According to Santiment, highly leveraged long positions have historically led to sharp liquidation events and volatility. This trend was also seen during some recent tops and pullbacks. Thus, considering that the Funding Rate is negative for Ethereum now, the risk of volatility may be lower. That said, Bitcoin’s long-heavy market could still be relevant for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be Sub-$50,000 By 2028 Without Quantum Fix, Warns Capriole Founder As Santiment explains, “all assets will still move with Bitcoin, meaning Bitcoin’s funding rates must stay neutral or go negative in order to justify a clear path back to $100K and for altcoins to rebound.” BTC Price Bitcoin has recovered back to $87,100 following its plunge on Wednesday.

They made this statement at a time when quantum computing is shifting from being a distant concept to a crucial matter this year. Notably, the developers’ efforts aim to prepare the ecosystem for a future that today’s technology cannot guarantee. This announcement followed the Solana Foundation’s release of a statement, in which it announced its partnership with Project Eleven , a tech company specializing in post-quantum security for blockchain. According to the organization, this collaboration aims to determine whether the cryptographic systems established in Solana can withstand the threat of future quantum computers. Several analysts commented on this move. They highlighted that there are heightened worries in the crypto industry regarding these advancements in quantum computing. According to them, individuals believe that there is a high likelihood that these advancements could threaten the safeguard methods blockchains apply to transactions and validators. The Solana Foundation partners with Project Eleven to strengthen its blockchains In an X post , the Solana Foundation stated that, “Quantum computers aren’t here yet, but the Solana Foundation is getting ready for that possibility.” According to the organization, they decided to partner with Project Eleven to assess their readiness for any potential quantum threats and assist with this move. Following this collaboration, reports highlighted that several developers from different blockchains, who like to strengthen their blockchains, ignited debates regarding how their networks can effectively address the dangers caused by quantum computing. In the meantime, the Solana Foundation has made its intentions clear, which are first to introduce post-quantum digital signatures on a test network. Regarding this decision, reports inquired why the organization chose Project Eleven for the plan. Respondingly, the Solana Foundation highlighted that apart from the tech firm primarily focusing on evaluating the risk to Bitcoin, it also carried out an assessment and established a testnet on Solana that utilizes digital signatures developed to be shielded against quantum computers. Sources close to the situation mentioned that this testnet was designed to determine whether transactions that can withstand quantum attacks can operate effectively at the network level with existing technology without causing interruptions. Matt Sorg, Vice President of Technology at the Solana Foundation, commented on the topic of discussion. He claimed that their duty is to ensure Solana remains protected from now on. To illustrate this commitment to protect the blockchain, reports mentioned that recent efforts by Solana developers are built on previous attempts to mitigate the dangers related to quantum computing. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the network successfully introduced an optional wallet feature, known as the Solana Winternitz Vault, in January of this year. The feature utilizes a hash-based signature system designed to protect user funds. This system develops new cryptographic keys intended for each transaction. It also permits users to freely decide if they want to use it rather than changing the protocol itself. “The culture of innovation in the Solana ecosystem will keep going with the launch of a second client and advanced consensus mechanism this year,” Sorg stated. “Initiatives like Project Eleven are important early steps to enhance the network’s strength and maintain Solana’s resilience over time.” Aptos follows Solana’s lead Apart from Solana, other blockchain networks have also reported getting ready to face similar challenges. An example of these networks is Aptos. On the blockchain network, a suggestion known as AIP-137 was submitted. This suggestion aims to launch the network’s first post-quantum signature option, pending approval by token holders. Sources familiar with the situation told reporters that this proposal would further strengthen SLH-DSA. This stateless, hash-based digital signature method is popular among researchers at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. Interestingly, Aptos Labs claimed that once this suggestion is approved, it will not need a full network migration. Following this claim, sources noted that the Ed25519 scheme, which currently manages transaction verification on Aptos, would still be considered the key signature method. For SLH-DSA, they noted that it would be made available as an optional account type, particularly for users seeking post-quantum security. Get seen where it counts.

Todd Snyder, the court-appointed plan administrator for the Terraform bankruptcy, filed a lawsuit in federal court in Illinois seeking $4B in damages from Jump Trading, co-founder William DiSomma, and former Jump Crypto president Kanav Kariya, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. “Jump Trading actively exploited the Terraform Labs ecosystem through manipulation, concealment, and self-dealing that enriched Jump while financially devastating thousands of unsuspecting investors,” Snyder said in a statement. “This action is a necessary step to hold Jump Trading accountable for illegal conduct that directly caused the largest crypto collapse in history.” The Office of the Terraform Labs Plan Administrator has filed a $4B lawsuit against Jump Trading over its direct role in the collapse of Terraform Labs, seeking to hold Jump to account for enriching itself through illicit market manipulation, self-dealing, and misuse of assets.… — Terra Powered by LUNA (@terra_money) December 19, 2025 Terra’s Death Spiral And The Contagion That Followed Terraform’s collapse still hangs over the market. TerraUSD, known as UST, was billed as a stablecoin that would hold $1 through an algorithm tied to its sister token, Luna, known as LUNA. When UST broke its peg in May 2022, the mechanism unraveled and both tokens spiraled toward near zero in days. The wipeout erased about $40B in value and rippled across the industry, squeezing lenders, funds, and exchanges that had treated UST yields and Luna liquidity as deep and durable. Three Arrows Capital was among the first major casualties, with later failures piling up as confidence and collateral evaporated. Terraform filed for bankruptcy in Jan. 2024, and public filings show the estate has recovered about $300M so far for creditors as it unwinds what remains. Claims Of Peg Support And Profits From Terra’s Fall Snyder’s complaint says Jump entered a secret arrangement to support TerraUSD’s peg before the final break and later walked away from the wreckage with outsized gains. Regulators have previously pointed to Jump’s trading in Luna, with the SEC saying in court filings that Jump made about $1B in profit by selling the token. The suit lands after a bruising year for Terraform’s former leadership. The company and Kwon agreed to a roughly $4.5B settlement with the SEC in 2024 following a jury verdict on securities fraud claims. Kwon, once a celebrity founder who mocked critics as UST scaled, pleaded guilty in August 2025 and a New York federal judge sentenced him to 15 years in prison last week.

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has dropped a bombshell prediction, directly linking the Bank of Japan’s monetary strategy to a potential seven-figure future for Bitcoin. His analysis presents a compelling, if audacious, case for a stunning Bitcoin price prediction of $1 million. Let’s unpack the logic behind this bold forecast. What is Hayes’s $1 Million Bitcoin Price Prediction Based On? Arthur Hayes, a respected and often provocative voice in crypto, made his case on social media platform X. His argument hinges on a single, powerful directive: “Do not bet against the Bank of Japan.” Hayes points to the BOJ’s long-standing commitment to negative real interest rates as the core catalyst. This policy, designed to stimulate Japan’s economy, effectively makes holding yen costly over time. Hayes argues this creates immense pressure for capital to seek harder, non-depreciating assets. Therefore, his Bitcoin price prediction isn’t just hopeful thinking; it’s framed as a direct consequence of global monetary flows. How Do Negative Rates Fuel a Bitcoin Surge? To understand this potential chain reaction, we need to grasp the mechanics. Negative real interest rates mean inflation outpaces the nominal interest rate. Savers and institutions see the purchasing power of their yen erode. This triggers a search for alternative stores of value. Hayes forecasts this will lead to two major outcomes: A drastically weaker yen , potentially reaching 200 yen per U.S. dollar. A monumental capital flight into assets perceived as inflation-resistant. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, is positioned as a prime beneficiary. The logic is clear: if Japanese capital, and indeed global capital anticipating further currency debasement, moves even a fraction into Bitcoin, the demand shock could be unprecedented. This forms the bedrock of Hayes’s ambitious Bitcoin price prediction . Is This Bitcoin Price Prediction Realistic or Pure Speculation? While the narrative is compelling, it’s crucial to weigh the challenges. A Bitcoin price prediction of $1 million represents a nearly 15x increase from all-time highs. Such a move would require: Sustained BOJ policy without major reversal. Massive institutional adoption from Japanese and international investors. Regulatory clarity in major markets to facilitate large-scale entry. Furthermore, other macroeconomic factors, like U.S. Federal Reserve policy, would also play a critical role. Hayes’s scenario is a specific, focused lens on one powerful driver, but the real-world path is inevitably more complex. What Can Investors Learn From This Analysis? Regardless of whether the $1 million target is hit, Hayes’s perspective offers actionable insights. It reinforces Bitcoin’s growing narrative as a monetary policy hedge . For investors, the key takeaway is to monitor global central bank actions, not just crypto-specific news. The potential weakening of major fiat currencies like the yen could create tailwinds for decentralized digital assets. Diversifying into Bitcoin can be seen as a strategic move to mitigate the risks of aggressive monetary easing elsewhere in the world. In conclusion, Arthur Hayes has connected dots between traditional finance and crypto in a provocative way. His stunning Bitcoin price prediction of $1 million rests on the premise that the Bank of Japan’s negative rate policy will unleash a wave of capital seeking an exit from currency debasement. While the journey will have volatility, this analysis highlights a fundamental shift: Bitcoin is increasingly analyzed through the lens of global macroeconomics, not just technological adoption. The era of crypto as a standalone asset class is fading, replaced by its integration into the broader narrative of 21st-century finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did Arthur Hayes predict about Bitcoin? Arthur Hayes predicted that the Bank of Japan’s negative interest rate policy could drive Bitcoin’s price to $1 million, alongside a significant weakening of the Japanese yen. How do negative interest rates affect Bitcoin? Negative real interest rates erode the value of holding a currency like the yen. This can push investors to seek alternative stores of value, such as Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply and is seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Is the Bank of Japan still using negative rates? As of the latest updates, the BOJ has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy, though it has made minor adjustments. The core environment of very low rates persists, which is the foundation of Hayes’s analysis. What would Bitcoin at $1 million mean for its market cap? A $1 million Bitcoin price would give it a total market capitalization of approximately $20 trillion, rivaling the current market cap of gold and representing a massive shift in global asset allocation. Should I invest based on this prediction? This prediction is a macroeconomic analysis, not financial advice. Always conduct your own research, understand the high volatility of cryptocurrencies, and consider your personal risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. What other factors could influence Bitcoin’s price? Bitcoin’s price is influenced by many factors, including U.S. monetary policy, regulatory developments worldwide, institutional adoption rates, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment.

Magdaleno Mendoza, a key accomplice in the notorious IcomTech crypto scam , has been sentenced to six years in federal prison. This sentencing by a U.S. court marks a significant victory for regulatory enforcement and a warning to bad actors. But what exactly was this scheme, and how did it ensnare so many investors? What Was the IcomTech Crypto Scam? The IcomTech crypto scam was a classic Ponzi scheme dressed in modern, digital clothing. Operated from at least 2017, promoters like Mendoza lured investors with irresistible promises. They guaranteed daily returns from supposed cryptocurrency trading and mining operations. However, as the Department of Justice indictment revealed, there was no legitimate investment activity. Instead, the operation used money from new investors to pay fake “returns” to earlier ones, a textbook Ponzi structure. How Did the Scam Recruit Its Victims? The perpetrators used a combination of high-pressure sales tactics and the allure of the crypto boom. They targeted communities, often hosting lavish promotional events to build credibility. Here are the key methods they employed: Promises of Guaranteed Returns: Investors were promised risk-free, daily profits, which is a major red flag in any investment. Fake Tech Platforms: IcomTech presented bogus online portals showing fabricated account growth to convince victims their money was working. Recruitment Bonuses: The scheme heavily relied on a multi-level marketing structure, encouraging existing members to recruit others for commissions. This combination created a false sense of security and community, making the IcomTech crypto scam particularly effective and damaging. What Does This Sentencing Mean for Crypto Investors? The six-year prison term for Magdaleno Mendoza is more than just a single verdict. It represents a growing trend of accountability. U.S. authorities are actively pursuing and prosecuting complex digital asset frauds. This case, alongside others, sends a clear message: the legal system is adapting to police the crypto space. For investors, it underscores the critical need for due diligence. If an opportunity sounds too good to be true—like guaranteed daily crypto returns—it almost certainly is. How Can You Protect Yourself from Similar Crypto Scams? Vigilance is your best defense. The aftermath of the IcomTech crypto scam provides hard-learned lessons. Always verify the legitimacy of any platform. Check for proper regulatory registrations, which many fraudulent operations lack. Be deeply skeptical of promises for guaranteed, high returns with no risk. Furthermore, understand that legitimate cryptocurrency mining or trading is complex and volatile, not a source of steady, passive income. Finally, research the team behind a project; anonymous or unverifiable founders are a significant warning sign. In conclusion, the sentencing in the IcomTech crypto scam case is a pivotal moment. It demonstrates that law enforcement can and will dismantle sophisticated digital Ponzi schemes. While it offers a measure of justice for the victims, its true power lies as a deterrent. The era of operating fraudulent crypto schemes with impunity is closing. For the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, such legal actions are necessary steps toward building a safer, more trustworthy market for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What was IcomTech? IcomTech was a fraudulent company that operated a Ponzi scheme by pretending to be a cryptocurrency trading and mining business, promising investors guaranteed daily returns. How much money did the IcomTech scam steal? While the full scale is still being determined, court documents indicate the IcomTech crypto scam defrauded investors of hundreds of thousands of dollars, with some reports suggesting the total could be in the millions. Have other people been charged in the IcomTech case? Yes. Magdaleno Mendoza is one of several individuals charged by the Department of Justice. The alleged mastermind, David Brend, and other promoters have also been indicted, with cases ongoing. Will the victims of the scam get their money back? The court may order restitution as part of the sentencing process. However, recovering funds from Ponzi schemes is often difficult, as the money is typically spent or transferred, leaving little for victims. What are the biggest red flags of a crypto Ponzi scheme? Major red flags include promises of guaranteed high returns, pressure to recruit new members, complex or secretive “strategies,” and the inability to withdraw your principal investment easily. Where can I report a suspected cryptocurrency scam? In the United States, you can report suspected fraud to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), or the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Knowledge is the best shield against fraud. If you found this breakdown of the IcomTech crypto scam sentencing helpful, please consider sharing it on your social media channels. Spreading awareness helps protect others in your community from falling victim to similar sophisticated schemes. Let’s work together to foster a safer cryptocurrency environment.

Bitcoin Shark-Sized Entities Have Been Growing Recently In a new post on X, Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt.₿ has talked about the recent growth in the supply attached to the Bitcoin sharks. “ Sharks ” are defined as the entities carrying between 100 and 1,000 BTC. At the current exchange rate, the range of this cohort converts to $8.7 million at the lower end and $87 million at the upper one. Due to the significant size involved, sharks are considered as a investor group, although they are less influential than the whales (1,000+ BTC). Lately, the supply of the sharks has been following a rapid upward trajectory, as the chart shared by CryptoVizArt.₿ shows. Since November 16th, the Bitcoin sharks have seen their combined balance change from 3.33 million BTC to 3.60 million BTC, reflecting a significant rise of 270,000 tokens. “The key question, however, is whether this reflects genuine net accumulation, or merely internal reshuffling across cohorts, a distinction only deeper on-chain analysis can resolve,” said the Glassnode researcher. By “reshuffling,” CryptoVizArt.₿ is referring to the merging or splitting of holdings that investors sometimes take part in. For example, a whale deciding to break their balance across multiple wallets can register as a decrease in the whale supply, and an increase in the supply of whatever bracket the smaller holdings fall inside. Signs point to something similar being a factor behind the recent Bitcoin shark supply increase. Below is another chart shared by the analyst, this one comparing the trend in the supply of the 100,000+ BTC entities against that of the sharks. The 100,000+ BTC cohort corresponds to the largest of entities on the blockchain, including exchanges, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , and custodial services. From the graph, it’s apparent that the holdings of this group have been declining recently. Interestingly, the amount distributed by the cohort in this drawdown is 300,000 BTC, which is roughly equal to that accumulated by the sharks (270,000 BTC). “This pattern strongly points to wallet reshuffling, not organic accumulation,” noted CryptoVizArt.₿. Since the 100,000+ BTC bracket also includes exchanges, reshuffling out of these platforms (that is, withdrawals) can still point toward positive accumulation. It turns out, however, that the nature of the reshuffling is truly likely to be internal, as Coinbase made internal wallet transfers amounting to a massive 640,000 BTC alongside this trend. Based on the data, the analyst has concluded: The key takeaway is that >90% of the apparent “shark accumulation” is likely driven by internal reshuffling by large custodial entities, rather than net buying by new 100–1K BTC holders. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $87,300, down over 3% in the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin accumulation|Bitcoin Sharks|btc|BTCUSDT|Glassnode,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-19 05:00:23

The bank argued that the stablecoin market cannot be viewed independently, as its growth is closely intertwined with the overall performance of the crypto sector, warning that expectations of a $1 trillion market by 2028 are too optimistic. In its Wednesday report, it revealed that the stablecoin market has swelled by roughly $100 billion this year to over $300 billion, with most of the increase coming from the two largest coins, Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. USDT increased by roughly $48 billion in supply, and USDC by about $34 billion. JPMorgan said stablecoin demand hinges on trading needs JPMorgan maintains that the growth of stablecoins is closely tied to broader cryptocurrency activity. It explained that in the past, the market growth surged during BTC and ETH rallies a nd eased when digital assets slowed. Earlier in the bank’s July report, it had indicated that stablecoin demand is largely driven by trading needs — tokens that are used as cash or collateral in derivatives and DeFi markets, as well as for crypto-native companies to hold unused capital. By then, derivatives exchanges had contributed approximately $20 billion in stablecoins, placing them as the principal contributor to supply growth. In their then report, it added, “The stablecoin universe is likely to continue to grow over the coming years broadly in line with the overall crypto market cap, perhaps reaching $500 billion–$600 billion by 2028, far lower than the most optimistic expectations of $2 trillion–$4 trillion.” On the other hand, Citi still expects the stablecoin market to expand to $1.9 trillion by 2030 under normal conditions and potentially reach as high as $4 trillion in an upside scenario, compared with Standard Chartered’s $2 trillion projection for 2028. JPMorgan just introduced its JPM Coin for institutional clients JPMorgan also cautioned that wider use of stablecoins for payments won’t automatically lead to a bigger market cap, as faster circulation reduces the need for higher outstanding balances. Instead, they anticipate that the greater use of payments would increase the frequency of stablecoins transactions. With USDT’s velocity around 50, they estimate that supporting $10 trillion in cross-border payments would require only $200 billion in stablecoins. Currently, more banks are taking an interest in stablecoins and exploring tokenized deposits. In November, JPMorgan, through its Kinexys unit, even introduced JPM Coin (JPMD) for institutional clients on Base, Ethereum’s layer 2 network incubated by Coinbase . It claimed the move would help both crypto-native and traditional companies transfer funds more quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, it argued that blockchain initiatives such as SWIFT’s experiments could help banks retain their position in international transfers, potentially limiting stablecoins’ use for institutional settlement. Its analysts also noted that CBDC initiatives, including the digital euro and digital yuan, could compete with private stablecoins by offering regulated payment options for cross-border and institutional use. The analysts explained, “In all, we continue to anticipate stablecoin growth broadly in line with the overall crypto market universe over the coming years. Greater usage of stablecoins in payments does not necessarily imply a large increase in the required stock of stablecoins.” Moreover, it asserted that blockchain projects targeting institutional payments could bolster banks by using non-bearer tokenized deposits, at the expense of privately issued stablecoins.

However, the price of its native token hasn’t managed to stage a decisive breakout and remains in red territory on both the weekly and monthly timeframes. One key factor, though, hints that a surge could be knocking on the door. Abandoning Exchanges Earlier this week, PI plunged to $0.19, but in the following days the bulls reclaimed some of the losses, and the price is now hovering around $0.20 (per CoinGecko’s data). While this might represent just a minor resurgence, the recent shift from exchanges towards self-custody methods suggests a more substantial pump could be on the way. Data shows that over 1.2 million tokens have left such centralized platforms in the past 24 hours, typically translating to reduced selling pressure. As of this writing, there are roughly 428 million PI situated on exchanges, with more than half stored on Gate.io. Bitget comes in second with 147.6 million assets. In addition, the upcoming token unlocks are less aggressive than those seen in the last few months. Nearly 165 million coins are set for release in the next 30 days, representing an average daily unlock of around 5.5 million units. PI Token Unlocks, Source: piscan.io Some of PI’s die-hard fans remain optimistic and keep outlining bullish forecasts. Recently, X user Web3_Vibes suggested that the price could head north once it bounces off the support level around $0.192. Others have predicted scenarios where PI reaches the astonishing target of $100 and even beyond. That, of course, seems quite preposterous and even impossible as of now. Some Community Members are Losing Patience Despite the optimism shared above, many industry participants are disappointed with PI’s negative performance. X user pinetworkmembers claimed the project began as an “ambitious idea” but has turned into “years of tapping a button, unclear timelines, shifting goals, and endless ‘coming soon’ updates.” “There’s still no solid utility, no open market confidence, and very little transparency about where this is actually heading. A strong community deserves real progress, not perpetual waiting and recycled promises,” they added. X user Pi Update also stands in the bearish corner. They claimed the token is “starting to look like a case study in hype outrunning execution,” adding that holders continue to wait for basic improvements such as clear tokenomics, real liquidity, and a use case that extends beyond the native ecosystem. In conclusion, the X user argued that vague promises from the Core Team and community enthusiasm can’t unlock the project’s full potential. “Until PI delivers independent price discovery and real-world utility, it feels less like a hidden gem and more like a project stuck between vision and viability,” they stated.

This sharp decline from recent peaks has investors asking one urgent question: is this a dangerous correction or a hidden buying opportunity? What Does the Plunging Crypto Market Cap Mean for Investors? Data from tracking platforms reveals the total crypto market cap now sits near $2.93 trillion. This represents a staggering drop of roughly 33% from its high in early October. Consequently, the mood across trading forums and social media has turned decidedly fearful. This isn’t just a minor dip; it’s a significant pullback that tests the conviction of every market participant. Expert Warnings: Could Altcoins Face More Pain? Prominent crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has outlined a concerning scenario. His analysis suggests that if Bitcoin (BTC) experiences further selling pressure, the ripple effect could be severe for alternative cryptocurrencies, often called altcoins. Altcoins may correct an additional 10% to 20%. Bitcoin’s price action often sets the tone for the entire market. Investors should prepare for potential volatility. Therefore, the health of the broader crypto market cap remains tightly linked to Bitcoin’s stability. The Contrarian Signal: Is Extreme Fear a Good Thing? However, not all data points to doom. Blockchain analytics firm Santiment provides a crucial counterpoint. They report that market sentiment has reached levels of “extreme fear.” Historically, this intense pessimism, especially among retail investors, has often preceded a market rebound. Think of it this way: when everyone is selling in panic, it can sometimes mean the market is nearing a bottom. This creates a classic conflict between short-term fear and long-term opportunity within the crypto market cap trajectory. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Correction So, what should an investor do when the crypto market cap is falling? First, avoid making decisions based purely on emotion. Second, review your portfolio’s risk exposure. Diversification and a clear understanding of your investment horizon are more important than ever during corrections. Remember, the digital asset market is cyclical. While the current crypto market cap decline is significant, it exists within a history of similar volatile periods followed by recovery. Conclusion: A Market at a Crossroads The plunge to an eight-month low for the total crypto market cap presents a complex picture. On one hand, technical analysis warns of further potential downside, particularly for altcoins. On the other, sentiment indicators hint that the prevailing fear might itself be a signal to watch for a turnaround. The path forward will likely be determined by macroeconomic factors and Bitcoin’s ability to find a stable footing. For savvy investors, this volatility is not just a risk—it’s the very environment where informed decisions can separate future gains from losses. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is crypto market cap? The crypto market cap is the total value of all cryptocurrencies in circulation, calculated by multiplying the current price of each coin by its total supply. Why is the crypto market cap falling? The decline is due to a combination of factors including broader economic concerns, profit-taking after a rally, and negative market sentiment driving sell-offs. Should I buy crypto when the market cap is low? This depends on your strategy. Some investors see low market caps as a buying opportunity, but it requires research and risk tolerance, as prices could fall further. How does Bitcoin affect the total crypto market cap? Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Its price movements significantly influence overall market sentiment and the total valuation of the crypto space. What does ‘extreme fear’ in market sentiment mean? It indicates that most market participants are pessimistic and selling. Historically, such extreme fear has sometimes marked potential turning points, but it’s not a guaranteed indicator. How long do crypto market corrections typically last? Corrections vary greatly. They can last from a few weeks to several months, depending on the underlying causes and broader financial conditions. Share Your Thoughts Navigating market volatility is challenging.

That’s precisely what happened to one fortunate solo Bitcoin miner in December, capturing the attention and envy of the entire crypto world. This remarkable event proves that in the decentralized realm of Bitcoin, lightning can still strike. How Did a Solo Bitcoin Miner Win Such a Huge Reward? On December 18th, a lone miner successfully solved the complex mathematical puzzle for Bitcoin block 928,351. For this immense computational effort, the miner received the full block reward: 3.152 BTC, worth approximately $271,000 at the time. This story, first reported by Cointelegraph, is a modern-day gold rush tale. Unlike pooled mining, where thousands combine power to share smaller, frequent rewards, this individual took on the entire network alone—and won. What Exactly Is Solo Mining and Why Is It So Rare? Solo mining is the original, pure form of Bitcoin mining. An individual uses their own hardware to try and validate the next block on the blockchain. However, the chances of success are incredibly slim. Here’s why: Massive Competition: The Bitcoin network’s total computational power (hash rate) is colossal, dominated by huge industrial mining farms. A Lottery with Long Odds: For a solo Bitcoin miner , finding a block is like winning a lottery where the ticket is computational guesswork. High Costs: It requires significant investment in powerful (and expensive) hardware and electricity, with no guaranteed return. Therefore, this $271K win is a stunning exception, not the rule. It’s a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s foundational promise: that anyone, in theory, can participate in securing the network and be rewarded. Can You Still Be a Successful Solo Miner Today? The short answer is: it’s extremely difficult, but not technically impossible. This recent success story will undoubtedly inspire many. However, it’s crucial to approach solo mining with realistic expectations. Consider these key points: Hardware is Key: You need an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miner, which is designed solely for Bitcoin mining. Consumer-grade computers are utterly ineffective. Profitability is Unpredictable: Electricity costs often outweigh potential rewards, especially for a solo Bitcoin miner facing long dry spells. Pool Mining is the Norm: Most miners join a “pool,” combining resources with others to earn smaller, more consistent payouts. It’s the reliable salary versus the elusive jackpot. What Does This $271K Win Mean for Bitcoin? This event is more than just a lucky break; it’s a healthy sign for the Bitcoin ecosystem. First, it demonstrates the continued decentralization and security of the network. If a single entity ever controlled over 51% of the hash rate, they could manipulate the blockchain. The fact that a solo Bitcoin miner can still win reinforces that no single group has absolute control. Second, it serves as a powerful narrative. In a financial world dominated by large institutions, Bitcoin still offers a story where an individual, with enough skill and a bit of luck, can achieve a life-changing reward through a transparent, rules-based system. Conclusion: A Beacon of Decentralized Hope The story of the solo Bitcoin miner and their $271,000 windfall is a thrilling anomaly. It underscores the core ethos of cryptocurrency: permissionless participation and decentralized opportunity. While it doesn’t signal a practical path to wealth for most, it stands as a dazzling testament to the unpredictable and open nature of the Bitcoin network. It reminds us that in the digital frontier, fortune sometimes favors the bold individual. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How often does a solo miner successfully find a Bitcoin block? A: It is exceedingly rare. With the network’s current hash rate, a solo miner might expect to find a block once every few years, if not decades, making this event newsworthy. Q: What did the solo miner actually do to “mine” the block? A: Their mining hardware performed quintillions of guesses per second to find a specific cryptographic solution that would validate a bundle of Bitcoin transactions, thereby adding a new “block” to the blockchain. Q: Is solo mining profitable? A: For the vast majority, no. The high costs of equipment and electricity, combined with the incredibly low probability of success, make it generally unprofitable compared to pool mining. Q: Could this have been a fluke or luck? A> It is almost entirely based on luck and statistical probability. The miner’s hardware got the correct answer in the vast computational lottery before anyone else’s did. Q: What happens to the 3.152 BTC reward? A> The reward, consisting of newly minted bitcoins (the “block subsidy”) plus any transaction fees from that block, is sent directly to the miner’s Bitcoin wallet address, which they control.

Addressing this year’s final press conference on Thursday, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the digital euro is technically ready. “We have done our work, we have carried the water,” Lagarde noted. “But it’s now for the European Council and certainly later on for the European Parliament to identify whether the Commission proposal is satisfactory, how it can be transformed into a piece of legislation or amended.” In September, ECB’s Executive Board member Piero Cipollone set a realistic timeline for digital euro rollout around mid-2029 , calling it “a fair assessment.” He said at the time, “Discussion at the level of member-states is going very well.” Now, with the authorities stressing that the preparatory systems are built, attention is shifting to political institutions to authorize. “We place great hopes in the work that will be done in Parliament, once the Council has determined its views,” Lagarde added. Along with her counterparts from other EU nations, Lagarde has been a “very strong” supporter of this initiative. MiCA-Compliant Stablecoins Are Regarded as Safe: ECB President During the Q&A session, the ECB head dismissed that stablecoins are a threat to Europe’s monetary sovereignty, when the asset class comes under Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) . “We are lucky in Europe to have something that is called MiCAR,” Lagarde said. “It’s the legal framework within which instruments like stablecoins can work and can be supervised and can be regarded as safe.” Besides, she added that regulated stablecoins are “an alternative form of payment,” which might have its own benefits. She also pressed the potential risks around multi-issuance currency for stablecoins, which potentially exposes the reserves. “So on that particular area, I think that we need to be extremely attentive to what the potential risks are for the system itself and for the holders of stablecoins.” Digital Euro to Exist Alongside Fiat Money At the meeting, President Lagarde stressed that the ECB does not aim to be a role model for digital euro. Instead, “to make sure that in the digital age, there is a currency that is the anchor of stability for the financial system.” She reaffirmed ECB’s commitment to keeping euro cash widely available, emphasizing that a digital euro is to complement and not replace fiat money. “In addition to making sure that it is user-friendly, not costly, fast, efficient, private, that it can work online, offline,” she noted. Further, she addressed a data-driven approach to interest rate decisions, adding that inflation is projected to meet the ECB’s 2% target by 2028.

Will Cardano’s ADA token finally break through the $2 barrier in the coming years? As one of the most established blockchain platforms in the cryptocurrency space, Cardano has captured the attention of investors and developers alike. This comprehensive Cardano price prediction analysis examines the factors that could drive ADA’s value from 2026 through 2030, providing you with the insights needed to make informed decisions about this promising cryptocurrency. Understanding Cardano’s Current Market Position Cardano stands as a third-generation blockchain platform that has consistently ranked among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Unlike many projects that rushed to market, Cardano has followed a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach. The current ADA price reflects both the platform’s technological achievements and market sentiment toward its gradual but methodical progress. As we look toward 2026 and beyond, several key factors will determine whether ADA can achieve the elusive $2 milestone that many investors have been anticipating. Technical Analysis: Cardano Price Prediction for 2026 Looking specifically at 2026, our Cardano price prediction considers both historical patterns and future developments. By this time, Cardano’s ecosystem should be substantially more mature, with numerous decentralized applications (dApps) fully operational and generating real usage. Key factors influencing ADA in 2026: Network adoption and transaction volume DeFi and NFT ecosystem growth Regulatory developments affecting the broader cryptocurrency market Technological upgrades and scalability improvements Year Conservative Prediction Moderate Prediction Optimistic Prediction 2026 $1.20 – $1.50 $1.50 – $1.80 $1.80 – $2.20 2027 $1.40 – $1.70 $1.70 – $2.10 $2.10 – $2.60 2030 $1.80 – $2.50 $2.50 – $3.50 $3.50 – $5.00 The Road to 2027: Will ADA Price Show Sustained Growth? By 2027, Cardano’s development roadmap should be largely complete, with the platform operating at full capacity. The critical question for investors is whether the ADA price will reflect this technological maturity. Several scenarios could unfold: Bullish factors for 2027: Mainstream adoption of Cardano-based applications Increased institutional investment in the Cardano cryptocurrency Successful implementation of governance mechanisms Growing developer activity and community support Potential challenges: Competition from other blockchain platforms Regulatory uncertainty in key markets Technical hurdles in scaling the network Market volatility affecting all cryptocurrencies Cardano 2030: Long-Term Vision and Price Potential Looking further ahead to 2030, our Cardano 2030 analysis considers the platform’s potential to become a foundational layer for global financial systems and decentralized applications. The long-term success of any Cardano cryptocurrency investment depends on several macroeconomic and technological trends. Critical developments needed for ADA to reach $2+ by 2030: Mass adoption of blockchain technology in traditional industries Cardano’s successful implementation of its full roadmap Regulatory clarity that supports innovation while protecting users Demonstrated real-world utility beyond speculative trading What Could Drive ADA to $2 and Beyond? The $2 price point represents a significant psychological barrier for ADA price movements. Reaching and sustaining this level would require more than just market speculation—it would need tangible evidence of Cardano’s utility and adoption. Key drivers for reaching $2: Ecosystem Growth : A thriving network of dApps with substantial user bases Institutional Adoption : Major companies and governments building on Cardano Technological Superiority : Demonstrated advantages over competing platforms Market Conditions : Favorable cryptocurrency market trends and investor sentiment Risks and Challenges in Cardano’s Path While our Cardano price prediction considers optimistic scenarios, investors must also understand the risks. The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, and even established projects like Cardano face significant challenges.

In contrast, networks like Aptos are taking proactive steps by proposing opt-in post-quantum signature schemes, as part of the industry shift toward preparation rather than debate as quantum research accelerates. Quantum Computing Fears Quietly Weighing on Bitcoin Concerns over quantum computing are re-emerging as a source of tension in the Bitcoin ecosystem, with some crypto industry executives arguing that the way developers are responding to the issue is beginning to weigh on price action and capital flows. While most Bitcoin developers see the risk as a distant and largely theoretical problem, critics say investor perception matters a lot, regardless of whether the threat is imminent. Adam Back, a long-time cypherpunk and co-founder of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream, wanted to downplay the urgency of the debate in a series of posts on X . Back said it is sensible for Bitcoin to be “quantum ready,” but argued that quantum computing poses no realistic threat for decades. According to Back , the technology is still extremely early, with unresolved research and development challenges, and is unlikely to present any meaningful risks in the next ten years. He also pointed out that Bitcoin’s core security model does not rely solely on encryption in a way that would allow coins to be easily stolen even if certain cryptographic components were weakened. Despite those assurances, some investors and analysts argue that the dismissive tone taken by parts of the developer community is itself becoming a problem. Nic Carter , a partner at Castle Island Ventures, said it is “extremely bearish” that influential developers seem to flatly deny the existence of any quantum risk at all. Carter argued that there is a growing gap between developers and capital allocators, with investors actively looking for solutions while developers are perceived as being in denial. According to him, this disconnect is already contributing to downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Similar concerns were shared by Craig Warmke , a fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, who said quantum risk is slowing capital inflows and encouraging larger holders to diversify their exposure. Warmke explained that non-technical investors may express their worries imprecisely, but said it is counterproductive for technical experts to dismiss those concerns outright. Instead, he argued that developers should focus on addressing how perceived quantum risk is influencing real-world investment behavior. While many in the Bitcoin community believe banks, governments, and other centralized systems will be targeted long before Bitcoin in any quantum breakthrough scenario, critics point out that major corporations and nation-states are already pouring a lot of resources into quantum computing. The involvement of artificial intelligence in also accelerating research. Warmke and Carter both argue that the most constructive path forward is not panic, but preparation. Even if the true risk is close to zero for now, they say the Bitcoin ecosystem would benefit from clearer contingency plans. Aptos Prepares for a Post-Quantum Future Aptos is taking early steps toward quantum-resistant security. On Thursday, the layer-1 blockchain outlined a proposal to introduce post-quantum signatures, to help strengthen how accounts and transactions are secured as quantum research accelerates. In a post on X , Aptos Labs said quantum computing is no longer a purely theoretical risk, and pointed to early discussions around quantum scaling by IBM and the rollout of post-quantum cryptography standards by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. While existing cryptographic schemes are still secure against classical computers, sufficiently powerful quantum machines could one day forge current digital signatures, which could potentially expose account ownership and transaction authorization models. Aptos X post To address this, Aptos developers have put forward AIP-137, an Aptos Improvement Proposal authored by in-house cryptographers. If approved through governance, the proposal would add support for SLH-DSA, a hash-based digital signature scheme standardized under FIPS 205, as an optional account-level signature type. (Source: X ) The feature would be opt-in only, leaving existing accounts unchanged while allowing users who are concerned about future quantum risks to adopt post-quantum accounts. If implemented, Aptos would become one of the first production blockchains to natively support post-quantum signatures. Aptos’ proposal is part of a broader shift in the industry toward precautionary action. Solana recently tested quantum-resistant transactions on a dedicated testnet, while parts of the Bitcoin community are debating quantum-resistant upgrades like BIP-360. Although many developers argue that practical quantum threats are still years away, Aptos’ approach proves that some networks are choosing to prepare early rather than wait for consensus on when the risk becomes immediate.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|RESEARCH|APT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-19 05:30:00

Mike Selig will join as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, while Travis Hill will head the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The chambers also approved a package of dozens of other nominees with a 53-43 vote. Selig will head the CFTC, which is expected to become a leading regulator of U.S. cryptocurrency activity once Congress completes the legislation to grant the agency more authority over crypto. He will succeed Acting Chairman Caroline Pham, who introduced a flurry of pro-crypto policy initiatives during her tenure at the agency. Selig succeeds Caroline Pham in the CFTC 🚨NEW: CFTC and FDIC Chair noms @MichaelSelig and Travis Hill are set to be voted on and confirmed as part of a block of nominees by the Senate at 7:30 PM EST. — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) December 19, 2025 Pham was waiting for a permanent replacement from the financial watchdog to join MoonPay. She planned to join the U.S.-based crypto infrastructure service provider as both Chief Legal Officer and Chief Administrative Officer. Selig’s appointment will enable him to continue working on digital asset policies that he has been pushing as an official at the Securities and Exchange Commission. His appointment also comes as the CFTC is working on several cryptocurrency regulations in the agency’s so-called crypto sprint. The rules include a push for allowing stablecoins to be used in tokenized collateral and to integrate blockchain technology into regulatory language across the agency. The CFTC has also recently been calling for regulated platforms to begin issuing spot leverage crypto products. Derivatives exchange company, Bitnomial, became the first to pursue such an offering. As Selig joins the agency, he will face some changes made by Pham, including the reduction of the CFTC’s five-member commission to a single member. The agency’s previous chair revealed that she plans to leave as soon as Selig arrives, which will make him the only member of the commission. Selig, as the sole member of the commission, may reduce friction in implementing policies. However, it could also pose some legal vulnerability for challenges that the commission’s policies are not being properly instituted. Selig joins the agency as Congress works to pass legislation to overhaul the agency’s powers, granting it formal authorization over wider crypto spot trading. The House of Representatives passed the bill this year, but it’s awaiting the Senate’s approval. Close observers of the negotiations revealed that the Senate Banking Committee may hold a markup hearing for the legislation before the end of the month. Hill seeks to continue his crypto regulatory policies Hill has been serving as the acting chairman of the FDIC and has taken a crypto-friendly stance since then. The agency is working to regulate stablecoin issuers and also has a significant impact on how the crypto sector is banked. Hill spoke at a hearing at the House Financial Services Committee on December 2, arguing that the Biden administration’s stance requires bankers to get approval from government supervisors before engaging in cryptocurrency activity. He acknowledged that the committee undid the policy and removed the prohibitions. “We undid the policy of the past few years. Banks are expected to manage the safety and soundness risk, but otherwise have no prohibitions to serving those industries.” – Travis Hill , Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Hill has also championed digital asset regulatory policies by addressing complaints from the crypto industry regarding debanking. He took a leading role in addressing banks cutting off their relationships with crypto businesses and their executives, which was supported by industry insiders and many of their Republican policymakers. Both positions at the CFTC and FDIC remained two of the most sought-after vacancies in Trump’s pro-crypto administration. The President has already appointed individuals to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Department of the Treasury. Trump has also been revamping the Federal Reserve Board, where his nominee for vice chairman of supervision, Michelle Bowman, took over five months ago. The President has also been pushing to replace Chairman Jerome Powell when his term expires next year.

The Critical Forecast,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chainlink-price-prediction-2025-2030-3/,"BitcoinWorld Chainlink Price Prediction 2025-2030: Will LINK Reach $100? The Critical Forecast As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, one question dominates the minds of investors and analysts alike: Will Chainlink’s LINK token reach the coveted $100 milestone? With Chainlink establishing itself as the leading decentralized oracle network, connecting smart contracts with real-world data, its price trajectory has become a focal point for anyone serious about cryptocurrency investment. This comprehensive analysis examines the factors that could propel LINK to new heights or present challenges along the way. Understanding Chainlink’s Current Market Position Chainlink has solidified its position as the dominant player in the oracle space, with over 2,000 projects integrated across multiple blockchains. The network’s unique value proposition lies in its ability to provide tamper-proof data feeds to smart contracts, enabling everything from DeFi applications to insurance products and gaming platforms. As of current market conditions, LINK maintains a strong position among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, but the real question investors are asking revolves around its future potential. Chainlink Price Prediction for 2025 Looking toward 2025, several factors will influence LINK’s price trajectory. The continued expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the growing adoption of smart contracts across industries create a strong foundation for Chainlink’s growth. Market analysts consider multiple scenarios: Scenario Price Range Key Drivers Conservative $25-$40 Moderate DeFi growth, steady adoption Moderate $40-$65 Strong institutional adoption, new partnerships Bullish $65-$85 Mass adoption of smart contracts, major enterprise integration The critical factor for 2025 will be Chainlink’s ability to maintain its market dominance against emerging oracle competitors while expanding into new verticals beyond DeFi. LINK Price Forecast for 2026 By 2026, the cryptocurrency market is expected to have matured significantly, with clearer regulatory frameworks and broader institutional participation. For LINK specifically, several developments could drive price appreciation: Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) adoption reaching critical mass Expansion into traditional finance through tokenized assets Increased adoption in enterprise blockchain solutions Growth of decentralized insurance and prediction markets Analysts project that if these developments materialize as expected, LINK could trade in the $50-$80 range by 2026, with the potential for breakout performance if market conditions are exceptionally favorable. Cryptocurrency Forecast Through 2030 The long-term outlook for Chainlink depends on fundamental technological adoption rather than short-term market speculation. By 2030, the global blockchain market is projected to reach trillions of dollars in value, with smart contracts becoming ubiquitous across industries. Chainlink’s position as the leading oracle solution could translate into substantial value appreciation for the LINK token. Key considerations for the 2030 forecast include: Total value secured by Chainlink oracles Number of active node operators and data providers Market share in the oracle space Revenue generation through service fees Competitive landscape and technological innovation Will Chainlink Adoption Drive Price Growth? The relationship between adoption and price is fundamental to understanding LINK’s potential. Chainlink’s adoption metrics provide crucial insights: Adoption Metric Current Status Growth Potential Project Integrations 2,000+ Exponential growth expected Data Feeds 1,000+ Expansion into new data types Blockchain Networks 15+ Multi-chain expansion continuing Total Value Secured Billions Potential for trillions Each new integration represents potential increased demand for LINK tokens, which are required for node operator collateral and network services. This creates a fundamental economic relationship between adoption and token value. The Path to $100: Realistic or Speculative? The $100 price target represents approximately a 10x increase from current levels. Achieving this milestone would require: Significant expansion of the total addressable market for oracle services Maintenance of Chainlink’s dominant market position Favorable cryptocurrency market conditions Successful execution of Chainlink’s roadmap, including CCIP and staking v2 Increased utility and demand for LINK tokens beyond speculative trading While challenging, the $100 target is within the realm of possibility given Chainlink’s strong fundamentals and the projected growth of the blockchain industry. Risks and Challenges in Chainlink’s Future No investment comes without risks, and Chainlink faces several potential challenges: Competition: Emerging oracle solutions could capture market share Regulation: Changing regulatory landscapes could impact operations Technical Risks: Smart contract vulnerabilities or oracle failures Market Risks: Broader cryptocurrency market volatility Adoption Risks: Slower-than-expected adoption of blockchain technology Investors must weigh these risks against the potential rewards when considering LINK as part of their portfolio. Expert Opinions and Market Sentiment Industry experts offer varied perspectives on Chainlink’s future. Many analysts point to Chainlink’s first-mover advantage and established network effects as key strengths. The development team’s consistent delivery of roadmap milestones has built confidence among long-term investors. Market sentiment generally remains positive, particularly among those who believe in the long-term growth of decentralized applications and smart contract adoption. Conclusion: The Decisive Factor for LINK’s Future Chainlink’s journey toward $100 depends on one critical factor: real-world utility translating into sustained demand for its services. While short-term price movements will inevitably be influenced by market sentiment and broader cryptocurrency trends, the long-term value proposition rests on Chainlink’s ability to become the indispensable infrastructure layer for the smart contract economy. The network’s technical advantages, growing adoption, and expanding use cases provide a solid foundation for future growth, but investors should maintain realistic expectations and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.

56021955,646863,1766124012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56021955.jpeg,Crypto Crime Escalates: Chainalysis Data Shows Over $3.4 Billion Stolen This Year,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-crime-chainalysis-shows-3-4-billion-stolen/,"In a recent crypto crime report, blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis has uncovered a troubling trend in crypto theft. As of now, over $3.4 billion worth of digital assets has been stolen, surpassing the total amount reported in the previous year. Notably, North Korean hackers have been implicated in the majority of these thefts. Crypto Theft Escalates The report , published on Thursday, highlights significant alterations in how these thefts are occurring. One alarming statistic shows that compromises of personal wallets have surged, escalating from just 7.3% of the overall stolen value in 2022 to a staggering 44% in 2024. Even if the Bybit attack hadn’t dramatically skewed the figures, the share for 2025 would still stand at 37%. Meanwhile, centralized services are facing increasing losses due to private key compromises. Although such compromises are comparatively infrequent, their scale often accounts for a vast majority of stolen volumes. In fact, private key compromises were responsible for an overwhelming 88% of losses in the first quarter of the year. Chainalysis also noted a stark escalation in the scale of these attacks, with the ratio between the largest hack and the median of all incidents exceeding 1,000 times for the first time in 2025. This implies that funds taken in the largest hacks are now 1,000 times greater than those stolen in typical incidents—a worrying trend that eclipsed even the peak activity during the 2021 bull market. Record-Breaking Year For DPRK Theft The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) continues to be the most formidable nation-state threat to cryptocurrency security, claiming a record year for digital asset theft despite a substantial decrease in the reported frequency of attacks. In 2025, North Korean hackers reportedly stole at least $2.02 billion in cryptocurrency, signifying a 51% increase from the previous year. This is the highest value ever recorded for DPRK-related crypto theft, with these attacks contributing to a record 76% of all service compromises. The rise in stolen funds can be attributed in part to the DPRK’s tactics. Cybercriminals linked to the regime have increasingly embedded IT workers within cryptocurrency services, allowing them privileged access to high-impact compromises. However, a notable evolution in strategy has emerged: DPRK operatives are now impersonating recruiters for well-known Web3 and artificial intelligence (AI) firms. This approach involves orchestrating fake hiring processes, which culminate in technical screenings intended to harvest sensitive credentials, source code, and access to systems at current employers. 158,000 Cases Logged In 2025 In a significant finding, the report indicates that personal wallet compromises in 2025 accounted for 20% of the total value stolen. This marks a decline from 44% in 2024, reflecting an evolution in the types and scales of attacks. The number of theft incidents skyrocketed to 158,000 in 2025, a threefold increase from the 54,000 recorded in 2022, while unique victims surged from 40,000 to at least 80,000 in the same timeframe. Despite this increase in incidents and victims, the total value stolen from individual victims has decreased from $1.5 billion in 2024 to $713 million in 2025. This suggests a shift in focus, where attackers target a larger number of users but steal smaller amounts per person.

According to a Bloomberg report, which cited sources familiar with the discussions, MoonPay is close to finalizing this fundraising round and is targeting a valuation around $5 billion. New Regulatory Approval And Investment Talks Based in New York, MoonPay specializes in simplifying the trading of cryptocurrencies through various payment methods, including PayPal, Apple Pay, and Venmo. The platform also offers tools for users to send, receive, and manage stablecoins. Notably, MoonPay recently obtained a Limited Purpose Trust Charter from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), a significant regulatory approval that complements its existing BitLicense. Related Reading: Bitwise’s 2026 Crypto Forecast: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Poised For New Record Highs This charter enables MoonPay to expand its custody and other crypto services within New York, placing the company in league with established players like Coinbase (COIN) and PayPal, which also operate under the state’s strict digital asset regulations. The momentum for MoonPay continues to build, particularly with news that Caroline Pham, the acting chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), plans to join the firm as its chief legal and administrative officer. CFTC Chair Caroline Pham to Join MoonPay Pham has been a notable figure in the regulatory landscape, having served on the CFTC’s board since April 2022 and becoming acting chair in January 2025. She announced her intention to return to the private sector once a permanent chair was confirmed, which is expected to happen this week with Mike Selig’s anticipated confirmation. Under Pham’s leadership, the CFTC expedited several initiatives focused on cryptocurrencies, including the allowance for spot crypto trading on futures exchanges and the launch of a digital assets pilot program permitting the use of assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in derivatives markets. Additionally, Pham implemented various operational changes within the CFTC, reportedly leading to nearly $50 million in annual savings by enhancing governance and accountability. Related Reading: Optimism Grows In Crypto Market Structure Bill After Wednesday’s Senate Banking Meeting Pham articulated that her agenda as acting chair concentrated on executing a range of presidential executive orders aimed at promoting regulatory clarity and efficiency across government agencies. Reflecting on her decision to join MoonPay, she emphasized the importance of people in her career choices, stating that meaningful connections guide her decisions. Her connection to MoonPay began through a dinner hosted by Christie’s Art + Tech in 2023, where she met MoonPay’s president, Keith Grossman. A conversation that started at the dinner evolved into a friendship and later professional discussions as Pham considered her options post-government.

Some market watchers have affirmed that the flagship crypto may continue to have a disappointing end-of-year rally and potentially reach new lows before the pain is over. Related Reading: Did Crypto Investors Stop Believing In The Four-Year Cycle? Analyst Weighs In New Lows Before A 2026 Recovery? On Thursday, Bitcoin attempted to break past a crucial level after surging 2.9% from its daily opening. The cryptocurrency has been unable to reclaim $89,000-$90,000 area since the start-of-week correction, which sent the price to a two-week low of $85,145. Notably, the flagship crypto retested the crucial resistance area twice in the past 24 hours but has been rejected, falling back to the local lows. Market observer Ted Pillows highlighted that BTC has been holding above the $85,000 support zone despite the volatility, which could lead to another retest of the key $90,000-$92,000 zone if it holds. However, if price break below local support zone, Bitcoin would likely see a retest of the November lows, around the $80,000 mark. Ted also pointed out that the cryptocurrency may be mirroring its Q1 2025 price action, which suggests that a price drop below the recent lows could happen. Per the chart, BTC briefly bounced in March from its early 2025 correction before recording a lower low in the next few weeks. This was then followed by the Q2 and Q3 recovery rallies that propelled the price to its latest all-time high (ATH) of $126,000. Now, Bitcoin displays a similar performance, currently recovering from the initial corrective phase. If history repeats, the flagship crypto could see a 10%-15% drop to the $74,000-$76,000 area in the coming weeks before kicking off a rally toward new highs in 2026, the analyst suggested. Bitcoin To Continue With ‘No Direction’ Similarly, Ali Martinez affirmed that the cryptocurrency is at an inflection point and risks dropping up to 20% if the $87,000 support doesn’t hold. He explained that BTC is breaking out of a bear flag, which could target the $70,000 level if selling pressure spikes. Meanwhile, another analyst considers that “sentiment [is] flipping based on every last daily candle colour.” Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that Bitcoin has been trading within the $84,000-$93,500 for the past four weeks, “moving up and down in a choppy fashion, while trading in between these two larger levels.” To the trader, the next few weeks will continue to be “generally very choppy and lack direction” due to lower liquidity and trading volume during the holiday season. “I don’t think you’d be missing much if you log off and come back somewhere early January,” he added. Related Reading: XRP Price Must Defend This Level To Avoid 50% Breakdown, Analyst Warns On the contrary, analyst Crypto Jelle affirmed that despite the low-timeframe struggles, Bitcoin “still flat out refuses to drop lower, no matter how hard bears try.” He noted that price still sits “on a clear weekly support level” that has held since April, explaining that as long as this area holds, price can still reclaim the monthly opening, around the $90,300 area. As of this writing, BTC trades at $86,138 a 5.3% decline in the weekly timeframe.

On Thursday, the firm submitted a Form S‑1 to launch the “Bitwise Sui ETF,” officially registering the product with the SEC and taking the initial step toward bringing the fund to market. Reflecting growing institutional interest in SUI, the filing positions the token among digital assets pursuing approval as spot-based investment products in the U.S. If approved, the ETF would allow investors to gain direct exposure to SUI through regulated markets, without the need to hold the token themselves. Bitwise moves to secure spot Sui ETF approval The ETF essentially follows the spot price of SUI (the native token of the Sui Network), the filing states. Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain , introduced in mid-2023, that aims to accelerate transaction rates and provide scalable digital asset ownership. Bitwise has not yet selected a ticker symbol for the ETF, should it receive approval for trading. Coinbase Custody is expected to serve as the fund’s custodian, continuing its role as a leading provider of crypto ETF services in the U.S. Despite a surge in crypto ETFs this year, no spot SUI ETF has yet launched domestically. Other firms are also working to fill that gap, with Canary Capital and 21Shares having filed for spot SUI ETFs in March and April, respectively. Everybody is talking about these new stocks, particularly the 21Shares application, as the market awaits the SEC’s decision next month. The SEC approved a 21Shares 2x leveraged SUI ETF in early May. A slew of new crypto ETFs have been listed recently, following the regulator’s creation of generic listing standards, which have made it easier for listings to occur across the industry. Bitwise accelerates expansion of crypto ETF products Bitwise is also expanding its crypto ETF lineup as the regulatory environment improves. Earlier this month, the firm added SUI to the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The addition signals Bitwise’s increased confidence in the Sui Network’s sustainability. The firm has recently described Sui as a blockchain that accelerates, is private, secure, and facilitates easy digital asset ownership. It aligns with Bitwise’s approach of backing networks that can drive genuine adoption at scale. Outside Sui, Bitwise is already selling spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. That move solidified its place in the ETF market but also created its spot XRP ETF this year to broaden its exposure to the highest-value crypto assets. Bitwise executives are forecasting a surge in crypto ETF launches. Bitwise researcher Ryan Rasmussen, in a recent interview with the Bankless podcast, said the firm is betting on ‘faster growth’ in 2026. He said over 100 crypto ETF products could emerge in rapid succession as issuers scramble for market share. “And now we’re going to accelerate forward at crazy speed,” Rasmussen said. With a market capitalization of around $4.98 billion, SUI is now the 31st largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Spot ETFs could drive massive demand for a token by increasing the exposure offered to a wider swath of investors. Besides Bitwise, other platforms have also extended their application to the SEC, awaiting approval. With the current SEC leadership, the processes might be faster.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors and enthusiasts are closely watching Bitcoin SV (BSV) for signs of significant growth. The burning question on everyone’s mind: Can BSV reach the elusive $100 mark in the coming years? This comprehensive analysis explores the factors that could drive Bitcoin SV price prediction models and examines whether BSV cryptocurrency has what it takes to achieve this ambitious target. Understanding Bitcoin SV and Its Market Position Bitcoin SV, which stands for ‘Satoshi Vision,’ emerged from a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash in 2018. The project aims to restore what its creators believe was the original Bitcoin protocol as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that prioritize smart contracts and decentralized applications, BSV focuses on scalability, stability, and security for peer-to-peer electronic cash transactions. Key characteristics of BSV cryptocurrency include: Massive block size capacity (currently supporting up to 4GB blocks) Low transaction fees designed for microtransactions Protocol stability to encourage enterprise adoption Focus on data storage and enterprise blockchain solutions Current BSV Price Analysis and Market Performance Before diving into future predictions, it’s crucial to understand where BSV stands today. The cryptocurrency has experienced significant volatility since its inception, with notable peaks and troughs that reflect broader market trends and project-specific developments. Recent performance factors influencing BSV price include: Overall cryptocurrency market sentiment and Bitcoin dominance Regulatory developments affecting cryptocurrency adoption Enterprise partnerships and real-world use cases Technical developments within the BSV ecosystem Competition from other scalable blockchain solutions Bitcoin SV Price Prediction 2025: The Critical Year 2025 represents a pivotal year for BSV cryptocurrency according to most analysts. Several factors could converge to create favorable conditions for price appreciation. The Bitcoin SV price prediction for 2025 largely depends on adoption metrics, technological milestones, and market conditions. Potential catalysts for BSV price growth in 2025: Factor Potential Impact Probability Enterprise Adoption High – Could drive sustained demand Medium Regulatory Clarity Medium – Could improve investor confidence High Technical Scaling High – Successful implementation of roadmap Medium-High Market Cycle Position Variable – Depends on broader crypto cycle Unknown BSV Forecast 2026-2030: Long-Term Prospects Looking beyond 2025, the BSV forecast becomes increasingly dependent on fundamental adoption rather than speculative trading. The period between 2026 and 2030 will test whether Bitcoin SV can establish itself as a viable enterprise blockchain solution. Critical questions for long-term BSV price prediction: Will enterprises adopt BSV for large-scale data management? Can BSV maintain its technical advantages as competitors evolve? How will regulatory frameworks affect BSV’s utility value? What role will BSV play in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem? Will BSV Price Hit $100? The Path to Triple Digits The $100 target represents more than just a psychological barrier for BSV cryptocurrency—it would signify substantial growth and market validation. Achieving this milestone requires a combination of favorable market conditions and project-specific successes. Three potential scenarios for BSV reaching $100: Bull Case Scenario: Widespread enterprise adoption combined with favorable regulatory environment and strong market cycle could propel BSV well beyond $100 by 2027-2028. Base Case Scenario: Steady growth in adoption and gradual market recognition could see BSV approach $100 by 2030, with potential for breakthrough if key partnerships materialize. Bear Case Scenario: Limited adoption, increased competition, or regulatory challenges could keep BSV below $50 throughout the prediction period, with $100 remaining out of reach. Factors That Could Accelerate BSV Price Growth Several developments could significantly impact the Bitcoin SV price prediction timeline. While no single factor guarantees success, their combination could create powerful momentum for BSV cryptocurrency. Key accelerators for BSV price appreciation: Major Enterprise Partnerships: Adoption by Fortune 500 companies for blockchain solutions Regulatory Tailwinds: Clear, favorable regulations for enterprise blockchain applications Technical Breakthroughs: Successful implementation of scaling solutions that outperform competitors Ecosystem Growth: Vibrant developer community creating valuable applications on BSV Market Sentiment Shift: Renewed interest in scalable, utility-focused cryptocurrencies Risks and Challenges for BSV Cryptocurrency No BSV forecast would be complete without considering potential obstacles. Understanding these risks is crucial for developing a balanced Bitcoin SV price prediction. Primary challenges facing BSV: Intense competition from other scalable blockchain platforms Regulatory uncertainty in key markets Technical complexity of maintaining massive block sizes Market perception and community fragmentation from previous forks Dependence on broader cryptocurrency market cycles Expert Opinions and Analytical Models for BSV Price Prediction Various analytical approaches contribute to the BSV forecast landscape. While predictions vary, examining different methodologies provides valuable perspective on potential outcomes. Common analytical approaches for Bitcoin SV price prediction: Methodology 2025 Prediction Range 2030 Prediction Range Technical Analysis $45-$85 $75-$150 Fundamental Analysis $35-$70 $60-$120 Adoption-Based Models $40-$90 $80-$200+ Market Cycle Analysis $30-$65 $50-$110 Actionable Insights for BSV Investors Based on our comprehensive Bitcoin SV price prediction analysis, several strategic considerations emerge for potential investors and current BSV holders. Strategic recommendations: Monitor enterprise adoption metrics more closely than price movements Diversify cryptocurrency investments while maintaining exposure to promising utility tokens Pay attention to regulatory developments in jurisdictions important for enterprise blockchain Consider dollar-cost averaging rather than timing the market Stay informed about technical developments within the BSV ecosystem Frequently Asked Questions About BSV Price Prediction What is Bitcoin SV and how does it differ from Bitcoin? Bitcoin SV is a cryptocurrency that resulted from a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash in 2018. It aims to restore what its proponents believe was Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision for Bitcoin, focusing on massive scalability for electronic cash transactions rather than smart contracts or decentralized applications. Who created Bitcoin SV? Bitcoin SV was created by nChain , a blockchain research and development company, with Craig Wright claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto and leading the project’s development philosophy. What factors most influence BSV price? The BSV price is influenced by enterprise adoption, regulatory developments, technical achievements, broader cryptocurrency market trends, and competition from other blockchain platforms. Is BSV a good long-term investment? As with any cryptocurrency investment, BSV carries significant risk. Its long-term potential depends largely on enterprise adoption of its blockchain for data management and transactions. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance. How can I stay updated on BSV developments? Follow official channels including the Bitcoin SV website , monitor enterprise partnerships, and track development activity on the blockchain. Reputable cryptocurrency news sources also provide regular updates. Conclusion: The Verdict on BSV’s $100 Potential The journey to $100 for Bitcoin SV represents more than just a price target—it symbolizes the project’s potential to achieve meaningful adoption and utility value. Our comprehensive Bitcoin SV price prediction analysis suggests that while the path contains significant challenges, the $100 milestone remains within reach under favorable conditions. The BSV forecast ultimately depends on the project’s ability to deliver on its promise of scalable enterprise blockchain solutions and navigate the evolving cryptocurrency landscape successfully. The most compelling aspect of BSV cryptocurrency isn’t just its price potential, but its ambitious vision for blockchain utility. Whether BSV reaches $100 by 2025, 2030, or beyond, its journey will provide valuable insights into the maturation of enterprise blockchain adoption and the evolution of cryptocurrency markets.

Australia’s private sector credit rose 0.6% month-on-month in November 2025, surpassing market expectations of a 0.2% growth but easing from a 0.7% increase in the previous month.

This decision, confirmed by reports from SolanaFloor, marks the end for a once-prominent automated market maker. The closure follows a community vote and triggers a significant wind-down process, including a multi-million dollar distribution to its token holders. Let’s unpack what happened and what it means for the people involved. Why Did the Solana-based DEX Lifinity Decide to Shut Down? The process began on December 10th when a formal proposal to cease operations was put before the Lifinity community. The core question was simple: should the project continue or wind down responsibly? The answer from the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) was unanimous. Therefore, the community voted to shut down the exchange. While the proposal did not publicly detail every reason for the shutdown, such decisions in the competitive DeFi space often relate to challenges like: Sustaining trading volume against larger competitors. Managing operational costs and developer resources. Evolving market conditions that make a project’s unique value proposition less viable. This move highlights the dynamic and sometimes unforgiving nature of decentralized finance, even on robust networks like Solana. What Does the $42 Million Distribution Mean for LFNTY Holders? The most critical immediate effect of this shutdown is the fate of the project’s treasury. In line with the passed proposal, the Lifinity DAO will distribute its entire treasury of $42 million in assets directly to LFNTY token holders. This is a significant act of returning value to the community that supported the project. Holders can expect to receive an estimated amount between $0.90 and $1.10 for each LFNTY token they own. This distribution plan serves as a responsible exit strategy, ensuring that the project’s remaining value benefits its users rather than vanishing. For investors, this payout provides a clear resolution, though the long-term vision for the Solana-based DEX Lifinity has concluded. What Are the Broader Implications for Solana DeFi? The shutdown of a project like Lifinity is a reminder of the inherent experimentation and risk in decentralized finance. However, it also demonstrates a maturing process. The fact that the shutdown was managed through a DAO vote and includes a structured asset distribution shows a move toward greater accountability and community-focused governance. For the Solana ecosystem, the departure of one player does not define the whole network. Solana continues to host a vibrant and growing DeFi landscape with other major DEXs like Orca and Raydium. The closure of the Solana-based DEX Lifinity may even reallocate liquidity and user attention to other thriving protocols on the chain. Key Takeaways from the Lifinity Shutdown This event offers several important lessons for crypto participants: DAO Governance in Action: The process showcased how a decentralized community can make a major, orderly decision. Importance of Treasury Management: The project’s ability to return value hinges on responsible fund management during its operational life. Dynamic Market Landscape: Innovation in crypto is fast-paced, and not all projects are built to last forever. In conclusion, the story of the Solana-based DEX Lifinity is one of both an ending and a responsible conclusion. While the platform will no longer facilitate trades, its finale is structured to honor its community through a substantial financial return. This episode underscores the evolving nature of DeFi, where community governance and transparent wind-downs are becoming crucial aspects of project lifecycles. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is my LFNTY token now worthless? A: No. While the token will no longer have utility for trading on Lifinity, it is the key to receiving the distribution from the project’s $42 million treasury. Holders will receive a payout per token. Q: How and when will I receive the distribution? A: The Lifinity DAO will handle the distribution process. Specific instructions, timelines, and eligible wallets will be announced by the project. Holders should monitor official Lifinity communication channels for details. Q: Why would a project vote to shut down? A> Projects may shut down due to unsustainable economics, low user adoption, high competition, or a strategic decision by the community and developers to allocate resources elsewhere. Q: Does this hurt Solana’s reputation? A> Not necessarily. A healthy ecosystem involves both successes and failures. The responsible handling of a shutdown can actually reflect well on the maturity of the projects built on a blockchain. Q: Can I still withdraw my assets from Lifinity? A> As the platform ceases operations, you should remove any liquidity or assets immediately. The interface may remain accessible for a short wind-down period, but acting quickly is advised. Q: Where should I trade on Solana now? A> Solana has several other large and established DEXs, including Orca, Raydium, and Jupiter. It is recommended to research these alternatives for your trading needs. Found this breakdown of the Solana-based DEX Lifinity shutdown helpful?

New data reveals a seismic shift in global crypto investment, with South Korean investors leading a massive charge. In a stunning display of confidence, their net purchases of overseas crypto stocks have skyrocketed, tripling year-over-year to a colossal $7.14 billion. This isn’t just a trend; it’s a powerful signal of where smart money is flowing in the blockchain era. What’s Driving the South Korean Frenzy for Overseas Crypto Stocks? The numbers are undeniable. From January 1 to December 18, South Korean net investment in foreign cryptocurrency-related equities hit approximately 10 trillion won. This marks a dramatic leap from the 3 trillion won recorded during the same period last year. But what’s behind this explosive growth? Analysts point to a combination of maturing local investors, favorable global regulatory developments for crypto assets, and a search for diversified exposure beyond domestic markets. The appetite for overseas crypto stocks reflects a strategic move to tap into leading global blockchain infrastructure companies. Which Companies Are Capturing South Korean Investment? So, where exactly is this billions in capital going? The investment patterns reveal clear favorites and sophisticated strategies.

This preference for ETFs over direct stock suggests investors are seeking leveraged returns or specific risk profiles through these overseas crypto stocks and related instruments. What Does This Mean for the Global Crypto Landscape? The tripling of South Korean investment is more than a local story; it’s a bellwether for global crypto adoption. This surge indicates that institutional and sophisticated retail capital from major economies is actively seeking regulated, equity-based avenues into the crypto ecosystem. The flow of funds into overseas crypto stocks like Bitmain and Strategy ETFs demonstrates a maturation of investment approaches. Investors are no longer just buying Bitcoin; they are building portfolios around the picks and shovels of the digital economy. However, this boom doesn’t come without its challenges. Investors must navigate foreign exchange risks, differing international regulations, and the inherent volatility of the crypto sector. The concentration in a few stocks also raises questions about portfolio diversification. Therefore, while the trend is powerful, it requires careful due diligence. Actionable Insights for Observers and Investors What can we learn from this South Korean movement? First, it validates the growing institutionalization of crypto. Second, it highlights ETFs as a crucial gateway for mainstream capital. For global investors, tracking these flows can provide early signals for sector trends. If you’re considering similar overseas crypto stocks , focus on companies with strong fundamentals, clear regulatory standing, and a competitive moat in their niche. Always remember to balance high-growth potential with prudent risk management. In conclusion, the South Korean investment surge of $7.1 billion into foreign crypto equities is a landmark event. It underscores a massive, strategic capital allocation towards the infrastructure of the future digital economy. This isn’t speculative fever; it’s calculated positioning by one of the world’s most tech-savvy investor bases. The message is clear: the bridge between traditional finance and crypto is being built, and equity markets are a primary crossing point. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are ‘overseas crypto stocks’? A: They are shares of publicly traded companies listed on foreign exchanges whose primary business is related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, such as mining hardware manufacturers, trading platforms, or ETF issuers. Q: Why are South Korean investors focusing on overseas markets? A> They are likely seeking exposure to leading global crypto firms not available on the Korean exchange, diversifying their portfolios, and potentially responding to different regulatory environments abroad.

His analysis focused on a convergence that has quietly taken shape across Ripple, Wormhole, Securitize, and BlackRock’s tokenized fund infrastructure. Individually, each development appeared incremental. Taken together, they describe a system that now operates end-to-end across multiple blockchains with XRP positioned inside the flow. SMQKE summarized the alignment in direct terms. “The loop is now closed.” The researcher drew attention to Wormhole’s role as the connective layer between BlackRock’s $BUIDL fund, Ripple’s infrastructure, and XRPL. The images he shared illustrate how $BUIDL operates multichain through Wormhole while relying on Securitize for issuance and compliance. Securitize, in turn, maintains close operational ties with Ripple , linking it to XRP. Ripple has officially integrated Wormhole into the XRPL. BlackRock’s $BUIDL platform relies on Wormhole to operate multichain and interoperate across multiple blockchain networks. This infrastructure is supported by Securitize, an institutional-grade custody platform… https://t.co/6SqOUGxk1q pic.twitter.com/EDmoVDLJ8V — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 15, 2025 Wormhole’s Integration Into XRPL Ripple recently confirmed that Wormhole has officially integrated with the XRP Ledger . This matters because Wormhole functions as institutional-grade interoperability infrastructure. Its messaging and transfer standards allow assets and data to move natively across chains without fragmenting liquidity. With XRPL now connected to Wormhole’s network, XRP gains direct exposure to ecosystems such as Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, and Aptos. This expands where XRP-linked liquidity can exist and how it can interact with tokenized assets issued outside the XRPL environment. It enhances utility through liquidity pairs for RLUSD and XRP ( through wXRP ). The integration also aligns XRPL with the same interoperability stack used by BlackRock’s on-chain products. That alignment did not require XRPL to change its core design. It connected XRPL to existing institutional rails. BlackRock, Securitize, and Onchain Finance BlackRock’s $BUIDL fund operates through Securitize, a regulated tokenization platform designed for institutional compliance. Meanwhile, Wormhole enables $BUIDL to function across multiple blockchains while preserving unified liquidity and transfer logic. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Securitize’s platform has long supported Ripple-linked infrastructure. That relationship places XRPL closer to tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) that already attract large capital allocations. The connection shows compatibility at the infrastructure level. XRP’s Role Inside the Emerging Stack The combined effect places XRP inside a multichain financial architecture used by asset managers, stablecoin issuers, and tokenization platforms. XRPL now connects to the same interoperability layer supporting BlackRock’s on-chain fund operations, further linking BlackRock with XRP . SMQKE’s work did not rely on speculation. It assembled documented integrations into a single view. As tokenized finance expands across chains, XRP now sits within that infrastructure, giving it an edge over many competitors.

More often than not, these trading apps are the first point of entry for new users exploring the crypto space. They make it easy for users to engage with digital assets by offering a range of services. However, users are expected to pay some fees when using these services. While this makes sense because these platforms need to generate revenue to run their businesses, understanding how crypto exchange fees work will help users make the most of their trading activities and save money. This article discusses everything you need to know about crypto exchange fees and why they matter. It also highlights ways to reduce these costs, bolstering users’ gains. What Exchange Fees Are and Why They Matter Crypto exchange fees are the costs users incur when buying, selling, or transferring cryptocurrencies. But it goes beyond that. It also encompasses fees from crypto activities such as trading, staking, mining, lending, borrowing, and many more. These fees are revenue that the exchanges use to keep their business running. Each crypto trading platform has its own fee structure, based on several factors, such as transaction type, trading volume, and even a user’s VIP status. Crypto exchanges also charge fees to avoid spam orders. Some malicious users often use bots to place spam orders, which can cause congestion and falsify the platform’s trading volume. When these bad actors realize they would incur fees for executing spam transactions, they may reconsider and stop their actions. When crypto users know exactly how much crypto exchanges charge in fees, they can plan their trading accordingly. It helps them to know how much of their capital is going to the platform. Knowing this, users can determine whether to trade fewer times to reduce the fees they would pay, and hopefully increase their profits. In our guide on crypto trading tips , we pay specific attention to how fees can stack up and chip away from your profits, so make sure to check that out. Not only that, but fees are recognized as an expense. In other words, most of the good crypto tax software will factor them and offset the taxable gain accordingly, so you don’t overpay on your yearly tax bill. Some crypto exchanges may appear to have low fees, while others seem expensive. However, in some cases, these platforms with so-called low fees may have hidden costs. Knowing this is where the real cost-effectiveness lies. Understanding fees will help users compare platforms effectively and make informed choices. Trading Fees: Maker, Taker, and Tiered Structures Anyone who trades on crypto exchanges knows that the most common fees they pay are maker and taker fees. There are also tiered fee structures that reward users for trading frequently. Let’s break each of them down. Maker A maker is a trader who adds liquidity to the market. This happens when you place an order that does not get filled right away, most commonly a limit order. When you place this kind of order, it sits on the order book and becomes part of the pool from which other orders are filled. In other words, you are helping to create a deeper and more liquid market by adding to the list of available orders. Because of that, market makers are typically rewarded with lower crypto fees. Taker A taker is a trader who removes liquidity from the market by buying and selling directly from the order book. This occurs when you place an order that is filled immediately – typically through a market order. When you act as a taker, you remove orders that other traders (makers) have already placed. Hence, you are reducing the number of available options in the market. Because your order is processed instantly and requires the exchange to match and complete the trade immediately, the exchange charges a slightly higher fee for this service. Tiered Fee Structures Crypto exchanges use tiered fee structures to provide trading fee discounts to traders. In this structure, the more users trade on the exchange, the more they become entitled to enjoy higher discounts on fees. This structure also benefits those who trade on exchanges with large amounts. The idea is to incentivize traders to be more active on the exchange and also spend more on trading. Each crypto exchange has its own fee structure. As a result, it is helpful for users to compare the tiered fee structures of different platforms to make wise choices. Deposit and Withdrawal Fees Across Different Exchanges Whenever users deposit or withdraw crypto assets, a fee is often attached. Most crypto exchanges charge a deposit fee when users send fiat money into their accounts, especially via bank transfer, debit/credit card, or other third-party payment platforms. However, funding your account with crypto assets is free for most exchanges. Of course, you will have to pay a network fee, and the amount depends on the assets and blockchain. Withdrawals, on the other hand, mostly come with a cost. Crypto platforms charge withdrawal fees when users transfer funds from their exchange account to their local banks and other crypto platforms. Each crypto exchange has its own unique withdrawal fees. Some charge a fixed fee, while others charge a percentage of the amount withdrawn. That said, let’s take a look at the deposit and withdrawal fees of some of the most popular crypto exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, KuCoin, and OKX. Binance Deposits : Crypto deposits are free. Withdrawals : Binance charges a flat fee for each cryptocurrency withdrawal. However, the fee depends on the network and asset involved. For example, withdrawing USDT via the BNB Chain costs 0.01 USDT, while withdrawing USDT via Ethereum and TRON costs 1 USDT. Bybit Deposits : Crypto deposits are free. Withdrawals : Bybit charges $0-$1 for USDT withdrawals across all networks and 0.00011 BTC ($10) for BTC withdrawals. Coinbase Deposits : Crypto deposits are free. However, fiat deposits may have charges depending on the payment method. For instance, users pay a $10 fee on wire transfers. Withdrawals : Coinbase charges two types of fees when you withdraw your assets from the platform. Network fee: The fee paid to a miner or validator for processing a transaction on the blockchain. The network fee depends on the asset and blockchain, and Coinbase usually displays it at the time of withdrawal. Processing fee: Coinbase charges this fee to process the transaction on its platform. The exchange charges 0.2% (of the transferred amount) for BTC withdrawals via the Lightning Network and 0.01% (of the transferred amount) for USDT withdrawals, capped at 20 USDT. KuCoin Deposits : Crypto deposits are free. Withdrawals: KuCoin charges withdrawal fees based on assets and the blockchain used for the withdrawal. USDT withdrawals, including taxes, can cost as much as $5 or as little as $0.5, depending on the network. And when withdrawing BTC via the Bitcoin network, KuCoin charges a fee of 0.000963 BTC. OKX Deposits : Crypto deposits are free Withdrawals: Fees depend on the network cost for the coin you are withdrawing. For example, the minimum and maximum withdrawal fees for USDT are 0.001 USDT (Berachain and Plasma) and 1 USDT (Solana), respectively. On the other hand, those using local bank transfer pay $30 for the withdrawal service. Hidden Costs Traders Often Overlook Aside from the pronounced fees we have discussed so far, such as maker-taker fees, some exchanges go further and charge users hidden fees that are not mentioned. These are subtle and are not readily labeled as fees, but will still cost users money. Here are some common ones among them: Currency conversion charges Whenever a user converts a crypto asset to another cryptocurrency or to fiat currency, the crypto exchange may apply conversion fees that are added to the total cost before the trade is executed. Slippage During times when the crypto market is experiencing rapid volatility or liquidity is low, the price at which traders place their orders may differ from the price they receive from the order book. This difference is called slippage. The sad part is that traders may end up getting worse prices than expected due to slippage. While technically not a “fee,” this is highly correlated with the exchange’s liquidity and market depth. It’s one of the most important considerations when choosing a venue to trade. The best crypto exchanges have the lowest slippage. Network fee markups Every transaction that passes through a blockchain network comes with a network fee. However, crypto exchanges may add their markup to this cost, especially for trades on blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Spread markup In crypto trading, a spread is the difference between the actual market price of a cryptocurrency and the price at which a trader bought it. This is one of the most common hidden fees that exchanges use. Even when they claim to offer zero-fee transactions, the spread markup could be the exchange’s way of making up the difference. Network Fees and Their Impact on Transactions Network miners or validators are incentivized with payments called network fees whenever they confirm transactions and add blocks to the mainnet. Their actions help secure the blockchain, keeping its decentralization intact. In most cases, these fees are unpredictable since they are affected by network congestion. This happens when the blockchain is experiencing heavy usage. When the system is congested, its fees tend to skyrocket. Most blockchain networks use either a proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Those using the PoW model are known to be slower and come with higher fees during network congestion. On the other hand, PoS models are known for their cheap and fast transaction settlements. Spread Markups and Price Execution Differences A spread is the difference between the current trading price of a cryptocurrency and the price at which a user buys it. Traders pay this cost whenever they buy or sell crypto immediately. This applies even in cases where the platform advertises low or zero trading fees. Some crypto exchanges adjust the spread to bolster their gain without mentioning it as a separate fee – because technically it’s not. This happens without the user’s knowledge. Traders who are not observant may even use crypto exchanges for years without knowing about these spreads. Factors that can affect the spread include trading volume and the availability of orders on the exchange. As the spread increases, traders end up paying more to buy a cryptocurrency and receive less when selling it. This hidden markup is not always obvious. This may be because most traders are focused only on the advertised fee rates, overlooking how the spread affects their total cost. When traders understand this, they will know how to ditch unnecessary expenses. Conversion and Cross-Asset Swap Charges Conversion fees are the fees one incurs when converting one cryptocurrency into another within the same platform. Whether at a centralized exchange or a wallet, users will incur a fee to process the transaction. Cross-asset swap fees, on the other hand, are slightly different. Users usually pay these fees when using a bridge or specialized protocols to swap assets across different blockchains. How KYC Levels Influence Fee Structures Since most centralized crypto exchanges are regulated, they require users to submit Know Your Customer (KYC) information for verification. This means that users must submit their personal credentials, such as a government-issued document and proof of address, to verify their identity. This helps to scare away malicious users, since they have to divulge their identity, which can be used to track them down. KYC levels can affect what users pay in several ways. Most exchanges have different verification levels. For instance, basic KYC enables access to standard trading features while those with higher KYC get to enjoy extra benefits from the platform, including lower fees. Strategies to Reduce Trading and Transfer Costs While one cannot entirely escape fee payments, there are strategies to help reduce costs. These include: Consolidate transactions to limit costs Some users often send cryptocurrencies in bits to other accounts. This always comes with fees on each transaction. Instead of taking this approach, users can send assets in larger chunks. This way, they cut down on costs. Avoid trading during market congestion Most blockchain networks get congested whenever activities like airdrop or other campaigns from big projects are ongoing. In such cases, network fees increase more than usual. The blockchain network could even experience a technical glitch, such as downtime, because of the heavy usage. Because of these, it is best for traders to avoid trading or reduce their trading during these periods. Use low-cost blockchains Most layer-1 blockchains using the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism are known for being painfully slow. As a result, transactions often come with high fees. Hence, when sending crypto on-chain, it is helpful to choose a fast blockchain, such as those using the proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm. These blockchains often introduce low-cost transactions, worth pennies, as long as the network is not congested. Most of the time, users opt for layer-2 blockchains, such as Polygon, Base, or Optimism. Compare fees across exchanges Another strategy that helps is to compare the fees of top crypto exchanges. This article highlighted the applicable costs on five major exchanges. While comparing them, look into their features so that you can make an efficient choice. It is also worth mentioning that most of these platforms offer fee discounts to those holding their affiliated cryptocurrency. For instance, BNB holders are entitled to discounts on Binance. Explore marketing promotions offering fee rebates and zero-fee trades Most crypto exchanges host marketing campaigns from time to time. Among the offers in these campaigns could be fee rebates and even zero-fee trades within a specific duration. To qualify, these exchanges would tell users to meet some criteria. If they do, they qualify for these discounts that help to downsize expenses. Comparing Centralized vs. Decentralized Exchange Fees Centralized exchanges tend to charge higher fees. Whenever users custody their cryptocurrencies with CEXs, they give the platform more control over their assets. The centralized exchanges discussed in this article, such as Binance, Coinbase, and OKX, charge fees of 0.1% to 0.2% per trade for regular users. These platforms also charge fees for services like trading, lending, and more. Many CEXs reduce their fees for users with high trading volume and users who hold the exchange’s native token. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are different. They are projects that give users complete control over their assets. Developers behind these projects use smart contacts to oversee activities. They also foster anonymity. This is why users can access services without undergoing KYC verification (in some cases). A major disadvantage of DEXs is that users must have a moderate level of crypto knowledge to easily navigate them. DEX fees are usually lower than those of CEXs. While DEXs don’t charge account-based fees, their swap fees are based on the crypto protocol and liquidity pool. Many pools charge between 0.01% and 0.3%, but some go as high as 1%. For example, Uniswap v3 and PancakeSwap v3 both offer fees ranging from 0.01% to 1%. Notably, the total cost of a DEX trade includes network gas fees and slippage. This means that DEX trades on blockchains like Ethereum can be more expensive than CEX spot trades, especially for smaller amounts. On cheaper chains and layer-2 networks, DEX plus gas can, however, be cheaper than CEX fees for some users. Most recently, though, there has been a notable trend in the face of decentralized perpetual futures exchanges such as Hyperliquid , Lighter, and others. Some of them go so far as to charge 0% maker fees to attract users. Evaluating Fee Schedules Before Opening an Account The fee schedule is another thing that crypto traders need to understand before creating a crypto exchange account. Today, when most users scout for crypto exchanges to use, they often pay attention solely to the platform’s services, trading interface, and supported cryptocurrencies. The exchange’s fee structure is often left out of the picture. In the real sense, evaluating these fee structures helps users make the right choice. This way, they don’t lose a large chunk of their potential gains to crypto exchanges. The fee schedule comprises all the costs that an exchange charges. They include trading fees, deposit fees, withdrawal fees, network fees, spread costs, conversion charges, and even inactivity fees. Learning how to read this breakdown will help users make smart decisions before they start trading. One of the major reasons fee schedules matter is that they directly affect your profits. For example, if you plan to trade frequently, you might choose an exchange with lower maker and taker fees so you keep more of your earnings. Knowing the withdrawal fees helps traders ditch platforms that charge high fees for sending crypto. This can be quite helpful for users who withdraw often. Some platforms may look cheap at first, but they have high withdrawal fees. Similarly, some exchanges widen their spread while promoting zero fees. This means you pay more fees when buying and selling crypto assets on the platform. Once users can evaluate fees, they will understand the actual costs they are likely to incur when they start using their preferred exchange. For instance, most platforms offer free crypto deposits but may charge some fees when users deposit fiat via bank transfers or cards. Withdrawals also vary depending on the coin you choose, because blockchain networks themselves require gas fees. Knowing this ahead of time helps you avoid confusion when you see a withdrawal charge that looks higher than expected. What is the end result? It helps users to save a lot of money over time and make their trading experience clearer, smoother, and much more predictable. Conclusion The crypto industry offers numerous ways for investors to make money. However, users who turn a blind eye to crypto exchange fees are setting themselves up for huge losses that will accumulate over time. Not wanting to be among those who could fall prey to unexpected fees, this article discussed how crypto fees work and listed five exchanges that stick with platforms that offer the most services at the lowest costs.​ The post ​Crypto Exchange Fees Explained: Hidden Costs & How to Save appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Guides|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-12-19 07:17:37

It often begins with technical conversations that only surface later as structural shifts. That appears to be the case with the XRP Ledger, where discussions about a potential rewrite now point to one of the most consequential upgrades in its history. Crypto commentator Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) highlighted this in a recent post, pointing to comments from Ripple CTO David Schwartz that suggest the XRPL could eventually be re-implemented in Rust. The idea reflects a deeper review of how the ledger is built and how it might evolve to support XRP over the long term. XRPL Rewrite Incoming? Ripple CTO David Schwartz confirms serious discussions around rewriting the XRP Ledger in Rust potentially the most radical upgrade in XRPL history What’s on the table Modular refactor under review Possible VM-based transaction engine No… pic.twitter.com/udeSObOE4C — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 16, 2025 Why a Rewrite Is Being Considered In the video Xaif shared, Schwartz said rebuilding XRPL in Rust has moved beyond theory, stating there is “definitely talk about doing that.” His focus is structural, not speed. He explained that XRPL runs as a monolith where consensus, transaction execution, and client queries are tightly coupled. While effective, this limits flexibility. A modular design could separate those components and let them evolve independently without altering user data or ledger history. Rust plays a key role in that vision, as the language offers strong memory safety and predictable performance. For a ledger that secures billions of dollars in XRP liquidity, those traits matter. According to Xaif, “This isn’t a patch. It’s about future-proofing XRPL for scale, security, and developers.” VM Concepts and Transaction Execution One of the most notable ideas Schwartz raised involves isolating the transaction engine inside a virtual machine. He said having multiple implementations today would be “very challenging.” A VM-based approach could standardize execution while letting other XRPL components use different languages. Schwartz said the complexity comes from parts of the payment engine that rely on floating-point math and execution order. He suggested fixing this through an amendment that introduces a more “organized, clear, coherent version” of the logic, improving determinism and settlement reliability for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What This Means for XRP Xaif framed these discussions as future-focused positioning for XRP. A modular XRPL lowers development friction and improves security guarantees. It also opens the door to more contributors without risking consensus integrity . Importantly, Schwartz emphasized that no user data would be altered. Balances, transaction history, and XRP supply mechanics would remain intact. The work targets infrastructure, not economics. Schwartz also plans to step down from his CTO role soon. That transition could free time for deeper involvement in broad technical initiatives like this. The XRPL has always prioritized stability, and these conversations show it is also planning for longevity. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The SEC’s latest roundtable signals a constructive shift in U.S. policy on crypto privacy, with regulators proactively engaging on how to balance blockchain’s public transparency with meaningful financial privacy. Tether is exploring tokenized shares as it seeks a $20 billion raise at a $500 billion valuation, while concerns persist over stablecoin issuers’ profitability amid falling interest rates and Circle’s weak post-IPO performance. Visa Expands USDC Settlement to U.S. Banks on Solana Visa ( V ) is extending its stablecoin settlement programs, enabling U.S. banks and fintechs to settle their Visa obligations in Circle’s USDC ( USDC-USD ), beginning with support on the Solana ( SOL-USD ) blockchain. Cross River Bank and Lead Bank are the first participants, with a broader rollout expected through 2026. The initiative aims to give issuers and acquirers faster, seven-day-a-week settlement and more predictable liquidity, particularly around weekends and holidays. This rollout is not a consumer-facing feature. Cardholders will continue to spend in dollars, and merchants will still receive dollars. The improvement happens between financial institutions and Visa, where obligations are settled. The expansion also deepens Visa’s collaboration with Circle: the payments network will support the upcoming Arc blockchain and operate a validator once the chain launches. Key Take In the traditional card network, settlement between issuers, acquirers, and Visa typically occurs on fixed banking schedules, often taking 1–2 days (longer over weekends and holidays). Funds move through legacy banking rails such as ACH or wire transfers, which are not designed for real-time, 24/7 liquidity. With this new feature, Visa’s partner banks settle behind the scenes using USDC to speed up and modernize liquidity flows. In our recent analysis article, we believe USDC will capture a significant share of regulated stablecoin growth, benefiting from the clearer regulatory environment following the GENIUS Act. While there are new competitors from major fintech and financial institutions, these entrants cannot compete with the established network effects of USDC. We also highlight Arc could play a role for Circle similar to what Base has become for Coinbase ( COIN ). Base has quickly grown into a leading Ethereum Layer 2 and is now contributing a meaningful share of Coinbase’s broader revenue mix. If Arc gains traction, it could evolve into a significant Layer 1 network that captures a portion of the value currently flowing to blockchains like Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Solana through USDC-related activity. SEC Leaders Highlight the Importance of Privacy Tools in Crypto At the SEC’s Roundtable on Financial Surveillance and Privacy in Washington held this week, SEC Chair Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce discussed the growing tension between blockchain transparency and individual financial privacy. Public blockchains offer unprecedented visibility to transaction history, far exceeding the traditional financial systems where all transactions are stored privately by different institutions. This level of transparency, when paired with advanced on-chain analytics, could turn crypto into the most powerful financial surveillance architecture ever invented. Atkins argued that regulatory approaches, such as treating every wallet as a broker or requiring exhaustive transaction reporting, could create a “financial panopticon,” undermining both market functioning and civil liberties. He highlighted the need for privacy-preserving tools that allow compliance without exposing users’ entire financial histories. Key Take Unlike the conventional perception that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum are anonymous, they are actually not. Transactions on Bitcoin and Ethereum are recorded on public ledgers and are visible to all. Skilled analysts can often uncover the real identities behind wallet addresses by tracing the transaction history to the original on-ramp step in centralized exchanges, thus linking to a KYCed user in centralized exchanges. Transacting in BTC or ETH essentially has less financial privacy than just using cash, as their entire transaction history can be traced and analyzed. Privacy coins and protocols exist in a tense regulatory environment. On one hand, they fulfill a legitimate demand for financial privacy and security; on the other, regulators worry that anonymity features can facilitate money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities. This concern has led to increased scrutiny and crackdowns on privacy-focused crypto projects in recent years. Some privacy-focused projects offer an optional privacy model that allows users who need transparency or auditability to use transparent addresses, while others can choose fully private transactions. This approach may offer a middle ground that preserves privacy in crypto while balancing regulatory requirements. Tether Explores Tokenizing its Shares Tether ( USDT-USD ) is reported to be exploring whether to issue tokenized versions of its shares while it seeks to raise about $20 billion at a valuation near $500 billion. This figure would put the company alongside some of the most highly valued private firms, including OpenAI ( OPENAI ) and SpaceX ( SPACE ). People familiar with the matter say Tether’s leadership is reviewing options such as tokenized equity and buybacks to give shareholders a structured way to access liquidity. The discussions follow an attempt by one shareholder to sell at least $1 billion worth of equity at a significantly lower $280 billion valuation, a move that management feared could complicate the company’s valuation. Tether has not indicated any interest in pursuing a public listing. Circle remains the only major stablecoin issuer that is now trading publicly, and its market value, at about $20 billion, sits far below the valuation Tether is aiming for. Key Take Stablecoin is clearly the most promising sector in the crypto market with product–market fit and a clear revenue model. However, this sector does not provide much opportunity for retail investors to participate, except through Circle stock. While many large institutions are launching their own stablecoins, such as PayPal’s PYUSD-USD , these stablecoin segments are too small compared to these companies’ existing businesses and do not provide meaningful exposure for investors who want exposure to stablecoin development. Despite Circle being the only stablecoin stock, it has not shown good performance since its IPO in June. Its price has fallen back to around $80 after an initial surge to over $250 right after the IPO. This is despite USDC experiencing continued supply growth and overall expansion of the stablecoin market during this period. Investors are concerned that the interest rate cutting cycle could weigh on the profitability of stablecoin issuers, as almost all income for stablecoin issuers comes from interest earned on reserve assets, which are primarily short-term U.S. Treasuries. Weekly Market Chart: The Prediction Market Race Beyond the noise of incentives-driven volume farming, the real contest in prediction markets is increasingly shaping up as Kalshi ( KALSHI ) versus Polymarket ( POLYMARKET ). Recent Dune data shows Kalshi pulling slightly ahead in open interest ($320 million versus Polymarket’s $310 million) while steadily closing the gap in daily trading activity and user engagement. Both platforms are moving toward a similar endgame: broader regulatory clarity and mainstream distribution, paired with a commitment to preserving deep crypto-native liquidity. Polymarket’s agreement with Intercontinental Exchange, potentially involving up to $2 billion in investment and institutional distribution of its event-driven data, marks a clear bid for traditional finance alignment and legitimacy. Kalshi is taking a different approach. Rather than bringing crypto to the regulated world, it is bringing regulated event contracts onto crypto rails. The platform has begun tokenizing its markets on Solana as SPL tokens, opening the door to continuous on-chain trading and full DeFi composability, from lending and borrowing to collateralizing positions.

Prices do not spike wildly. Headlines stay quiet. However, below, the allocation is restrictive and the behavior alters. It is usually at that point that the focus is replaced on watching with doing. The trend is now evident in the area of a new DeFi crypto around under $0.04. With the stable increase, the project is beginning to steal attention as a supply is becoming small, and investors are busy following the next crypto arrangements to be launched in 2026. Presale Marks a Change Mutuum Finance (MUTM) started selling tokens in early 2025 in a progressive format. Each of the mentioned phases added a new price and a fixed allocation. That structure has over time propelled the token to the next level where it is now. MUTM is currently priced at $0.035. It began at $0.01, which is a 250%t upsurge to date. The initial launch price is determined as $0.06 and this positions the first entrants at the headquarters as compared to the late entrants. The interest of participation has increased with price movement. The project has accumulated $19.4M and has more than 18,500 holders. Phase 6 is over 99% assigned leaving the remaining little of supply at the present price. The phase is commonly when the demand gains momentum and not decelerates. What Mutuum Finance Is Building Mutuum Finance: This is an initiative building a decentralized lending protocol that will maintain capital in circulation. The platform also allows two lending markets where the liquidity can flow where it is needed but has identified risk clearly. When users provide assets, the users are given the mtTokens which reflect their status in the system. These mtTokens increase in value during the time of earning interest on borrowing. This brings returns on a direct basis instead of being fixed. The issue of security has been incorporated in development. Mutuum Finance passed a CertiK Token Scan with a score of 90/100, and is undergoing an independent audit by Halborn Security of the final lending contracts. Bug bounty of $50k is an external consideration followed by a broader test. Stablecoin, Oracles and Analyst Outlook. In the future, the roadmap will consist of a borrower-backed stablecoin. This injects into the ecosystem a less volatile asset and helps to maintain operation at the various stages of the markets. Proper pricing is paramount to lending. To provide optimal valuations and secure liquidations, Mutuum Finance will use decentralized oracle infrastructure, such as Chainlink data feeds, and fallback sources. According to these factors, certain analysts feel that MUTM can expand further beyond its level. In a bullish case, it is estimated that it could grow 3x to 5x from the current $0.035 level in case it is adopted according to the roadmap. These crypto hedges are not guarantees, they are tied to the execution and market conditions. V1 Timing and the Reason Why Supply Matters Now The following milestone of development provides some background to the constrained supply. In statements on X , the team behind the Mutuum Finance said that the initial live implementation of the lending protocol was going to run on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This stage introduces core lending logic, mtTokens, and automated liquidations into a form of testing in the public, where it is launched on ETH and USDT. The allocation at this point is usually more competitive as projects near this phase. That trend is visible here. Phase 6 is almost over with bigger allocations becoming visible as supply left remains small. This behavior is common among market commentators when investors look ahead of a visibility change. Timing is important to individuals who monitor hot crypto opportunities and who are inquiring what crypto to buy in 2025 at a price below $0.04. The access comes earlier and the milestones of development are more evident. Mutuum Finance is a mixture of a fixed price increase, systematic distribution, and upfront development advancement. The early positioning window is narrowing at $0.035, and that phase 6 is almost over with V1 in the lead.

This decision, set for January 2026, sends a clear message about exchange standards and project accountability. For holders and observers, understanding the reasons behind this APM Coin delisting is crucial. Why is Bithumb Delisting APM Coin? Bithumb’s decision stems from a rigorous review process. The exchange placed APM on an investment warning list, giving the project’s foundation an opportunity to address concerns. However, the submitted materials were deemed insufficient. Consequently, a comprehensive evaluation concluded the token no longer meets the exchange’s criteria for trading support regarding viability and sustainability. What Does This Mean for APM Coin Holders? If you hold APM tokens on Bithumb, you need to take action before the deadline. The APM Coin delisting is scheduled for 6:00 a.m. UTC on January 19, 2026. Here is a clear timeline: Deposit Deadline: All deposits of APM must be completed well before the delisting time. Trading Halt: All trading pairs for APM will be suspended at the specified time. Withdrawal Period: Bithumb will typically provide a window after delisting for users to withdraw their tokens to a private wallet. Confirm this timeline with the official announcement. Failing to move your tokens could result in a loss of access. Therefore, mark your calendar and prepare accordingly. How Do Exchanges Like Bithumb Decide to Delist a Coin? The APM Coin delisting highlights the increasing regulatory and operational scrutiny in crypto. Exchanges regularly audit listed projects to protect users and maintain market integrity. Key factors that trigger a review include: Low trading volume and liquidity Lack of project development or communication Failure to meet ongoing disclosure requirements Legal or regulatory concerns Compromised network security In this case, the project’s foundation could not resolve the issues that initially prompted the investment warning. This process, while tough, is essential for a healthy ecosystem. What Can Investors Learn from This Delisting? This event is a powerful reminder for every crypto participant. First, it underscores the importance of investing in projects with strong fundamentals and transparent teams. Second, it shows that major exchanges are actively policing their platforms, which is a positive long-term trend for consumer protection. Always conduct your own research beyond exchange listings. Look for active development, clear use cases, and regular community updates. An exchange listing is not a permanent endorsement. Conclusion: Navigating a Maturing Crypto Landscape The APM Coin delisting by Bithumb is more than a single token’s removal. It represents the maturation of the cryptocurrency industry, where accountability and sustainability are becoming paramount. For investors, it reinforces the need for vigilance and proactive portfolio management. As the market evolves, such actions by leading exchanges will likely become more common, separating serious projects from the rest. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the exact date and time of the APM Coin delisting on Bithumb? A: The delisting is set for 6:00 a.m. UTC on January 19, 2026. All trading will halt at that time. Q: What should I do with my APM Coin on Bithumb? A: You should withdraw your APM tokens to a compatible self-custody wallet before the delisting date. After delisting, you may not be able to trade or access them on Bithumb. Q: Why is Bithumb delisting APM Coin? A: Bithumb stated that the project foundation provided insufficient materials to resolve issues that led to an investment warning. A review found the project no longer meets the exchange’s criteria for viability and sustainability. Q: Will APM Coin be traded on other exchanges after this? A: The Bithumb delisting is specific to their platform. APM Coin may still be traded on other exchanges that support it, but its market reputation and liquidity will likely be impacted. Q: Is my APM Coin investment lost after delisting? A: Not necessarily. The tokens still exist on their blockchain. Their value will depend on market demand on other platforms or in decentralized exchanges (DEXs), but it is likely to be negatively affected. Q: How can I stay informed about future delisting announcements? A: Regularly check the official “Notice” or “Announcement” section of your cryptocurrency exchange. Enabling notifications for such updates is also a prudent step. Share Your Thoughts Delistings are a critical part of market evolution. Did this news affect your portfolio?

This decision directly impacts traders and highlights the exchange’s ongoing commitment to maintaining a robust and compliant marketplace. If you hold any of the affected assets, understanding the details of this Binance Alpha delisting is crucial. Which Tokens Are Being Removed from Binance Alpha? Binance Alpha will delist nine specific tokens at 7:00 a.m. UTC on December 19. The tokens scheduled for removal are: BUZZ DARK FROG GORK MIRAI PERRY RFC SNAI TERMINUS This action means all trading pairs for these assets will cease on the Binance Alpha platform. Therefore, users must take proactive steps to manage their holdings before the deadline. Why Would Binance Alpha Delist Tokens? Exchanges like Binance Alpha periodically review the tokens listed on their platforms. While the official announcement did not specify individual reasons, such removals typically occur due to several factors. Common reasons include low trading volume and liquidity, which make a market inefficient for users. Furthermore, projects may fail to meet the exchange’s evolving listing standards or demonstrate insufficient development progress. Regulatory compliance is another critical factor, as exchanges must adapt to changing legal landscapes. This regular review process by Binance Alpha aims to protect users and ensure a healthy trading environment. What Should Affected Users Do Immediately? If you hold any of the nine tokens, time is of the essence. You have a clear window to act before the December 19 cutoff. First, you should sell your tokens for another cryptocurrency like USDT or BNB on the Binance Alpha exchange before trading stops. Alternatively, you can withdraw your tokens to a private, self-custody wallet that supports them. However, it is vital to check the wallet’s compatibility first. Importantly, after delisting, you will not be able to trade or deposit these tokens on Binance Alpha, though withdrawals may remain open for a limited time—always confirm the official post-delisting schedule. How Does This Reflect on the Broader Crypto Market? This move by Binance Alpha is not an isolated event but part of a broader industry trend. Exchanges continuously refine their offerings to prioritize security, compliance, and project quality. For investors, it serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of due diligence. Concentrating investments in assets with strong fundamentals, active development, and healthy community engagement can help mitigate delisting risk. The proactive management demonstrated by Binance Alpha should ultimately foster greater trust in the platform’s long-term viability. Final Summary: Navigating Exchange Updates The delisting of nine tokens from Binance Alpha is a standard operational procedure that underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. For holders of BUZZ, DARK, FROG, GORK, MIRAI, PERRY, RFC, SNAI, and TERMINUS, immediate action is required to secure assets before December 19.

The project executed a substantial burn of 200 million Ontology Gas (ONG) tokens, fundamentally reshaping its tokenomics and setting a new course for scarcity and utility. This strategic action directly targets the core supply mechanics of ONG, promising significant implications for users and investors within the Ontology network. What Does the Ontology Gas Tokenomics Update Involve? Ontology made the announcement via its official X account, detailing a precise and impactful change. The team permanently removed 200 million ONG from circulation. Consequently, this burn reduces the total supply of Ontology Gas from 1 billion to a new cap of 800 million tokens. This is not a minor adjustment but a foundational shift in the token’s underlying economics. Tokenomics refers to the economic design of a cryptocurrency. It covers distribution, supply, and utility. By burning a massive 20% of the total supply, Ontology is directly influencing key factors like scarcity and potential value accrual. Therefore, this update is a clear signal of the project’s long-term strategic planning. Why is This ONG Burn a Strategic Masterstroke? Token burns are a common deflationary tactic in crypto, but their impact depends on scale and context. Burning 200 million ONG is a substantial percentage of the total supply. Let’s break down the potential benefits of this updated Ontology Gas tokenomics model: Enhanced Scarcity: With fewer tokens available, the basic economic principle of supply and demand comes into play. Reduced supply can increase scarcity, which may positively influence the token’s market price if demand remains steady or grows. Increased Token Utility Focus: A smaller, more defined supply often shifts focus toward the token’s actual use cases. For ONG, this means its primary role as fuel for transactions and smart contracts on the Ontology blockchain becomes even more central. Boosted Investor Confidence: Proactive, transparent management of token supply demonstrates a commitment to the ecosystem’s health. This can build trust and confidence among current and potential stakeholders. Long-Term Value Alignment: The burn aligns the interests of the project with token holders by making each remaining ONG token represent a slightly larger share of the network’s total gas economy. How Will the New Ontology Gas Tokenomics Affect Users? If you hold ONT or use the Ontology blockchain, you might wonder about the practical effects. The immediate impact on everyday transactions might be minimal. However, the long-term vision is crucial. The updated tokenomics for Ontology Gas is designed to create a more sustainable economic environment. For developers, a predictable and well-managed gas token economy makes the platform more attractive for building decentralized applications (dApps). For holders, the deflationary pressure from the burn could be a positive force for the asset’s valuation over time. It’s a move that strengthens the foundational layer of the entire Ontology ecosystem. What Challenges Could This New Model Face? While the burn is overwhelmingly positive, it’s wise to consider the full picture. The success of this new Ontology Gas tokenomics model hinges on continued network adoption. The burn creates potential for value appreciation, but real, organic demand for the blockchain’s services must drive that value. If activity on the Ontology network does not grow, the reduced supply may not lead to the intended effects. Moreover, the team must continue to communicate clearly and ensure the market understands the long-term strategy behind this supply shock. Conclusion: A Bold Step Toward a Sustainable Future Ontology’s decision to burn 200 million ONG and redefine its gas tokenomics is a bold and confident step. It moves beyond mere speculation and focuses on creating a robust economic framework for the network’s utility token. By aggressively reducing supply, the project is betting on its own growth and adoption, aligning tokenholder success with the health of the ecosystem. This strategic burn ignites a new chapter of scarcity and purpose for Ontology Gas. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly was burned in the Ontology announcement? A: Ontology burned 200 million Ontology Gas (ONG) tokens, reducing the total supply from 1 billion to 800 million. Q: Does burning ONG affect my ONT (Ontology) tokens? A: No, ONT is the main network token. ONG is the separate gas token used for transaction fees. The burn only affects the ONG supply. Q: Why do projects burn tokens? A: Token burns are a deflationary measure. By permanently removing tokens from circulation, projects aim to increase scarcity, which can support the token’s value if demand is present. Q: Where can I see the official announcement? A: The announcement was made on Ontology’s official X (formerly Twitter) account. Always verify major news through official project channels. Q: Will this make ONG transaction fees more expensive? A: Not directly. Gas fees are determined by network demand and congestion. The burn affects the overall supply of ONG, not the immediate fee mechanism. Q: What is the difference between ONT and ONG? A> ONT is Ontology’s core staking and governance token. ONG is the utility token (“gas”) used to pay for transactions, deploy smart contracts, and use services on the blockchain. Found this breakdown of the Ontology Gas tokenomics update helpful?

This development comes as President Donald Trump also signed new legislation giving the government broader authority to block American money from flowing into Chinese technology companies. Trump announced earlier this month that he planned to permit sales of Nvidia’s H200 processors to China, with Washington collecting a 25% fee on each transaction. The president argued these sales would benefit American companies by reducing Chinese demand for domestically-produced chips, helping U.S. firms maintain their competitive edge. The proposal has sparked sharp criticism from lawmakers and former officials across party lines who worry the powerful chips could boost Beijing’s military capabilities and weaken America’s lead in artificial intelligence development. Four agencies review export applications The Commerce Department, which handles export decisions, has forwarded license requests for the chip sales to three other agencies – State, Energy, and Defense – for their input, the sources told Reuters. They spoke anonymously because the review process is not public information. Under current rules, these agencies have 30 days to provide their assessments. An administration official told the review would be comprehensive and “not some perfunctory box we are checking.” However, Trump will make the final call regardless of what the other departments recommend. A White House representative would not discuss the ongoing process but stated “the Trump administration is committed to ensuring the dominance of the American tech stack, without compromising on national security.” The Biden administration had previously blocked sales of advanced AI chips to China and other nations that might serve as pathways for smuggling the technology to Beijing. Officials cited national security risks as the reason for these restrictions. Trump’s current stance marks a sharp change from his approach during his first presidency, when he took aggressive steps to limit Chinese access to American technology. At that time, he pointed to allegations that Beijing steals U.S. intellectual property and uses commercially-purchased technology for military purposes, claims China denies. White House AI czar David Sacks and other Trump administration members now contend that selling advanced chips to China actually discourages Chinese companies like Huawei from working harder to match the cutting-edge designs from Nvidia and AMD. As reported by Cryptopolitan previously, Nvidia was looking at ramping up H200 production after early orders from China exceeded available supply. While H200 chips perform slower than Nvidia’s current Blackwell processors for many AI applications, they remain widely used and have never been approved for Chinese buyers. Trump initially considered allowing sales of a less-powerful version of Blackwell chips but changed course and settled on the H200 instead. Congress passes sweeping investment restrictions On the investment front, President Trump has now signed into law the most sweeping measures yet for monitoring and restricting where American dollars go in Chinese technology businesses. The provisions specifically target companies that strengthen Beijing’s military and surveillance operations. The restrictions are included in the annual National Defense Authorization Act , which identifies entities in China and other problematic countries, Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela and Russia, working on technologies with both commercial and military uses. “Investments propping up Communist China’s aggression must come to an end,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier this month. The House approved the NDAA last week and the Senate passed it Wednesday, both with large bipartisan support. The law makes permanent and expands a 2023 executive order from the Biden administration. Congress is now writing into law the authority to watch, and sometimes stop, U.S. financing of Chinese work on emerging technologies including artificial intelligence, quantum computing and advanced semiconductors. The law lets the president use International Emergency Economic Powers Act sanctions to prevent Americans from buying significant ownership stakes or debt in certain Chinese companies. The targeted entities include those based in China, Hong Kong and Macau, state-owned businesses, and companies connected to Chinese Communist Party officials. Even transactions that don’t get blocked will require mandatory reporting, forcing U.S. companies to notify the government about deals involving sensitive Chinese technologies. A Chinese Embassy spokesperson in Washington criticized the legislation, saying it was “overstretching the concept of national security” and would “distort normal investment flows between the two countries.” Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who championed the legislation over five years, stated: “Every dollar invested in China by a United States investor into a Chinese company is a dollar that’s going toward the potential production of weapons and technology that one day may be used to kill Americans.” Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada said America’s national security future depends on “making sure we remain ahead of our adversaries in the race to develop cutting-edge technologies like AI and semiconductors.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Tech|CNY|Nvidia|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-19 07:41:29

With risk appetite subdued and volatility rising across altcoins, ADA has struggled to defend key technical levels, leaving the token vulnerable to further downside. The recent selloff reflects a combination of deteriorating technical signals and mechanically driven trading flows, rather than a shift in project fundamentals. This analysis is powered by Outset PR , a crypto PR agency built on data, trends, and market timing. It helps blockchain projects make the most of every moment. Cardano Breaks Below $0.37 and Accelerates Selling ADA slipped below the $0.37 support level, a move that accelerated losses as stop-loss orders and leveraged positions were unwound. The decline was amplified by algorithmic traders, contributing to a sharp increase in volatility. Seven-day volatility surged to 40%, a level typically associated with panic-driven exits rather than orderly repositioning. This suggests that a significant portion of the recent move was flow-driven. Momentum Indicators Remain Bearish Technical indicators continue to point to downside risk. The 14-day relative strength index stands at 33.25, approaching oversold territory but without signaling a clear reversal. This indicates that selling pressure may persist before buyers step in. Momentum has also weakened following a bearish MACD crossover confirmed on Dec. 16. Such signals often precede extended consolidation or further declines, particularly in weak market environments. Key Support at $0.366 Comes Into Focus On the downside, the next level to watch is $0.366, which aligns with the 2024 low and a key Fibonacci retracement level. A decisive break below this area would likely reinforce bearish sentiment and open the door to deeper losses. For now, this zone represents a critical test for short-term price stability.

Cardano Needs to Reclaim $0.39 for Stabilization On the upside, ADA would need to reclaim the $0.39 level to shift near-term momentum. This area aligns with the 7-day simple moving average and represents the first meaningful resistance following the recent breakdown. A sustained move above $0.39 could help stabilize price action, reduce volatility, and signal that sellers are losing control. Until then, rebounds are likely to be viewed as corrective rather than the start of a renewed uptrend. Outlook: Volatility Likely to Persist With bearish momentum intact and volatility elevated, Cardano remains in a vulnerable position. While oversold conditions are beginning to form, confirmation of a trend reversal will require a clear reclaim of key resistance levels. Until ADA regains $0.39 and stabilizes above it, the balance of risks remains skewed to the downside rather than a sustained bullish recovery.

56026438,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=247978,1766130311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"BTC Price Soars: Bitcoin Breaks $88,000 Barrier in Stunning Rally",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-btc-price-88000-rally/,"BitcoinWorld BTC Price Soars: Bitcoin Breaks $88,000 Barrier in Stunning Rally In a powerful move that has electrified the crypto market, the BTC price has decisively broken through the $88,000 barrier. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin is now trading at $88,010.44 on the Binance USDT market. This surge marks a significant psychological milestone for investors and signals robust bullish momentum. But what’s fueling this impressive climb, and is it sustainable? Let’s dive into the details of this latest BTC price rally. What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Surge? The jump in the BTC price above $88,000 is not happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are contributing to this upward trajectory. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Furthermore, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often drive investors toward assets perceived as stores of value like Bitcoin. Market sentiment has also turned notably positive. A combination of technical breakout patterns and growing mainstream media coverage creates a feedback loop that attracts more buyers. However, it’s crucial to remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. While the current BTC price action is exciting, investors should always be aware of the potential for sharp corrections. How Significant is the $88,000 BTC Price Level? Reaching a new high like $88,000 is more than just a number. It represents a major resistance level being conquered. For traders, this breakout can be interpreted as a strong buy signal, potentially paving the way for further gains. Historically, when Bitcoin shatters a key psychological barrier, it often experiences a period of accelerated growth as fear of missing out (FOMO) sets in. For long-term holders, or ‘HODLers,’ this milestone validates their investment thesis. It demonstrates Bitcoin’s enduring resilience and its growing acceptance as a legitimate financial asset. The sustained BTC price increase above such a level builds confidence in the network’s underlying value proposition. What Should Investors Consider at This BTC Price Point? Watching the BTC price climb can be thrilling, but smart investing requires a level-headed strategy. Here are a few actionable insights for navigating this market phase: Diversify Your Portfolio: Never put all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising it seems. Understand Volatility: Be prepared for price swings. Setting clear entry and exit points can help manage risk. Focus on Fundamentals: Look beyond the price ticker. Consider Bitcoin’s network security, adoption rate, and developer activity. Avoid Emotional Trading: Chasing pumps or panic-selling during dips often leads to losses. Stick to your pre-defined plan. Moreover, this BTC price movement offers a perfect case study in market dynamics. It highlights how sentiment, macroeconomics, and technical analysis converge to drive asset valuation in the digital age. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin’s Valuation While celebrating the current BTC price achievement is warranted, the future path remains uncertain. The market will now watch to see if Bitcoin can consolidate above $88,000 or if it will face a pullback. Key things to monitor include trading volume, which confirms the strength of the move, and any major regulatory news that could impact sentiment. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s journey is a marathon, not a sprint. Each new high tells a story of growing adoption and technological belief. Whether you’re a trader capitalizing on short-term movements or a believer in the long-term decentralized future, understanding the forces behind the BTC price is essential. Conclusion: A Milestone in Bitcoin’s Ascent The breakthrough of the $88,000 mark is a triumphant moment for Bitcoin, underscoring its strength and increasing market maturity. This BTC price rally reflects a complex mix of investor confidence, macroeconomic trends, and market technicals. As the landscape evolves, staying informed and disciplined is the key to navigating the opportunities and challenges ahead. Bitcoin continues to prove its mettle, one resistance level at a time. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused Bitcoin to rise above $88,000? The rally is likely due to a combination of factors, including positive market sentiment, institutional buying interest, and Bitcoin’s perceived role as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin at this price? Investment decisions should be based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and research. While the trend is up, cryptocurrency prices are volatile, and buying at a peak carries risk. Consider dollar-cost averaging as a strategy. Could the BTC price drop after this rally? Yes, price corrections are a normal part of any bullish market. Volatility is inherent to crypto. Investors should be prepared for potential downturns even during strong upward trends. What is the next major resistance level for Bitcoin? If the bullish momentum continues, traders often look at round numbers like $90,000 or $100,000 as the next key psychological resistance levels to watch. How does this price affect the overall cryptocurrency market? Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. A strong BTC price performance can boost investor confidence across the board, potentially leading to rallies in other major cryptocurrencies (altcoins). Where can I safely track the live BTC price? Reputable cryptocurrency data websites and major exchange platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time price charts and market data.

The latest report by Outset PR defies this assumption. According to it, there is no Asian equivalent of The New York Times of crypto. No outlet commands universal trust or reach. Instead, Asia’s crypto media landscape is fragmented, localized, and shaped by structures that look very different from Western media models. Asia Speaks Different Languages In the US or UK, media influence concentrates around a small group of dominant outlets. Getting coverage there often creates a ripple effect: secondary publications follow, social amplification kicks in, and narratives travel fast. Outset PR’s report shows that Asia does not work this way. The region is split by language, regulation, culture, and infrastructure. Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, China, and Hong Kong all operate under different rules — not just legally, but structurally. Media outlets do not share the same incentives, funding models, or relationships with exchanges, investors, or communities. As a result, influence is decentralized and trust is earned locally. Three Models Dominate Asian Media Landscape Based on Outset PR’s research and direct work with regional publishers, Asian crypto media broadly falls into three models. Venture-linked media ecosystems In markets like Vietnam, crypto media often evolves alongside venture capital and founder communities. Large outlets are closely connected to investment groups, accelerators, and ecosystem builders. For projects, this means media outreach is inseparable from relationship-building. Coverage depends less on press releases and more on credibility within the ecosystem. Exchange-anchored distribution networks In China, Hong Kong, and parts of Southeast Asia, exchanges play a central role in information flow. Due to regulatory pressure or economic constraints, many media outlets rely on exchange sponsorship, partnerships, or direct funding. This does not mean content is purely promotional. It means exchanges function as distribution layers. Listings, integrations, and partnerships often determine which stories get visibility. Ignoring this reality leads to missed reach. Regulated, trust-first media markets Japan and South Korea operate differently. Regulation is strict, and audiences expect precision. Media outlets are fewer, more cautious, and highly selective. Here, trust is built slowly. Technical accuracy, compliance clarity, and transparent sourcing matter more than speed or hype. Generic global announcements rarely perform well without localization and documentation. Why Global Crypto Media Has Limited Impact English-language crypto media still matters — but mostly outside Asia. Local audiences prefer native-language reporting that reflects domestic context. Translated global stories often arrive late, lack nuance, or miss regulatory and cultural specifics. As a result, they attract attention from insiders, not mass audiences. This is why a strong Asia strategy cannot rely on a single global media win. Visibility must be rebuilt market by market. Trust Is Personal, Not Institutional In fragmented environments, trust does not flow from logos. It flows from people. Editors, analysts, founders, community leads — these individuals act as filters. They decide which projects deserve attention and which do not. Their reputations matter more than the publication masthead alone. This is especially visible as AI-driven search and zero-click summaries reduce direct traffic to articles. Named experts, consistent commentary, and clear entity authority increasingly determine what information is surfaced and reused. How Outset PR Monitors Crypto Media Performance Outset PR works at the intersection of media strategy and data analysis. The agency monitors how crypto media performance shifts at the market level. This approach is supported by Outset Data Pulse , an internal intelligence system that tracks: Traffic flows across crypto publications Regional shifts in reader attention Performance changes tied to regulation, listings, and market cycles Using this data, Outset PR identifies where attention is consolidating, where it is fragmenting further, and which outlets or formats are losing relevance. Earlier, Outset PR published a dedicated report on Asia’s crypto media traffic in Q2 , highlighting how reader demand varies sharply by country and why Western traffic assumptions fail in local contexts. That research reinforced a consistent finding: visibility in Asia depends less on scale and more on precision. Personalized Trust as the Baseline The key takeaway from Outset PR’s report is that in Asia, credibility should be built from scratch. Personalized trust means knowing which voices matter in each market, understanding how narratives travel, and communicating in ways that align with local media realities. For crypto teams serious about Asia, this can be the baseline for sustainable visibility. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Through the deal, the U.S. government campaign to force a sale on national security grounds comes to an end, establishing a new joint venture led by American investors. In the memo, Shou Chew, the CEO of ByteDance, called the new agreement a “new TikTok U.S. joint venture.” According to the memo, the partnership is set to close on January 22, 2026. American investors gain key responsibilities in TikTok The memo said that the new agreement would give American investors power over the U.S.-based company. Under the agreement, the recently formed investor group includes Cloud giant Oracle, tech-focused private equity firm Silver Lake, and AI-focused Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX. Oracle, Silver Lake, and AI-focused Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGXs will jointly own 45 percent of the U.S. operation. The remaining 20 percent is being held by ByteDance . The memo indicated that the U.S. joint venture shall be liable for software assurance, algorithm security, content moderation, and U.S. data protection. The joint venture will be in charge of the retraining of the U.S. content recommendation algorithm. The retraining of the U.S. content will ensure that the content feed does not contain any external interference. In the new alliance, the U.S. joint venture will have Oracle as a formidable security partner once the acquisition has been completed. The memo stated that a trusted security partner will conduct an audit and meet the requirements of the National Security guidelines. Through the agreement, TikTok Global’s U.S. entities will oversee global product interoperability and specific commercial activities, such as e-commerce, advertising, and marketing. The U.S. joint venture will function as an independent entity with control over U.S. data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance. According to the memo, a large portion of the agreement is similar to the wording of an executive order that U.S. President Trump signed in September. The sale of TikTok’s U.S. business to an American investor group was also authorized in that document. Trump said during a briefing with reporters that He received clearance from Xi Jinping, the president of China. “I spoke with President Xi; we had a good talk, I told him what we were doing, and he said, ‘Go ahead with it.” -Donald Trump, U.S. President. Vice President JD Vance said that as a result of the deal, TikTok U.S. would be worth “around $14 billion.” CFIUS and the Biden administration influence TikTok’s U.S. operations The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) issued a Divestment order on August 14, 2020. CFIUS order required ByteDance to sell off TikTok’s U.S. company due to national security concerns. According to the order, CFIUS required TikTok either to liquidate its American business or face a ban. The U.S. Congress passed the Act. According to the White House Report, the sell-off Order of August 14, 2020, reserved the ability to issue additional orders involving ByteDance to preserve U.S. national security. The report stated that the Framework Agreement and a CFIUS-approved agreement with U.S. investors ensured that economic incentives were aligned with national security safeguards. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States process and lawmakers requested a structural cure from both sides, building distinct U.S. operations. The White House report noted that the structural cure limited foreign access to data and critical systems, and assigned verification to an American security partner. The White House report noted that TikTok has an estimated 170 million subscribers in the U.S. On September 19, ByteDance stated that “it will work in accordance with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users through TikTok U.S.” However, ByteDance has not yet officially agreed to the agreement or presidential order.

The nation’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) is pushing for a groundbreaking Digital Financial Security Act . This move aims to fortify the defenses of virtual asset service providers against devastating hacks. The recent Upbit incident, which saw losses of over $32 million, served as a stark catalyst for this legislative push. For investors and industry players, this signals a new era of accountability and security in one of the world’s most active crypto markets. What is the Digital Financial Security Act and Why Now? The proposed Digital Financial Security Act represents a comprehensive legal framework designed to prevent crypto hacks. South Korea’s FSC disclosed this plan in a December business report to the presidential office. The commission explicitly cited the Upbit hack as a key example of the vulnerabilities in the current system. Therefore, the act seeks to create a unified security standard for a broad range of entities, including: Traditional financial companies Electronic financial service providers Virtual asset service providers (VASPs) like exchanges This legislation is not just a reaction but a proactive measure. It aims to build a resilient digital finance ecosystem that can withstand sophisticated attacks. How Will This New Act Prevent Future Crypto Hacks? The core mission of the Digital Financial Security Act is prevention. By establishing mandatory security protocols, the FSC hopes to close the gaps that hackers exploit. The act will likely mandate stringent cybersecurity measures, such as cold storage requirements for customer funds and regular penetration testing. Moreover, the FSC plans to strengthen its response system for new types of financial crimes. This enhanced system will specifically target: Cross-border crime: Tracking illicit fund flows across jurisdictions. Money laundering: Implementing stricter Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks for crypto transactions. By covering both prevention and enforcement, the act creates a more holistic defense against crypto hacks. What Does a “Comprehensive Regulatory Framework” Include? Beyond immediate security, the Digital Financial Security Act is part of a larger vision. The FSC intends to use it as a foundation for a comprehensive regulatory framework for all digital assets. A critical component of this framework will be clear rules for stablecoins. These dollar-pegged tokens have become integral to crypto trading and DeFi but currently operate in a regulatory gray area in many regions. Establishing rules will provide much-needed clarity and stability for issuers and users alike. This move positions South Korea not just as a consumer market, but as a potential leader in shaping sensible digital asset policy. What Are the Challenges and Implications for the Crypto Industry? While the intent of the Digital Financial Security Act is protective, its implementation will present challenges. Increased compliance costs could burden smaller exchanges and startups. Furthermore, finding the right balance between security and innovation is always delicate. Overly restrictive rules might stifle the very creativity that drives the crypto sector. However, the potential benefits are significant. For the industry, clear regulations can reduce uncertainty and attract more institutional investment. For everyday users, it means greater confidence that their assets are safe on regulated platforms. This act could become a model for other nations grappling with similar security concerns. Conclusion: A Step Toward Maturity and Security South Korea’s push for a Digital Financial Security Act marks a pivotal moment. It transitions the conversation from reactive damage control to proactive, systemic protection. By learning from past incidents like the Upbit hack, the FSC is constructing a legal shield for the future of digital finance. This legislation, if enacted effectively, will not only prevent crypto hacks but also foster a safer, more trustworthy environment for everyone involved. It is a bold acknowledgment that for cryptocurrency to achieve mainstream adoption, robust security must be the non-negotiable foundation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What triggered South Korea’s push for the Digital Financial Security Act? A1: The immediate trigger was the recent hack of the Upbit exchange, which resulted in a loss of 44.5 billion won ($32.2 million). This incident highlighted critical security vulnerabilities, prompting the FSC to propose comprehensive legislation. Q2: Who will be affected by this new act? A2: The act is expected to cover a wide range of entities, including traditional financial companies, electronic financial service providers, and all virtual asset service providers (VASPs) like cryptocurrency exchanges. Q3: How will this act help prevent money laundering? A3: The FSC plans to strengthen its response system, which will include enhanced tracking of cross-border transactions and stricter enforcement of KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations for crypto transactions. Q4: Does the act only cover security, or are there other regulations? A4: While security is the primary focus, the act is part of a plan to establish a broader regulatory framework. This includes creating specific rules for stablecoins, bringing more clarity to that sector of the digital asset market. Q5: What are the potential downsides of this regulation? A5: The main challenges could be increased operational and compliance costs for crypto businesses, especially smaller ones. There is also a concern that overly strict rules might limit innovation within the South Korean crypto ecosystem. Q6: When is this act expected to be passed? A6: The FSC has disclosed the plan, but it is still in the proposal stage. It will need to go through the legislative process in South Korea’s National Assembly, so a specific timeline for enactment is not yet available.

Esports market depth and promotions are more limited compared to esports-focused platforms, but it remains a solid option for users who value anonymity. How to Choose the Best Crypto Esports Betting Site Not every crypto betting site is optimized for esports. When betting on CS:GO and Dota 2, a few core factors matter most. Key points to consider: Market depth — map, series, handicap, totals, and prop bets across major and regional events Odds quality — competitive pricing with consistent limits for pre-match and live betting Live betting performance — fast odds updates, minimal delays, and optional live streaming Crypto payments — support for BTC and USDT, quick withdrawals, transparent network fees Bonuses — cashback, free bets, or VIP rewards with reasonable wagering terms Platforms that perform well in these areas offer a smoother and more reliable esports betting experience in 2026. Why Bet on CS:GO and Dota 2 with Crypto? Cryptocurrency has become the preferred payment method for many esports bettors due to its efficiency and flexibility. Key advantages include: Faster deposits and withdrawals Global access to esports betting markets Reduced banking friction Privacy-focused transactions For CS:GO and Dota 2, where live betting and frequent wagers are common, crypto payments offer a clear advantage over traditional methods. Cryptocurrencies Used for Esports Betting Most crypto esports betting sites focus on a small set of reliable digital assets that offer speed, liquidity, and low fees. The most commonly used options in CS:GO and Dota 2 betting include: Bitcoin (BTC) — the most widely accepted cryptocurrency for esports betting, suitable for both pre-match and live wagers Tether (USDT) — popular among bettors who want price stability during long tournaments or live betting sessions Ethereum (ETH) — commonly supported, though fees can vary depending on network conditions Other altcoins — platforms may also accept LTC, DOGE, TRX, or BNB for faster or cheaper transactions For most esports bettors in 2026, BTC and USDT remain the preferred choices due to their balance of reliability, speed, and broad platform support. Benefits and Risks of Crypto Esports Betting Key Benefits Fast deposits and withdrawals using crypto Global access to CS:GO and Dota 2 betting markets Lower payment friction compared to fiat sportsbooks Privacy-focused transactions Potential Risks Volatile odds during live matches Limited consumer protection on some platforms Bonus terms that may restrict esports markets Balancing speed and discipline is essential when betting on esports with cryptocurrency. Conclusion Crypto betting has become a natural fit for CS:GO and Dota 2 esports in 2026, offering faster payouts, global access, and flexible live betting. With deep esports markets, real-time odds, and crypto-first design, platforms like Dexsport provide a streamlined way to bet on esports using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Key Takeaways: Raoul Pal says Zcash’s rally so far looks like capital rotation, not a confirmed long-term uptrend. Despite a 699% gain this year, ZEC has pulled back sharply, falling about 37% over the past month. Pal says Zcash must form a stable price base before its move can be considered structural. Speaking on the When Shift Happens podcast with Kevin Follonier on Thursday, Pal said Zcash’s rally has yet to prove it represents a structural trend rather than speculative repositioning within the broader crypto market. “Do I need that asset to say I was in earliest? I don’t really,” Pal said, suggesting that recent price action alone is not enough to justify long-term conviction. Zcash’s 699% Rally Loses Steam as Prices Pull Back 37% in a Month Zcash (ZEC) has posted some of the strongest gains among major cryptocurrencies this year, rising roughly 699% since Jan. 1 to trade around $385, according to CoinMarketCap. However, momentum has faded in recent weeks, with the token down about 37% over the past 30 days. Pal said that distinction is critical. “We can’t prove it until the whole market goes up and it continues to trend and not a rotation,” he said. “Right now it’s confirming the rotation thesis.” According to Pal, the next key test for Zcash will be whether it can establish a stable base after its sharp move higher. Sustained support at lower levels would indicate that buyers are stepping in with longer-term conviction, rather than exiting after a rapid run-up. “What you want to see is whether it finds a base and then starts pulling up again,” he said. Despite the strong year-to-date performance, Pal said he is not inclined to chase the asset at current levels. “I’m not sure I’m going to chase it, but I might buy it in the next down cycle,” he added. Zcash’s rally has stood out in a broader market that has struggled to maintain upward momentum. The token’s market capitalization climbed from under $1 billion in August to more than $7 billion at its early November peak, even as several major cryptocurrencies traded lower. Part of that surge followed comments from crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes, who said in late October that Zcash could eventually reach $10,000, triggering a sharp short-term price reaction. ZEC jumped roughly 30% within 24 hours of the remarks. Institutional Interest Moves Toward Zcash ETF Interest in privacy-focused assets has also increased amid growing concerns around surveillance, censorship, and regulatory scrutiny. In November, XT Exchange said anonymity-focused tokens were gaining renewed attention as traders reassessed the role of privacy in digital assets. Institutional interest has begun to follow. On Nov. 27, Grayscale Investments filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to convert its Zcash trust into a spot ETF, signaling a potential pathway for broader investor exposure.

By 2026, many players are actively moving away from platforms that require full identity verification, document uploads, and intrusive compliance checks. Instead, demand is growing for no-KYC crypto betting sites that allow users to bet with Bitcoin anonymously while still offering reliability and modern betting features. This article explains how no-KYC crypto betting works, why it has become popular, and how platforms like Dexsport approach anonymous crypto sports betting in a more structured and mature way. Quick Overview No-KYC crypto betting allows users to place bets without identity verification Bitcoin remains the most popular currency for anonymous sports betting Speed, privacy, and global access drive adoption in 2026 Dexsport offers a crypto-native, no-KYC betting experience built around transparency What Is No-KYC Crypto Betting? No-KYC crypto betting refers to betting platforms that do not require users to complete “Know Your Customer” verification as part of standard onboarding. Instead of submitting personal documents, players interact with the platform using cryptocurrency wallets or minimal account details. In practice, this model is most common in: Crypto sports betting Esports betting Decentralized or Web3-oriented platforms The core idea is simple: cryptocurrency acts as both the payment method and the access layer, reducing the need for traditional identity checks. Dexsport : No-KYC Crypto Betting Platform Overview Dexsport represents a more mature approach to no-KYC crypto betting. Rather than positioning anonymity as a loophole, the platform integrates privacy into a broader crypto-native betting framework. Dexsport allows users to access the platform without mandatory identity verification, using options such as email, Telegram, or DeFi wallet connections. Bitcoin is fully supported alongside other cryptocurrencies, making it suitable for players who want to bet with BTC anonymously. What distinguishes Dexsport from many no-KYC crypto betting sites is its emphasis on transparency. A public bet desk displays wagers and outcomes in real time, allowing users to observe betting activity rather than relying on opaque settlement systems. The platform covers: Sports betting with deep market coverage Esports betting, including popular competitive titles Live betting and streaming features Crypto-based bonuses and cashback systems By combining no-KYC access with visible betting mechanics, Dexsport aims to reduce the typical trust gap associated with anonymous betting platforms. How No-KYC Betting Works on Dexsport Account Setup Without Verification Users can register quickly without submitting identity documents. Access is granted through lightweight sign-up options, allowing immediate entry to betting markets. Betting with Bitcoin and Crypto Bitcoin can be used directly for sports and esports betting. Deposits are handled on-chain, and balances are managed without conversion into fiat systems. This structure supports true crypto sports betting no KYC, rather than a hybrid model. Withdrawals and Privacy Considerations Withdrawals are processed in cryptocurrency, maintaining privacy throughout the transaction cycle. Users retain control over wallet addresses and transaction timing. Why Bettors Are Choosing No-KYC Crypto Platforms in 2026 The rise of no-KYC crypto betting is not driven by a single factor. Instead, it reflects broader changes in how players interact with online betting platforms. Privacy and Anonymity For many users, privacy is the main motivation. No-KYC crypto betting sites allow players to bet without linking wagers to personal identity, reducing exposure of sensitive data. Bitcoin anonymous sports betting is especially appealing to players who value financial discretion and control. Faster Access and Withdrawals Traditional sportsbooks often delay withdrawals due to verification checks or manual reviews. Crypto betting without KYC removes many of these bottlenecks. Benefits include: Faster deposits Quicker withdrawals Fewer approval steps This speed advantage is a key reason crypto betting sites with no KYC continue to grow. Fewer Regional Restrictions Many bettors face geographic limitations on traditional platforms. No-KYC crypto betting sites tend to operate globally, making them accessible to international users who may not have local sportsbook options. A Crypto-Native Betting Experience Unlike platforms that simply “accept crypto,” no-KYC sportsbooks are often designed specifically for digital assets. Wallet-based access, blockchain settlements, and transparent transaction histories are common features.. Conclusion In 2026, no-KYC crypto betting has evolved from a fringe concept into a legitimate alternative for experienced bettors. Privacy, speed, and global access continue to drive demand, especially for those looking to engage in bitcoin anonymous sports betting . Platforms like Dexsport illustrate how no-KYC crypto betting can be combined with transparency and structure rather than operating as a black box. For players seeking crypto betting without KYC, understanding how a platform balances anonymity with trust remains the most important factor.",More News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-12-19 07:57:04

You’re Fine!” Feels Worse Than Covid Crash Futures trader ‘Toni’ replied, stating that the long-term gain and current pullback mean that “reversion is doing its job, not a bear market.” “The ETF inflows created the spike, now we’re just settling back to the long-term BTC growth curve. This is healthy consolidation.” The comments came in response to analyst ‘Ash Crypto,’ who said that markets made this year feel worse than the COVID crash, FTX meltdown, LUNA crash, SEC and Gary Gensler’s lawsuit spree, Celsius and BlockFi bankruptcies, and the 3AC collapse. He listed several bullish fundamentals that have emerged this year, including pro-crypto policy in the US, all-time highs for stocks and commodities, institutional adoption, and expansion of the global money supply. “Market rallies don’t start when hope is high, it’s when people are tired, frustrated, and ready to give up.” 2025 has been brutal, “it was front-loaded pain in every single way possible, from tariffs to geopolitical tensions to policy mayhem and everything in between,” said crypto investor Jesse Eckel. However, he also debunked the four-year cycle theory, stating that 2026 is structurally the opposite. “They want an economic boom and are pouring as much gasoline on the fire as they can. It’s not even 2026, and we’ve already received three rate cuts, QT is over, balance sheet expansion is underway, and tariff reductions,” he added before adding that it will be a five-year cycle. Don’t Panic And Zoom Out Looking at the Bitcoin chart from a yearly perspective shows that it is still in a strong uptrend . BTC is still double the price it was trading at on this day two years ago and more than 400% higher than it was in December 2022. Nevertheless, the asset continues to weaken in the short term and was trading around $87,000 at the time of writing, 31% down from its all-time high, but up 2.3% after the Bank of Japan raised rates on Friday morning.

Exciting new analysis suggests the flagship cryptocurrency has officially moved out of oversold territory, potentially marking a crucial turning point for investors. According to crypto analyst MorenoDV, key on-chain metrics now point toward the beginning of a gradual Bitcoin recovery . This shift could signal fresh opportunities in the evolving market landscape. What Does “Oversold” Mean for Bitcoin? In trading, an “oversold” asset is one believed to be trading below its intrinsic value, often due to excessive selling pressure. For Bitcoin, exiting this state is a significant technical and psychological event. It suggests the intense selling may have exhausted itself, allowing space for stabilization and potential growth. The analyst bases this optimistic outlook on a rebound in a specific, powerful indicator. The NVT Golden Cross: Your Guide to Market Cycles MorenoDV highlights the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross indicator as the primary signal for this shift. Think of it as a sophisticated tool that compares Bitcoin’s market value (network value) to its transactional utility. Here’s how it works: Overbought Signal: A reading above 2.2 typically suggests Bitcoin is overvalued relative to its network usage. Oversold Signal: A reading below -1.6 indicates it is undervalued. The analyst reports this metric has rebounded sharply from -0.58 to 0.32. More importantly, it recently hit the lowest level of the current market cycle. This extreme reading often structurally hints that a short-term price bottom is in place. Why This Bitcoin Recovery Phase Matters Now This isn’t just a minor statistical blip. The indicator’s climb from its cycle low and its move into positive territory suggests a change in market structure. The Bitcoin recovery appears to be transitioning from a concept to a measurable, on-chain reality. For traders and long-term holders, this phase is critical. It represents the period where fear subsides, value is recognized, and a new foundation for price action is built. However, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The indicator shows a “gradual recovery,” not a vertical surge. This implies a process that may involve consolidation and testing of new support levels. Patience, therefore, remains a key virtue for anyone watching this Bitcoin recovery unfold. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors What should you do with this information? First, understand that on-chain analysis provides context, not crystal-ball predictions. The signal suggests the conditions for a Bitcoin recovery are improving. Consider these steps: Monitor the Trend: Watch if the NVT Golden Cross continues its upward trajectory. Assess Risk: Gradual recoveries can be volatile; ensure your position sizing reflects your risk tolerance. Look for Confirmation: Pair this data with other indicators like trading volume and macroeconomic trends. Conclusion: A Cautious Optimism Takes Hold The exit from oversold territory marks a hopeful moment for the Bitcoin market. The rebound in the NVT Golden Cross provides a data-driven reason for cautious optimism, suggesting the worst of the recent selling pressure may be over. While challenges remain, the path for a sustained Bitcoin recovery now looks more plausible. The journey upward has begun, one gradual step at a time. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the NVT Golden Cross indicator? The NVT (Network Value to Transactions) Golden Cross is an on-chain metric that compares Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the value transacted on its network. It helps identify whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued based on its utility. Does exiting oversold territory guarantee a price increase? No, it does not guarantee an immediate price rise. It indicates that extreme selling pressure has likely eased, creating conditions more favorable for recovery or stabilization. Price action depends on many additional factors. How reliable is this indicator for predicting bottoms? While no indicator is perfect, extreme readings on the NVT Golden Cross have historically coincided with significant market cycle lows. It is considered a strong, data-backed signal for identifying potential turning points. What’s the difference between “oversold” and a “market bottom”? “Oversold” describes a condition of excessive selling. A “market bottom” is the confirmed lowest price point. An asset can be oversold and still see further declines, but exiting an oversold state is often a prerequisite for forming a bottom. Should I invest based solely on this signal? Absolutely not. This should be one piece of a comprehensive investment strategy. Always conduct your own research, consider your financial goals and risk tolerance, and look for confirmation from multiple data sources. How long do gradual recoveries typically last? There is no set timeline. A gradual recovery can last weeks or months, often involving periods of consolidation and testing of investor sentiment. It contrasts with a rapid, V-shaped rebound.

56027102,646839,1766131218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56027102.jpeg,Bitcoin Losses Are Aging: 43% Of Underwater Supply Now Held By HODLers,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-losses-aging-43-underwater-held-by-hodlers/,"On-chain data shows the distribution of the underwater Bitcoin supply has been shifting recently with the share of long-term holders rising. 23.7% Of Bitcoin Supply Is Currently Being Held At A Loss In its latest weekly report, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Total Supply in Loss . This metric measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of the cryptocurrency’s supply that’s currently carrying a net unrealized loss. The indicator works by going through the transaction history of each token in circulation to see what price it was last moved at. If this previous transaction price was lower than the latest spot price for any token, then that particular coin is assumed to be underwater right now. The Total Supply in Loss adds up all coins of this type to produce a net situation for the network. A counterpart metric called the Total Supply in Profit accounts for the tokens of the opposite type. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the 7-day moving average (MA) of the Total Supply in Loss over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Total Supply in Loss witnessed a sharp surge as the asset’s price crashed in November. Since then, the metric has stayed inside the 6 to 7 million BTC range, with its current value being 6.7 million BTC. This phase corresponds to the highest degree of loss on the network since 2023. Glassnode explained: Persisting within the 6–7 million BTC range since mid-November, this pattern closely mirrors early transitional phases of prior cycles, where mounting investor frustration preceded a shift toward more pronounced bearish conditions and intensified capitulation at lower prices. The report has also shed light on how this loss supply is distributed between the two main divisions of the Bitcoin investors based on holding time: short-term holders (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs) . The cutoff between the two groups is 155 days, with investors who purchased inside this window falling in the STHs and those with a longer holding time in LTHs. As the below chart shows, the Bitcoin loss supply spike last month was initially dominated by STHs. With the cryptocurrency ranging low since then, the distribution of the loss supply has seen a shift between the two cohorts: LTHs have gained some notable share. Of the 23.7% Bitcoin supply in circulation that’s underwater right now, 13.5% is held by STHs and 10.2% by LTHs. “This distribution suggests that, much like in prior cycle transitions into deeper bearish regimes, loss-bearing supply accumulated by recent buyers is gradually maturing into the long-term holder cohort,” noted the analytics firm.

The court sentenced the accused to 71 months in federal prison for defrauding working-class Spanish-speaking investors. Mendoza was a senior promoter in the purported crypto-mining and trading company IcomTech. The firm was established in mid-2018 and collapsed by the end of 2019. Court orders Mendoza to pay restitution and forfeit his California residence Crypto promoter sentenced for Ponzi scheme “IcomTech.” “Mendoza targeted Spanish-speaking investors with false promises about ‘crypto’ profits and left victims, including those here in New York, holding only losses,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton. https://t.co/ZmXKRrFPBZ — US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) December 18, 2025 The court alleged that Mendoza’s scheme falsely promised guaranteed daily returns from crypto trading and mining. However, he operated that scheme as a classic MLM-style Ponzi scheme, paying earlier participants with new investor funds. According to the report, he allegedly siphoned hundreds of thousands for personal use. The court ordered Mendoza to pay $789,218.94 in restitution. He is also required to forfeit approximately $1.5 million, along with his Downey, California, residence, which is suspected to be derived from the proceeds of the scheme. The defendant is alleged to have previously promoted at least two other digital asset Ponzi schemes. The court found that Mendoza also used his own restaurant in Los Angeles to host pitch events and collect thousands in cash. Mendoza’s scheme worked because he toured the country with flashy expos, arriving in luxury cars and wearing designer clothes. Meanwhile, his victims were unaware that they couldn’t access their phantom profits growing in their dashboards. Court documents revealed that withdrawal requests began to be delayed at the beginning of August 2018. The delays were followed by excuses and hidden fees, which prompted IcomTech to roll out a proprietary token, Icoms. The digital asset was falsely touted as valuable for future payments but turned out to be worthless, leading to losses for investors. Ari Redbord, Global Head of Policy at TRM Labs , argued that promoters often share a language or cultural background with their victims. She believes that it lowers skepticism and increases credibility. She also noted that such schemes exploit real barriers faced by immigrant communities. “Promoters often share a language or cultural background with victims, which lowers skepticism and increases credibility. These schemes also exploit real barriers – limited access to traditional financial services, less exposure to regulatory warnings in a person’s primary language, and heavy reliance on word-of-mouth networks.” -Ari Redbord, Global Head of Policy at TRM Labs. Redbord also acknowledged that Mendoza’s 71-month sentence mirrors how courts are currently treating large-scale crypto Ponzi schemes. According to her, courts give such a sentence where a Ponzi scheme has a clear intent, significant victim loss, and sustained promotion. She argued that courts are increasingly focused on traditional fraud factors, such as scale, duration, losses, and leadership roles. Court sentences other co-conspirators for their roles in the IcomTech Ponzi scheme The court also sentenced Mendoza for illegal reentry into the U.S. after deportation. He was accused of living in the country unlawfully for decades, and he has been deported four times. He has also been deported once for using a false identity. Court documents revealed that Mendoza went on to promote around three more crypto Ponzi schemes after IcomTech collapsed. The court has also convicted and sentenced other senior promoters for their roles in the scheme, including David Brend, Juan Arellano, and Moses Valdez. Other co-conspirators in the scheme were also charged, including IcomTech’s founder, David Carmona, alleged CEO Marco Ruiz Ochoa, and web developer Gustavo Rodriguez. Redbord argued that the biggest challenge is dealing with promoters who move from one scheme to the next by rebranding pitches and targeting new communities. She added that IcomTech is a clear example of promoters resurfacing, but their histories eventually catch up with them. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The Clarity Bill establishes clear rules for how banks and financial institutions can engage with digital assets. For the first time, it provides explicit guidance on which crypto assets banks may hold, custody, or use, and under what conditions. Therefore, this regulatory certainty paves the way for deeper institutional participation, more secure custody solutions, and seamless integration of blockchain technology into the traditional financial system. How the Clarity Bill Could Unlock XRP’s Next Growth Phase If the Clarity Bill becomes law, here’s how XRP could gain, based on existing reporting and regulatory insights. 1. Clear Legal Status & Regulatory Certainty A key potential benefit of the Clarity Bill is its aim to define how digital assets like XRP are classified under U.S. law, potentially as commodities rather than securities. This legal clarity could reduce long-standing uncertainty that has weighed on XRP’s price and adoption. Clear statutory definitions would also make it safer for institutions, exchanges, market-makers, and custodians to work with XRP without fear of sudden regulatory shifts. 2. Potential Commodity Classification If the Clarity Bill classifies XRP as a commodity, as Ripple and many investors hope, it would fall under the CFTC instead of the SEC. This builds on prior court rulings that XRP is not a security and positions it more favorably for long-term institutional adoption, offering clarity and reducing regulatory uncertainty compared with a ‘security’ label. 3. Boost in Institutional Investment Regulatory clarity is key for major investors, banks, hedge funds, and pension funds, to commit capital. If the Clarity Bill establishes a trusted legal framework, it could unlock significant institutional inflows into XRP and related products like ETFs and custody services, boosting liquidity, stabilizing markets, and supporting long-term price growth. 4. Less Regulatory Overhang Regulatory uncertainty, like the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, has long weighed on crypto markets. If the Clarity Bill passes and curbs enforcement overreach, it could remove a major barrier for investors, boosting confidence and sparking bullish momentum, as past legislative progress has often driven price rallies. 5. Stronger Use-Case Narrative XRP’s core strength lies in cross-border payments. Regulatory clarity could unlock wider adoption by banks and financial institutions, driving real-world transaction use on the XRP Ledger beyond speculation. Conclusion The passage of the Clarity Bill could be a game-changer for XRP. By clarifying regulations and potentially classifying XRP as a commodity, it would reduce legal uncertainty, attract institutional investment, and boost real-world use in cross-border payments. Despite ongoing compliance and legislative details, the bill paves the way for a more secure, credible, and scalable future, positioning XRP as a leading digital asset in a maturing crypto market.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-19 08:07:45
56027704,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/borrow-fiat-with-crypto-in-europe-regulated-bitcoin-backed-lenders-compared,1766131856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/56027704.jpeg,Borrow Fiat with Crypto in Europe: Regulated Bitcoin-Backed Lenders Compared,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/borrow-fiat-with-crypto-in-europe-regulated-bitcoin-backed-lenders-compared,"Crypto-backed lending in Europe has moved into a more mature phase. What used to be a fragmented mix of unregulated platforms and opaque terms has evolved into a regulated market where users can borrow fiat against Bitcoin and other major assets without selling their holdings. For long-term crypto holders, this model solves a familiar problem: access liquidity while maintaining market exposure and avoiding unnecessary taxable events. The difference between providers, however, lies in structure, cost efficiency, and how much control the borrower retains. Among regulated European lenders, Clapp stands out for rethinking how crypto credit should work. Clapp.Finance: Crypto Credit Lines Built for Real Usage Clapp operates a regulated credit-line model designed around flexibility and cost control. Users secure a borrowing limit with crypto collateral, including Bitcoin, but interest accrues only on the amount actually withdrawn, not on the full approved limit. Any unused portion of the credit line carries 0% APR, and once funds are repaid, the available credit is restored immediately. This structure changes how borrowing feels in practice. Liquidity is always available, but capital is not priced unless it is actively used. The annual rate is floating and linked to LTV, remaining among the lowest in the market due to its direct risk-based pricing. Clapp also supports multi-collateral borrowing, allowing users to combine up to 19 assets—BTC, ETH, SOL, and stablecoins—into a single credit line. There is no fixed repayment schedule, and funds can be drawn or released at any time directly from the Clapp Wallet. From a risk perspective, LTV is monitored in real time. Users receive advance notifications as their position approaches liquidation thresholds, giving them time to add collateral or repay part of the balance. The result is a borrowing framework that prioritizes visibility, flexibility, and borrower control. Nexo: Established and Structured Nexo is one of the most recognized crypto lenders operating under European regulatory frameworks. Its model centers on open-ended credit lines backed by major crypto assets, including Bitcoin. Borrowers can access fiat currencies such as EUR and GBP, with interest rates influenced by LTV and loyalty tiers. While the structure is flexible compared to traditional loans, interest accrues on borrowed balances continuously, and rates are generally higher than usage-based models during periods of lower utilization. Nexo’s appeal lies in its long operating history, wide fiat support, and institutional-grade custody arrangements. For users seeking a familiar and established platform with clear rate tiers, it remains a solid option. YouHodler: Higher LTV, Higher Risk YouHodler focuses on flexibility and leverage. It allows borrowing against a wide range of crypto assets, often offering higher LTV limits than more conservative lenders. This approach can unlock more fiat liquidity from the same collateral, but it comes with increased liquidation risk. Interest rates scale with LTV, and active monitoring is required to avoid forced liquidation during volatile market conditions. For experienced users who understand leverage and are comfortable managing exposure, YouHodler offers powerful tools. For conservative borrowers, the trade-offs deserve careful consideration. Comparing the Models The key difference between these platforms is not just regulation or supported assets, but how borrowing is priced and controlled. Traditional crypto loans often resemble repackaged margin products, where interest runs continuously and repayment terms are implicit rather than explicit. Clapp’s model separates access to liquidity from interest accrual, allowing users to keep capital available without paying for it unnecessarily. In volatile markets, this distinction matters. Paying interest only when capital is in use can materially reduce costs, especially for users who need liquidity intermittently rather than constantly. Final Thoughts Europe’s regulated crypto lending market now offers credible, compliant ways to borrow fiat against Bitcoin. Among leading providers, Clapp sets itself apart by aligning borrowing costs with real usage rather than static loan terms. For users who value control, flexibility, and cost efficiency, its credit-line approach offers a practical alternative to standard crypto-backed loans—one that fits how capital is actually used, not how loans are traditionally structured. How to Borrow Fiat with Crypto Collateral: FAQ What does it mean to borrow fiat with crypto in Europe?It means using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as collateral to receive a fiat loan (for example, EUR) from a regulated lender. You keep ownership of your crypto while accessing cash. Are crypto-backed loans legal and regulated in Europe?Yes, several providers operate under European regulatory frameworks. These platforms follow disclosure, custody, and consumer protection requirements, offering more transparency than unregulated lenders. How does a Bitcoin-backed loan work?You deposit Bitcoin as collateral and receive a fiat loan based on a predefined Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. If the value of Bitcoin falls and LTV rises too high, the lender may require additional collateral or liquidate part of the position. How is Clapp different from traditional crypto loans?Clapp uses a credit-line model. You secure a borrowing limit with your crypto but pay interest only on the amount you actually withdraw. Unused credit carries 0% APR, and repaid funds immediately restore available credit. Can I use multiple assets as collateral on Clapp?Yes. Clapp allows users to combine up to 19 assets—including BTC, ETH, SOL, and stablecoins—into a single credit line. Who is crypto-backed borrowing best suited for?It suits long-term crypto holders who want fiat liquidity without selling their assets, triggering taxable events, or committing to rigid loan terms.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s price also increased to $847.7 as buying interest surged once again. If traders continue buying, the BNB price might see a further increase and break above $875. On the other hand, a failure in attracting buying demand might result in a correction. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate support at $830. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $8,519.96 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $847.7, as bulls target $875. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 1.19 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction , BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2026, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $8,519.96 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November. By the end of November, the price of BNB declined below $800. In early December, BNB price triggered a strong bull run toward $900.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-19 08:14:08

Bearish Patterns Emerge For Solana This downturn comes as the cryptocurrency has broken below the critical support level of $120, which had acted as a pivotal floor since the start of the month and previously prevented further drops. The situation appears even more dire for investors with bullish sentiments, as recent data from CoinGecko indicates that Solana has retraced nearly 60% from its all-time high of $293, reached back in January of this year. Year-to-date, the token has experienced a significant loss of 40%, which raises additional concerns among top analysts about its near-term stability. Related Reading: Optimism Grows In Crypto Market Structure Bill After Wednesday’s Senate Banking Meeting Experts are cautioning that unless conditions change, the Solana price may soon retest the $100 mark—an area not seen since April. Should this scenario materialize, it would imply an additional drop of approximately 15.9%. Some analysts, like market commentator EddieTradezz, have pointed to a bearish “head and shoulders” pattern formed in SOL’s daily chart, suggesting that Solana is on the brink of a substantial decline. He notes that it is now breaking through strong long-term resistance, with April’s lows around $95 potentially being a more realistic target than $100. Adding to the bearish sentiment, fellow expert ColdBloodShill has indicated that Solana may be heading toward a price point of $80, which would result in a drastic additional drop of 32%. However, as EddieTradezz mentioned, the possibility for recovery would largely depend on market-wide conditions and investor sentiment. Institutional Interest Grows As SOL ETFs See Major Inflows Despite the prevailing bearish indicators, there has been a noteworthy development on the institutional front. Recently approved Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US have seen impressive uptake, amassing $63.9 million in net inflows over the past week. This suggests that institutions are beginning to accumulate Solana, potentially viewing it as a long-term investment opportunity. However, this positive news has been overshadowed by heavy selling pressure in spot markets. Related Reading: Bitwise’s 2026 Crypto Forecast: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Poised For New Record Highs Increased volatility has led to a rise in liquidations for leveraged positions, dampening Solana’s price reaction to the overall positive developments in institutional interest. Ultimately, Solana’s future remains uncertain. While institutional interest may offer some hope, the immediate outlook is clouded by increased selling pressure and the inability to regain capital in the broader market, which has recently dropped below the $2.90 trillion mark in total market capitalization.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-caressing-its-13-month-support-base-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto analyst ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) is closely tracking XRP as the asset trades at a level that has defined its structure for more than a year. In his latest chart analysis, the focus is not on short-term volatility but on a long-established support base that now sits under direct pressure. XRP’s price action has compressed into a narrowing range, forcing what ChartNerd views as a decisive moment for the asset. It currently sits on a 13-month support zone that has repeatedly absorbed selling pressure. According to the analyst, this area represents the dividing line between continuation and a deeper corrective move. The chart shows XRP trading within a descending broadening wedge , a structure defined by lower highs and volatility. While the pattern allows for both outcomes, ChartNerd emphasized that the support base must hold to sustain bullish momentum. He described the setup as “the fine line between moonshot, or the sweep,” highlighting how little margin remains before a larger reaction unfolds. $XRP is caressing its 13 month support base. The fine line between moonshot, or the sweep. Hold multi-month support, the launchpad looks ready. Lose support, then the ""Lower Base Sweep"" will come into effect within this Descending Broadening Wedge. See through the storm. pic.twitter.com/IQV969zERg — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 17, 2025 Multi-Month Support Defines the Short-Term Outlook The support zone has acted as a pivot throughout the past 13 months. Each prior test resulted in a bounce that restored higher price levels. One of these bounces pushed XRP to its all-time high of $3.65 in July . This rally gave rise to the descending broadening wedge, setting XRP down the path that currently defines its potential trajectory. ChartNerd emphasized that the consistency of this pattern matters. In his view, holding this area keeps XRP positioned for what he described as a launchpad . That scenario depends on sustained closes above support and a gradual reduction in selling pressure from the wedge resistance. The structure does not require an immediate breakout, but requires stability. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Risk of a Lower Base Sweep Still Exists ChartNerd also outlined the alternative outcome. A failure to hold multi-month support would trigger what ChartNerd called a “Lower Base Sweep.” His chart indicates the 0.382 Fibonacci level near $1.55 as the likely target. XRP previously fell to similar levels during a flash crash in October . However, he stressed that such a move would not break the larger cycle. Instead, it would complete a corrective phase before continuation. “See through the storm,” he wrote, urging patience during heightened volatility. What Comes Next for XRP? XRP now trades in a compressed technical window where reaction matters more than prediction. The chart shows clear levels and highlights the importance of support levels. Resistance levels define confirmation, and if XRP holds the 13-month base, the structure favors continuation within the wedge and eventual upside resolution .

56029980,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248014,1766135411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming Hyperliquid Outflows: $430M Flees Decentralized Exchange in One Week,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/hyperliquid-outflows-430-million-week/,"BitcoinWorld Alarming Hyperliquid Outflows: $430M Flees Decentralized Exchange in One Week The decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape was rattled this week as data revealed staggering capital flight from a major player. Hyperliquid, a leading perpetual futures decentralized exchange (DEX), recorded net outflows exceeding $430 million. This marks the third-largest weekly withdrawal in the platform’s history, signaling a potential crisis of confidence among its users. Let’s unpack what these massive Hyperliquid outflows mean and why they matter for the broader crypto ecosystem. What Are the Staggering Hyperliquid Outflows Telling Us? According to a report by Wu Blockchain, the scale of the exit is unprecedented for the exchange. A net outflow of over $430 million in just seven days represents a significant portion of user-deposited assets leaving the platform. Consequently, this exodus has had a direct and severe impact on Hyperliquid’s total value locked (TVL). The platform’s assets under management (AUM) have plummeted from a peak of $6 billion in September to approximately $4 billion today. This dramatic decline paints a clear picture of eroding user trust and capital seeking safer or more profitable harbors. Why Is Capital Fleeing the Hyperliquid Exchange? While the raw numbers are startling, understanding the ‘why’ is crucial. Several interconnected factors likely contributed to this wave of Hyperliquid outflows . Market-Wide Volatility: Broader cryptocurrency market downturns often trigger a ‘flight to safety.’ Users withdraw funds from leveraged trading platforms like Hyperliquid to avoid liquidation risks or to hold assets in self-custody. Competitive Pressure: The DeFi perpetuals space is fiercely competitive. The emergence of new platforms offering lower fees, better incentives, or novel features can quickly siphon users and liquidity away from established exchanges. Protocol-Specific Concerns: While not confirmed, users may react to perceived risks, smart contract vulnerabilities, or changes in the platform’s tokenomics or reward structures. Therefore, this event is not just about Hyperliquid but serves as a real-time stress test for user loyalty in the permissionless world of DeFi. What Does This Mean for the Future of Hyperliquid and DeFi? Such significant Hyperliquid outflows present both a stark challenge and a critical learning opportunity. For the Hyperliquid team, the immediate priority will be stabilizing the situation. This could involve: Enhancing communication and transparency with the community. Reviewing and potentially boosting liquidity provider incentives. Auditing and showcasing protocol security to rebuild trust. For the wider DeFi sector, this episode is a reminder that capital is highly fluid and sensitive. It underscores that even innovative platforms must continuously earn their users’ deposits through security, performance, and value. The health of a DeFi protocol is directly tied to the confidence of its community. Key Takeaways from the $430M Withdrawal Episode In summary, the massive weekly Hyperliquid outflows are a significant market event with clear implications. First, they highlight the non-custodial nature of DeFi, where users can exit en masse at the click of a button. Second, they demonstrate how quickly leadership can change in a fast-paced, competitive environment. Finally, they remind all participants that due diligence and risk management are perpetual necessities, not one-time actions. The resilience of Hyperliquid moving forward will be a case study in protocol durability. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly are ‘net outflows’? A: Net outflows occur when the total value of assets withdrawn from a platform exceeds the total value of new assets deposited over a specific period. It indicates more money is leaving than entering. Q: Is my money safe on Hyperliquid after these outflows? A: The safety of funds depends on the platform’s smart contract security and your personal risk management. Large outflows don’t directly compromise security, but they can indicate shifting user sentiment. Always conduct your own research. Q: Could this cause Hyperliquid to shut down? A> While a severe and sustained loss of liquidity is a major challenge, it doesn’t necessarily mean shutdown. Many protocols navigate such periods by adapting their models and rebuilding trust. Q: Where is the withdrawn capital likely going? A> Capital could be moving to competing DEXs, centralized exchanges (CEXs), stablecoins, or simply into personal wallets (self-custody) as users adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ approach during market uncertainty. Q: How does this affect the price of Hyperliquid’s token (HLP)? A> Significant outflows can create selling pressure and negatively impact sentiment around a platform’s native token, potentially affecting its price. However, tokenomics are complex, and multiple factors are at play. Q: Should I withdraw my funds from Hyperliquid? A> This is not financial advice. You must make your own decision based on your risk tolerance, investment strategy, and confidence in the platform’s long-term vision and security.

Officials plan to announce details this Friday. Nanto, a city in Toyama prefecture near the Sea of Japan coast, is teaming up with private developer GigaStream Toyama. They’re planning a facility with 3.1 gigawatts of total power. That makes it the country’s third major data center spot, according to documents Reuters obtained. Japan’s racing to meet surging demand for computing power that artificial intelligence needs. Once it’s done, this will be one of the world’s largest facilities. The scale matches up with OpenAI’s Stargate project , which has a $500 billion price tag and 10 gigawatts of capacity. Finding good spots outside Tokyo and Osaka has been tough. Right now, those two regions hold about 85 percent of the country’s data centers. Government officials have been pushing to spread these around more to ease the bottlenecks. What makes Nanto an ideal location? Nanto has several things working in its favor. The city is about 250 kilometers from Tokyo and Osaka. That’s close enough to reach the big population centers without being right on top of them. But the bigger selling point is safety. Toyama is among the prefectures with the fewest big earthquakes, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The first phase of the Nanto Campus will support about 400 megawatts of power. That’s equal to some of Japan’s largest data centers announced so far. It can handle big operators like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. The site will be up and running by the end of 2028, based on the public-private plan. GigaStream Toyama focuses on getting infrastructure ready for data center operators to use. It’s similar to what U.S.-based companies Lancium and Tract do. The company plans to start promoting the Nanto Campus at next month’s Pacific Telecommunications Council conference in Honolulu. Daniel Cox heads up GigaStream Toyama. He’s spent 25 years in Japan’s real estate investment market. Officials at both Nanto city and GigaStream Toyama wouldn’t comment when asked. They said they’ll make an announcement soon according to Reuters. Market’s Growing Fast Cloud and AI services are pushing Japan’s data center market to grow fast. IDC Japan forecasts the market will almost double to more than 5 trillion yen in the five years through 2028. That’s $32 billion. The government’s counting on this sector to help hit its goal of bringing in 120 trillion yen in foreign direct investment by 2030. That’s up from 53.3 trillion yen in 2024. Power’s more abundant and generally cheaper in western Japan compared to the east. Multiple utilities service the area – Hokuriku Electric Power, Kansai Electric Power, and Electric Power Development, along with smaller operators. Hokuriku Electric sells less than half of its maximum output even without its idled Shika nuclear power plant running. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The city expects to grant its first licenses to stablecoin issuers in early 2025, creating a regulated framework for digital assets pegged to traditional currencies. This development signals Hong Kong’s commitment to balancing innovation with financial stability. What Does This Mean for Stablecoin Issuers? Christopher Hui, Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, recently announced that the licensing process will prioritize applicants demonstrating robust systems. The government has already received 36 applications from various sectors as of September’s end. This strong interest shows how seriously businesses view Hong Kong’s regulatory approach. The review process will focus on three critical areas: Sound reserve management to ensure full backing of issued tokens Price stability mechanisms to maintain the peg to underlying assets Anti-money laundering (AML) compliance to prevent financial crimes Why Is Hong Kong’s Regulatory Approach Significant? Hong Kong’s move comes at a crucial time for global cryptocurrency regulation. While some jurisdictions have taken restrictive approaches, Hong Kong is creating a clear pathway for legitimate stablecoin issuers to operate legally. This provides much-needed certainty for businesses and investors alike. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) stated in October that it will review applications based on new regulatory requirements once the stablecoin ordinance becomes law. This structured approach helps prevent the regulatory uncertainty that has plagued other markets. What Challenges Might Stablecoin Issuers Face? While the licensing framework offers opportunities, potential stablecoin issuers must navigate several challenges. The application process requires demonstrating sophisticated reserve management systems and comprehensive AML protocols. Smaller companies might find these requirements particularly demanding. Moreover, the regulatory focus on foreign exchange reserve management means applicants must show they can handle currency fluctuations and maintain adequate liquidity. This is especially important for stablecoin issuers pegging their tokens to multiple currencies or operating across borders. How Will This Impact the Global Crypto Market? Hong Kong’s licensing initiative could set a precedent for other financial centers. By creating a regulated environment for stablecoin issuers , Hong Kong positions itself as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. This could attract significant investment and talent to the region. The success of this program might encourage other jurisdictions to develop similar frameworks, potentially leading to greater global standardization. For investors, regulated stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong could provide safer entry points into cryptocurrency markets. What Are the Next Steps for Applicants? Companies seeking licenses should begin preparing now. The application window is open, but the review process will be thorough. Prospective stablecoin issuers should focus on strengthening their compliance systems and reserve management practices. Key preparation areas include: Developing transparent reserve reporting systems Implementing robust AML and KYC procedures Creating clear redemption mechanisms for token holders Establishing governance structures that meet regulatory expectations Hong Kong’s plan to license stablecoin issuers represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency regulation. By early 2025, we should see the first approved companies operating under this new framework. This balanced approach—encouraging innovation while ensuring stability—could become a model for other financial centers worldwide. The coming months will reveal which companies meet Hong Kong’s high standards and how this regulatory experiment transforms the digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions When will Hong Kong issue its first stablecoin licenses? Hong Kong expects to grant its first licenses to stablecoin issuers in early 2025, according to official announcements. How many companies have applied for stablecoin licenses? As of September this year, Hong Kong has received 36 applications from various sectors interested in becoming licensed stablecoin issuers. What are the main criteria for obtaining a license? The review process focuses on three key areas: sound reserve management, price stability mechanisms, and robust anti-money laundering compliance measures. Who is overseeing the licensing process? The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will review and approve applications based on new regulatory requirements once the stablecoin ordinance is enacted. Why is Hong Kong creating this licensing framework? Hong Kong aims to become a global cryptocurrency hub by providing regulatory clarity while ensuring financial stability and preventing illicit activities. Can foreign companies apply for Hong Kong stablecoin licenses? While specific details about eligibility are still emerging, the 36 applications received come from “various sectors,” suggesting both local and international companies may apply.

The small weekly event precedes a larger monthly, quarterly, and yearly expiration in a week. Deribit options signal careful trading, with protection against the downside for BTC. In total, $3.18 in BTC and ETH options expired on Friday, with $2.7B in notional value for BTC contracts. 🚨 Options Expiry Alert 🚨 At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, around $3.18B in crypto options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $2.72B notional | Put Call: 0.81 | Max Pain: $88K BTC open interest is concentrated around 88K, with slightly heavier put positioning, pointing to a relatively… pic.twitter.com/wW8ZYXYCsx — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) December 18, 2025 BTC traded close to the maximum pain levels at around $88,000. However, this time around, traders are not pushing BTC deliberately toward the maximum pain level. Options are becoming a tool for protection, with positioning based on put options for prices below $91,000 per BTC. The weekly expiration event has a put/call ratio of 0.8, suggesting slightly more call options at this price range. Traders show a dominance of call options at prices above $91,000, while the biggest liquidity for put options is at $85,000. The options positioning suggests traders are seeking a way to exit the market in the case of a downturn toward $80,000. Historically, weekly options expiry has been followed by more volatile trading over the weekend. However, BTC and ETH are facing price pressures, and the effect of Deribit may be smaller. Deribit options protect from ETH dip to $2,500 Another $460M in ETH options expired on Friday, with maximum pain at $3,100. Ahead of the weekly event, ETH traded at $2,952.97. ETH strike prices are more diverse compared to BTC, with the most liquidity allocated to downside protection at $3,500. Based on options positioning, traders may be more bullish on ETH at levels above $3,400. ETH sentiment is also more neutral compared to BTC, which is also reflected in the options market. Deribit options prepare for yearly close In the last quarter of 2025, the options market slowed down. After the Q3 expiry event, Deribit rebuilt a lower level of open interest. At the end of Q3, options markets had a total of over $46B in open interest. Toward the end of the year, open interest is down to $39B, remaining flat over the past three months. The last period of 2025 arrived with smaller weekly expiry events, though still retaining the higher baseline achieved at the end of November. On December 26, around $23B in options are expected to expire, making up more than half of the open interest. Other contracts will be rolled over into the next quarter. After that, the rebuilding liquidity on Deribit may signal the overall trend on crypto markets. Derivative trading lagged behind the October 11 crash, and in fact benefitted as traders were seeking both protection and opportunities to make calls at a favorable price. However, the stagnant trading of BTC also led to a slower derivative market, in addition to overall falling interest on futures markets. BTC open interest remains at around $27B, with minimal change since the October crash. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The use of price models adapted towards early discovery models to forward valuation when access is constricted and the usage milestones approach. It is the context on top of which a new commentary is being built around a DeFi crypto, which has been developing under the radar as its remaining supply shrinks. Some commentators in the market now identify the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as an altcoin that would have made that transition window. As the current levels of allocation are almost depleted, analysts are reconsidering the amount of space left as the project enters its next stage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is constructing a decentralized lending protocol that has two interconnected markets. The peer-to-contract side gives users an opportunity to deposit into liquidity pools and invest to receive mtTokens. The returns would vary with the level of demand, whereby APY is decreasing as the number of borrowings is rising and also rising when the liquidity is excessive. In conjunction, the peer-to-peer market of borrowing facilitates the direct loans on specified provisions. The exposure is limited by loan-to-Value limits, and the liquidation thresholds insure the system in case the collateral prices will decrease. The purpose of this structure is to ensure the capital is kept productive as well as dealing with the downside risk. Since the very beginning (early 2025) the number of people who participate has been increasing. MUTM currently stands at a price of $0.035 in presale, that is 250% growth. The project has raised $19.4M, has brought over 18, 500 holders, and sold in excess of 820M tokens. Phase 6 is currently allocated more than 99%, and the following phase is set to increase the price by almost 20% to the level of the launch price of $0.06. V1 Timing and Security Reviews When a protocol is on the verge of live testing, the projections may be changed by analysts. In statements by the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team on X, the initial implementation of the lending and borrowing protocol is planned to be on Sepolia testnet during Q4 2025. With this launch, liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and automated liquidations enter a publicly accessible realm, and ETH and USDT are the initial types. This timing is put into context by security preparation. Mutuum Foundation has passed a CertiK Token Scan with the score of 90/100, and Halborn Security is carrying out an independent audit of the signed contracts. A $50k bug bounty is also in place. Using this, some analysts feel that it is possible that the price will start moving above the launch price of $0.06 sooner rather than later when V1 shows up. Under constructive conditions, forecasts indicate that it could 2x to 3x the current position as the market gets to price live usage as opposed to plans. Growth Catalysts After a launch, tokens tend to change in the valuation. In the case of Mutuum Finance, the middle of this change is used by the mtTokens. In the event of assets being provided by the users, the value of the mtTokens is accruing based on how the interest flows through the system. This can happen by staking these mtTokens in the safety module. Based on it, the mechanism of buy-distribute will kick into action. MUTM bought via protocol fees on the open marketplace is redistributed to users who make a stake in the safety module. This associates token demand with volume of lending as opposed to cycles of attention. This model is supported by accurate pricing. To keep valuations fair and lead to orderly liquidations, Mutuum Finance would depend on decentralized oracle infrastructure, such as Chainlink data feeds with fallback sources. According to some analysts, as long as the borrowing activity remains steady, with this structure scale, the system revenue and participation could be able to drive a 4x to 6x move of the current position of $0.035 over the course of time. The factor behind comparing MUTM to Early Solana by Analysts Early Solana comparisons are not really based on technology, but rather time. Solana achieved its most superior returns during developments that matched businesses taking a positive growth in usage and increased visibility. Price was not high yet at that stage as compared to later adoption. According to market commentators, similar features are exhibited in Mutuum Finance. It is young in its lifecycle, building a definite use case and is getting ready to enter into its first live environment. Demand is organized and restricting and the participation is expanding. In contrast to other recently launched cryptocurrencies, Mutuum Finance makes the token demand dependent on lending. Analysts interpret this as a major distinction in favor of longer-run designs as opposed to short spurts. Closing Perspective Analyst models are prone to changes as the allocation gets smaller and development milestones are nearing. That is the point where Mutuum Finance currently stands. As MUTM is in the $0.035 pricing and Phase 6 is almost done, and V1 is imminent, the former concern is no longer the early accumulation but forward valuation. To crypto followers trying to identify the best crypto opportunity and wondering what crypto should buy today, this constructs the case behind why analysts are highlighting Mutuum Finance as a project that is in its next growth cycle.

In a statement posted on X, Oscar said it had previously defended the Shiba Inu account “in good faith,” but now considers that effort misplaced. OSCAR Blasts Shiba Inu Account “For a long time, we believed that something positive could emerge from the SHIB account,” the Oscar team wrote. “We defended it in good faith, even at a high personal cost, trusting that past mistakes had been left behind and that something constructive could flow from that platform. Unfortunately, we were wrong. Nothing changed. For that, we sincerely apologize.” The group then drew a hard line: “The OSCAR community — the same community that has consistently stood up for SHIB and, in many cases, personally financed initiatives to defend both SHIB and this specific account — no longer supports this account,” the statement said. “It does not represent Ryoshi’s vision , it is not aligned with the interests of the SHIB Army, and it has become a stage for personal financial interests. This is not SHIB. It never was.” The immediate catalyst was a Dec. 17 post from the official @Shibtoken account amplifying a separate token, Hachiko (HACHI), with messaging that some Shiba Inu holders interpreted as promotional. The post read: “$HACHI X95 $SHIB 0X95,” referencing a superficial similarity between contract/address prefixes highlighted by the Hachiko account: “Only $HACHI contract created on November 2nd: … Starting X95 … $SHIB starts 0x95.” @Shibtoken included a disclaimer underneath: “Friendly heads-up: This post is from a partner project , not an official Shib token. Always DYOR, frens.” Even with that caveat, the reaction in the comment section was sharply negative, with several users arguing the account has increasingly functioned as a marketing channel rather than a source of official ecosystem updates. “Very irritating to the Shib community,” one user wrote. “The reason I followed @shibtoken account many years ago because it stated it was the official account. I would be able to get official updates. Now it appears that it is marketing other projects. (for a while) Go back to your roots.” Another commenter urged holders to ignore promoted projects altogether: “I encourage all #SHIBARMY to don’t buy anything that the @Shibtoken account promotes. Just give up on that account.” Oscar’s statement attempted to separate the dispute from Shibarium -related efforts, saying it will continue building support infrastructure while distancing itself from the main account’s messaging strategy. “That said, we want to make it clear that we will continue to support Shibarium through our charity portal, as we have done since day one,” the Oscar team wrote. “The SHIB community will always be welcome within our ecosystem. However, the time has come for us to follow our own path and focus on the interests and values of our own community.” At press time, there was no visible public response from the official @Shibtoken account addressing the allegations, and no reaction from any Shiba Inu developer or marketing lead.

After a two-year hiatus prompted by stringent regulations, Bybit is back with a new, compliance-first approach. This re-entry signals a maturing relationship between innovative crypto platforms and established financial oversight, offering a potential blueprint for others. For traders and observers alike, understanding this development is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of digital asset access. Why Did Bybit Leave the UK Market in the First Place? Bybit’s initial exit from the UK was a direct response to regulatory pressure. In 2022, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced strict new rules governing the advertising and marketing of cryptocurrency services. These rules were designed to protect consumers from high-risk, misleading promotions. Faced with this new compliance landscape, Bybit, like several other international exchanges, chose to withdraw its services rather than risk operating outside the guidelines. This decision highlighted the growing pains of a global industry adapting to national regulatory frameworks. How is Bybit’s Return to the UK Market Different? This time, Bybit’s strategy for the UK market is fundamentally different. The exchange is not attempting to go it alone. Instead, it is operating under the regulatory umbrella of Archax, a UK-based digital asset exchange that is fully licensed by the FCA. This partnership is the cornerstone of Bybit’s new approach. Archax will supervise Bybit’s operations and marketing activities in the region, ensuring every action aligns with UK financial regulations. This model provides Bybit with the necessary compliance infrastructure to serve UK customers legally and safely. This isn’t Archax’s first rodeo. The firm has established itself as a key facilitator for global exchanges seeking UK access. It has previously assisted industry giants like Coinbase and OKX in navigating the local regulatory environment without those exchanges holding their own direct licenses. Therefore, Archax’s experience is a critical asset for Bybit’s compliant re-entry into the UK market. What Does This Mean for Crypto Traders in the UK? For users, Bybit’s return to the UK market under this new structure offers both opportunities and important reassurances. Regulatory Safety: Trading on a platform supervised by an FCA-licensed entity offers a higher degree of consumer protection. Increased Choice: UK traders regain access to Bybit’s suite of products, including spot and derivatives trading. Industry Validation: This move reinforces the trend of major exchanges seeking legitimate pathways to operate in regulated jurisdictions. However, users should remain vigilant. They must ensure they are using the specific, Archax-supervised Bybit service intended for the UK, not a global version that may not be compliant. What is the Bigger Picture for Crypto Regulation? Bybit’s strategic pivot is more than just a business decision; it’s a case study in the industry’s evolution. The “compliance-through-partnership” model demonstrated here may become a standard template. It allows innovative global platforms to leverage the expertise and licenses of local, regulated entities. This collaboration can accelerate safe market access while ensuring regulatory standards are met. The successful re-entry of Bybit into the UK market could encourage other regulators and exchanges to explore similar cooperative frameworks, potentially leading to more harmonized global standards over time. In conclusion, Bybit’s return to the UK market marks a pivotal moment. It showcases a pragmatic shift from avoidance to engagement with financial regulation. By partnering with Archax, Bybit is prioritizing long-term, sustainable growth over rapid, unconstrained expansion. This development is a win for regulatory clarity, consumer protection, and the overall legitimacy of the cryptocurrency sector. It proves that with the right partnerships, innovation and compliance can successfully coexist. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Can I use my old Bybit account to access the UK service? A: Likely not. You will probably need to register for a new, specific account through the Archax-supervised platform to ensure compliance with UK rules. Check Bybit’s official communications for precise instructions. Q: Will all Bybit services be available in the UK? A: Not necessarily. The suite of products offered will be tailored to comply with UK regulations. Some services, particularly certain leveraged derivatives, may be restricted or modified. Q: How does the Archax partnership protect me as a user? A> Archax, as an FCA-licensed entity, is responsible for ensuring Bybit’s UK operations follow strict rules on anti-money laundering, fair marketing, and consumer protection. This provides a layer of oversight that was absent before. Q: Does this mean Bybit is now directly licensed by the FCA? A> No. Bybit is operating under the regulatory permission of Archax. This is a common and legal model known as “appointed representative” or similar arrangements in the financial sector. Q: Should I trust this new service more than the previous one? A> Yes, from a regulatory standpoint. The previous operation was unregulated in the UK. The new service has a formal compliance framework, which significantly enhances user protection and legal certainty. Q: Will this make it easier for other exchanges to enter the UK? A> Potentially, yes. It validates a workable model for market entry. Other global exchanges may pursue similar partnerships with licensed UK firms, increasing options for traders.

Since hitting a peak of $4.4 trillion in October, the market has lost about a third of its value and is down nearly 14% in 2025, edging toward bear market territory. Earlier this year, it briefly fell to $2.5 trillion on April 9 before rebounding to record highs six months later. Overall, crypto capitalization has remained range-bound since March 2024 and is now hovering around the midpoint of that range. Van de Poppe warns of short-term crypto pain amid extreme fear MN Fund’s Michaël van de Poppe had warned that the market could see additional short-term pain, expecting the downtrend to persist until the Bank of Japan gives its interest rate decision. He posted on X, saying, “It’s very likely that the trend keeps going down until the BoJ comes out with the news. Wouldn’t be surprised if BTC continues to cascade and gets itself into a form of capitulation in the next 24 hours, as the trend clearly is down.” He added that altcoins might drop 10–20% before bouncing back, and that gold could reach a new all-time high, with a swift reversal once the news of the rate hike is revealed. The Bank of Japan raised its interest rate to 0.75% on Friday. And while some analysts cautioned that this could be bad news for crypto, Bitcoin outperformed the people’s expectations and soared 2.3% to $86,872. However, the overall cryptocurrency market remains in a state of decline. Even Ethereum, the second-largest token, is also going through a rough patch, as investors anticipate more volatility. Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research, stated that the recent decline in market capitalization was due to economic conditions and a reduced appetite for risk. He added, “While up to now there has still been short-term volatility, this pullback creates potential accumulation opportunities in really strong projects as the sector matures and continues to attract institutional capital.” Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency sentiment has returned to fear levels again, according to Santiment. The blockchain platform noted on Friday that a flurry of negative comments spread on social media after Thursday’s minor market swing. Bitcoin had risen to $90,200 before falling back to $84,800. However, the platform argued that when retail traders speak more about fear than optimism, it typically indicates a contrarian opportunity, as markets tend to move in the opposite direction of prevailing expectations. The Fear & Greed Index is also currently at 16, signaling “extreme fear” in crypto. The index had stayed below 30 since early November. Mike McGlone believes BTC could plummet to $10,000 In a shared chart, Bloomberg Intelligence’s Mike McGlone called out similarities between the 1929 U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average and the 2025 Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index. Each of those years, almost 100 years apart, is marked by a rapid rise to a peak and an accelerated sell-off before it crashes, comparing early crypto to a beach ball pushed underwater until 2024. That said, the Bloomberg analyst has been pessimistic on Bitcoin for months, consistently stating that the value might plummet as low as $10,000. Still, the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio is at 20.18, the lowest since early 2024, raising concerns among investors.

The latest increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00023931 to $0.00024023. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, and will continue until its official launch. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market recorded a marginal uptick in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed $89,000 before sliding back towards $87,000 as the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates by 0.25 basis points to 0.75%, the highest in 30 years. Altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), also traded in positive territory, with the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency up over 3% at $2,910. Husky Inu (HINU) Ready For Next Price Move Husky Inu (HINU) is set for its next price increase during the pre-launch phase, which will see the value of the HINU token rise from $0.00023931 to $0.00024023. The regular increases in the value of the HINU token enable the project to continue fundraising while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. The primary goal of the pre-launch phase is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. Husky Inu's official launch is on March 27, 2026. However, the team is open to moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The project team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Cryptocurrency Markets Remain Sluggish As Japan Cuts Interest Rates Looking at the bigger picture, the cryptocurrency market registered a marginal increase over the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin (BTC) holding steady around the $87,000 mark. The flagship cryptocurrency briefly crossed $89,000 on Thursday before losing momentum and dropping to $84,460. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $87,000 and move to its current level of $87,340, up nearly 1%. Ethereum (ETH) followed a similar trajectory, reaching an intraday high of $2,993 on Thursday before losing momentum and dropping to a low of $2,781. The altcoin rebounded from this level to reclaim $2,900 and move to its current level, up over 4% at $2,950. Ripple (XRP) is up almost 1% at $1.85, and Solana (SOL) is up 0.70% at $122. Dogecoin (DOGE) is also trading in positive territory at $0.126, while Cardano (ADA) is up 1% at $0.364. Chainlink (LINK) has registered a substantially larger 24-hour increase of almost 3%, while Stellar (XLM) is up 2.80% at $0.213. Litecoin (LTC) and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable increases over the past 24 hours. However, Litecoin (LTC) and Toncoin (TON) have failed to regain momentum and are trading in the red. The crypto market cap is marginally up over the past 24 hours, while the 24-hour trading volume has risen 14% to $132 billion.

56031674,https://cryptonews.com/?p=465962,1766137731,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56031674.jpeg,Bank of Japan Hikes Rates to 30-Year High as Yen Weakens – The Catalyst for Bitcoin Rebound?,https://cryptonews.com/news/bank-of-japan-hikes-rates-to-30-year-high-as-yen-weakens-the-catalyst-for-bitcoin-rebound/,"The Bank of Japan raised interest rates to 0.75% on December 19, marking the highest borrowing costs in three decades and triggering immediate speculation about implications for global crypto markets. Bitcoin climbed 2.5% to approach $88,000 following the decision, which came as policymakers balanced inflation concerns against mounting fiscal pressures from Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s $117 billion stimulus package. Source: TradingView The central bank voted unanimously to lift short-term rates from 0.5%, stating that “ real interest rates are expected to remain significantly negative, ” and that “ accommodative financial conditions will continue to firmly support economic activity. “ Governor Kazuo Ueda emphasized the bank would “ continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation ” if the economic outlook materializes as projected. Historic Move Confronts Deepening Fiscal Challenges The rate increase represents Japan’s most aggressive monetary tightening since 1995 , though borrowing costs remain far below those in other major economies. The decision arrives as Takaichi’s government pushes through expansive fiscal policies funded largely by issuing more bonds. More than half of the stimulus spending will come from additional debt issuance, raising concerns about Japan’s already massive public debt, more than twice the size of its economy. Speaking to The New York Times , George Goncalves, head strategist at MUFG, noted the “ volatile mix of growing debt, higher interest rates, aggressive fiscal spending and tariffs make the path forward for Japan’s economy difficult to predict. ” Market reactions were mixed, with the yen initially strengthening before giving up those gains as investors digested the statement’s implications. Christopher Wong, currency strategist at OCBC, speaking with Reuters , added that “ the yen initially strengthened but quickly surrendered those gains, in part reflecting thin market liquidity that amplified short-term price action rather than a reassessment of fundamentals. “ Divergent Policy Paths Signal Volatility Ahead The rate hike comes amid broader regulatory shifts in Japan’s crypto landscape. The Financial Services Agency recently proposed requiring exchanges to hold dedicated reserves against customer losses , extending a framework long used in traditional securities markets. The move follows major breaches, including Bybit’s February 2025 hack, which resulted in roughly $1.46 billion in losses. Japan is also simultaneously preparing its most sweeping overhaul of crypto oversight in almost a decade, planning to move digital assets under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The transition would impose stricter disclosure requirements and explicit insider-trading rules covering token listings, major system breaches, and large-scale issuer sales. Arthur Hayes, former BitMEX CEO, reacted bullishly to the decision on social media. “ Don’t fight the BOJ: -ve real rates is the explicit policy, ” Hayes wrote. “ $JPY to 200, and $BTC to a milly. “ Don’t fight the BOJ: -ve real rates is the explicit policy. $JPY to 200, and $BTC to a milly. pic.twitter.com/PdZh87ruVI — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) December 19, 2025 Speaking with Cryptonews, Ignacio Aguirre, CMO at Bitget, offered measured optimism despite near-term uncertainty. “ However, the BOJ’s tightening stands in contrast to widely expected Fed rate cuts in early 2026, setting up a period of heightened volatility that often creates attractive accumulation windows for long-term investors, ” Aguirre said. He projected Bitcoin could retest the $95,000–$100,000 range by early 2026. Market Analysts Split on Bitcoin’s Near-Term Trajectory Trader Michael van de Poppe downplayed the hike’s lasting impact on crypto markets. “ Markets knew this beforehand, so the actual impact of this rate hike is firstly, going to have less impact the more those will take places as the marginal impact for the Carry Trade is getting less and less, ” van de Poppe said. He argued markets had “ overpriced this to the downside prior to the event expecting a big crash to occur,” adding that given the soft inflation outlook, “it’s time to get back to the fair price for Bitcoin. “ Bitcoin initially dipped below $86,000 following the announcement due to yen carry trade unwinds, but quickly rebounded above $87,000 as pre-event downside fears proved overblown. CryptoMichNL noted the hike’s reduced marginal impact on carry trades from prior adjustments, with markets having priced in a severe crash that didn’t materialize.

Lee’s forecast draws on surging spot ETF inflows exceeding $30 billion year-to-date and anticipated regulatory easing under the Trump administration, aligning with his accurate 2024 call for Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 during the halving cycle.

In the complaint filed Thursday in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, Terraform Labs blames Jump for unlawfully profiting from Terraform’s rise and fall through “market manipulation, secret agreements, and misuse of digital assets.” The Office of the Terraform Labs Plan Administrator claims those actions helped inflate the ecosystem before leaving investors exposed when it unraveled. It is seeking to hold Jump co-founder William DiSomma and president Kanav Kariya accountable for allegedly acquiring wealth at the expense of TerraUSD stablecoin and its sister token, Luna. “The action aims to recover value for creditors and hold Jump responsible for exploiting the ecosystem, leaving unsuspecting investors to bear the losses,” the Terra Money Chapter 11 procedural official X account wrote. Jump trading conducted secret token deals, administrator says According to the lawsuit, Jump and Terraform supposedly entered into several secret agreements starting in 2019, which gave the former platform preferential access to Luna tokens at deeply discounted prices. Those arrangements allegedly allowed the trading firm to amass profits when Luna’s market value surged to an all-time high in 2022. Per one agreement cited in the complaint, Jump purchased millions of Luna tokens for 40 cents a pop. At its peak, Luna traded above $110 per token, and according to court filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Jump made about $1 billion by selling the token at its highs. The lawsuit also reiterated these deals were not disclosed to the public market, so Jump had an unfair advantage over retail investors who bought tokens without knowing the true structure of the ecosystem. The arrangements, according to the administrator, distorted market pricing and hid several fundamental weaknesses in the Luna token and Terraform’s business. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, a Jump spokeswoman rejected the claims and called the lawsuit an attempt by Do Kwon’s camp to deflect their responsibility in the fall of the digital token issuer. “This is a desperate attempt by Terraform Labs to shift blame and financial responsibility away from the crimes that Do Kwon committed. We will defend ourselves vigorously against these baseless claims,” she said. Jump Trading propped up TerraUSD behind the scenes Terraform Labs piled on their legal charges against Jump Trading saying it secretly intervened to support TerraUSD, Terraform’s algorithmic stablecoin, and helped trick the public to believe the system was functioning as it was meant to do. Terraform collapsed in 2022 after TerraUSD lost its one-to-one peg with the US dollar, and Luna, the “system stabilizer,” plunged to near zero merely three days after the depeg. The sudden crash erased roughly $40 billion in market value and left thousands of investors with empty coffers. The administrator alleges that before the final collapse, Jump had entered into a “gentlemen’s agreement” with Terraform to help keep TerraUSD’s peg. That arrangement was allegedly kept hidden to avoid regulatory scrutiny. The office insisted that in May 2021, when UST briefly slipped below $1 and recovered, it was from the causality of large-scale purchases by Jump. The Chicago-based algorithmic trading company supposedly “misled the public” by pushing Terraform to tell the public UST’s peg had been restored organically. Luna Foundation Guard benefited Jump officials and Do Kwon After the initial depegging took place in 2021, Terraform created the Luna Foundation Guard, a reserve to defend TerraUSD using Bitcoin and other crypto assets. The plan administrator added that the foundation was directed by Terraform founder Do Kwon and Jump’s Kariya. When TerraUSD depegged again in May 2022 and entered a so-called death spiral, the administrator claims nearly 50,000 bitcoins were transferred from the foundation to Jump without any written agreement of how the assets would be used. Terraform filed for bankruptcy in January 2024 and agreed to pay about $4.5 billion to settle a civil securities fraud lawsuit brought by the SEC. About $300 million in assets have been recovered so far to compensate creditors, per public filings shared by the fallen crypto company. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This collaboration represents more than just another corporate deal—it’s a clear indicator of how traditional finance and blockchain technology are converging. The Ripple strategic partnership with established financial players demonstrates the maturing infrastructure supporting digital assets. What Does This Ripple Strategic Partnership Actually Mean? On December 18, Ripple revealed its investment in TJM Investments and TJM Institutional Services. While the exact financial details remain undisclosed, the implications are substantial. This Ripple strategic partnership connects blockchain innovation with regulated financial services, creating a bridge between two previously separate worlds. The arrangement provides TJM with enhanced infrastructure for trade execution and clearing services through Ripple’s technology platforms. This development didn’t happen overnight. Ripple Prime, the company’s multi-asset prime brokerage platform, has maintained a long-term relationship with TJM. Therefore, this formalized Ripple strategic partnership represents the natural evolution of their existing collaboration into a more integrated and substantial arrangement. Why This Partnership Matters for Crypto Adoption The significance of this Ripple strategic partnership extends far beyond the two companies involved. Here’s why this development matters: Regulatory Credibility: TJM’s registration with FINRA and the NFA brings regulatory legitimacy to the partnership Institutional Gateway: Creates a clearer pathway for traditional financial institutions to engage with digital assets Infrastructure Development: Enhances the technological backbone supporting crypto trading and settlement Market Confidence: Signals growing trust between established finance and blockchain innovators This Ripple strategic partnership addresses one of the biggest challenges in cryptocurrency adoption: building trustworthy bridges between new technology and existing financial systems. By partnering with regulated entities, Ripple demonstrates its commitment to working within established frameworks while pushing innovation forward. The Practical Benefits for Both Partners Every successful partnership creates value for all participants. This Ripple strategic partnership offers distinct advantages to both organizations. For TJM, access to Ripple’s advanced blockchain infrastructure means improved efficiency in trade execution and clearing services. The investment also provides capital for expansion and technological upgrades. For Ripple, the benefits are equally compelling. The partnership strengthens their position in institutional finance and validates their technology with regulated entities. This Ripple strategic partnership also creates a valuable case study for how blockchain solutions can enhance traditional financial services without disrupting regulatory compliance. What Challenges Might This Partnership Face? Despite the promising nature of this Ripple strategic partnership, several challenges could emerge. Regulatory scrutiny remains intense in the cryptocurrency space, and any partnership involving digital assets must navigate complex compliance requirements. Additionally, integrating blockchain technology with legacy financial systems presents technical hurdles that require careful management. Market volatility represents another consideration. The cryptocurrency sector experiences significant price fluctuations that could impact the partnership’s stability. However, the long-term nature of this Ripple strategic partnership suggests both companies have considered these factors and developed strategies to address them. Actionable Insights from This Development This Ripple strategic partnership offers valuable lessons for the broader cryptocurrency and financial sectors: Successful blockchain adoption requires collaboration with regulated entities Long-term relationships often precede formal partnerships Infrastructure development remains crucial for institutional adoption Strategic investments can accelerate technology integration For investors and industry observers, this Ripple strategic partnership demonstrates the importance of looking beyond short-term market movements to identify foundational developments that shape the industry’s future structure. The Future Impact on Digital Asset Infrastructure Looking forward, this Ripple strategic partnership could influence several areas of digital asset development. We may see increased collaboration between blockchain companies and traditional financial institutions. The partnership might also encourage other regulated entities to explore similar arrangements, potentially accelerating institutional adoption of cryptocurrency technologies.

The success of this Ripple strategic partnership might demonstrate practical models for combining regulatory compliance with technological advancement. Conclusion: A Strategic Step Forward Ripple’s partnership with TJM represents a significant milestone in cryptocurrency’s journey toward mainstream acceptance. This Ripple strategic partnership bridges the gap between innovative blockchain technology and established financial regulation. While challenges remain, the collaboration demonstrates how thoughtful partnerships can advance the entire digital asset ecosystem. As traditional finance and blockchain technology continue to converge, developments like this will likely become increasingly common, shaping the future of both industries. Frequently Asked Questions What is the main purpose of Ripple’s partnership with TJM? The primary goal is to combine Ripple’s blockchain technology with TJM’s regulated financial services to create more efficient trade execution and clearing infrastructure for digital assets. How does this partnership benefit traditional financial institutions? It provides a regulated pathway for traditional institutions to access blockchain technology while maintaining compliance with financial regulations through TJM’s FINRA and NFA registrations. Will this partnership affect XRP’s price or utility? While the partnership demonstrates institutional adoption of Ripple’s technology, direct impact on XRP’s price is uncertain. The partnership primarily focuses on infrastructure rather than specific token utility. What regulatory approvals were needed for this partnership? Since TJM is already registered with FINRA and the NFA, the partnership operates within existing regulatory frameworks. No additional major approvals were required beyond standard business arrangements. How does this differ from other crypto-finance partnerships? This partnership is notable because it involves direct investment and long-term infrastructure collaboration rather than just service agreements or pilot programs. Can other crypto companies form similar partnerships? Yes, this model could be replicated by other blockchain companies seeking to work with regulated financial entities, though success depends on specific technology, regulatory compliance, and partnership terms.

As these trendlines converge will Bitcoin break up or down? $BTC price squeezing into a tightening space Source: TradingView The 4-hour picture above tells the story that the $BTC price is managing to stay within the confines of a bear flag, and that the bottom of the bear flag is sitting slightly below the major ascending trendline - two trendlines helping to keep the price up. However, the price is approaching the downtrend line that has been respected since the $126,000 all-time high. Add to this a decent horizontal resistance at $88,000, and you have an ever decreasing space into which the price is being squeezed. If the price continues to the apex of the two trendlines this will take a maximum of five more days, after which the price will either break the downtrend, or fall under the major ascending trendline. 200-day SMA inclining downwards Source: TradingView The daily time frame reveals that the 100-day SMA has also dropped below the 200-day SMA. This follows the 50-day SMA doing the same thing previously, whereby it formed the ‘death cross’. One thing that really does have to be noted though is that the 200-day SMA is now starting to show a more pronounced inclination towards the downside. This is the first time this has happened during this bull market, apart from a slight downward inclination during the 8-month bull flag. This can be taken as just one more sign that the coming battle of the trendlines could be crucial to the continuance of the bull market. A drop to the previous bull market high is a possibility Source: TradingView In the weekly chart yet another support lends its weight to the bull case in the form of the 100-day SMA. The chart illustrates that this moving average has risen to just below the bottom of the bear flag. Putting the bull case aside, and assuming that the price will end up falling through trendlines and moving average, the band of support below, from $74,000 down to $69,000 is an incredibly strong base, and is arguably the strongest horizontal support in Bitcoin’s history. If the $BTC price did get down to it, and held, this could be an amazing level from which to make the fightback. At the bottom of the chart the Stochastic RSI indicators are posturing to turn back down. If they do so, this could signal the possibility of a drop down to the major horizontal support. Are we already in a bear market, or do the bulls have one more throw of the dice? Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It usually starts quietly. Large caps stall, familiar names lose momentum, and investors begin scanning for projects that are still early but clearly active. When that scan keeps returning the same name, momentum builds quickly. That is what appears to be happening in Q4 2025. One Ethereum-based DeFi project is starting to dominate conversations among traders looking for the best crypto to buy now. The reason is not noise or sudden hype. It is timing, structure, and a launch window that is getting closer. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stands Out Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol with two distinct markets designed for different users. The first is the peer-to-contract model. In this setup, users supply assets into liquidity pools. In return, they receive mtTokens, which represent their share of the pool. These mtTokens grow in value over time as borrowers pay interest. For example, if a user supplies ETH into the protocol, their mtTokens reflect both their original deposit and the yield generated by lending activity. This model suits users who want passive exposure to lending demand. The second market is peer-to-peer borrowing. Here, borrowers interact more directly, with rates shaped by market conditions. Borrowers can access variable rates that change with utilization, or stable rates in certain conditions for more predictable repayment. Loan-to-Value limits cap how much can be borrowed against collateral, and liquidation rules protect the system if prices move sharply. This structure matters because it supports real use. It allows capital to move based on demand rather than speculation. That is why the numbers around Mutuum Finance are drawing attention. The project has raised $19.4M so far and now counts more than 18,500 holders. Those figures suggest broad participation before the protocol even goes live. According to official statements from the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team on X, V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol is scheduled for the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Core components include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be the first supported assets. For many investors, this milestone marks the point where development becomes public. Why Timing Is Critical MUTM is currently priced at $0.035, placing it firmly in the category of potential best cryptocurrency under $0.05. The total supply of MUTM is capped at 4B tokens. A defined portion of this supply has been allocated to early distribution, with 820M tokens already sold. Since early 2025, the token has moved through structured stages with rising prices. MUTM started at $0.01 in Phase 1 and reached $0.035 by Phase 6. That represents a 250% increase before launch. Phase 1 participants are positioned for up to 500% MUTM growth relative to the official launch price of $0.06. Phase progression is crucial here. Each completed phase reduces the number of tokens available at lower prices. Phase 6 is now more than 99% allocated, and the next phase is expected to raise the MUTM price by nearly 20%. This matters for early participants because price exposure tightens as access shifts upward. Market commentators suggest that this kind of staged pricing often changes behavior near the later phases. Investors move from watching to positioning, especially when a launch window is approaching. Security Reviews and Why They Matter Before Launch Lending protocols require trust in code and execution. Mutuum Finance has taken visible steps to address this. The project completed a CertiK Token Scan with a 90/100 score, which helps establish baseline confidence around the token structure. Beyond that, an independent audit by Halborn Security is currently in progress. Halborn is reviewing Mutuum’s finalized lending and borrowing contracts under formal analysis. This audit focuses on the core mechanics that will power V1, including borrowing logic and liquidation processes. Mutuum Finance has also launched a $50k bug bounty aimed specifically at identifying code vulnerabilities. These layers matter because they reduce uncertainty before public testing. Industry speculation points to audits and bug bounties as common signals that a project is preparing for wider use. Positioning Ahead of Q1 2026 Mutuum Finance is built on Ethereum, which gives it access to deep liquidity and established infrastructure. As the roadmap extends beyond V1, plans include stablecoin development backed by borrower interest, robust oracle systems using Chainlink data feeds, and potential layer-2 expansion to reduce costs and improve speed. These elements position Mutuum Finance as more than a short-term trade. They support a broader thesis around usage-driven growth. In a bullish scenario, projections show that if adoption accelerates after launch, MUTM could see token appreciation in the 400–450% range from current levels. Some analysts believe longer-term outcomes could be higher if lending activity scales into 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines early-stage pricing, visible development, and an approaching launch window. That combination is why, in Q4 2025, this $0.035 altcoin is starting to dominate investor attention.

In a post Thursday, energy-sector managing partner David Eng argued the next eight days (December 19 through December 26) could define the near-term cycle for BTC, not because of a macro headline or some sudden ETF stampede, but because a large chunk of dealer gamma exposure is scheduled to roll off the board in two shots. At press time, bitcoin traded around $86,928, after swinging between roughly $84,461 and $89,230 intraday. Eng’s framing is blunt and very “options people”: the market is being mechanically pinned, and the pin has an expiry date The Hidden Force Holding Back Bitcoin Price? “The narrative isn’t just about tomorrow. We are staring down the barrel of a ‘Double-Barreled’ Liquidity Event that will wipe 67% of the entire derivatives board clean by December 26th,” Eng wrote. “Bitcoin is trading at $88,752, deep in the -25% Value Zone (Trend Value: $118k). The spring is coiled, but two massive structural weights are holding the lid down.” Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge: Longs Dominate BTC, While ETH Shorts Rise Those “weights,” in his telling, are two expiries with meaningful gamma attached: roughly $128 million tied to Dec. 19 (21% of the total he tracks) and another $287 million at Dec. 26, which he calls the “boss level” ceiling. He labels the combined $415 million a coming “Gamma Flush,” arguing that once it clears, the hedging drag that’s been compressing spot price action should ease. The practical point is less mystical than it sounds. If dealers are sitting on meaningful gamma around a tight cluster of strikes, their delta-hedging can dampen volatility and keep spot gravitating around certain levels until that exposure decays or expires — the kind of “why does this tape feel glued?” frustration traders know too well. Eng’s map is built around very specific lines in the sand: $85k–$90k as the “mud” zone where hedging pressure keeps snapping price back, and $90,616 as the flip level he’s watching around the Dec. 19 expiry. “Stage 1: The Spark (Tomorrow, Dec 19) — $128 Million in Gamma expires tomorrow (21% of total). This is the ‘Appetizer.’ It removes the immediate suppression pinning us below $90k,” he wrote. “Watch the $90,616 flip level. If we clear this, the intraday shackles fall off.” But Eng is clearly more focused on the week after. “Stage 2: The Floodgate (Next Friday, Dec 26) — $287 Million in Gamma expires next week,” he continued. “A staggering 46.2% of all dealer gamma exposure sits on this single date… Dealers have a quarter-billion-dollar incentive to keep volatility crushed and price pinned near $85k-$90k through Christmas to harvest this premium.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Washout Points To $180,000 In 90 Days, GMI Says The claim, basically: pre-Dec. 26 is “thick mud,” post-Dec. 26 is the tape suddenly breathing again. “When you combine these two dates, $415,000,000 of gamma — two-thirds of the entire market structure — evaporates in the next 8 days,” Eng wrote. “Before Dec 26: The market is fighting through thick mud… After Dec 26: The mud dries up. The suppression mechanism is gone. The Power Law gravity ($118k) takes over without the dealer counter-flow.” He also tossed out a provocative ratio that’s been circulating in derivatives circles all year: dealer mechanics versus ETF demand. “Dealer Gamma forces are currently ~13x stronger than ETF Flows,” he wrote. “Dealer ~$507.6M, ETF ~$38M. This is why the market is obeying the technical gamma levels ($85k/$90k) and ignoring the ETF volume.” Dealer Gamma forces are currently ~13x stronger than ETF Flows Dealer ~$507.6M ETF ~$38M This is why the market is obeying the technical gamma levels ($85k/$90k) and ignoring the ETF volume. — David 🇺🇸 (@david_eng_mba) December 18, 2025 And when critics in the replies questioned whether “$287M” is even meaningful, Eng clarified what the figure is — and what it isn’t. “The $287M figure refers to dealer gamma exposure (GEX), not total options size,” he wrote. “GEX measures how much spot Bitcoin dealers may need to buy or sell to stay delta-neutral as price moves. It reflects hedging pressure, not notional value.” So the tradeable implication of Eng’s thesis is straightforward: expect the pinning games into Christmas, then watch whether a post-expiry regime shift actually shows up in realized volatility — and in price’s ability to stop bouncing off the same levels like it’s hitting invisible glass. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $87,953.

This reflects the growing demand for tokenised securities globally, and recognises Bitfinex Securities’ role as one of the leading international tokenisation platforms. The increase in the platform limit means that Bitfinex Securities will be able to facilitate additional capital raising activities and secondary market trading of companies that wish to be listed on the platform. The decision comes at the end of a pivotal year for Bitfinex Securities, which also operates a regulated entity in El Salvador. In September 2025, it announced it was approaching $250 million of tokenised listed assets across the platform. This includes the listing of the tokenised subordinated debt of a UK community bank, tokenised exposure to Bitcoin mining in North America, tokenised US Treasury Bills, tokenised equity of an entity providing litigation financing for motor industry claims in the UK, and the tokenisation of bonds investing in microfinance opportunities in emerging markets. Jesse Knutson, Head of Operations at Bitfinex Securities, commented: “AFSA has proven itself to be a trailblazer in the regulation of digital assets, and we remain grateful for its continued support. There is growing recognition worldwide that tokenised securities are radically changing the structure of capital markets and opening up new markets for both issuers and investors. As a forward-looking jurisdiction, the AIFC is well-positioned to capture the benefits of a digital asset-friendly economy. We look forward to strengthening our collaboration with AFSA over the coming years.” Bitfinex Securities was the first global digital asset platform to join AFSA’s Fintech Lab, a regulatory sandbox, in September 2021. Since then, it has listed over $200 million worth of tokenised securities, including Mikro Kapital’s regular tokenised bond programme and the first Blockstream Mining Note, issued in 2022. Bitfinex Securities is submitting an application to AFSA to migrate from the FintechLab to become an Authorised Investment Exchange.

Pal speculated investors put money into Zcash not because they have strong support for the token’s future prospects, but as part of a more extensive portfolio rotation in the crypto market . During his conversation with Kevin Follonier, the host of the “When Shift Happens” podcast held on Thursday, December 18, Pal claimed that he does not actually require that many assets, like Zcash, to declare that he was among the first. Pal raises concerns about Zcash’s latest significant growth This year, news about Zcash’s significant growth has made headlines, drawing the interest of several reports seeking to interview the executives behind the cryptocurrency. Crypto investors, on the other hand, were amused by such a move, demonstrating a heightened desire to make a major investment in Zcash. Nonetheless, even with this excitement in the crypto industry, Pal cautioned that it was too early to conclude whether such a rise marked the beginning of a substantial uptrend . He further elaborated that, “We can’t confirm that until the entire market rises and it keeps trending up instead of just shifting around.” At this particular moment, the CEO still held firm to his earlier argument that this growth backs the concept of a rotation. Regarding Zcash’s significant rise, reports highlighted that it is currently valued at $411.08, illustrating a growth of 744.9% since January 1, 2025, according to data from CoinMarketCap. However, sources have pointed out that Zcash’s momentum has decreased in recent weeks, with its price declining by approximately 37% over the past month. Following the release of this information, Pal commented that a key indicator at the moment is whether Zcash will be able to establish a solid base price after its latest rise. He explained this argument, noting that he seeks to understand if it will acquire backing and then begin to increase again. Pal also pointed out that he was unwilling to purchase the cryptocurrency at its current price. He argued that he was not sure if he was ready to chase it at the moment. This did not mean he could not consider buying it later. To support this claim, the Real Vision CEO hinted at the possibility of him purchasing Zcash at its next downturn. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the cryptocurrency experienced a surge in price despite the entire crypto market dropping sharply. Its market capitalization increased from a low of $1 billion in August to more than $7 billion by early November. Arthur Hayes’s move plays a significant role in Zcash’s notable surge Sources with knowledge of Zcash’s latest growth claimed that this notable surge occurred after a tip from Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX. This announcement indicated that an increasing number of individuals are shifting their focus towards privacy, which has drawn attention to privacy tokens, according to an analysis from XT Exchange released on November 9. Following this evidence, reports noted that Zcash surged 30% in a day in a month earlier, particularly on October 26. This rise followed the submission of a proposal by prominent American entrepreneur Hayes, which suggested that the token might finally reach an all-time high of approximately $10,000. Consequently, institutions demonstrated heightened interest in this cryptocurrency at the same time. To support this claim, reports dated November 27 pointed out that Grayscale Investments submitted a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting to change its Zcash fund into a spot ETF. This decision followed the major digital currency asset management company’s move to launch additional spot ETFs linked to cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and XRP.

It has crossed the mark of $4.9 million during the OZ presale. It is estimated that the AI-powered crypto project could now soon reach $5 by 2028. This jump from $0.014 is drawn from Ozak AI’s technical offerings and recent upgrades in addition to presale performance. OZ’s Projected ROI Ozak AI has sold over 1 billion OZ tokens and has raised more than $4.9 million in funds. This comes despite a significant decline in the value of Bitcoin tokens. For reference, BTC has plunged to $91,313.37, down by 12.66% over the last week. The slowdown has been credited to the correction phase before it re-hits highs. Nevertheless, a decline in BTC’s value has triggered anticipation regarding alternatives and Ozak AI is emerging at the top. It has not only reached a major milestone of $4.9 million but has also seen a massive surge of 14x in offer value. OZ started at $0.001 and is now at $0.014. Furthermore, it has a target price of $1 in mind. An ROI of 420x is based on the rise from the current value, which would turn it into over $5. This means that an investment of $100 made right now could become $42,000 when Ozak AI tokens reach $5 by 2028. The same is a tough call for BTC, which is expected to grow by a maximum of 4x. Thereby taking the same investment only to $400. Technicalities of Ozak AI Supporting 420x ROI Ozak AI has a fusion of AI tools and functions via their integration with decentralization. For instance, DePIN secures the financial data by leveraging blockchain and IPFS nodes while simultaneously orchestrating payments, work, and staking using Ozak AI Contracts on a smart contract execution layer. Access to AI Agents and a real-time analytics feed enables community members to experience auto-optimized yields plus key insights into financial markets for effective and timely decisions. A practical approach with token utility simply takes things up a notch. Holders of OZ can participate in governance to contribute to the expansion of the ecosystem. Thereby working to grow their portfolios. Ozak AI’s Implemented Upgrades Ozak AI has implemented multiple upgrades. The x402 Protocol is the latest upgrade, which was announced earlier in November 2025. The protocol essentially eliminates the requirement to sign up for a plan or to subscribe to a plan for using bits of computing. Users can now seamlessly opt to pay just for the bit of computation that they use. This upgrade has worked in two ways. It has brought down the cost to a fraction of a cent, and it has made it convenient for developers to build on the foundations laid out by Ozak AI. The move has been defined as a massive step in the direction of making the ecosystem’s agents truly autonomous. Key Takeaways One interpretation of the current situation is that Ozak AI tokens might outperform BTC when they are listed on exchange platforms. Meanwhile, ongoing circumstances are evidently showing the growth of OZ beyond $4.9 million despite a fall below the $98k mark of Bitcoin tokens.

After a strict seven-year prohibition, the nation’s financial authorities are actively drafting legislation to permit domestic ICOs once again. This potential move represents a seismic shift from blanket restriction to regulated innovation, aiming to bring crypto fundraising activities back onshore and under the watchful eye of local regulators. For blockchain entrepreneurs and investors in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, this news sparks a wave of cautious optimism. Why is South Korea Reconsidering Domestic ICOs Now? The 2017 ban on domestic ICOs was a reaction to rampant fraud and investor protection concerns during the initial crypto boom. However, this policy had an unintended consequence. It pushed promising Korean blockchain projects to launch their token sales overseas, often in less regulated jurisdictions, before seeking listings on popular South Korean exchanges. This ‘regulatory arbitrage’ created risks for local investors who ultimately traded these assets without the initial safeguards of a domestic offering. The proposed Digital Asset Basic Act seeks to correct this by creating a controlled, transparent environment for fundraising within the country’s borders. The core of the new framework, as reported, hinges on mandatory information disclosure. Projects seeking to launch a domestic ICO would need to provide comprehensive details about their team, technology, use of funds, and associated risks. This approach mirrors principles from traditional securities regulation, aiming to protect investors while fostering legitimate innovation. What Does the Draft Law Say About Stablecoins? The proposed legislation extends far beyond just ICOs. It introduces stringent new rules for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar. In a bold protective measure, the draft law proposes to ban the domestic trading of major overseas stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), unless their issuers establish a physical presence and comply with South Korean regulations. Local Presence Required: Foreign stablecoin issuers must set up a local entity. Strict Compliance: They must adhere to South Korean anti-money laundering (AML) and capital reserve rules. Investor Protection: The goal is to ensure accountability and reduce systemic risk for Korean investors. This move could significantly impact the local crypto market, potentially encouraging the development of Korean-won-pegged stablecoins and giving regulators greater oversight over a critical part of the digital asset ecosystem. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges? Unlocking domestic ICOs could unleash a wave of benefits for South Korea’s tech sector. It would allow innovative blockchain startups to raise capital from a supportive local investor base without the legal complexity and cost of going abroad first. This could position South Korea as a more competitive hub for Web3 development in Asia. However, significant challenges remain. Regulators must walk a tightrope between enabling growth and preventing the scams that prompted the original ban. Implementing effective, real-time monitoring of ICO disclosures will be resource-intensive. Furthermore, the stablecoin rules may face pushback from global crypto firms and could temporarily limit liquidity on local exchanges if enforced abruptly. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) has been careful to note that these proposals are not final. Discussions with other government agencies are ongoing, meaning the specifics could change before the law is presented to the National Assembly. The second phase of the Digital Asset Basic Act is expected to be finalized and potentially take effect sometime in 2025. Conclusion: A Cautious Step Towards a Structured Future South Korea’s potential pivot on domestic ICOs is a powerful signal of regulatory maturity. It acknowledges that a total ban is less effective than a well-designed framework. By aiming to bring crypto fundraising in-house with clear rules, the country seeks to protect its citizens, retain its technological talent, and capture the economic benefits of blockchain innovation. While the path forward requires careful navigation, this draft law could mark the beginning of a new, more integrated era for digital assets in one of the world’s most vibrant crypto markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When could South Korea officially allow domestic ICOs? A: The change is part of the second phase of the Digital Asset Basic Act, which could take effect as early as 2025, though the timeline is not yet finalized. Q: Why did South Korea ban ICOs in the first place in 2017? A: The ban was implemented due to widespread concerns over fraud, scams, and a lack of investor protection during the initial cryptocurrency boom period. Q: Will USDT and USDC be banned in South Korea? A: The draft law proposes banning the trading of overseas stablecoins unless their issuers establish a local presence and comply with South Korean financial regulations. It is not an outright ban but a requirement for localization. Q: What does ‘sufficient information disclosure’ mean for ICOs? A: It likely means ICO projects will be required to publicly disclose detailed information about their business plan, team, technology, use of proceeds, and risk factors, similar to a prospectus in traditional finance. Q: How will this affect South Korean crypto exchanges? A: Exchanges will likely need to adapt their listing procedures to vet and list tokens from newly permitted domestic ICOs. They may also need to adjust their trading pairs based on the new stablecoin rules. Q: Is this law guaranteed to pass? A: No. The FSC has stated the draft is not final and is still under discussion. The proposals must go through further review and legislative processes before becoming law. Found this analysis of South Korea’s groundbreaking crypto policy shift insightful?

The combined average daily trading volume on major prediction market platforms has rocketed to a staggering $500 million. This milestone, reported by analytics firm Sentora, signals that these platforms are moving from niche curiosities to mainstream financial instruments. But what’s fueling this explosive growth, and what does it mean for the future of trading? Which Prediction Market Platforms Are Driving This Surge? Sentora’s analysis points to a handful of key players leading the charge. Platforms like Polymarket, Kalshi, Limitless, and Opinion have all seen significant user and volume growth this year. Each platform offers a unique twist, from crypto-native interfaces to regulated US markets, attracting a diverse range of traders. This isn’t just about betting on sports; these prediction market platforms allow users to trade on outcomes for politics, current events, technology, and finance. The appeal is clear. They provide a tangible way to hedge real-world risk or simply express a viewpoint on future events. For example, you can trade on the probability of a Federal Reserve rate hike or the outcome of a major election. This utility, combined with easier access, is a primary growth driver. Why Are Prediction Markets Suddenly So Popular? Several powerful trends are converging to boost these platforms. First, the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has normalized peer-to-peer, blockchain-based trading. Second, global uncertainty around elections, inflation, and geopolitics creates more events people want to hedge against or speculate on. Finally, user experience has improved dramatically, making these markets accessible to non-experts. Transparency: Blockchain-based platforms offer publicly verifiable odds and results. Accessibility: Anyone with an internet connection and crypto wallet can participate globally. Liquidity: High daily volume attracts more traders, creating a virtuous cycle of better prices and more activity. Therefore, the $500 million volume figure isn’t just a number—it’s proof of a maturing, liquid ecosystem. As more institutional players and retail traders recognize their value, these prediction market platforms are poised for even greater adoption. What Challenges Do These Platforms Face? Despite the impressive growth, the path forward isn’t without hurdles. Regulatory clarity remains a patchwork globally, with some jurisdictions embracing these markets and others restricting them. Platforms must navigate complex legal landscapes, especially those operating in traditional finance like Kalshi. Furthermore, there is an ongoing need to educate new users about the mechanics and risks involved in trading event outcomes. Another challenge is maintaining integrity and preventing manipulation of real-world events. Reputable prediction market platforms invest heavily in oracle systems and dispute resolution to ensure accurate, tamper-proof results. Overcoming these challenges is crucial for transitioning from a $500 million daily volume to a multi-billion dollar industry. Conclusion: The Future of Forecasting The $500 million daily volume milestone is a watershed moment for prediction markets. It demonstrates a powerful and growing demand for decentralized information aggregation and financial tools that interact with real-world events. As technology improves and regulatory frameworks evolve, these platforms could fundamentally change how we think about risk, investment, and even the nature of forecasting itself. The market has spoken, and its verdict is one of staggering growth and potential. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is a prediction market platform? A prediction market platform is a marketplace where users can trade contracts based on the outcome of future events. Prices reflect the crowd’s collective probability of an event occurring. Is trading on prediction markets legal? Legality varies by country and platform. Some, like Kalshi, are regulated in the US, while others operate in decentralized legal gray areas. Users must check their local regulations. What was the source of the $500M daily volume data? The data comes from an analysis by Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock), a prominent DeFi and market analytics layer. Can you make money on prediction market platforms? Yes, traders can profit by correctly forecasting outcomes. However, like any trading, it involves significant risk and potential for loss. What kinds of events can I trade on? Markets range from politics and economics to sports, entertainment, and crypto-specific events like Bitcoin price milestones. Do I need cryptocurrency to use these platforms? Most decentralized platforms require crypto (like USDC or Ethereum). Regulated platforms like Kalshi may use traditional fiat currency.

The process is about to develop slowly, access gets smaller and those investors who trace and track progress, rather than follow the newspaper reports, are the first to move. As it occurs, at times when allocation is tightened and a product launch appears into the lenses, interest tends to move swiftly. That arrangement is currently chalked around an Ethereum-based DeFi crypto that is just about to hit full allocation as it waits for its initial live launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a real-use based lending and borrowing protocol that is decentralized. The system is divided into two specific markets and each is targeted towards a need. The peer-to-contract market requires the users to contribute assets to common liquidity pools. They, in their turn, are rewarded with mtTokens which reflect their rank. The value of these mtTokens rises with the payment of interest by the borrowers. As an example, when a user deposits ETH into a pool where the borrowing demand increases the commended yield is an increase in the value of the mtToken with time. The P2P market is that which helps to lend directly between users. Borrowers are able to get capital on the basis of demanded interest rates and liquidity. The loan to value limits restrict the amount one can borrow based on the collateral and the liquidation regulations ensure that in case of a collapse in prices, the system is not fully damaged. This arrangement assists in maintaining balance of the protocol when there is an ebb and flow in the market. Such mechanics have aided in the consistent involvement of Mutuum Finance. The project has raised $19.4M and has increased to above 18,500 holders since the beginning of 2025. This is important as it is not an isolated focus but rather a wide interest. As stated by the team on X , the original version of the protocol is planned to make its appearance in the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This V1 release will include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens and a liquidator bot which will initially be ETH and USDT. Token Price, Supply and Phase Progress MUTM is priced at the point of the Phase 6 at $0.035 in presale and the Phase is now at more than 99%. The sale of tokens started at $0.01 and thus MUTM has already registered 250% growth since it started selling them. The harsh aggregate supply of MUTM remains constant at 4B tokens. Out of this quantity 45.5% or about 1.82B tokens are distributed to the presale. Up to now, over 820M tokens have sold off with huge portions of early access adaptable. The participants in Phase 1 are set for 500% MUTM appreciation on the actual launch price of $0.06. The entry price has shifted upwards as every phase has shut. The following step would increase the price of MUTM by 15%. This staged form is the reason why early involvement has more upside and costly stages take trade the lower risk. Security Preparation In the lending protocols, code trust is paramount. Mutuum Finance was able to complete a CertiK Token Scan with a 90/100 rating, which provides an external audit of token structure. Moreover, Halborn Security is realizing a separate audit of the completed lending and borrowing contracts. This review dwells upon such core mechanics as borrowing logic and liquidations. The project has also introduced a bug bounty valued at $50k to ensure increased coverage of the review to detect any possible vulnerabilities. Increasing towards Phase 6, investor actions have begun to change. Larger allocations are emerging as the supply empire is being reduced. This trend is typical when demand gets constrained in the run-up to a predetermined target. The community keep-up would be maintained by a 24 hour leaderboard whereby the largest daily user would get to win $500 in MUTM. This system is set to promote uniform involvement as opposed to infrequent purchases. Mutuum Finance is in the transitional stage. The current price allocation is close to 100%. V1 testing is approaching. The security reviews are done. Meanwhile, the token is below $0.04. This mix is becoming popular among the investors who track the best crypto opportunities and consider the next crypto that has a high degree of utility. Although results are always determined by performance and the business climate, the present arrangement is the reason why concern is gaining momentum in a very short time.

The miner earned a reward of 3.152 BTC, equivalent to approximately $271,000. Mempool statistics confirmed on Thursday that the block had a near-perfect health score of 99.96% and total transaction fees of 0.027 BTC (~$2,363). On-chain data reveal that the block had a median cost of about 2 sat/vB and a fee range of 1–313 sat/vB. Solo Bitcoin miners beat odds to win blocks The Mempool data revealed that the actual Bitcoin block had 2,806 transactions (-16.56%). The block had a total fee of 0.027 BTC (-6.18%). According to on-chain data, the block weighted 3.5 MWU (-12.37%). The block was mined with Version 0x20400000, bits 0x1701e63a, nonce 0xcc01ab16, and a Merkle root of 45c4235f79f7c8642b4eca86ce7e7c28452374b4fc8f1b64b907e4912c3b626 at a network difficulty of 148,195,306,640,204.7. On December 12, a different solo Bitcoin miner using the alias 1Ng9~VoQz successfully mined a legitimate block #927,474. The miner claimed the 3.13 BTC block reward, which is worth roughly $288,383.50. The Bitcoin block had 1,117 transactions (-62.99%), a block weight of 1.45 MWU (-63.65%), and total fees of 0.008 BTC (-8.83%). Against mathematical odds, the Bitcoin miner utilized a hashrate (computing power) of 270 TH/s, equivalent to approximately 0.00002% of the total processing power of the Bitcoin network. As per the current Bitcoin mining data, a setup of this scale has a 1 in 30,000 chance of solving a block on any given day. Ckpooldev, the developer of the CKPool software, the miner used to mine the block, commented that the incident represents the 310th instance of a solo miner obtaining a block reward under these particular tracking conditions. Similar to previous miners that mined a single block, 1Ng9~VoQz did not distribute the mining rewards among other participants as they would have in a traditional mining pool model. Instead, the miner earned the entire amount (minus a 2% charge to CKPool) immediately. In November, a platform user computed a block #924,569 using hardware with a hash rate of just 6 TH/s. CKPool administrator Con Kolivas referred to the miner as “incredibly lucky.” The odds of producing a block with such processing power are about 1 in 1.2 million every day. Another solo Bitcoin miner mined block #920,440 in October using the Public Pool platform. The miner earned a reward of 3.141 BTC. Bitcoin mining profitability declines despite rising hash rate According to research released by JPMorgan (JPM), the profitability of Bitcoin (BTC) mining declined for the fourth consecutive month in November. Analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce noted that the daily block reward gross profit also decreased by 26% from the prior month. According to Glassnode, the global Bitcoin hash rate (30-day moving average) is roughly 1.1 ZH/s. The present trend shows a surge toward mid-October record values of 1.15 ZH/s. Global Bitcoin hash rate nears record levels set in mid-October. Source: Glassnode On November 21, the hash price reached its lowest point of the year, at approximately $34 per PH/s per day, coinciding with Bitcoin’s decline to $83,000. The mining profitability indicator was limited to $40 per PH/s every day, even after the price of digital gold recovered to above $90,000. In November, Fred Thiel, CEO of MARA, stated that miners are facing a challenging time due to growing competition and declining profitability in the mining industry. The combined market capitalization of the 14 U.S.-led miners that JPM follows dropped 16% month over month to $59 billion. JPM revealed that Cypher Mining (CIFR) beat the group thanks to its recent Fluidstack acquisition, with a 9% rise.

BREAKING: THIS ISN’T A CRASH. IT’S A COIL. Raoul Pal just spelled it out: The old 4-year halving cycle is over. We’re in a liquidity-driven supercycle. For 15 years the script was simple: Halving.

Further, both noted that they aim to trade liquidity, not calendars, and outlined the significant changes coming for next year: – Business cycle bottoming – Fiscal stimulus loading – Global money printer warming up – Institutions forced to chase Merlijn concluded that corrections are not the end of the bull markets anymore: instead, he called them “slingshots.” Consequently, he warned traders that they need to adapt to the new BTC cycle version: “Trade like it’s the old cycle that no longer exists. Or position for the exponential curve already in motion.” $600K in 2026? Given the price movements over the past couple of months, it’s difficult to speculate about massive increases in 2026. However, pseudonymous analyst Wise Crypto recently did that and highlighted a mindblowing target of up to $600,000 next year if all factors align in a perfect crypto storm. Some of those include the highly anticipated end to the Fed’s quantitative tightening, additional rate cuts, improving short-term liquidity through Treasury bill support, and the US mid-term election cycle, all of which should lean in favor of risk assets.

Whale Alert, the blockchain tracking service, reported a staggering 68,000 ETH whale transfer from an unknown wallet to the Binance exchange. Valued at approximately $201 million, this single transaction has sent ripples through the crypto community, prompting urgent questions about its intent and potential impact on Ethereum’s price. This kind of ETH whale transfer is a critical signal for traders and investors to decode. What Does This Massive ETH Whale Transfer Actually Mean? When a whale—an entity holding a colossal amount of cryptocurrency—moves funds, it’s rarely without consequence. This specific ETH whale transfer from a private wallet to a major centralized exchange like Binance typically suggests one of a few possibilities. The whale could be preparing to sell, which might exert downward pressure on the market. Alternatively, they might be moving funds for security purposes, staking, or to participate in other trading activities on the platform. Understanding the context of this whale transfer is key to gauging market sentiment. Why Should Every Crypto Investor Pay Attention? Whale movements are a leading indicator of market sentiment. A large ETH whale transfer to an exchange often precedes increased selling pressure. However, it’s not always a bearish signal. Therefore, investors should consider several factors: Market Context: Is Ethereum in a bullish or bearish trend? Exchange Flow: Are more ETH flowing into or out of exchanges? Historical Patterns: How have similar past transfers affected the price? Monitoring these whale transfer alerts helps traders make more informed decisions rather than reacting to fear or speculation. Could This ETH Whale Transfer Signal a Major Price Move? The immediate question on everyone’s mind is price action. A $201 million ETH whale transfer represents significant liquidity suddenly available for trading. If the whale decides to sell even a portion, it could temporarily suppress the price. Conversely, if this is a strategic move for other purposes, the impact might be minimal. The market often reacts psychologically to such news before the actual trade occurs, creating volatility. This makes tracking ETH whale transfer data an essential tool for anticipating short-term swings. How to Track Whale Activity and Protect Your Portfolio You don’t need to be a whale to think like one. Staying informed is your best defense and opportunity. Here are actionable steps: Follow blockchain analytics platforms like Whale Alert on social media. Use exchange transparency pages to monitor large wallet inflows. Never make impulsive trades based solely on one data point. Always cross-reference with broader market analysis. By understanding the motives behind an ETH whale transfer , you can separate meaningful signal from market noise. The Bottom Line: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The recent 68,000 ETH whale transfer to Binance is a powerful reminder of the influence large holders wield in the crypto markets. While it demands attention, it should not dictate panic or euphoria. Savvy investors use this information as one piece of a larger puzzle, combining on-chain data with technical and fundamental analysis. The true impact of this whale transfer will unfold in the coming days, offering valuable lessons on market structure and participant behavior. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a “crypto whale”? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a sufficiently large amount of a cryptocurrency that their trades can potentially influence the market price. Is a transfer to an exchange always a sell signal? Not always. While it increases the possibility, whales also move funds to exchanges for staking, lending, trading into other assets, or security reasons. Context from other data is crucial. How can I track whale movements myself? You can use free blockchain explorers like Etherscan to track large transactions, or follow dedicated alert services like Whale Alert (@whale_alert) on Twitter/X. What was the exact value of this ETH transfer? Based on the ETH price at the time of the transaction, the 68,000 ETH was valued at approximately $201 million USD. Should I sell my ETH because of this whale transfer? Making investment decisions based on a single transaction is not advisable. Consider your own investment strategy, risk tolerance, and the broader market context before acting. Share Your Insights What’s your take on this major market move?

Valued at approximately $237 million, this massive transfer from Binance to a Binance Beacon Deposit wallet has sparked intense speculation. What does this colossal movement of funds signal for Ethereum and the broader market? Let’s dive into the details. What Does This Massive Ethereum Transaction Mean? The reported Ethereum transaction is not your typical transfer. Moving 80,000 ETH from a major exchange like Binance to a Beacon Deposit address suggests a strategic shift from a trading position to a staking or long-term holding position. The Beacon Chain is integral to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus. Therefore, this move could indicate a major player is preparing to stake a significant portion of the network’s value, showcasing strong confidence in Ethereum’s future. Why Are Whale Transactions So Important? Large-scale movements, often called ‘whale transactions,’ serve as critical market indicators. They provide insights into the sentiment of major holders who can influence price and liquidity. When a whale moves funds off an exchange, it typically reduces immediate selling pressure. This specific Ethereum transaction suggests the holder may be: Committing to staking to earn rewards on the Ethereum network. Securing assets in a non-custodial manner for long-term holding. Preparing for participation in Ethereum’s ecosystem development. Such actions often reflect a bullish, long-term outlook rather than a plan for short-term trading. Could This Ethereum Transaction Impact the Market? While a single Ethereum transaction does not dictate market direction, it contributes to the overall supply dynamics. Removing a large amount of ETH from an exchange’s readily available supply can lead to a tightening of liquidity. If demand remains steady or increases, this reduction in available sell-side pressure can be a supportive factor for price. However, it’s crucial to view this event within the broader context of network upgrades, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic factors. What Should Everyday Investors Take Away? For the average investor, monitoring whale activity is more about understanding market structure than timing trades. This notable Ethereum transaction highlights several key points: Institutional-grade players are actively managing large Ethereum positions. The infrastructure for staking and securing Ethereum continues to see significant use. Major holders appear to be positioning for the long-term evolution of the network. Instead of reacting to every large move, focus on the underlying trend it represents: growing institutional commitment to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake ecosystem. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The movement of 80,000 ETH is a powerful reminder of the scale at which major players operate in the cryptocurrency market. This Ethereum transaction from Binance to a Beacon Deposit wallet is likely a strategic allocation towards network participation and security, reflecting a vote of confidence in Ethereum’s roadmap. While thrilling, it’s one piece of a much larger puzzle. Savvy observers will watch for follow-on activity and consider how such movements align with broader adoption trends. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Binance Beacon Deposit? A Binance Beacon Deposit is a wallet address associated with Binance that is specifically used for depositing Ethereum to be staked on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain, which coordinates the proof-of-stake network. Why would someone move ETH off an exchange? Moving ETH off an exchange, especially to a staking contract, often indicates a long-term holding strategy. It secures the assets, allows the owner to earn staking rewards, and reduces the risk associated with keeping funds on a centralized platform. Does a large transaction always mean the price will go up? Not necessarily. While moving funds off an exchange can reduce immediate selling pressure, many other factors influence price. It is a data point suggesting holder confidence, not a guaranteed price predictor. What is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a blockchain tracker and analytics service that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions (typically over $100,000) across major blockchains and reports them via social media. How much does it cost to transfer 80,000 ETH? The transaction fee (or gas fee) for an Ethereum transfer depends on network congestion. For a simple transfer like this, even at a high gas price, the fee would be a tiny fraction of the total $237 million value. Is staking Ethereum safe? Staking involves locking ETH to help secure the network and earn rewards. While it is a core function of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model, it is not without risk, including potential technical slashing penalties and the illiquidity of staked funds until withdrawals are enabled.

Data from Shibburn reveals a staggering 3,915,071.74% increase in the burn rate. This dramatic surge resulted in the permanent removal of 21,611,748 SHIB tokens from circulation. The memecoin has maintained an aggressive burning strategy since its launch. The total number of destroyed tokens now stands at 410,753,929,644,556 SHIB. This leaves approximately 585,277,528,786,334 tokens available in the market.

SHIB currently trades at $0.000007380, according to CoinMarketCap. The asset has declined 1.5% over the last 24 hours. SHIB price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap The disconnect between supply reduction and price action has raised questions among market observers. Traditional economic principles suggest that decreased supply should drive prices higher when demand remains constant. However, SHIB has not followed this pattern.

The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance reported that Libya accounted for around 0.6% of the global Bitcoin hash rate in 2021. The firm also noted that the surge in BTC mining in Libya put it ahead of every other Arab and African state, and even above some European economies. Authorities began cracking down on Bitcoin mining activities late in the year after it strained the electrical grid. Low electricity prices create arbitrage opportunities for Bitcoin miners The report revealed that the surge in BTC mining activities was also driven by a long period of legal and institutional ambiguity. Libya has faced more than a dozen political regimes since 2011. The situation allowed miners to increase faster than the authorities could react. The country’s electricity price is among the lowest globally, estimated at around $0.004 per kilowatt-hour. The lower prices are driven by the state’s heavy fuel subsidies and low tariffs. “Electricity in Libya is virtually free for most consumers, and diesel is similarly subsidized. It’s no surprise that both Libyan and foreign actors are rapidly setting up mining farms across the country to exploit these conditions.” -Sami Radwan, Economic Analyst in Libya Over the years, Libya’s electrical grid has faced damage, theft, and underinvestment. The General Electricity Company of Libya (GECOL) reported that such issues cause the country to lose about 40% of its generated electricity before it reaches homes. The low prices create a significant arbitrage for miners, where they buy energy way below its real market price and convert it into Bitcoin. Miners in Libya could even feed subsidized power to older-generation machines and still generate a margin. The environment attracted foreign operators willing to ship used rigs and accept legal and political risk. The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance also reported that Libya may have consumed around 2% of its total electricity output during its peak in 2021. The figure accounts for approximately 0.855 terawatt-hours (TWh) a year. The report revealed that the U.S., China, and Kazakhstan remain the top globally in absolute hash rate. Local authorities convict foreigners operating illegal Bitcoin mining farms Authorities convicted and sentenced nine people to three years in prison for operating Bitcoin miners inside a steel factory in the coastal city of Zliten. Prosecutors seized the miners and also forfeited the profits generated to the state. The authorities have also conducted similar raids across Benghazi and Misrate in 2024 and have arrested several Chinese nationals who were operating industrial-scale farms. They confiscated more than 1,000 devices in Benghazi from a single hub alleged to be making more than $45,000 a month. Libya’s authorities also arrested 50 Chinese nationals and seized about 100,000 devices a year earlier. Local media reported that operators believe they will remain a step ahead due to low electricity prices and fragmented governance. They also argued that the government take-downs won’t work because it will be hard to find the thousands of smaller rigs scattered across homes and workshops. Bitcoin mining in Libya continues despite a warning issued by the Central Bank of Libya (CBL) in 2018, which deemed digital assets illegal in the country. The bank cited risks of money laundering and terrorism financing, and removed any legal protection for anyone using or trading crypto. Despite a decree from the Ministry of Economy in 2022, which prohibits the import of mining hardware into Libya, there has been no change. The illegal mining farms also add a constraint on the country’s fragile grid, affecting schools, hospitals, and ordinary households. Local authorities revealed that large farms can draw 1,000-1,5000 megawatts of electricity, enough to power a mid-sized city’s demand.

DeepBook Protocol, the native decentralized exchange on Solana, has been generating significant buzz in the crypto community. As investors look toward the future, many are asking: Is DEEP a good investment for the coming years? This comprehensive analysis provides our DeepBook Protocol price prediction from 2026 through 2030, examining the technology, market position, and factors that could influence DEEP’s trajectory. What is DeepBook Protocol and Why Does It Matter? DeepBook Protocol serves as Solana’s primary decentralized exchange infrastructure, providing essential liquidity and trading capabilities for the entire ecosystem. Unlike traditional DEXs, DeepBook Protocol operates as a core primitive within Solana’s architecture, offering institutional-grade order book functionality with the speed and low costs that define the Solana network. This fundamental position within one of cryptocurrency’s most promising ecosystems makes understanding DeepBook Protocol price prediction crucial for forward-thinking investors. Current Market Analysis and DEEP Price Prediction Methodology Our DEEP price prediction methodology combines multiple analytical approaches to provide balanced projections. We examine historical price data, trading volume patterns, on-chain metrics, and broader market trends. The analysis considers both technical indicators and fundamental factors including adoption rates, protocol upgrades, and competitive positioning within the Solana DEX landscape. Key factors influencing our DeepBook Protocol price prediction include: Solana ecosystem growth and adoption rates DeepBook Protocol’s market share among Solana DEXs Protocol development and feature implementation Overall cryptocurrency market cycles and trends Regulatory developments affecting decentralized exchanges DeepBook Protocol Price Prediction 2026: The Near-Term Outlook Looking toward 2026, our DeepBook Protocol price prediction suggests moderate growth potential as the protocol continues to establish itself within the Solana ecosystem. By this point, we expect broader cryptocurrency adoption to be well underway, with institutional players increasingly exploring decentralized finance options. The success of this DEEP investment period will depend heavily on Solana’s ability to maintain its technological advantages and market position against competing layer-1 solutions. Several factors could accelerate growth for DeepBook Protocol in 2026: Increased institutional adoption of Solana for trading and settlement Successful implementation of planned protocol upgrades Expansion of DeepBook Protocol’s feature set beyond basic trading Strategic partnerships with major DeFi projects and traditional finance institutions DEEP Price Prediction 2027: Mid-Term Growth Potential Our 2027 DEEP price prediction anticipates more significant movement as the protocol matures and potentially captures greater market share. By this stage, we expect DeepBook Protocol to have established itself as a critical piece of Solana’s financial infrastructure. The cryptocurrency prediction for this period assumes continued growth in overall DeFi adoption, with Solana maintaining or expanding its position among leading blockchain platforms. Factor Potential Impact on DEEP Probability Solana ecosystem 2x growth High positive impact Medium Major protocol upgrade success Moderate positive impact High Increased regulatory clarity Variable impact Medium Competitor DEX innovations Potential negative impact High Solana DEX Landscape and DeepBook Protocol’s Competitive Position The Solana DEX space has become increasingly competitive, with multiple projects vying for market share. DeepBook Protocol’s unique position as a native protocol gives it certain advantages, including deeper integration with Solana’s core infrastructure and potentially better performance characteristics. However, this DEEP investment analysis must consider the competitive pressures from other Solana-based decentralized exchanges that may offer different features or incentives. DeepBook Protocol’s main competitive advantages include: Native integration with Solana’s architecture Potential for lower latency and higher throughput Direct access to Solana’s validator network Alignment with Solana Foundation’s development priorities Is DEEP a Good Investment? Risk and Reward Analysis Determining whether DEEP represents a good investment requires balancing potential rewards against significant risks. The cryptocurrency prediction landscape remains inherently uncertain, particularly for projects tied to specific blockchain ecosystems. A DEEP investment carries both the potential for substantial returns if Solana succeeds and significant risks if the broader ecosystem faces challenges. Key risks to consider in your DeepBook Protocol investment decision: Solana network stability and performance issues Regulatory uncertainty for decentralized exchanges Competition from other Solana DEXs and cross-chain solutions Broader cryptocurrency market volatility and cycles Technology execution risks and protocol development delays Cryptocurrency Prediction 2028-2030: Long-Term Vision for DeepBook Protocol Our long-term cryptocurrency prediction for DeepBook Protocol through 2030 considers several potential scenarios. In a bullish case where Solana establishes itself as a leading blockchain for financial applications, DeepBook Protocol could become a fundamental piece of global decentralized finance infrastructure. This would make DEEP a good investment with substantial appreciation potential. However, in more conservative scenarios, growth may be more modest, tied to broader cryptocurrency adoption rates rather than exceptional outperformance. Potential catalysts that could drive DeepBook Protocol price prediction upward through 2030: Mass adoption of decentralized trading by traditional financial institutions Solana becoming a preferred blockchain for high-frequency trading applications DeepBook Protocol expanding to support additional financial instruments beyond spot trading Successful implementation of cross-chain functionality with other major blockchains Regulatory frameworks that favor decentralized exchange models over centralized alternatives Technical Analysis and Market Sentiment for DEEP Beyond fundamental factors, technical analysis provides additional insights for our DeepBook Protocol price prediction. Key technical levels, trading volume patterns, and market sentiment indicators all contribute to understanding potential price movements. The DEEP investment landscape will likely see periods of consolidation followed by potential breakouts, particularly around major protocol announcements or Solana ecosystem developments. Important technical factors for DEEP price prediction: Trading volume trends relative to other Solana ecosystem tokens Price correlation with SOL and major cryptocurrencies On-chain metrics including active addresses and transaction counts Exchange listing developments and liquidity depth Market maker activity and order book depth on DeepBook Protocol itself FAQs About DeepBook Protocol and DEEP Investment What is DeepBook Protocol’s relationship with Solana? DeepBook Protocol is the native decentralized exchange built directly into the Solana blockchain infrastructure, developed with support from the Solana Foundation . Who developed DeepBook Protocol? The protocol was developed by teams within the Solana ecosystem, with contributions from various developers and organizations focused on advancing Solana’s DeFi capabilities. How does DeepBook Protocol differ from other DEXs? Unlike most decentralized exchanges that are built as applications on top of a blockchain, DeepBook Protocol is integrated at a fundamental level within Solana’s architecture, potentially offering performance advantages. What factors most influence DEEP price prediction? The most significant factors include Solana’s overall adoption and performance, competitive developments in the DEX space, regulatory changes affecting decentralized exchanges, and broader cryptocurrency market trends. Is DEEP a good investment for long-term holders? As with any cryptocurrency investment, DEEP carries both potential rewards and significant risks. Long-term prospects depend heavily on Solana’s success and DeepBook Protocol’s ability to maintain its competitive position within the ecosystem. Conclusion: The Future of DeepBook Protocol Investment Our comprehensive DeepBook Protocol price prediction from 2026 through 2030 reveals a project with significant potential but substantial uncertainty. The fundamental question of whether DEEP is a good investment depends largely on your confidence in Solana’s long-term success and DeepBook Protocol’s ability to capitalize on that ecosystem growth. While the protocol’s native integration provides unique advantages, the competitive landscape remains challenging, and broader market factors will inevitably influence outcomes. For investors considering DEEP, a balanced approach that acknowledges both the transformative potential of decentralized exchange infrastructure and the inherent risks of cryptocurrency investments seems most prudent. As with any emerging technology investment, position sizing, diversification, and ongoing monitoring of both DeepBook Protocol developments and the broader Solana ecosystem will be crucial to investment success.

Hold Tight,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-investors-jake-claver-calling-it-hold-tight/,"Digital Assets Daily recently shared a clip featuring Jake Claver, a longtime XRP advocate known for bold commentary and confident market calls. The post carried a short message urging followers to “hold tight,” as something larger may be approaching. In the video, Claver discusses how future interest rate decisions could alter market behavior in a manner that previous cuts have not. While rate cuts this year failed to drive XRP’s price up , he argues the next move could be different if policymakers act more forcefully. Jake Claver calling it. Hold tight. https://t.co/zLCV8WNqRL — Digital Assets Daily (@AssetsDaily) December 17, 2025 Why Small Cuts May Not Matter Claver draws a sharp distinction between small and large cuts. He says a 25-basis-point reduction would likely produce only a mild reaction. “It’ll be more of a trickle,” he says. He does not expect that size of move to force investors to reposition quickly. That view reflects recent market behavior. Earlier easing cycles brought limited follow-through across crypto markets, including XRP. Claver suggests that this poor performance was predictable given the modest nature of those cuts . Bigger Cuts and Faster Repositioning Claver’s outlook changes when discussing deeper reductions. He says a 50 or 75 basis point cut would have a much stronger effect. “If they move 50 or 75 basis points, it’s gangbusters.” He links that scenario to leveraged strategies tied to interest rates. According to Claver, aggressive cuts would unwind those positions rapidly. He believes that the process could send capital into risk assets with speed rather than hesitation. XRP, in his view, would benefit from that environment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Timing and the Element of Surprise Like Claver, many experts believe rate cuts can cause XRP to explode . However, Claver also focuses on timing. He suggests policymakers could act when markets are closed, limiting the ability for gradual adjustment. He says they could “push it over the weekend,” adding that it might lead to “a happy Monday.” He specifically references December 21 as a date to watch. He does not present it as a guarantee. He presents it as a moment where surprise could amplify market reaction. What XRP Traders Are Watching Claver does not claim every rate cut will lift XRP. His argument centers on magnitude and execution. Smaller moves allow markets to adapt slowly, while larger ones force immediate change. Claver’s confidence hinges on one condition. He believes the next meaningful cut will not creep in quietly. If it arrives with size, he expects markets to react faster .

Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have seen their prices increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is up by 1.4% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $87,906. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is up by 4.1%, now changing hands at $2,953. This is the highest increase in this category. It’s followed by Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 2.4% to the price of $0.128. At the same time, Tron (TRX) saw the lowest rise, with a change of 0.8%, now standing at $0.2794. When it comes to the top 100 coins, 90 coins saw increases. Of these, two are double-digit. Provenance Blockchain (HASH) is up 10.1% to the price of $0.03094, while Bitcoin Cash (BCH) went up by 10%, currently changing hands at $587. Among the red coins, MemeCore (M) posted the highest fall in the category. It’s down 8.2%, now trading at $1.54. Mantle (MNT) is next, having decreased by 3.7% to the price of $1.17. Meanwhile, in the US, a delayed report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics was cooler than expected. More precisely, consumer prices increased less than expected in November. This encourages hope among investors that inflationary pressures may cool to the degree that would result in the higher-than-expected easing of US monetary policy. Also, Binance is reportedly considering a return to the US market , with potential structural changes to its American operations. A possible recapitalization of Binance.US could reduce Changpeng Zhao’s controlling stake. @binance plans a US return with @cz_binance possibly cutting his stake & pursuing partnerships with BlackRock & Trump-linked WLFI in the works. #Binance #USCrypto https://t.co/jN8SILynzO — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 18, 2025 ‘US CPI Was Noisy, Not Bullish’ Gabe Selby, Head of Research at Kraken company CF Benchmark , commented that Bitcoin’s erratic price action reflects the seller-dominated crypto market, as well as elevated uncertainty around the broader macro trajectory. Yesterday’s US CPI release initially appeared supportive for risk assets. However, “the underlying reality is more complex.” Notably, “the data was compiled under highly atypical conditions,” most notably the government shutdown. Therefore, the report captured November’s latter portion only, which was heavily distorted by Black Friday product discounting. Per Selby, “this created temporary disinflationary noise that limits the report’s reliability as a true inflation gauge. Markets seem to recognize this, treating the print as an aberration rather than confirmation of any sustained cooling trend.” “What’s particularly telling is that Bitcoin’s price action mirrored this skepticism in real time. The asset rallied immediately after the release but quickly lost steam as traders reassessed the data quality.” Bitcoin pushed toward Wednesday’s highs but failed to break through, fully retracing its gains. That rejection is significant, says Selby. It shows that “sellers remain firmly in control and reinforces the view that Bitcoin is still trading within a broader downtrend, despite the brief optimism sparked by the headline CPI number.” The key takeaway, Selby concludes is that, “until we get several months of clean, uninterrupted inflation data, the [US Federal Reserve’s] path remains murky. And in that environment of uncertainty, Bitcoin—despite its recent institutional adoption narrative—continues to behave like the risk asset it is, struggling to find sustained buying conviction.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Friday morning, BTC stood at $87,906. After a sideways trading period early in the day, BTC jumped to the intraday high of $89,219, before plummeting to $84,581 and then recovering to the current level. Moreover, BTC is down 5% in a week, 3.4% in a month, 13.2% in a year, and 30% from the October all-time high of $126,080. Investors are now looking to see if the price will move above $90,000 and then hold that level. This would open doors for another leg up towards $100,000. Conversely, a fall may lead the coin to the $74,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $2,953. The highest point it reached over the past 24 hours (by the time of writing) is $2,989, before plunging to the low of $2,781. It has recovered to the current price since. Over the past week, ETH fell 9.2%, as well as 2.9% in a month and 19.8% in a year. It has also decreased by 40% from its August ATH of $4,946. Should the price reclaim the $3,000, it could proceed to $3,130 and $3,250. However, a decrease would pull the price back to the $2,900 zone and possibly into the $2,700 territory. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Moreover, the crypto market sentiment has decreased yet again within the fear territory. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 21 today , compared to 22 yesterday. It is now back on the verge of the extreme fear zone. Market participants remain highly cautious of the incoming development, as well as uncertain over the market trajectory. They’re waiting for further signals to decide on their next moves.

The crypto market saw an increase over the past 24 hours, while the US stock market closed higher on Thursday. By the closing time on 18 December, the S&P 500 was up by 0.79%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 1.51%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.14%. The increases follow the release of delayed Consumer Price Index data, which ended up being better than expected. Is this rally sustainable? The rise may continue in the short term, but the analysts expect another decrease at any given moment currently. That said, many argue that we’re still in for a significant rally as the new year begins, possibly in Q1.

In the following lines, we will touch upon their performances and outline some of the future targets (according to analysts). Ethereum (ETH) will also be in focus, as it appears to be approaching a pivotal moment that may shape its broader trend. What’s Going on With PI? The native token of Pi Network spent the past week trying to reclaim the $0.20 mark. The bulls managed to defend that level (at least for now), and the asset is currently trading around $0.205 (per CoinGecko’s data). This represents a minor decrease of 1.5% on a weekly scale, but a staggering 93% crash since the all-time high of $3 witnessed at the start of 2025. Earlier this week, there was an evident shift of tokens from exchanges towards self-custody methods, which typically reduces the selling pressure and could be interpreted as a bullish sign. As CryptoPotato reported , over 1.2 million coins were taken out of the centralized platforms in just 24 hours. Meanwhile, the community seems divided regarding the asset’s next potential move. Some argue that PI has turned into a disappointing project and are not optimistic about its future. Others, like X user Web3_Vibes, expect the token to head north after bouncing off the $0.192 support level. Where Next for ADA? Over the past week, Cardano’s native cryptocurrency has performed much worse than PI, losing approximately 14% of its value, and is currently worth roughly $0.36. Analysts like X user Ali Martinez think the asset may tank further in the short term, eyeing a 20% collapse to the $0.29 support zone. However, there are many optimists who envision a substantial resurgence. X user Marzell, for instance, assumed that ADA has shown early signs of a rebound, with bullish RSI/MACD divergence. He outlined that the valuation remains under the 50- and 100-day MAs, predicting a pump to $0.50 hinges on a decisive breakout from the present price level. The analyst, using the X moniker Sssebi, also chipped in. They spotted bullish divergence on the price chart, describing it as “the last hope” for ADA. Crash or Rally for ETH? The second-largest cryptocurrency witnessed enhanced volatility as of late and, as of this writing, trades just south of the psychological mark of $3,000, or a 9% drop for the past seven days. The X user Colin Talks Crypto claimed the overall downfall could continue in the short term and lead to a potential fall to as low as $2,100. “ETH will drop as BTC drops, and both short-term charts look horrible. Look at it as an opportunity,” he added. On the other hand, there are some optimists. X user Ash Crypto told their two million followers that “the local bottom is in or very close,” while Ted forecasted a jump to as high as $3,200 as long as the price doesn’t lose the $2,2700-$2,800 support zone. The declining supply of ETH on exchanges supports the bullish thesis. Just a few days ago, the amount of assets stored on such platforms dipped to a fresh nine-year low of around 16.2 million, whereas currently it is quite close to that figure.

According to official responses shared with lawmakers, the coins were seized during criminal probes into fraud, money laundering and other illegal activity. The holdings were listed in a government inventory dated October 31, 2025, and the figure was made public amid questions from lawmaker Ko Ju-Chun. Seized Crypto Under Judicial Control Reports have disclosed that the Bitcoin is held under judicial custody, not as a national reserve. Court procedures determine what happens next. Some assets may be returned to victims, some kept for evidence, and some could be forfeited or auctioned after legal review. No formal plan to convert the holdings into state reserves or investments has been announced. The seized portfolio includes more than just Bitcoin. Officials recorded 2,429.97 ETH and sizable sums of stablecoins such as USDT and USDC. Based on reported totals, the combined value of these crypto assets exceeded NT$1.3 billion.

Another nation-state holding Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/bp6VJ90rDM — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 18, 2025 That amount converts to millions of US dollars at current exchange rates. At recent market levels, the 210.45 BTC alone is worth roughly $18 million, a figure that will move with Bitcoin’s price. Value And Composition Of Holdings According to public documents and reporting, Taiwan’s stockpile places it among several jurisdictions that hold cryptocurrency through law enforcement action. Rankings that track seized or government-held crypto put Taiwan near other countries that have accumulated coins via criminal investigations. Law enforcement seized these assets during a string of investigations into digital asset fraud and illicit exchanges. Some cases involved networks that used crypto to hide proceeds. Other seizures came from raids tied to financial crime. Officials say the assets remain linked to ongoing legal processes, and ownership claims must be resolved before any transfer or sale can occur. Implications For Policy And Enforcement Based on reports, this disclosure highlights practical issues for authorities handling crypto. Keeping digital coins secure, establishing chain-of-custody records, calculating market value for legal decisions, and managing potential auctions are all new operational tasks for judicial agencies. Transparency demands have increased as lawmakers press for clearer rules about how seized crypto should be treated. Market watchers and legal experts say the public accounting of seized crypto may spur debate in Taiwan about regulations and asset management. Some will argue for clearer rules on disposition. Others will push for victim compensation procedures that account for volatile values. Whatever comes next, these tokens are currently pieces of evidence tied to court rulings rather than line items in a sovereign treasury.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-will-drop-to-1-75-and-rise-to-16-heres-the-timeline/,"Crypto markets are entering a critical phase where volatility, sentiment, and liquidity are converging. Price action across major digital assets suggests the market is preparing for a decisive move. Historically, these periods of compression have preceded sharp reversals or explosive continuations. Against this backdrop, one analyst’s outlook is gaining attention for its structured timeline and clearly defined price zones. That outlook comes from CryptoBull, who recently shared a market projection outlining a short-term corrective phase followed by a strong bullish expansion. His analysis frames current weakness not as failure, but as a necessary reset before the next major leg higher. Bitcoin Sets the Tone for the Market CryptoBull’s central argument is that Bitcoin is the primary driver of the market. He expects BTC to experience a corrective pullback toward the $82,000 level. From a technical perspective, this move would represent a healthy retracement within a broader uptrend, rather than a breakdown of structure. Bitcoin will drop to $82,000 and then rise to $119,000. #XRP will go to $1.75, then rise to $16 by end of January/early February. pic.twitter.com/Yijg7NZTAv — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 19, 2025 According to the analysis, this decline would help flush out excessive leverage and restore balance to momentum indicators. Once this process is complete, CryptoBull projects Bitcoin resuming its upward trajectory, with a recovery move toward $119,000. Such behavior aligns with historical patterns where Bitcoin corrects first, stabilizes, and then leads the next expansion phase. XRP Approaches a Final Reset Zone XRP, in CryptoBull’s view, is nearing what he describes as a final shakeout phase. He identifies the $1.75 region as a potential downside target , driven by liquidity dynamics rather than weakening fundamentals. This level is presented as a temporary stop on the way to a much larger move. The projected dip is not framed as bearish. Instead, it is seen as the last opportunity for the market to reset before XRP transitions into price discovery. Structurally, XRP remains within a long-term bullish formation, with recent consolidation reinforcing, rather than invalidating, that setup. The Path to $16 and the Projected Timeline The most striking element of CryptoBull’s forecast is the upside target. Following the corrective phase, he anticipates XRP entering a rapid expansion that could push the price toward $16 . The timeline for this move is ambitious, with late January to early February identified as the critical window. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This projection is based on historical cycle behavior, multi-year technical patterns, and the tendency for XRP to move aggressively once momentum decisively shifts. In this scenario, price acceleration would be driven by renewed market confidence and increased capital rotation into high-beta assets. Conditions That Could Shape the Outcome CryptoBull’s roadmap remains conditional on broader market factors. Bitcoin must successfully reclaim momentum after its retracement, and overall liquidity conditions must remain supportive. Any deviation in macro sentiment could alter the pace or extent of the move. Still, the analysis offers a clear framework for understanding potential market behavior in the weeks ahead. Rather than predicting straight-line gains, it acknowledges volatility as part of the process. A Market at a Defining Moment As the market approaches this pivotal window, CryptoBull’s analysis underscores a recurring theme in crypto cycles. Major rallies often begin after periods of doubt and exhaustion. Whether the forecast plays out exactly as outlined remains to be seen, but the structure and timing highlight why many traders are watching XRP closely as the new year approaches.

Bybit has reportedly launched a spot trading platform with 100 crypto pairs and a peer-to-peer marketplace, in partnership with UK-based Archax. The Dubai-based exchange bid farewell to the European jurisdiction in 2023 after the UK government passed legislation to curb “illegal” financial promotions through its regulatory body, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The regulations took away the “freedom” unlicensed crypto firms had to advertise and provide services to British residents, and several exchanges, including Bybit , had to suspend local operations. The exchange has gone back to the UK after forming a partnership with London-based crypto exchange Archax, which holds a special license to approve financial promotions on behalf of unauthorized firms. Bybit makes UK return with compliance through partnership Although Bybit is not itself licensed in the UK, the exchange said it will operate under the FCA’s standards for transparency and financial promotion. “The UK is home to one of the most sophisticated financial ecosystems in the world, and its clear regulatory direction makes it an ideal environment for responsible innovation,” said Mykolas Majauskas, senior director of policy at Bybit. Archax’s Chief Compliance Officer, Ben Brown, reiterated the firm’s experience in guiding crypto exchanges into the UK market. “Archax is supporting Bybit’s compliant access to the UK market, building on our experience where we have previously helped other leading crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase and OKX, access the UK market without the need for their own authorisation,” he told news publications through an emailed statement. Bybit’s return to the British kingdom is a much-needed win in a year where it suffered the largest hack in the history of crypto exchanges in February 2025. North Korean cyber actors allegedly stole $1.46 billion from its offline storage, and the stolen funds, mostly in Ether, were moved to several wallets and then liquidated. Days after the incident, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation linked the attack to North Korea, citing activity by the group known as “TraderTraitor.” The theft marked a record haul for Pyongyang, which has now reportedly accumulated more than $6.75 billion in cryptocurrency theft since 2016. Chainalysis’s report, released Thursday, showed the North Korean regime broke its previous record of $681 million stolen in 2024, and it is the first nation-state to exceed $2 billion in crypto theft in a single year. UK financial watchdogs to welcome crypto regulatory discussions The British government is preparing to bring crypto assets under the same regulatory framework as other financial products, with legislation expected to take effect by 2027. Crypto firms will be required to meet standards overseen by the FCA, including transparency requirements and clear operational guidelines. Lucy Rigby, the minister for the City of London, told the Guardian that the government would like to make the UK more “attractive” for crypto firms. “We want the UK to be at the top of the list for crypto assets firms looking to grow and these new rules will give firms the clarity and consistency they need to plan for the long term,” she surmised. The Treasury is currently drafting regulations that would integrate crypto service providers into the remit of the FCA to make sure the services consumers pay for are following the same standards as traditional financial products. “Regulation is coming, and we want to get it right. We’ve listened to feedback, and now we’re setting out our proposals for the UK’s crypto regime,” executive director for payments and digital finance at the FCA, David Geale, told Reuters. Per FCA’s Crypto Asset Consumer Research 2025 report, around 8% of adults held digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2025, down from 12% in 2024. The financial watchdog’s 2022 survey found that 10% of adults owned crypto, almost double the number from 2021’s findings of just 4.1%. Approximately 21% of crypto holders reported portfolios valued between £1,001 ($1,342) and £5,000 ($6,707), while the share of investors with holdings below £100 ($134) has also tanked significantly.

56037154,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248076,1766146227,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Hegota Upgrade: Ethereum’s Monumental 2026 Evolution for a Leaner, Faster Network",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-hegota-upgrade-2026/,"BitcoinWorld Hegota Upgrade: Ethereum’s Monumental 2026 Evolution for a Leaner, Faster Network Ethereum’s development roadmap just got a major milestone. Core developers have officially named the network’s pivotal upgrade for the second half of 2026: the Hegota upgrade . This isn’t just another routine update; it’s a foundational shift designed to solve some of Ethereum’s most pressing challenges. If you’re invested in the future of decentralized applications and a more scalable blockchain, understanding the Hegota upgrade is crucial. What Exactly Is the Hegota Upgrade? The name Hegota itself tells a story. It’s a creative portmanteau, blending ‘Bogota’ (the planned execution layer upgrade) and ‘Heze’ (the consensus layer upgrade). This naming convention follows Ethereum’s tradition but signals a unified, coordinated effort across both layers of its architecture. The primary goal? To dramatically reduce the operational burden on network participants while paving the way for next-generation client software. Why Is the Hegota Upgrade a Game-Changer? Ethereum’s success has created its own challenge: an ever-growing history of data that full nodes must store. This ‘state bloat’ makes running a node increasingly resource-intensive, which can centralize the network. The Hegota upgrade tackles this head-on with two revolutionary features. Verkle Trees: This is a new data structure that will replace the current Merkle Patricia trees. Think of it as a massive efficiency upgrade for how the network organizes and verifies data. State and History Expiry: This mechanism will allow old, unused data to be safely ‘rolled up’ and archived, preventing the blockchain’s active state from growing indefinitely. Together, these changes are the essential prerequisites for enabling ‘stateless clients,’ which could verify the chain with minimal data storage. What Are the Tangible Benefits of This Upgrade? So, what does this technical wizardry mean for the average user, developer, or validator? The advantages are profound. Lower Barrier to Node Operation: By curbing state growth, the Hegota upgrade aims to keep hardware requirements manageable. This promotes decentralization by allowing more people to run nodes. Faster Syncing and Verification: Stateless clients, enabled by Verkle Trees, could sync to the network almost instantly, improving the overall user experience and network resilience. Enhanced Scalability Foundation: A leaner, more efficient data layer creates a stronger foundation for future scaling solutions, ensuring Ethereum can handle global adoption. What Challenges Lie Ahead Before 2026? Implementing changes of this magnitude is no small feat. The path to the Hegota upgrade involves rigorous testing, community coordination, and seamless integration. Developers must ensure these deep protocol changes are secure and backward-compatible. Furthermore, clear communication and tooling for node operators and service providers will be vital for a smooth transition. The two-year timeline reflects the complexity and importance of getting every detail right. Conclusion: Hegota as a Pivotal Step Forward The announcement of the Hegota upgrade solidifies Ethereum’s commitment to long-term, sustainable growth. It moves beyond short-term fixes to address fundamental architectural constraints. While the features are highly technical, their purpose is simple: to preserve Ethereum’s core values of decentralization and security while enabling it to scale for the future. The Hegota upgrade is not just an update; it’s a critical evolution in Ethereum’s journey to becoming a robust, global settlement layer. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) When is the Ethereum Hegota upgrade scheduled? The Hegota upgrade is currently scheduled for activation in the second half of 2026. What is the main purpose of the Hegota upgrade? Its main purposes are to implement Verkle Trees and introduce a state expiry mechanism. These are designed to reduce data storage burdens on nodes and enable stateless clients, which are crucial for long-term scalability and decentralization. Will the Hegota upgrade require a hard fork? Yes, like most major network upgrades, the Hegota upgrade will be implemented via a scheduled hard fork, requiring all node operators to update their client software. How will Verkle Trees benefit Ethereum? Verkle Trees allow for much smaller ‘proofs’ of data, meaning stateless clients can verify transactions without storing the entire chain state. This leads to faster syncing times and lower hardware requirements for participants. What is ‘state expiry’ and why is it needed? State expiry is a mechanism to archive old, inactive data from the blockchain’s active state. This prevents ‘state bloat,’ where the data full nodes must store grows indefinitely, increasing costs and centralizing the network. Can the timeline for the Hegota upgrade change? Absolutely. Development timelines in blockchain are estimates. The 2026 target is a goal, but it could shift based on the complexity of implementation, testing outcomes, and community consensus. Found this deep dive into Ethereum’s future helpful? The Hegota upgrade is a landmark event for the blockchain ecosystem.

However, there are some gray areas, particularly in DeFi, where reporting taxes can be difficult. This U.S. crypto taxes guide will help you navigate the new IRS crypto tax rules 2025 requirements, understand your tax obligations, and avoid common mistakes when filing taxes. Quick Summary — What Changed in U.S. Crypto Taxes? (2025-2026) As the IRS tightens reporting requirements, investors need a reliable U.S. crypto tax guide to navigate the changes. New IRS “Broker” definition Passed in 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act clarified the definition of a broker to include any person who facilitates the transfer of digital assets on behalf of other people. Based on this new definition, centralized crypto exchanges like Binance US and NFT Marketplaces like Magic Eden US have to report to the IRS. The Act also contains several changes that affect how crypto will be taxed. Mandatory 1099-DA reporting The IRS introduced the first dedicated crypto tax reporting form, which is called Form 1099-DA (Digital Asset Information Return). The crypto tax 1099 form is designed to improve transparency when filing crypto income tax. Beginning in 2025, brokers now issue this form to their customers who have traded or disposed of digital assets to report sales proceeds, cost basis, and profit and loss from all crypto transactions. Centralized exchanges → full reporting obligations The IRS requires all centralized crypto exchanges like Kraken , Binance US, and Coinbase to track all transactions, including buys, sells, and withdrawals. Under the IRS’s crypto broker rules, they must also provide complete profit and loss reporting, cost basis tracking, identity verification, and transaction reporting through the 1099-DA form. NFT marketplaces now classified as brokers NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea, Blur, and Magic Eden US also have the same obligations as centralized crypto exchanges. They must issue 1099-DA reports for NFT sales, including secondary market sales, and creator royalties. NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea, Blur, and Magic Eden US are now bound by the same crypto broker rules. DAOs, self-custody interactions, DeFi — still gray zones The IRS has no well-detailed guidance on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), self-custody wallets, automated market makers (AMMs), and other DeFi platforms. This is mostly due to the decentralized nature of these platforms. However, users are expected to self-report relevant transactions and maintain detailed records while using these platforms. The IRS is expected to develop a framework to address all gray zones in 2026. Threshold changes for Form 8300 All businesses that accept crypto payments are now required to file Form 8300 for payments worth $10,000 and above, whether in a single or multiple transactions. This ensures that large payments are properly tracked for tax and to prevent money laundering. How Crypto Is Taxed in the U.S. The IRS treats cryptocurrency as property, which means various crypto-related events can be taxed, and they can be categorized into either capital gains or income events. Two Tax Categories: Capital Gains and Income The U.S. crypto taxes guide says you realize a capital gain or loss when you trade, sell, or spend your crypto, while you make an income when you earn new tokens such as mining rewards, staking rewards, or airdrops . Crypto = Property According to IRS Notice 2014-21, cryptocurrencies are considered property. This means that every crypto transaction is treated like the sale or exchange of property, and you must calculate gains or losses based on the fair market value (FMV) at the time of the transaction. Short-term vs long-term capital gains Short-term capital gains apply to crypto held for one year or less and are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate, which is between 10% to 37%. Long-term capital gains apply to crypto held for more than one year and are taxed at reduced rates of 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income level. In 2025, the threshold for 0% long-term capital gains was $48,350 for single filers. When crypto is taxed, and when it’s not According to the IRS crypto tax new rules, you are taxed when you sell, trade, or spend it for a profit, and when you earn new tokens through mining, staking, or airdrops. Transfers between your own wallets are not taxable events, as no gain or loss is realized. Taxable Events (Fully Updated for New Rules) The U.S. crypto taxes guide for 2026 clearly distinguishes between taxable events and non-taxable ones. Moving crypto between your own wallets (NOT taxable) One of the few non-taxable actions is transferring crypto between wallets you own, similar to transferring money between your various bank accounts. For instance, moving your ETH from an exchange to a hardware wallet does not create taxable income, and the key factor is ownership. As long as you maintain full control of the asset during the transfer, the IRS does not treat it as a taxable event. Transfers ≠ taxable events. Selling crypto for USD Crypto is considered a property, and selling it will result in income, which can be taxed. This is the clearest way to trigger a taxable event under the IRS crypto tax rules 2025. Trading one crypto for another The IRS treats trading of a cryptocurrency for another as a taxable event, even though no fiat is involved. This is because it is seen as selling an asset to purchase another, a transaction that is subject to capital gains tax. This means you must determine the dollar value of the sold token and the one you bought from the trade. Spending crypto Whenever you make a payment, including tipping, with crypto or a crypto debit card, it is considered a disposal by the IRS, and it is subject to tax. The amount disposed of will be the fair market value at the time the payment was made, and your capital gains or loss would be the difference between that value and your cost basis. Receiving crypto as income Earnings in crypto come in various forms, ranging from plain ol’ salary paid in crypto to blockchain-native concepts such as mining and staking rewards. Salary Crypto received as compensation, either as a salary, contractor pay, or any kind of compensation, is taxed as ordinary income at its fair market value on the day you receive it. Mining rewards The moment mined coins are credited to your wallet, their dollar value counts as income. When you eventually sell or trade those mined coins, you incur a separate capital gain or loss. Staking rewards Staking rewards trigger income tax at the time the rewards become accessible to you, not when you choose to claim or trade them. This distinction is important, especially in situations where staking rewards get accumulated over time. Airdrops Airdrops are also taxable the moment you gain control over the tokens, regardless of whether you requested or expected them. Hard forks When there’s a fork of a blockchain, if it results in new tokens appearing in your wallet and you have control over them, their fair market value is treated as income and will be taxed. Creator royalties (NFTs) Royalties earned from NFTs are taxed as ordinary income. This applies to creators who receive ongoing payments from secondary sales. These royalties are not treated as capital gains because they represent compensation for creative work. Trading, DEXs & DeFi Tax Rules Taxation of crypto in decentralized finance (DeFi) is more complex than in centralized exchanges and NFT marketplaces. DeFi platforms run on the blockchain, with no singular legal entity in charge. Therefore, it is almost impossible for the IRS to enforce regulations; however, users are still expected to self-report on all taxable transactions. Also, the IRS is expected to provide a detailed U.S. crypto taxes guide in 2026 on how to properly tax DeFi transactions. Swapping tokens on DEXs Decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap allow users to trade digital assets on the blockchain through swapping, and this makes it hard for the IRS to track. A swap is the exchange of a digital asset for another, which can result in a capital gain or loss. Swaps on decentralized exchanges such as Raydium and 1Inch Network are treated the same as trades on centralized exchanges, in the sense that the IRS expects you to still report them. LP positions → two taxable events Providing liquidity to a pool often triggers two taxable events. First, the deposit of assets to the pool may be treated as a disposal, depending on the mechanics of the protocol. Many automated market makers issue liquidity provider (LP) tokens in exchange for deposited assets, and receiving these tokens may constitute a second taxable event. Liquidity removal The removal of liquidity from a liquidity pool will often result in capital gains or losses, which must be included when filing your crypto tax. Earning yield on DeFi Earning yield on DeFi platforms through mechanisms like lending or yield farming counts as income. Regardless of whether rewards are automatically compounded or manually claimed, the IRS expects income to be reported based on the fair market value of the rewards at the time they are earned. Lending/borrowing Borrowing in DeFi does not trigger a taxable event. However, the interest you pay may be treated as a disposal of crypto if you make payments using tokens that have appreciated or depreciated. Rewards received through lending protocols are treated as income. Liquidations Liquidations can result in a capital loss, especially if your collateral is sold at a value lower than its cost basis. DeFi users should track collateral values carefully, as liquidations occur automatically and may not include clear documentation of values. DeFi wrappers & synthetic tokens A DeFi wrapper is a crypto token that represents a crypto from another blockchain, allowing the asset to be used on that chain. Synthetic tokens are assets that mimic the price action of an underlying asset without the user holding the asset. Both DeFi wrappers and synthetic tokens occupy a gray area in regulation, because in many cases, wrapping tokens does not change ownership; therefore, it cannot be treated as a taxable exchange. However, some wrappers alter your rights over the underlying asset, which may cause the IRS to treat them as a disposal, therefore taxable. L2s and cross-chain bridges tax handling Moving assets across various chains is non-taxable as long as you retain full ownership. When bridging involves minting a wrapped asset or using a third-party liquidity provider, the transaction might be treated as a taxable exchange. NFT Tax Rules The taxation of NFTs depends largely on whether the asset is considered a “collectible.” Collectibles tax rate (28%) in some cases NFTs, which meet the IRS’s U.S. crypto taxes guide definition of collectibles, are subject to a maximum long-term capital gains rate of 28%. Minting an NFT Minting an NFT is not a taxable event unless you receive tokens or other compensation during the minting process. For creators, the act of minting is considered the creation of property. The taxable event only occurs when the NFT is sold, and the proceeds are treated as ordinary income. Selling an NFT When an NFT is sold, it leads to income tax for the creators, since they are earning from the sale of a digital asset, while the buyer gets taxed on capital gains. The buyer should include the gas fees paid during minting or the purchase of the NFT to accurately calculate their capital gain or loss. Creator royalties NFT creators usually earn royalties from secondary sales of an NFT, and the IRS classifies this as income, not capital gains. It’s important to note that income tax rates can be significantly higher than tax on capital gains. Gaming assets Tokens, play-to-earn NFTs and other gaming assets earned through gameplay are classified as income under current NFT taxes USA guidelines, and will be taxed at their fair market value. Future trading of these assets will lead to capital gain or loss depending on the changes in market prices. Mining, Staking, and Airdrops — Income vs Capital Gains Mining rewards = ordinary income at FMV Rewards from crypto mining activities are classified as income and will be taxed based on the fair market value when they are received. Staking rewards Staking rewards are considered income as soon as they are available, whether they are claimed or not. This applies to staking on both DeFi and centralized platforms. Selling or disposing of the rewards later may result in capital gains or losses. Airdropped tokens taxed at the moment of control These are taxed as income at the moment tokens come under your control, even if they drop in your wallet unsolicited. Subsequent sales may trigger capital gains. How 1099-MISC forms apply The crypto tax 1099 form is a tax form used to report income payments of at least $600 or royalty payments of at least $10 made to individuals and entities who are not employees. It applies to payments such as staking rewards, mining rewards, and promotional tokens. It is one of the most important crypto broker rules that centralized crypto exchanges like Binance US must provide eligible users with a tax form for. Airdrops, Forks, Rewards — Special Cases Token airdrops, network forks and blockchain-issued rewards present special cases that are not readily addressed under existing rules. Hard Forks: income if new tokens received A hard fork occurs when there is an irreversible change to the blockchain, resulting in two branches. The hard fork of a chain can lead to taxable events when there are new assets deposited into your wallets. The new assets are considered income by the IRS and will need to be reflected in your crypto income tax. Airdrops: FMV income The fair market value of airdropped tokens at the moment you receive them is considered income. Subsequent profits or losses when selling the tokens are subject to crypto capital gains tax. Incentive programs Many platforms run incentive programs where users can gain points, which can later be converted to tokens. The conversion of these points to tokens creates taxable income. Liquidity mining Liquidity mining rewards are treated as ordinary income, which is also subject to capital gains tax. New IRS Crypto Reporting Rules Heading into 2026, there are a few new rules to know as you prepare to report your crypto transactions to the IRS. Form 1099-DA Brokers must issue the Digital Asset Reporting Form 1099-DA to users who trigger taxable events. The form includes proceeds, cost basis, acquisition dates, disposal dates, and wallet addresses, allowing the IRS to compare taxpayer reports with the information submitted by the brokers in order to reduce underreporting. Exchanges as “Brokers” Centralized crypto exchanges are classified as brokers now and are obligated to follow the new crypto taxes new rules. Exchanges must collect and verify customer identities, maintain detailed records of all user transactions, and issue the various tax reporting forms, including the crypto tax 1099 form. NFT platforms as brokers NFT marketplaces are also treated as brokers, and must report NFT sales, royalty payments made to creators, and wallet information for taxable transactions. CeFi → Obligatory KYC reporting Centralized crypto platforms are required to verify their customers’ identities. The USA Patriot Act and Bank Secrecy Act mandate that all financial institutions, including crypto exchanges, implement Customer Identification Programs. DeFi — Not clearly included DeFi platforms are not currently covered by IRS crypto reporting rules and are not required to issue tax forms because they often lack identifiable customer data. However, the IRS expects users to self-report. “Cash-Like Crypto Transactions” Over $10,000 According to the new U.S. crypto taxes guide, businesses that receive over $10,000 in crypto must file Form 8300. This is one of the initiatives meant to curb money laundering using crypto. Crypto Losses & Tax Strategies Tax-loss harvesting Traders often rely on tax-loss harvesting at the end of the year to offset taxable gains. Because crypto is volatile, intentionally selling assets at a loss can reduce tax bills significantly. Wash sale rule does NOT apply (yet) A wash sale is when an investor sells an asset at a loss and immediately buys it back to claim tax deductions on the realized loss. The U.S. wash sale rule prevents this. However, it does not yet apply to cryptocurrency, allowing investors to sell at a loss and buy back immediately without penalty. Offsetting gains Another strategy investors use to reduce their tax burden is by using losses to offset both short-term and long-term gains. If losses exceed gains, up to $3,000 can be deducted from ordinary income annually, with unused losses carried forward. Lost/stolen crypto Lost or stolen crypto can be counted as a deductible if there’s sufficient proof that the crypto was stolen and that it is permanently lost, which means losing access to your wallet doesn’t automatically qualify you for a tax deduction. Rug pulls and scams This is treated similarly to losses incurred from theft of crypto. The IRS requires evidence of fraud and permanent loss of funds. Without clear evidence, the deductions will not be allowed. How to File Crypto Taxes Filing U.S. crypto taxes requires various forms: Required IRS forms Form 8949 for individual trades, including capital gains or losses. Schedule D for total gains and losses for the tax year. Schedule C for crypto-related business or crypto mining. The new Form 1099-DA, if received from a broker. Form 8300 for businesses accepting large crypto payments of up to $10,000. Using crypto tax software Self-reporting taxes on DeFi trades is difficult because taxable transactions are not easily identifiable and lack the clear, structured data the IRS requires. Crypto tax software like Koinly, CoinTracker, TokenTax, and Accointing solve this problem by helping traders generate IRS-ready reports. Koinly provides the most support for DeFi protocols, tracking trades and liquidity, and cross-chain activities to generate IRS-ready forms like Form 8949 and Schedule D. CoinTracker partnered with Coinbase and is a good choice for users who bridge DeFi and CeFi. It provides accurate tax calculations, including insights into users’ portfolios. TokenTax offers automated tax tracking and uses human tax professionals to review the filings and prepare full IRS returns. Accointing excels at sorting through messy on-chain data to provide IRS tax reports. It also has a dashboard that tracks users’ portfolios across chains. Working with a professional Professional tax help may be necessary for scenarios where a user has triggered taxable events across multiple chains, earned creator royalties , runs a staking business, or heavy yield farming. Common Mistakes and IRS Red Flags The IRS has become significantly better at detecting unreported crypto activity. Common mistakes include failing to report trades on decentralized exchanges, not reporting airdrops as income, and errors with cost basis when moving tokens between wallets. Withdrawals from exchanges to wallets are not disposals and should not be reported as sales. However, many users seem to make this mistake. NFT royalties often go unreported. Because royalties are income, failing to include them on your return increases audit risk. Similarly, those who trade across L2 networks without tracking each transaction may leave significant gaps in their reporting. Large OTC transactions, especially peer-to-peer sales, may also cause scrutiny if not documented thoroughly. With blockchain data now cross-referenced with third-party reports, omissions are easier to detect. What to Expect Next (Crypto Tax Outlook 2026+) The United States Treasury and the IRS tried to designate DeFi platforms as brokers and have them report transactions via the various tax reporting forms. However, Congress struck this down and further prohibited them from issuing any similar rules without express Congressional authorization. The IRS is expected to release further U.S. crypto taxes guide for DeFi and other non-custodial activities in the coming months, to clarify tax obligations and improve compliance for U.S. taxpayers. On the 4th of April, 2025, the SEC published a statement where it clarified that fully backed USD stablecoins can not be treated as securities when used as a means of payment, and this has not changed in 2026. However, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has highlighted the need for a global framework to regulate the issuance of stablecoins and reduce risks associated with liquidity. The FSB also recommended that the framework should include data collection and reporting, and cross-border cooperation. The SEC has also called for the development of a comprehensive model to govern the issuance of stablecoins, emphasizing that issuers must meet a clearly defined reserve backing standard. Self-custody wallet users can expect more regulatory clarity in 2026, thanks to new laws, like the GENIUS Act in the U.S. The act protects personal crypto activities by clarifying that personal uses, like peer-to-peer transfers and transfers between personal accounts, remain permissible, while custodial services are subject to stricter oversight. This aims to protect users while supporting secure, independent crypto management under tighter crypto tax reporting USA obligations. The IRS currently requires all staking rewards to be reported as income. However, Senator Todd Young, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, argued that taxing staking rewards upon receipt instead of when the rewards are sold unfairly taxes unrealized gains. The IRS is expected to issue further guidance, and future rules may align more closely with economic reality. For centralized staking-as-a-service providers, they must report to the IRS and also issue Form 1099-DA. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has issued guidelines to address concerns about money laundering and terror financing in crypto, especially DeFi, citing reports of an increase in the use of crypto and digital assets in fraud and scams. The FATF encourages that various jurisdictions should implement its Travel Rule to mitigate risks associated with digital assets.",Cryptocurrency Guides|Binance US|Coinbase|IRS|Kraken|PancakeSwap|Treasury Department|Uniswap|USD,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-19 12:15:14

The incident involved sensitive data handled by the Foreign Office on behalf of the Home Office, and though officials say the risk to individuals remains low, the breach has triggered a full-blown investigation across multiple agencies. Trade Minister Chris Bryant confirmed on Friday that the breach was real and being investigated.“We think that it is a fairly low-risk that individuals will have been compromised or affected,” Chris said. He also made it clear that the security loophole had been “closed pretty quickly.” Still, when asked by Times Radio about whether the attack was linked directly to the Chinese state, he replied, “I’m not able to say whether it is directly related to Chinese operatives, or indeed the Chinese state.” Officials confirm breach involved government-run visa data systems The October cyber incident may have targeted visa-related data, putting thousands of sensitive records at risk. The Foreign Office detected the activity, and the case has now been referred to the Information Commissioner’s Office. The UK government has not publicly named the perpetrators, but Chris said agencies were “working to investigate” what happened. The suspected involvement of a China-affiliated group brings even more attention to recent alerts from UK intelligence services. Agencies including GCHQ have repeatedly warned that China’s espionage operations are becoming more aggressive, especially when it comes to stealing political and commercial information. GCHQ stated last year that more resources were being thrown at dealing with China than any other country. When asked about the UK’s digital readiness, Jamie MacColl, a Senior Research Fellow in Cyber and Tech at the Royal United Services Institute, said part of the problem is that departments still rely on old IT systems. “This can be particularly acute in the public sector because they don’t have the money,” Jamie said , adding that “procurement can be a race to the bottom,” where officials opt for the cheapest providers instead of secure ones. Experts say old systems, weak procurement made attack possible Jake Moore, who works as a global cybersecurity adviser for ESET, said this breach once again shows how weak government IT infrastructure really is. He told the BBC, “Often governments use old systems because they haven’t got the money to improve them.” Jake also said departments need to “invest in better digital defences” if they want to avoid repeated attacks. On China’s cyber tactics , he added, “We often think cyber attacks are connected to financial motivation, but this is another level that comes out of China, with espionage and monitoring systems as the key motivator.” However, Jake also warned against jumping to conclusions. “Sophisticated cyber criminals are able to direct a cyber attack and make it look like it’s come from another country,” he said. Still, confirmation of Chinese involvement would be especially awkward right now. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to visit Beijing next year, the first UK prime minister to do so since 2018. The Labour government says dialogue with China is necessary on issues like trade and climate change, but that doesn’t mean ignoring matters of national security. “Government facilities are always going to be potentially targeted,” Chris said on Friday. “We are working through the consequences of what this is.” The Chinese government continues to deny involvement. Last year, reacting to the UK’s National Security Strategy, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London called the UK’s accusations “entirely fabricated, malicious slander.” Earlier this month, Keir made it clear that the UK can’t afford to keep swinging between extremes in how it handles its relationship with China. “Failing to navigate a relationship with China would be a dereliction of duty,” he said, adding that the country is now a “defining force in technology, trade and global governance.” Keir also argued that building a careful relationship would help the UK remain strong on the world stage and protect its national security, all while facing the “reality” that China poses national security threats.

Does this favor a bullish Ethereum price prediction that sees the token breaking past $3,200 before Christmas? Trading volumes increased by 42% during this period, currently accounting for 10% of the token’s circulating market cap, meaning that the buying pressure has increased significantly. Crypto trader Ted Pillows, whose X account is followed by more than 250,000 users on X, sees the price of ETH rising past $3,200 as long as the $2,700 – $2,800 support holds. $ETH tapped the $2,700-$2,800 support zone and is now bouncing back. As long as Ethereum holds this level, a rally towards $3,100-$3,200 could happen. Losing this level means ETH will retest the $2,500 level. pic.twitter.com/DW41nUtoeU — Ted (@TedPillows) December 19, 2025 The market’s mood continues to be sour as the Fear and Greed Index currently sits at 21. This indicates that investors are fearful as volatility has spiked in the past few weeks. Nonetheless, long-term short-term readings seem to show that the sell-off has already gone too far, possibly favoring a bullish Ethereum price prediction for the next few weeks. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Hits Key Trend Line Support – Can It Break It? The 4-hour price chart for Ethereum shows that the token recently bounced strongly off the $2,800 level and rapidly climbed to retest the upper bound of a descending price channel that has been forming for weeks. In this lower time frame, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has hit oversold territory already. The last two times this happened, the price rallied strongly and surpassed the $3,000 level shortly afterward. If this pattern repeats, we could see ETH breaking past the $3,000 level in the next couple of days. The first stop could be around $3,050 for a confirmed trend reversal, followed by a strong push to $3,400. This implies a 15% upside potential based on where ETH is trading today. As cryptocurrencies seem ready to make a comeback, the most promising crypto presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) could outperform well-established tokens. This mine-to-earn (M2E) project makes crypto mining hassle-free, fun, and highly rewarding.

One trader favors a bearish Ethena price prediction as the token has dropped below a key weekly support. Since August 2024, data from DeFi Llama shows that the protocol’s earnings have been steadily declining, moving from $4 million back then to just $50,000 in November as mint fees have declined sharply. Ethena’s USDe circulating supply has suffered a strong setback, declining from a peak of $15 billion in mid-October to just $6.7 billion at the time of writing. It seems that, during times of market turmoil, investors prefer to rely on well-established names in the stablecoin space like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Hence, this protocol could be suffering the consequences of a flight-to-safety move. Crypto analyst ChiefraT shared an interesting chart that shows a bearish breakout below Ethena’s long-standing weekly support. $ENA is testing All Time Lows on the weekly chart. Close below this and downside price discovery begins! pic.twitter.com/dzwnhRYgaU — ChiefraT (@ChiefraFba) December 18, 2025 This worsens the token’s situation, as the market could be ready to dump the token to discover how low the price needs to go for buyers to show up. Ethena Price Prediction: ENA Faces 50% Correction After Losing Key Support Trading volumes for ENA have increased by 33% in the past 24 hours and currently account for 20% of the token’s circulating market cap as the price struggles to stay above the $0.20 level. The $0.18 area is the key support to watch for ENA as the token will hit the lower bound of its descending price channel if it touches that threshold. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains heavily depressed at 32, indicating that negative momentum has accelerated. Meanwhile, if the selling spree continues and ENA is pushed down to break below this trend line support, nothing would prevent a much stronger correction to $0.10. This means a total downside risk of 50% for the token in the near term. Although ENA’s outlook is quite bearish, top crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) continue to capture investors’ attention as this type of project can deliver the highest upside potential once cryptos start to recover. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Brings Meme Energy to the Trading World Maxi Doge ($MAXI) rallies traders together under a well-known flag – the viral Doge meme. This Ethereum meme coin embodies the spirit of bull markets and the energy that retail traders bring to the table with its “up only” motto.

56039323,646876,1766149246,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56039323.jpeg,Crypto Market Structure Bill Update: January Markup Confirmed By White House Crypto Czar,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-market-structure-bill-update-january-markup/,"According to David Sacks, the White House’s artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto Czar, the long-awaited crypto market structure bill, the CLARITY Act, which aims to define how regulatory bodies will oversee cryptocurrency markets, is reportedly closer to passing. Markups For Crypto Market Structure Bill Set For January In a recent post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Sacks shared insights from a fresh meeting with Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, indicating that a markup for the CLARITY Act is slated for January. The CLARITY Act is designed with a core framework that classifies digital assets into three categories: digital commodities, overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); investment contract assets, regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); and permitted stablecoins . This structure aims to establish distinct regulatory roles for the CFTC and SEC, require registration for cryptocurrency exchanges, define Qualified Digital Asset Custodians (QDACs) with strict key management protocols, and introduce anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) rules. However, the bill has faced delays over recent months, primarily due to an extended US government shutdown and ongoing negotiations between Democratic and Republican lawmakers. As recent reports by Bitcoinist have indicated, Democrats are advocating for additional time to discuss various crucial issues, including market integrity, financial stability, and ethical considerations surrounding President Trump’s family’s business dealings in the crypto space. Despite these hurdles, a spokesperson for Chair Scott emphasized the significant progress made by the Senate Banking Committee in creating a robust regulatory framework. Meanwhile, the crypto industry is also striving to address concerns regarding the recently passed GENIUS Act, which includes provisions that could exert further limits on stablecoins. Contention Grows Over GENIUS Act A letter led by the Blockchain Association, signed by over 125 industry players, criticized attempts to reinterpret and expand the existing prohibition on interest linked to stablecoins within the GENIUS Act. Signed into law by President Trump in July, the GENIUS Act aims to establish a regulatory framework for dollar-backed digital tokens, which are widely known as stablecoins. The act contains a provision that prevents stablecoin issuers from offering “any form of interest or yield.” This aspect has ignited a contentious debate between the crypto and banking sectors regarding the extent of the interest prohibition and whether adjustments are necessary. Banking representatives argue that the prohibition on interest should extend to other entities that provide rewards to stablecoin holders, labeling any attempt to exclude them a “loophole” that contradicts the law’s original intent. They also lobbying Congress to revise the GENIUS provisions as part of the crypto market structure bill.

After months of compressed price action and rising uncertainty, traders are facing a moment where fear and opportunity may collide. Historically, such phases rarely resolve quietly. Instead, they tend to produce sharp moves designed to test conviction before the true trend reveals itself. For XRP, the next structural shift could be decisive. Amid this tension, prominent market analyst XForceGlobal has issued a cautionary outlook, warning that XRP may be on the verge of one of the largest fakeouts in its history if a specific technical structure fully develops. His assessment has intensified discussion among traders attempting to separate temporary breakdowns from genuine trend reversals. $XRP This is going to be one of the biggest fakeouts in the history for #XRP if the Expanded Flat plays out. Wave C will break market structure that will lead to panic, then to insane new ATH's. This is basically the final straw for #XRP , or it risks a multi-year bear market. https://t.co/8sS4qbSmZ2 pic.twitter.com/KDIZqEWxLC — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) December 19, 2025 The Expanded Flat Structure XForceGlobal’s analysis centers on an Expanded Flat correction, a complex Elliott Wave pattern known for its deceptive nature. Unlike simple pullbacks, this structure is designed to mislead market participants by creating a convincing breakdown before reversing aggressively. Expanded Flats often appear late in corrective phases, when patience is thin and sentiment is fragile. Within this pattern, Wave C plays the most critical role. It is typically sharp, emotional, and destructive to market confidence. Price action during this phase often violates well-established support zones, breaks visible market structure, and convinces traders that a larger bearish trend has begun. Why Wave C Triggers Panic Wave C is where fear dominates decision-making. As price falls below key levels, stop losses are triggered, leverage unwinds, and late sellers rush to exit positions. This cascade creates the impression that the market has fundamentally failed. According to XForceGlobal, this is precisely the environment where fakeouts become most effective, forcing weak hands out before a major reversal. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In XRP’s case, such a move would likely be interpreted as the final confirmation of bearish control. Yet, in Expanded Flat formations, this is often the last phase of downside before a powerful bullish expansion begins. From Breakdown to Potential New Highs If XRP completes Wave C and successfully reclaims broken structure, the shift could be dramatic. Historically, reversals following Expanded Flat corrections tend to be impulsive, marked by strong volume, renewed momentum, and rapid price appreciation. For XRP, this would open the door to a sustained rally that could challenge or surpass previous all-time highs. This transition is not guaranteed, but the technical framework suggests that panic may precede expansion. The key lies in how the market responds after the selloff exhausts itself. A Make-or-Break Moment for XRP XForceGlobal stresses that this phase represents a final test. If XRP fails to recover structure after a Wave C-driven decline, the implications could be severe. A confirmed breakdown without swift recovery would increase the likelihood of a prolonged, multi-year bear market, undermining bullish narratives and suppressing investor confidence. On the other hand, a successful fakeout would validate long-term accumulation and reinforce XRP’s resilience. As the market stands now, XRP is not simply reacting to price levels; it is confronting a defining moment that will shape its future path.

The company plans to deploy up to $100 million into Solana’s native token, SOL, through a newly established Digital Asset Treasury. This decision marks a significant pivot for a traditional healthcare company and signals deepening confidence in blockchain technology’s financial infrastructure. Why Is This SOL Investment a Major Signal for Crypto Markets? Mangoceuticals isn’t just dipping a toe in the water; it’s making a strategic, nine-figure commitment. The creation of a dedicated subsidiary, Mango DAT (Digital Asset Treasury), formalizes this SOL investment as a core part of its corporate strategy. To manage this substantial treasury, the company has partnered with Cube Group, led by a former Solana core developer, ensuring expert custody and strategic asset management. This move demonstrates that serious institutional players are now looking beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, seeking growth and utility in high-performance layer-1 networks like Solana. Beyond the SOL Investment: A Multi-Pronged Digital Asset Strategy Mangoceuticals’ vision extends far beyond a simple token purchase. The company’s SOL investment is the cornerstone of a broader digital transformation plan. Their strategy includes several key initiatives designed to generate value and integrate blockchain across operations: Tokenization of Real World Assets (RWAs): Exploring how to represent physical assets, like intellectual property or equipment, on the blockchain. Staking and Node Operations: Actively participating in the Solana network to earn rewards and support its security and decentralization. Stablecoin Adoption: Implementing stablecoins for corporate payments and settlements to increase efficiency and reduce transaction costs. This holistic approach shows a deep understanding of how to leverage crypto assets for both treasury growth and operational improvement. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Adoption? The announcement is a powerful validation for the entire cryptocurrency sector. When a publicly-traded company on a major exchange like Nasdaq makes such a definitive SOL investment , it sends a clear message to other corporations. It demonstrates that digital assets are being viewed not as speculative gambles, but as legitimate components of a modern corporate treasury and growth strategy. This could pave the way for more traditional firms to follow suit, bringing significant new capital and credibility into the ecosystem. Navigating the Challenges of a Corporate SOL Investment While the opportunity is immense, this strategic SOL investment does not come without its hurdles. Mangoceuticals must navigate a complex landscape of regulatory uncertainty, market volatility inherent to cryptocurrencies, and the technical complexities of secure asset custody. Their partnership with an experienced firm like Cube Group is a crucial step in mitigating these risks. Furthermore, they will need to maintain transparent communication with shareholders about the performance and rationale behind this digital asset allocation. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Solana and Crypto Mangoceuticals’ planned $100 million SOL investment is more than just a headline; it’s a watershed moment. It represents a maturation point where sophisticated institutional capital is strategically allocating to specific blockchain ecosystems based on their utility and potential. This move validates Solana’s technology and could accelerate the trend of tokenizing real-world assets and integrating crypto into traditional business finance. The future of corporate treasury management is being rewritten, one digital asset at a time. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is Mangoceuticals investing in? A1: Mangoceuticals is primarily investing in SOL, the native cryptocurrency of the Solana blockchain, with plans to allocate up to $100 million through its new Digital Asset Treasury subsidiary. Q2: Why did a healthcare company decide to invest in Solana? A2: The company is likely diversifying its corporate treasury and seeking growth opportunities in the digital asset space, viewing blockchain technology and high-performance networks like Solana as a strategic financial frontier.

The analytics and chart platform has noted that while Bitcoin is still one of the world’s most traded digital assets, its momentum is waning, and accumulation rates from retailers and institutions pattern shift have dropped to 12-month lows. Institutional demand contracts amid ETF sell-offs The Bitcoin institutional players who were more than welcoming to the Donald Trump administration at the start of the year have made the end of 2025 a crypto investment ghost town. Bitcoin’s demand boom is fading. This cycle ran on three spot demand waves, and the latest one looks like it’s rolling over. Since early October, demand is below trend, which can stay bearish for price. pic.twitter.com/7IWnRscD8H — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 19, 2025 According to CryptoQuant’s analysis , US spot Bitcoin ETFs in the fourth quarter of 2025 shifted from net buyers to net sellers, shedding approximately 24,000 BTC. The addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, which are mostly ETFs and treasury companies , have been expanding at below-trend rates. CryptoQuant’s analysts believe these conditions are very similar to the end of 2021 when it clocked an all-time high of $69K in November, then fell to almost half its price in January 2022 bear market. Bitcoin ETFs attracted net inflows of $457 million on Thursday, the third-largest single-day inflow since early October. Previous peaks were recorded on November 11 and October 21, with inflows of $523.98 million and $477.19 million, respectively, according to SoSoValue data. However, the month of December had witnessed redemptions of $100 million from these vehicles before the Thursday overhaul. If inflows do not accelerate in the second half of the month, we might be in for another “dark November” that featured $3.7 billion outflows. Derivative markets spell reduced risk appetite CryptoQuant noted that declining funding rates could indicate a reduced willingness among traders to hold onto their long positions, which typically occurs during bear market cycles. Coinglass says that Bitcoin and Ether’s volatility smiles are skewed toward out-of-the-money put options at all tenors. This shows that traders still want protection against losses. Short-dated volatility may have eased from earlier extremes that pulled BTC down to $80,000. However, the overall price movement is more bearish than bullish, which could mean the market is not expecting a positive run heading into 2026. Analyst IT Tech wrote that short-term holders of Bitcoin are sitting on average losses of -14.9%, with the crypto currently trading at $86,700 while their average cost basis is around $101,800. This, per the market watcher, has created a “pain zone,” where attempts by the market to rebound toward $101,000 could cause panic selling and profit taking. Bitcoin’s price has also fallen below its 365-day moving average, the long-term technical support that distinguishes bull from bear markets. And as several chartists on X have insinuated, demand cycles drive Bitcoin’s four-year market behavior more than halving events do. Despite these signals, historical bear market bottoms for Bitcoin appear on the heels of the king coin’s realized price, currently near $56,000 and 55% from recent all-time highs. The crypto’s intermediate support is currently around $70,000, but if BTC drops below that threshold, investors might as well wait for a $50,000 flash alert. The crypto market has declined about 13% year-to-date, with Bitcoin down 10% over the same period. The total market capitalization has dipped below $3 trillion, its lowest point since April. Still, some crypto enthusiasts are urging the community not to forget the years of exceptional growth the market has experienced. “I get that this year is a drag, but consider Bitcoin was up 468% in the two years prior. That’s an annual return of 138%, eight times more than US stocks. It’s like your ice cream sundae now has 55 cherries instead of 60. You’re fine!” argued Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

The Bitcoin weekly RSI, a key momentum indicator, has just plunged to its lowest level since January 2023. This dramatic drop signals a market under intense pressure and presents a pivotal moment for anyone invested in the crypto space. But what does this technical signal truly mean for the future price of BTC? Let’s break down the data and explore the potential paths forward. What Does the Bitcoin Weekly RSI Tell Us? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures the speed and change of price movements on a scale from 0 to 100. Analysts consider a reading below 30 to indicate an “oversold” asset, potentially primed for a bounce. According to a Cointelegraph analysis of Bitstamp data, the Bitcoin weekly RSI has now fallen to 35. This is the weakest reading in over a year, matching levels last seen when Bitcoin traded between $15,500 and $17,000. This suggests the current sell-off has created a condition of extreme weakness on a longer-term timeframe. Is This a Signal to Buy or a Warning Sign? The market is at a crossroads, and analysts are divided on the interpretation. On one hand, such a low Bitcoin weekly RSI has historically preceded significant price rallies. The logic is simple: when an asset becomes extremely oversold, the selling pressure often exhausts itself, creating a foundation for a reversal. Cointelegraph’s analysis supports this view, noting that other metrics like the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio also suggest Bitcoin may be undervalued. However, this signal is not a guaranteed buy ticket. Prominent crypto analyst Jelle highlights the duality of the situation. This level could indicate the market is either: Approaching a solid bottom , setting the stage for a recovery. On the verge of a larger decline , where oversold conditions can persist in a strong bear trend. Therefore, this is a pivotal moment requiring careful observation rather than impulsive action. How Should Traders Navigate This Pivotal Moment? Navigating this extreme Bitcoin weekly RSI reading requires a balanced strategy. First, understand that weekly data reflects longer-term sentiment, so a reversal may not be immediate. Traders should watch for confirmation from other indicators and price action itself. Look for a stabilization in price and a potential bullish divergence on the RSI, where price makes a new low but the RSI forms a higher low. Key actionable insights include: Do not FOMO buy based solely on this one metric. Monitor higher timeframe support levels for signs of holding. Consider dollar-cost averaging if you believe in the long-term thesis, as prices may be in a value zone. Manage risk aggressively ; an oversold market can remain oversold. The Bottom Line on Bitcoin’s Oversold Signal The plunge in the Bitcoin weekly RSI to a multi-year low is undeniably significant. It acts as a clear warning siren that selling momentum has reached an extreme, often a precursor to a trend change. While history favors the bulls in such oversold scenarios, the current market structure demands respect and patience. This is not a time for certainty, but for heightened awareness. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether this low RSI marks a capitulation bottom or just another step in a deeper correction. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Bitcoin weekly RSI? A1: The Bitcoin weekly RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of Bitcoin’s price changes over a weekly timeframe. It helps identify overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) conditions. Q2: Why is a low weekly RSI significant? A2: A low weekly RSI, like the current 35 reading, suggests the asset is oversold on a longer-term basis. This can indicate that selling pressure is exhausting itself and may precede a potential price reversal or rally, though it is not a guaranteed signal. Q3: Does a low RSI always mean the price will go up? A3: No. While a low RSI often precedes a bounce, an asset can remain in an oversold state during a strong downtrend. It is a warning of extreme conditions, not an automatic buy signal. Confirmation from price action is essential. Q4: How does this RSI reading compare to past Bitcoin cycles? A4: The current level of 35 was last seen in January 2023, when Bitcoin was trading significantly lower. Historically, similar or lower readings on the weekly RSI have coincided with major market bottoms, but each cycle has unique drivers. Q5: What other indicators should I watch alongside the RSI? A5> Traders often combine RSI analysis with other tools like moving averages for trend direction, trading volume to confirm moves, on-chain metrics like the NVT ratio for valuation, and key support/resistance levels on the price chart. Q6: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A6> The low RSI suggests Bitcoin may be in a potential buying zone for long-term investors, but it carries high risk. It is crucial to have a clear risk management strategy, consider dollar-cost averaging, and only invest capital you can afford to lose.

With the mining competition gradually getting tougher, profit margins shrinking, and institutional operations becoming the trend, the kind of tools miners require goes beyond just a “block-producing tool,” they want a one-stop ecosystem that remakes the mining, manages the assets, and provides financial services. This is why FleetMining has made the change from a conventional mining pool to a full-fledged cloud mining service platform. Beyond Hashrate An Integrated Mining Ecosystem Is Emerging Mining landscape of today has significantly changed compared to the past. The profitability of a miner is no longer solely dependent on the hashrate and cost of electricity, but actually on: • How efficient capital turnover is • How well assets are allocated • What risk hedging tools are available • Whether there are tools to respond quickly to market volatility The result of this is mining platforms changing their shapes into vertically integrated ecosystems whereby miners are able to get their work done within a single platform: Mining → Income receipt → Asset management → Conversion and allocation → Reinvestment FleetMining operates on this principle and therefore has designed a system that encompasses the whole lifecycle of cloud mining activities. Built-In Secure Accounts: Earn and Manage Instantly FleetMining ecosystem’s most important element is its internal secure wallet system. Mining rewards are paid directly into users’ accounts on the platform, thus there is no need to frequently move the funds to other wallets or exchanges. Three main benefits are brought by this: • Lack of dependence on external transfers which lowers the operational and counterparty risk • More rapid settling of funds which, in turn, leads to increased turnover efficiency • A unified account system that makes tracking and management easier Whether for house mining or large-scale institutional-backed mining, one can manage their assets on a security-focused platform thereby significantly lowering the level of operational friction. Automatic Token Conversion: More Flexible Rewards Genuine miner’s goal is going to be to keep the coins, but the fact is what they get are the rewards which reflect the work of mining. Some will certainly need to use their mining rewards for electricity bills, others may want to dedicate the majority of their portfolios to the long term, and then again there are those who will want to hedge short-term price fluctuations. Instead of manually exchanging, FleetMining miners will have an option of readily converting mining tokens to any one of the other mainstream crypto assets thereby, the miners will benefit in the following ways: • Automatic hedging against price fluctuations • Matching operational and financial needs • Reducing the cost of switching across multiple platforms Rewards are not just mined — they can be instantly allocated and reused. The Real Value of a Unified Platform: Convenience × Security × Growth FleetMining is not only simple and transparent, but also highly integrated: • Convenience: one account for mining, wallet, exchange, and contracts • Security: fewer paths for asset transfer and stronger risk control • Growth: tools for reinvestment and scaling In an industry where competition is fierce and efficiency determines survival, such unified platforms are becoming miners’ infrastructure. How to Register on FleetMining: Quick Start for Beginners FleetMining’s design philosophy includes making mining ecosystem accessible to more people. So, they have kept the simple registration process: 1. Visit the official FleetMining registration page 2. Use your email address and create an account 3. Following a successful registration, the system automatically credits a $15–$100 bonus 4. Log in to the dashboard to access the mining control panel 5. Choose a contract and start mining You don’t need to do complex configurations, the whole thing can be done within a couple of minutes. Contract Participation Model: Hashrate as a Service To allow more users to participate without building their own mining rigs, FleetMining offers a hashrate contract model: users would buy hashrate contracts while the platform would supply the computing power and generate rewards automatically. Example contracts (based on common models): Ø 15$ contract, 1-day period → Daily earning $0.6 You can participate once a day ( free plan, start at zero cost ). Ø 100$ contract, 2-day cycle → Total return $106 Ø 1,200$ contract, 10-day cycle → Total return $1,362 Ø 6,000$ contract, 20-day cycle → Total return $7,920 Ø 30,000$ contract, 45-day cycle → Total return $54,300 Users only need to select a contract and confirm participation. The system performs the processes automatically and daily orders earnings by settlements. Such a model helps change mining from heavy-asset operations that require capitalization to a lightweight and digitally repeatable financial instrument. The Future of Mining Pools: From Output to Financial Infrastructure With the mining industry gradually moving towards maturity,the competitive focus among pools is shifting as well. Nowadays, long-term value platforms are not those only characterized by the largest hashrate andlowest fees but by the offer of: • Comprehensive asset management capabilities • Flexible financial tools • Stable and secure one-stop infrastructure FleetMining’s changeover from a conventional mining pool to a fully integrated cloud mining ecosystem is a testament to this trend. At this new stage, miners are no longer just “coin producers,” but participants who can manage, allocate, and amplify the value of digital assets. Operating in the market environment is a complicated matter. However, ifminers get the chance to evolve, this in itself can be the most rewarding ‍‌outcome.

In the past few months, various forms of revenue sharing accelerated. DeFi protocols had one of their strongest years, bringing peak fees for some of the protocols. The big shift in 2025 is that more DeFi platforms introduced forms of revenue sharing. As token prices stagnated, revenue sharing turned into an incentive for users to continue adopting new protocols. The shift started with Hyperliquid , later putting pressure on other protocols to distribute fees. Widely used hubs like Pump.fun and Uniswap also moved toward revenue sharing. The apps were also pressured for their perceived extraction, without returning value to the crypto space. DeFi protocols distributed 15% of fees A growing share of DeFi revenues flowed back to token holders. Protocols removed previous forms of inflationary rewards, instead moving to buybacks , token burns, and other forms of value distribution. Fees were a game-changer in DeFi, showing blockchains could generate real revenues. The distribution did not come from new token minting, as in previous profit-sharing tools. Only around 5% of protocol fees were distributed to holders before 2025. In the past year, the amount tripled to 15%, according to the DeFi Llama report on the industry. Token holders could receive forms of revenue sharing, treasury yield, or general support from buybacks and burns. Not all buybacks had the same effect, as some tokens remained stagnant. The trend has also reached major protocols like Aave, holding 60% of DeFi deposits, as well as the Uniswap DEX . More protocols resemble traditional financial markets and aim to bring intrinsic value to their tokens. DEX and perp trading boosted fee sharing Fee sharing came from many different decentralized protocols, but trading venues were the biggest producers. Decentralized markets and perpetual futures DEXs became more competitive in 2025, increasing fee capture. Some of the protocols managed to become sustainably profitable, despite the slide in their token price. The ability to become profitable meant DeFi protocols had more space to explore incentive models and new products. As some networks scaled and offered lower costs, the revenue model no longer depended on token valuations. With low transaction fees, apps could afford to ask for fees in exchange for their services and access to liquidity. The sliding gas fees on Ethereum and its L2 chains and the low fees on Solana encouraged DeFi innovation and brought more users to the space. As of December 2025, Hyperliquid produces the highest holder revenues. For the past month, the platform distributed over $74M to holders. Hyperliquid peaked with $9.8M in daily distributions on October 10 . Hyperliquid was among the leaders for holder revenue, based on its peak performance as a trading hub in 2025. | Source: DeFi Llama In 2025, the barrier to entering DeFi is no longer about the availability of infrastructure. Any project could build apps for yield, staking, liquid staking, or trading. However, some of the biggest protocols established themselves as leaders, securing the biggest share of users and the highest revenues. As a result, communities could also pressure protocols into sharing some of their fees.

A critical market signal just flashed red, with the premium widening to a concerning -$57. This development reveals weakening appetite from a key player: U.S. institutional investors. Understanding this metric is crucial for anyone tracking Bitcoin’s true momentum. What Exactly is the Coinbase Negative Premium? The Coinbase negative premium is a simple but powerful gauge. It measures the price difference for Bitcoin between the U.S.-based Coinbase exchange and major global platforms like Binance. When this number turns negative, it means BTC is trading at a discount on Coinbase. This typically signals that selling pressure from U.S. entities outweighs buying pressure. The recent plunge to -$57, as reported by CryptoQuant, is a significant move that demands our attention. Why is U.S. Institutional Demand Weakening Now? This widening Coinbase negative premium doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Analysts point to a perfect storm of factors driving institutional money to the sidelines. Let’s break down the key reasons: Year-End Portfolio Management: Institutions often rebalance and de-risk their holdings as the fiscal year closes. Profit-Taking Activity: After periods of gains, large players secure profits, creating sell-side pressure. Tax-Loss Harvesting and Selling: Strategic selling for tax purposes can increase market supply. Spot BTC ETF Outflows: Recent net outflows from these popular funds directly reduce institutional buying power. This combination suggests institutions are currently in an exit phase, preferring liquidity over exposure. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Price Trajectory? The implications of a sustained Coinbase negative premium are clear for Bitcoin’s near-term path. The analysis concludes that upward momentum will likely remain limited until this premium returns to positive territory. Essentially, the market lacks a major engine for growth without strong, consistent institutional buying from the United States. While retail sentiment or international demand can provide support, a true bullish breakout often requires institutional conviction, which this metric shows is currently absent. How Can Traders and Investors Use This Insight? This isn’t just a data point; it’s an actionable signal. The widening Coinbase negative premium serves as a caution flag. For traders, it suggests adopting a more defensive stance or waiting for the premium to stabilize before expecting significant rallies. For long-term investors, it highlights the importance of monitoring institutional flows alongside other fundamentals. Remember, this metric is one piece of the puzzle, but a vital one for gauging professional market sentiment. The Bottom Line on the Current Market Signal The message from the -$57 Coinbase negative premium is unambiguous: institutional demand is weak. This creates a headwind for Bitcoin’s price. However, markets are cyclical. Monitoring when this premium narrows or turns positive will be the first sign of institutional money returning. Until then, the market narrative is one of caution and consolidation, driven by a key group stepping back. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Coinbase Premium? The Coinbase Premium is the price difference for a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, between the Coinbase Pro exchange (favored by U.S. institutions) and other major global exchanges. A negative premium means it’s cheaper on Coinbase. Why does a negative premium suggest weak institutional demand? Coinbase is a primary gateway for U.S. institutional investors. When Bitcoin trades at a discount there, it indicates higher selling pressure from these large players compared to buyers, signaling reduced demand. Is a negative premium always bad for Bitcoin’s price? While it often acts as a near-term headwind, it’s not a permanent predictor. It reflects current sentiment. A return to a positive premium is typically needed for sustained upward momentum driven by institutional inflows. How often does this premium data update? The premium is calculated in real-time based on live order book data from exchanges. Analytics platforms like CryptoQuant track and report it continuously. Can retail buying overcome weak institutional demand? Retail buying can provide support, but institutional capital volumes are typically much larger. Strong, sustained rallies often require participation from both groups. Where can I track the Coinbase Premium myself? You can monitor this metric on cryptocurrency data analytics websites such as CryptoQuant, which provide charts and analysis of the exchange premium.

This monumental fundraising effort comes as the AI pioneer faces intensifying competition from rivals like Anthropic and Google while grappling with soaring computational costs and supply chain constraints. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts watching the intersection of technology and finance, this development signals how AI companies are becoming the new tech giants, potentially influencing investment flows and market dynamics across the broader technology sector. OpenAI’s Massive Fundraising Push According to reports from the Wall Street Journal and The Information, OpenAI is in advanced talks to secure up to $100 billion in new funding by the end of the first quarter next year. The company is reportedly courting sovereign wealth funds and major technology investors for what could become one of the largest private funding rounds in history. This comes as OpenAI’s valuation has skyrocketed from approximately $500 billion in recent secondary transactions to a potential $830 billion mark. The company currently holds over $64 billion in its coffers according to PitchBook data, but this new injection would dramatically expand its war chest. ChatGPT Maker’s Ambitious Expansion Plans The ChatGPT creator isn’t just raising funds for operational expenses. OpenAI has committed to spending trillions of dollars on AI development and has been striking deals globally to maintain its leadership position. The company’s compute costs have reportedly grown beyond what partnerships and cloud credits can subsidize, particularly for inferencing operations. This massive fundraising would help OpenAI: Accelerate development of new AI models Expand its presence in developer and tooling ecosystems Secure necessary computing resources amid chip shortages Fund global expansion and partnership initiatives AI Competition Intensifies with Anthropic and Google The urgency behind OpenAI’s fundraising becomes clearer when examining the competitive landscape. Rivals like Anthropic and Google are making significant strides in AI development, forcing OpenAI to accelerate its innovation timeline. The company has had to “step on the gas” to release new models and maintain its technological edge. This competitive pressure comes at a time when broader market sentiment around AI has cooled somewhat, with investors questioning whether the current pace of debt-fueled investment by tech giants can be sustained long-term. Company Recent Valuation Key Products Competitive Position OpenAI $500B-$830B (projected) ChatGPT, GPT models, API services Market leader, seeking massive funding Anthropic $15B-$30B range Claude AI, Constitutional AI Strong competitor with different approach Google $1.8T market cap Gemini, DeepMind, Cloud AI Massive resources, integrated ecosystem Valuation Concerns and Market Realities The proposed $830 billion valuation raises important questions about market fundamentals. While OpenAI reportedly generates about $20 billion in annual run-rate revenue, this valuation represents a significant multiple that reflects both optimism about AI’s future and concerns about sustainability. Several factors complicate the picture: Memory chip shortages constraining AI hardware production Growing compute costs outpacing credit subsidies Investor skepticism about debt-fueled AI investment cycles Regulatory uncertainties in major markets Strategic Partnerships and Future Directions Beyond the immediate fundraising, OpenAI is exploring multiple strategic avenues. Rumors suggest the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would provide access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips. There are also persistent whispers about a potential IPO that could raise tens of billions more for development efforts. These moves indicate that OpenAI is building a multi-pronged strategy to secure both capital and technological advantages in the AI race. FAQs About OpenAI’s Fundraising What is OpenAI’s current valuation? OpenAI was most recently valued at about $500 billion in secondary transactions, but the new funding round could value the company at up to $830 billion. Who are OpenAI’s main competitors? OpenAI faces significant competition from Anthropic (creator of Claude AI) and Google (with its Gemini AI and DeepMind technologies). What is OpenAI’s annual revenue? The company is reportedly generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion from its various AI products and services. Are there rumors about OpenAI working with Amazon? Yes, there are rumors that OpenAI is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give OpenAI access to Amazon’s new AI computing chips. What challenges does OpenAI face? The company faces intensifying competition, soaring compute costs, memory chip shortages, and questions about whether current investment levels in AI can be sustained. OpenAI’s pursuit of $100 billion at an $830 billion valuation represents a pivotal moment in the AI industry’s evolution.

The token is now live and listed on BitMart and BingX , expanding global access to the GrantiX ecosystem. $GRANT serves as the utility and governance token for GrantiX, which connects blockchain donors with verified social entrepreneurs through an audited platform. The TGE follows successful IDOs on Finceptor and Spores Network, alongside additional offerings on Red Kite and Huostarter. “$GRANT is not a speculative launch, it is the activation of an ecosystem that is already operating, audited, and delivering measurable impact,” said Dr. Konstantin Livshits, founder of GrantiX. “This milestone aligns our community around a shared mission to make impact investing transparent, efficient, and scalable.” Built on Arbitrum and designed to be multi-chain, GrantiX integrates directly into high-volume DeFi protocols, enabling optional micro-donations to be embedded into everyday transactions. Alongside with real-world revenue streams, a single Web3 partner processing more than 100 million transactions per week can route user opt-in donations to verified impact projects, with GrantiX earning a 2% fee for distribution, verification, and on-chain transparency. Even modest participation at this scale creates recurring, sustainable effect. The global impact economy represents a $1.57 trillion market that remains largely offline and opaque. As financial activity increasingly moves on-chain, GrantiX aims to bring this capital into Web3 by embedding impact directly into transactions, turning donations into programmable infrastructure rather than a separate product. Since launching its MVP, GrantiX has processed more than 20,000 donations totaling over $250,000, distributed more than $80,000 in grants to verified social entrepreneurs, and onboarded more than 18,000 users organically. The project has raised more than $1.75m in angel funding and public rounds, and all smart contracts have been audited by CertiK ahead of the mainnet rollout. “The demand we saw across our IDOs reflects growing interest in Web3 projects with real-world utility and sustainable economics, rather than hype-driven meme coins” said Anton Yanushkevich, CEO of GrantiX. “By combining AI-driven evaluation with on-chain transparency, we are building an impact layer for Web3 where doing good is embedded directly into financial infrastructure – we believe, that the future of impact is on-chain.” $GRANT is now live. Users can join the launch by trading $GRANT on BingX and BitMart and become part of the on-chain impact economy: BingX: https://bingx.com/en/spot/GRANTUSDT BitMart: https://www.bitmart.com/trade/GRANT_USDT About GrantiX GrantiX is a sustainable, multi-chain impact platform connecting donors, social entrepreneurs, and investors on-chain.

This comes as the BTC price continues to trade below the psychological $90,000 level following its crash, which began last month. Here’s The Amount Of Bitcoin Supply At A Loss In a report, Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin supply in loss has risen to 6.7 million BTC, marking the highest level of loss-bearing supply observed in this cycle. The analytics platform further noted that this represents 23.7% of the circulating supply, which is currently underwater. 10.2% of this supply is held by long-term holders and 13.5% by short-term holders. Related Reading: The Bearish Structure That Puts Bitcoin Price At $92,550, And Then $82,000 Glassnode stated that this distribution suggests that, much like in prior cycle transitions into deeper bearish regimes, the loss-bearing Bitcoin supply accumulated by recent buyers is gradually maturing into the long-term cohort. Meanwhile, the analytics platform noted that the 6-7 million range, which has been at a loss since mid-November, mirrors early transitional phases of prior cycles, where mounting investor frustration came before a shift toward more bearish conditions and intensified capitulation at lower Bitcoin prices. Notably, the Bitcoin price has dropped to levels last seen in 2024, erasing its year-to-date (YTD) gains. Glassnode stated that this has left behind a dense supply cluster accumulated by top buyers in the $93,000 to $120,000 range. The resulting supply distribution is said to reflect a top-heavy market structure where recovery attempts are capped by heavy overhead sell pressure, especially in the early stages of a bearish phase. Glassnode declared that as long as the Bitcoin price remains below this range and fails to reclaim key thresholds, most notably the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis at $101,500, the risk of further corrective downside persists. BTC Spot Demand Is Unstable Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin spot market flows continue to reflect an uneven demand profile across major venues. The Cumulative Volume Delta bias is said to show periodic bursts of buy-side activity, but has failed to develop into sustained accumulation, especially during the recent BTC price pullbacks. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Down Today? BlackRock Deposits Spark Worry The on-chain analytics platform noted that the Coinbase spot CVD remains relatively constructive, indicating steadier participation from US-based investors. On the other hand, Binance and aggregate Bitcoin flows remain choppy and largely directionless. Glassnode stated that these dispersion points point to selective engagement rather than coordinated spot demand. Meanwhile, the platform alluded to recent Bitcoin price declines, which it pointed out have not triggered decisive expansion in positive CVD. Glassnode noted that this suggests dip-buying remains tactical and short-term. In the absence of sustained accumulation across all venues, Bitcoin’s price action continues to rely more on activity in the derivatives market and liquidity conditions rather than organic spot demand. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $86,800, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The token is now live and listed on BitMart and BingX , expanding global access to the GrantiX ecosystem. $GRANT serves as the utility and governance token for GrantiX, which connects blockchain donors with verified social entrepreneurs through an audited platform. The TGE follows successful IDOs on Finceptor and Spores Network, alongside additional offerings on Red Kite and Huostarter. “$GRANT is not a speculative launch, it is the activation of an ecosystem that is already operating, audited, and delivering measurable impact,” said Dr. Konstantin Livshits, founder of GrantiX. “This milestone aligns our community around a shared mission to make impact investing transparent, efficient, and scalable.” Built on Arbitrum and designed to be multi-chain, GrantiX integrates directly into high-volume DeFi protocols, enabling optional micro-donations to be embedded into everyday transactions. Alongside with real-world revenue streams, a single Web3 partner processing more than 100 million transactions per week can route user opt-in donations to verified impact projects, with GrantiX earning a 2% fee for distribution, verification, and on-chain transparency. Even modest participation at this scale creates recurring, sustainable effect. The global impact economy represents a $1.57 trillion market that remains largely offline and opaque. As financial activity increasingly moves on-chain, GrantiX aims to bring this capital into Web3 by embedding impact directly into transactions, turning donations into programmable infrastructure rather than a separate product. Since launching its MVP, GrantiX has processed more than 20,000 donations totaling over $250,000, distributed more than $80,000 in grants to verified social entrepreneurs, and onboarded more than 18,000 users organically. The project has raised more than $1.75m in angel funding and public rounds, and all smart contracts have been audited by CertiK ahead of the mainnet rollout. “The demand we saw across our IDOs reflects growing interest in Web3 projects with real-world utility and sustainable economics, rather than hype-driven meme coins” said Anton Yanushkevich, CEO of GrantiX. “By combining AI-driven evaluation with on-chain transparency, we are building an impact layer for Web3 where doing good is embedded directly into financial infrastructure – we believe, that the future of impact is on-chain.” $GRANT is now live. Users can join the launch by trading $GRANT on BingX and BitMart and become part of the on-chain impact economy: BingX: https://bingx.com/en/spot/GRANTUSDT BitMart: https://www.bitmart.com/trade/GRANT_USDT About GrantiX GrantiX is a sustainable, multi-chain impact platform connecting donors, social entrepreneurs, and investors on-chain.

Namely, the meme coin, known for its sensitivity to the controversial influencer’s activities, has gone up nearly 9% on the weekly chart, trading at 0.0166$ at the time of writing. Daily trading volumes are likewise climbing, sitting at ~$759,000, almost 5% in the green over the past 24 hours, likely due to hype surrounding the Misfits boxing match. DADDY weekly price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Daddy Tate crypto outperforms the market DADDY’s ongoing surge has allowed the token to significantly outperform the market, which is only now starting to see modest gains, rising 0.4% on the day. For further comparison, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is still down 4.7% on the week, while Ethereum ( ETH ) and XPR are experiencing an 8% slump. Adding to the hype, the influencer once again endorsed crypto in a post on X earlier today, claiming he can sell real estate “in a few days maximum for crypto” with no taxes to worry about. “I’ve doubled my money in 3 years on everything I’ve bought. I can sell a house in a few days maximum for crypto, zero taxes on profit or on rental income,” Tate wrote. Buy a house to live in wherever you want to live. But for an investment?

For instance, betters on Polymarket now give Tate 82% chance of winning, as do their peers on Kalshi . Should Tate emerge victorious, his followers might witness a DADDY rally amid all the excitement, while Chase DeMoor’s victory could reverse this week’s gain.

After weeks of consolidation and muted momentum, traders are increasingly divided between expectations of an imminent breakout and fears of another downside sweep. Historically, such uncertainty often precedes moves that catch the majority off guard, especially in markets where liquidity dynamics are not yet resolved. Against this backdrop, chartist BLOCK BULL has shared a detailed liquidity-based perspective on XRP, arguing that the market is not yet positioned for a sustainable advance. His analysis focuses on where liquidity truly resides and why current price levels may be structurally insufficient to support a lasting move higher. Liquidity, Not Direction, Is Driving Price BLOCK BULL’s central thesis is that XRP currently trades in a zone where liquidity is thin. In a technical market structure, liquidity refers to clusters of orders that allow large participants to transact efficiently. When price hovers away from these zones, it often becomes unstable, prone to sharp and seemingly irrational movements. There is no liquidity for $XRP until we're underneath Octobers Wick. 2024 consolidation range will be tested. WHY? Because all noob traders who take positions bring their stop losses up to their entry for ""a risk free trade"" Market makers do this deliberately cos 99% of… pic.twitter.com/1A0ux3n3Mn — BLOCK BULL (@TheBlockBull) December 18, 2025 Rather than following trend narratives or sentiment, price tends to gravitate toward areas where orders are concentrated. According to this view, XRP’s present range lacks the depth required for continuation, making a retracement toward lower liquidity pools increasingly probable. The Significance of October’s Wick A critical reference point in BLOCK BULL’s analysis is the October wick. Long wicks typically indicate aggressive price rejection, where a fast move leaves behind unfilled orders. These areas often remain relevant long after the initial reaction, acting as unfinished business for the market. BLOCK BULL argues that meaningful liquidity exists beneath this wick, and until price trades into that zone, XRP remains structurally incomplete. Revisiting it would allow the market to interact with resting orders that were previously skipped, restoring balance to the broader price structure. Why the 2024 Consolidation Range Matters Equally important is the 2024 consolidation range, a prolonged period where XRP moved sideways, and traders established significant positions. Such ranges naturally accumulate liquidity as entries, exits, and stop placements cluster over time. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From a technical standpoint, markets frequently revisit these zones to clear inefficiencies. BLOCK BULL suggests that this range has not yet been properly tested from above, making it a logical target if XRP seeks to rebalance before attempting a larger directional move. The Hidden Risk of “Risk-Free” Trades Trader psychology plays a central role in this setup. Many retail participants move stop losses to breakeven once a trade shows modest profit, believing they have eliminated downside risk. While emotionally reassuring, this behavior creates dense stop-loss clusters at predictable levels. These clusters represent accessible liquidity. Market makers, aware of this pattern, often drive prices into such zones to trigger stops, forcing exits, and redistributing positions. The result is a sharp move that feels manipulative but aligns with standard liquidity-seeking behavior. What This Means for XRP’s Near-Term Outlook The analysis does not suggest that XRP’s broader outlook is invalidated . Instead, it implies that the price may need to move lower before it can move higher with conviction. Until liquidity beneath October’s wick and within the 2024 consolidation range is addressed, XRP remains vulnerable to volatility-driven sweeps. As BLOCK BULL’s perspective underscores, markets prioritize structure over comfort. For XRP, patience and an understanding of liquidity dynamics may prove more valuable than anticipating an early breakout.

That future is now taking shape, as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) embarks on a groundbreaking collaboration with more than 30 global banks to build a revolutionary SWIFT blockchain system . This move signals a pivotal moment for traditional finance embracing distributed ledger technology. What Is the SWIFT Blockchain System Project? Thierry Chilosi, SWIFT’s Chief Business Officer, recently revealed the organization’s ambitious plan. The core initiative involves integrating a blockchain-based ledger into SWIFT’s existing, vast financial messaging network. This isn’t a standalone experiment; it’s a strategic upgrade designed in partnership with a consortium of major banking institutions. The goal is to enhance the speed, transparency, and security of the trillion-dollar cross-border payment ecosystem. This development follows SWIFT’s earlier work with blockchain firm ConsenSys, indicating a committed, phased approach to modernizing its infrastructure. The current phase focuses on finalizing the technical design of the ledger alongside its banking partners, ensuring the solution meets real-world operational needs. Why Is Collaboration the Key to Success? Chilosi emphasized a crucial point to Standard Chartered’s Michael Spiegel: collaboration is non-negotiable for achieving scale. The SWIFT blockchain system ’s value depends on widespread adoption. By involving over 30 banks from the outset, SWIFT is tackling the classic network effect challenge head-on. Shared Expertise: Banks provide practical insights into compliance, risk, and customer needs. Standardization: Joint development helps create universal protocols, preventing fragmentation. Trust and Governance: A consortium model builds collective trust in the new system’s rules and operations. This collaborative model starkly contrasts with closed, proprietary systems and may well be the formula that finally brings blockchain’s promise to mainstream global finance. What Are the Potential Benefits of This New System? The potential impact of a successful SWIFT blockchain system is monumental. For decades, cross-border payments have been plagued by high costs, slow settlement times (often days), and opaque tracking. A blockchain ledger could directly address these pain points. Key benefits include: Near-Instant Settlement: Transactions could settle in minutes or seconds, not days. Enhanced Transparency: All parties could track a payment’s status in real-time, similar to a package delivery. Reduced Costs: Automating reconciliation and reducing intermediary steps could lower fees significantly. Improved Security: The immutable nature of blockchain ledgers can reduce fraud and errors. What Challenges Lie Ahead? Despite the excitement, the path forward isn’t without hurdles. Integrating a novel blockchain system with legacy banking infrastructure is a complex technical endeavor. Regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions remains a formidable task. Moreover, achieving consensus among dozens of large, independent banks on every operational detail requires sustained diplomacy and shared vision. However, SWIFT’s unique position as a neutral, global cooperative gives it a significant advantage in navigating these challenges compared to any single corporate entity. A Transformative Step for Global Finance The announcement is more than a pilot project; it’s a powerful signal of institutional conviction. When over 30 of the world’s leading banks and the backbone of global financial messaging unite to build a SWIFT blockchain system , it validates the technology’s potential for core financial infrastructure. This move could accelerate the entire industry’s adoption of distributed ledger technology, paving the way for a more efficient and inclusive global financial network. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is SWIFT’s role in this new blockchain system? SWIFT is not replacing its network but enhancing it. It acts as the orchestrator and platform provider, integrating a new blockchain-based ledger into its existing infrastructure to facilitate faster, more transparent transactions between member banks. Which banks are involved in the collaboration? While a full public list isn’t provided, Thierry Chilosi confirmed the group includes over 30 global banks. Standard Chartered, whose Global Head was part of the discussion, is a known participant. The consortium likely features other major international banks that are key SWIFT users. How will this blockchain system benefit ordinary people? End-users could experience faster international money transfers, whether for business, remittances, or personal use. Lower transaction costs and real-time tracking would make cross-border payments more reliable and affordable. Is this related to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? Not directly. This project uses blockchain as a shared ledger technology for recording transactions between trusted, permissioned institutions (banks). It does not involve creating a new public cryptocurrency or using existing ones like Bitcoin for settlement. When will this new system go live? The project is currently in the design finalization phase. A specific public launch date has not been announced. Given the scale and complexity, industry observers expect a phased rollout over the coming years. Will this make traditional banking obsolete? No, it aims to make traditional banking more efficient. The SWIFT blockchain system is designed to upgrade the plumbing between banks, not replace the banks themselves. It strengthens the existing system by addressing its inefficiencies. Join the Conversation on the Future of Finance The move towards a SWIFT blockchain system is one of the most significant stories in modern finance. It represents the tangible convergence of traditional banking and cutting-edge technology. What are your thoughts on this development?

Recently, a wallet address linked to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin executed a notable sale, sparking widespread discussion. This Vitalik Buterin crypto transaction involved selling thousands of KNC and millions of STRAYDOG tokens, netting nearly $16,000. But what does this move really mean? Let’s dive into the details and explore the potential implications for investors and the broader crypto ecosystem. What Was the Vitalik Buterin Crypto Transaction? According to data from the blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, a specific Ethereum address presumed to belong to Vitalik Buterin became active. This address sold 29,500 Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) tokens and a staggering 30.5 million StrayDog (STRAYDOG) tokens. The total proceeds from this dual sale amounted to 15,916 USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This action immediately caught the attention of traders and analysts. Transactions from high-profile figures like Buterin are often scrutinized for signals about market sentiment or the health of specific projects. While the sum of $15.9K is relatively small in the grand scheme of Buterin’s holdings, the symbolic weight of the move is significant. Why Does This Crypto Transaction Matter? You might wonder why a $16,000 sale matters in a multi-trillion dollar market. The importance lies not in the amount, but in the actor and the potential message. Vitalik Buterin is a foundational figure in blockchain. His actions, however small, are interpreted by the community. Market Signal: Some investors view sales by founders as a potential lack of confidence in a project’s short-term prospects. Portfolio Rebalancing: It could simply be routine portfolio management, cashing out small amounts of tokens for operational expenses or diversification. Liquidity Event: The conversion to USDC, a stablecoin, suggests a move to secure dollar-pegged value, possibly indicating a cautious stance on market volatility. Therefore, this Vitalik Buterin crypto transaction serves as a case study in how the market reacts to the movements of its most watched participants. Decoding the Impact on KNC and STRAYDOG Let’s break down the immediate aftermath for the two tokens involved in this sale. The reaction was a textbook example of market psychology. For KNC, the native token of the Kyber Network liquidity hub, the sale represented a tiny fraction of its circulating supply. However, the news likely contributed to short-term selling pressure as some traders followed the perceived ‘smart money’ signal. The impact on STRAYDOG, a meme token with a much smaller market cap, was more pronounced. Transactions from celebrity wallets can dramatically affect low-liquidity tokens, causing sharp price swings. This event highlights the inherent volatility and sentiment-driven nature of certain crypto asset classes. What Can Everyday Crypto Investors Learn? So, should you sell your holdings because Vitalik Buterin did? Absolutely not. The key takeaway is about strategy, not mimicry. Here are actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never base your investment decisions solely on the actions of others, no matter how influential. Context is King: A single transaction lacks context. It doesn’t reveal the overall portfolio strategy or reasons behind the move. Beware of Volatility: This event underscores how smaller, speculative assets can be disproportionately affected by single events. Use Tools: Leverage blockchain explorers and analytics platforms like Lookonchain to inform your research, not dictate your trades. This Vitalik Buterin crypto transaction is a reminder that in transparent blockchain markets, every move is public, but not every motive is clear. Conclusion: A Ripple, Not a Wave In conclusion, the recent sale from a Vitalik Buterin-linked address is a fascinating micro-event in the crypto universe. It demonstrates the market’s sensitivity to founder actions and the powerful narrative-driven forces at play. However, for the savvy investor, it reinforces fundamental principles: maintain a long-term perspective, prioritize foundational research over noise, and understand that transparency does not always equate to clarity. The true lesson of this Vitalik Buterin crypto transaction is to watch, learn, but always think for yourself. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Did Vitalik Buterin definitely make this sale? A1: The sale was made from an address “presumed” or “linked” to Vitalik Buterin based on past activity and holdings. While not 100% confirmed, blockchain analysts have high confidence in the attribution. Q2: Why would he sell such a small amount? A2: There are many reasons, including covering personal expenses, charitable donations, simple portfolio rebalancing, or testing market liquidity. The modest size suggests it was not a major strategic shift. Q3: Should I sell my KNC or STRAYDOG because of this? A3: No. Making investment decisions based solely on one person’s transaction is risky. Always base your trades on your own financial goals and research into the project’s fundamentals. Q4: How can I track these kinds of transactions myself? A4: You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan to view any public Ethereum address. Analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Nansen, or Arkham Intelligence aggregate and highlight notable wallet activities. Q5: Has this affected Ethereum’s price? A5: No, this transaction involved specific tokens (KNC and STRAYDOG) and had no direct impact on the price of Ethereum (ETH). The markets for these assets are largely separate. Q6: Are founder sales always bad for a token’s price? A6: Not always. Scheduled, transparent sales (like vesting unlocks) are often planned for. Unexpected large sales can signal concern, but small sales like this one are typically neutral and routine.

Bitcoin Two Week RSI Support Test. Source: TradingView / X In a post on X, Rekt Fencer said Bitcoin is “about to enter bear market zone” if BTC breaks a specific RSI level. The two week BTCUSD index chart shows the RSI hovering near the low 40s, a zone that has acted as a floor in past cycles. He argued that losing that level would leave little technical support, and he set $50,000 as the likely downside target. The chart also marks a prior instance in 2022 when RSI fell below a similar range before Bitcoin dropped toward the cycle low. By contrast, the 2023 recovery followed only after RSI reclaimed the area and held above it. Bitcoin has already pulled back from its 2025 peak, while RSI kept sliding, which signals weakening momentum even as price stayed relatively high. The next two week close will determine whether RSI holds the support zone or confirms a breakdown. Long term cycle indicator shifts toward late stage Meanwhile, Bitcoin may be entering a late cycle phase, according to analyst Titan of Crypto, as a long term momentum indicator shows conditions that previously aligned with market tops. Bitcoin Monthly SOTT Cycle Indicator. Source: TradingView / X In a post on X, Titan of Crypto pointed to the SOTT indicator on the monthly Bitcoin U.S. dollar index chart, noting that it has turned purple. Historically, this shift appeared near or shortly after major cycle peaks, rather than during early or mid cycle expansions. He questioned whether the current cycle is following the same pattern. The chart highlights several past Bitcoin tops, including 2013, 2017, and 2021, where price reached cycle highs as SOTT transitioned into similar colors. In each case, the indicator reflected slowing momentum after extended rallies, followed by prolonged consolidation or drawdowns. The current signal appears while Bitcoin trades near record levels, raising concerns about whether upside momentum is fading. At the same time, the indicator does not pinpoint exact tops. Previous cycles showed price volatility after the signal, with Bitcoin continuing higher for periods before confirming a broader reversal. As a result, the reading suggests a shift in cycle conditions rather than an immediate price breakdown. Titan of Crypto framed the signal as a warning that Bitcoin may be closer to the later stages of its cycle than the beginning. With multiple long term indicators now showing cooling momentum, the chart suggests that the market is approaching a phase where risk increases and trend strength weakens, even if price remains elevated in the near term. Fear and Greed index hits historical extreme Bitcoin may be approaching a short term relief phase, according to analyst James Easton, as sentiment indicators fall to levels rarely seen in past cycles. Bitcoin Weekly Fear and Greed Index Extremes. Source: TradingView / X In a post on X, James Easton said Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed index has dropped to a zone reached only four times before. The weekly BTCUSD chart shows those prior instances aligned with periods of heavy pessimism, when sentiment fell into extreme fear while price traded well below recent highs. The chart highlights similar moments in 2018, 2020, and 2022. In each case, the Fear and Greed index dipped into deeply oversold territory before Bitcoin staged strong rebounds over the following weeks or months. Easton stressed that those moves did not always mark absolute cycle bottoms, but they consistently preceded meaningful upside reactions. Currently, the index sits near the low end of its historical range, while Bitcoin trades below recent peaks after a sharp pullback. Easton said the market appears stretched to the downside, with sentiment compressed even as long term structure remains intact. He noted that conditions like this often limit further immediate selling pressure. Easton cautioned that oversold readings alone do not confirm a trend reversal. Still, he said the data suggests that risk may be shifting away from aggressive downside continuation toward at least a short term bounce. As a result, the chart points to sentiment exhaustion rather than renewed panic, with history showing that similar setups rarely persisted for long without a relief move.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-19 15:16:52

However, analysts say the MemeCore price prediction indicators point toward a rebound before year-end. “Meme 2.0” Blockchain Infrastructure MemeCore operates as a Layer 1 blockchain centered on the “Meme 2.0” concept , aiming to evolve meme coins from short-term speculative vehicles into sustainable, community-powered assets. https://twitter.com/AltCryptoGems/status/2001336590141161544?s=20 Beyond functioning as another digital gambling token, MemeCore provides infrastructure enabling creators, communities, and brands to tokenize and monetize memes directly on-chain. MemeCore establishes itself as a convergence point where humor, creativity, and decentralized finance meet. The $M token facilitates transactions, ecosystem incentives, and governance, synchronizing user participation with network expansion. The blockchain employs a “Proof of Meme” (PoM) consensus mechanism that rewards creators, validators, and users of meme coins. MemeCore is now approaching a $3 billion market capitalization while maintaining above $1.50 despite recent declines. This momentum shows no signs of slowing down as chart patterns point to a potential rebound heading into Christmas. Memecore Price Prediction: $1.70 Support Critical for Recovery This 4-hour chart shows MemeCore in a recovery phase after a sharp capitulation move, but momentum has clearly slowed as price runs into overhead supply. The rebound from the $1.22 base was strong and impulsive, indicating aggressive dip-buying and short covering, yet that rally stalled just below the $1.95 area, which now stands out as a well-defined overhead resistance. Since failing there, price has rolled over and is consolidating below the critical $1.70 support, a level that has flipped from demand to a key make-or-break zone. Source: TradingView RSI has cooled into the mid-30s to low-40s range, reflecting fading buying pressure without yet signaling extreme oversold conditions. This implies consolidation or further downside is still possible before a sustainable bounce develops. As long as $1.70 is reclaimed quickly, the broader recovery structure from $1.22 can stay intact, leaving room for another attempt toward $1.95–$2.00 resistance. However, failure to hold this zone increases the probability of a deeper retracement, with $1.22 acting as the next major downside magnet where stronger demand previously stepped in. Pepenode Offers Early Access to Memecoin Season 2.0 MemeCore recovery above the $1.90 resistance level could trigger a memecoin season 2.0 rally that would benefit early-stage meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) . Pepenode is a new crypto project still in its presale round that’s already raised over $2.3 million despite the memecoin sector losing over 50% of its value year-to-date. It’s a game where you can mine coins without needing expensive hardware setups. You play the game in your web browser, set up virtual mining rigs, and upgrade your facilities to earn PEPENODE tokens . Now that more people are investing in Pepenode’s mining rigs, the presale price is increasing every day. To join the presale before the ongoing round sells out, go to the official Pepenode website and connect a crypto wallet like Best Wallet. You can then buy PEPENODE tokens for $0.0012016 and pay with crypto using ETH or USDT, or use a bank card for fast payment.

The decision came as officials pointed to firmer inflation trends and more consistent wage growth, while stressing that overall financial conditions remain supportive. Bank of Japan Rate Decision. Source: Bank of Japan Markets treated the move as a measured step rather than a sharp pivot. Even after the hike, Japan’s interest rates remain well below those of other major economies. Still, the increase pushed borrowing costs to their highest level in roughly thirty years and reinforced expectations that Japan’s long era of near zero rates is ending. The yen showed limited volatility following the announcement, while Japanese government bond yields edged higher. Investors instead focused on the Bank’s guidance, which emphasized caution and gradualism rather than an aggressive tightening cycle. Why the BOJ Acted Now The central bank said inflation has stayed near its 2% target for longer than expected, supported by rising wages and stable domestic demand. Policymakers also cited improving price behavior across a wider range of goods and services, rather than temporary cost driven spikes. At the same time, the BOJ noted that real interest rates remain deeply negative, meaning policy is still accommodative even after the increase. Officials described the hike as an adjustment to the degree of monetary support, not a shift to restrictive policy. Governor Kazuo Ueda said future decisions will depend on incoming data. He stressed that the Bank will closely monitor wage negotiations, consumer spending, and price expectations before deciding on additional moves. What Comes Next for Policy and Markets The BOJ said it will continue to reassess its stance at each meeting, leaving the door open to further increases if economic conditions evolve as projected. However, officials avoided signaling a specific pace or timeline for future hikes. For businesses and households, the impact is expected to remain limited in the near term. Loan rates may edge higher, but overall financing conditions remain loose compared with historical standards and global peers. Globally, the decision keeps Japan on a different path from central banks that are either cutting rates or holding them steady after earlier tightening cycles. As a result, investors are likely to keep watching how Japan’s policy normalization affects currency markets, capital flows, and regional financial conditions in the months ahead.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-19 15:20:10

BCH Outperforms Despite Bear Market Scare Even on October 10, when most altcoins crashed by approximately 80%, Bitcoin Cash barely moved and has rallied over 20% since then. Currently trading around $595.50 with a market capitalization of $11.9 billion, BCH requires only a 12% surge to break the $650 resistance and surpass Cardano as the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. https://twitter.com/CoinDome_/status/2001973383043400176?s=20 Data from Coinglass reveals that Binance’s top traders are rapidly expanding their BCH long positions. And with Grayscale’s September filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to obtain approval for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that would follow the performance of Bitcoin Cash, the possibility of BCH surpassing $650 when approved is very high. With the filing, the digital assets platform intends to convert its current closed-end trusts for Bitcoin cash into ETFs that will mainly be listed on NYSE Arca or Nasdaq. Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction: Daily Chart Shows Bullish Structure Building Bitcoin Cash’s daily chart displays a constructive bullish formation developing after successfully defending the $450 support during October’s selloff, which marked a clear higher-timeframe demand zone. Since that low, price has established a series of higher lows and recently printed a strong bullish wick, signaling aggressive dip-buying and rejection of lower prices. BCH now trades above its short-term moving average, which is beginning to slope upward, reinforcing the momentum shift back to the upside. The $615 area remains the key near-term resistance, having capped price multiple times in recent months, but the latest daily close near $592 suggests growing pressure on this level. Source: TradingView RSI has advanced back above the mid-50s, reflecting strengthening bullish momentum without entering overbought territory, leaving room for continuation. If BCH secures a decisive daily close above $615, the structure supports continuation toward the $650–$652 region, which aligns with the next major resistance and prior distribution zone. Failure at resistance would likely trigger a shallow pullback toward rising trend support around the mid-$560s, but provided price maintains above this area, the broader bias remains bullish with higher prices favored over the coming sessions. Maxi Doge Raises $4.3M To Position for Christmas Rally If Bitcoin Cash breaks the $650 resistance before Christmas, significant attention would spotlight undervalued presale projects like Maxi Doge (MAXI) . Maxi Doge is an early-stage memecoin following the Dogecoin playbook that helped it achieve over 2x pump during the November-December 2024 Santa rally. The project has now established an alpha channel to help traders exchange insider tips, share early trade ideas, and discover hidden opportunities to capitalize on a similar memecoin Christmas rally. The MAXI presale has already raised over $4.3 million and offers 72% annual staking rewards for those entering early at the current $0.000274 price before it increases. To buy early, visit the official Maxi Doge website and connect a crypto wallet like Best Wallet.

This new platform represents a significant evolution in the real-money prediction market space, offering a regulated venue for users to trade contracts on future events. The launch signals a major step toward mainstream adoption of prediction markets in the United States. What is DraftKings Predictions and How Does This Real-Money Prediction Market Work? DraftKings Predictions is not a typical sportsbook. Instead, it functions as a regulated marketplace where users can buy and sell contracts based on the outcome of real-world events. Think of it like a stock market for predictions. If you believe an event will happen, you buy a “Yes” contract. If you think it won’t, you buy a “No” contract. The contract’s value fluctuates based on market sentiment and settles at $1 if the event occurs or $0 if it does not. This creates a dynamic real-money prediction market where information and opinion directly influence price. The platform’s registration with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA) is a crucial detail. This regulatory oversight provides a layer of legitimacy and consumer protection often absent in less formal prediction markets. It operates in 38 states, dramatically expanding its potential user base from the outset. Why is This Launch a Game-Changer for the Industry? DraftKings’ entry into this arena is monumental for several reasons. First, it brings massive institutional credibility and an existing user base of millions to the concept of prediction markets. Second, its regulatory status helps normalize the activity, potentially paving the way for wider acceptance. Here are the key benefits this platform introduces: Regulated Environment: CFTC/NFA oversight ensures fair play and financial security. Mainstream Accessibility: Leverages DraftKings’ familiar brand and user-friendly interface. Market Efficiency: These markets can aggregate dispersed information, often leading to remarkably accurate forecasts. New Asset Class: It creates a novel way for individuals to hedge opinions or speculate on non-financial outcomes. However, challenges remain. Regulatory complexity varies by state, and educating a broad audience on how a real-money prediction market differs from simple betting will be an ongoing task. Furthermore, the types of events allowed will be strictly controlled under CFTC rules, likely focusing on sports, entertainment, and financial indices initially. What Can You Trade on This New Prediction Market Platform? While specific event contracts will evolve, they will typically be binary outcomes. Examples could include: “Will Team X win the championship?” “Will Actor Y win the Academy Award?” “Will the Federal Reserve raise interest rates at the next meeting?” Each of these questions becomes a tradable contract. Your ability to profit hinges on buying contracts at a lower price than their final settlement value. This mechanism turns public knowledge and intuition into a tangible financial instrument within a real-money prediction market . Actionable Insights for Interested Participants If you’re considering participating, start by treating it as a sophisticated information market, not a casino. Research is paramount. Furthermore, understand the fees, settlement times, and specific rules DraftKings implements. Diversify your “predictions” and never risk more than you can afford to lose, as with any financial market. This platform is a tool for the informed, not a shortcut for the speculative. In conclusion, DraftKings Predictions has the potential to democratize forecasting and create a fascinating new intersection of gaming, finance, and data. By launching a fully regulated real-money prediction market , DraftKings isn’t just offering a new product—it’s testing the future of how we collectively gauge probability and risk. Its success could redefine an entire sector. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is DraftKings Predictions available in my state? A: The platform is currently available in 38 states. You will need to check the DraftKings website or app for the most up-to-date list of supported jurisdictions. Q: How is this different from regular sports betting on DraftKings? A: Sports betting involves placing a fixed-odds wager. A prediction market involves trading contracts whose price changes like a stock, allowing you to buy and sell before the event concludes based on new information. Q: What kind of events can I trade on? A: Initially, expect events related to sports, entertainment, and financial markets, as these align with regulatory guidelines. The event catalog will likely expand over time. Q: Is my money safe on this platform? A: As a CFTC-registered entity, DraftKings Predictions must adhere to strict financial integrity and consumer protection standards, including segregating customer funds, which provides a significant safety layer. Q: Can I lose more money than I deposit? A: No. These are limited-liability contracts. The maximum you can lose on any single contract is the amount you paid for it. Q: Are winnings taxable? A: Yes. In the United States, net profits from prediction market trading are generally considered taxable income. You should consult a tax professional for guidance specific to your situation.

He felt it the moment the meeting ended. He had just finished what officials later called a “strong interview” with President Donald Trump for the Federal Reserve chair role. The talk focused on the labor market, slow hiring, and ways to push job creation. It ended minutes before Trump spoke to the nation about the economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, chief of staff Susie Wiles, and deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino sat in. Chris answered everything asked, but he also sensed the truth: the process was still wide open, and he was not at the top. Another sign was the lineup still ahead. BlackRock’s Rick Rieder will sit down with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in the last week of the year. Officials also confirmed that Michelle Bowman is out of the running. Kevin Hassett, seen as the favorite in prediction markets, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh already had their interviews with the president. The whole setup showed how crowded the race still was. Trump signals his wider search for a chair Officials stressed that the conversation with Chris proved wrong any claim that Trump wanted someone who would “bow” to him on interest rates. They said the president was looking across many economic issues. But Trump has also been blunt about wanting a chair who talks to him. Last week, he told The Wall Street Journal the Fed chair “should consult” with him. He added, “I don’t think he should do exactly what we say. But certainly we’re—I’m a smart voice and should be listened to.” Classic Trump line. Direct. Confident. And yes, Chris heard all of that too. A day later in the Oval Office, Trump gave Chris warm public remarks when asked by a reporter. He said, “I think he’s great. I mean, he’s been a man who has been there a long time, somebody that I was very involved with.” Trump nominated him in 2019. Still, the praise did not change the simple fact that Chris was not emerging as the leading pick. Officials kept repeating that the interviews were part of a “highly organized process,” which usually means the decision is nowhere near done. Trump’s speech Wednesday night made the direction even clearer. He said, “I will soon announce our next chairman of the Federal Reserve, someone who believes in lower interest rates by a lot, and mortgage payments will be coming down even further.” That line alone showed what he wants: someone aggressive on cuts. Chris lays out his rate views and job worries Hours before the Oval Office meeting, Chris spoke at the Yale CEO Summit in New York. He said he believed interest rates could fall by 50 to 100 basis points because he expects inflation to drop and is worried about weak hiring. The Fed governor also reminded viewers that he dissented in July when the Fed held rates steady. That call looked sharp later, with the Fed cutting 75 basis points starting in September. Officials did not share details of his private conversation with Trump, but the context made the topic clear. The November jobs report showed unemployment rising to 4.6%, up from 4.4% in September. Payroll growth almost stalled. Jobs have become a major political headache. Trump pushed the point again in his economic speech, saying, “There are more people working today than at any time in American history. And 100 percent of all jobs created since I took office have been in the private sector.” Since January, the private sector added 687,000 jobs while the government cut 188,000 roles. And then there was the moment that made everyone in the room laugh. Someone told Trump that Chris can deadlift 350 pounds. The president was said to be “seriously impressed.” Not enough to hand him the top job, but definitely enough to raise eyebrows. Chris left knowing the truth. The search continues. And he is no longer expecting his phone to ring.

ME tokens will be distributed using a proportional model, with allocations determined by the amount of staking power used by each participant. Access for existing and new participants Existing MOCA stakers can register directly through the MocaPortfolio platform to participate in the Magic Eden token drop. Moca Network also introduced a fast-track option for new participants, allowing users to stake MOCA tokens for a limited period in order to generate sufficient staking power to join the allocation. Kenneth Shek, project lead of Moca Network said: “MocaPortfolio is curated with tokens in Animoca Brands’ portfolio to help portfolio projects grow token distribution, and to enable token holders to accumulate a collection of tokens and grow along with their chosen projects. Holding MOCA gives the holders the ability to build up their own portfolios along the principles that Animoca Brands uses for its own ecosystem of token investments.” Featured image via Shutterstock.

Price then rebounded aggressively, reclaiming the $0.125 level and breaking higher with a clear impulse move. DOGE is now consolidating near $0.129, suggesting short-term strength as buyers defend gains just below the $0.13 resistance area. As of this writing, DOGE is exchanging hands at around $0.1294 with a 24-hour gain of 0.48%. DOGE price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Dogecoin Whales Go Silent as DOGE Consolidates Near Key Support Levels According to analyst Ali Martinez, the chart indicates that Dogecoin whale holdings declined sharply from late October, when DOGE was trading near the $0.08–$0.09 range, into early December as prices slipped toward the $0.07 area. This period marked a clear distribution by large holders. However, once DOGE stabilized around the $0.07–$0.075 zone, whale activity flattened out, with balances remaining nearly unchanged for the past four weeks, signaling a pause in both accumulation and selling. Martinez explains that this extended whale silence suggests uncertainty at current price levels rather than outright bearish conviction. With DOGE consolidating near key support and whales holding roughly steady around 17.4 billion DOGE, price action is now largely influenced by retail traders and short-term momentum. Historically, such low whale engagement near support levels often precedes a decisive move, with renewed accumulation potentially pushing DOGE back toward higher resistance zones. At the same time, fresh distribution could expose the token to another downside test. Dogecoin Breaks Long-Term Trendline, Echoing the Explosive 2014–2017 Cycle According to analyst Trader Tardigrade, the 2-week Dogecoin chart shows a decisive break above a long-term ascending trendline, a structure that closely mirrors the market behavior seen during the 2014–2017 cycle. In that earlier period, DOGE spent years respecting a rising support line before finally breaking above it, marking the transition from accumulation to a powerful expansion phase. The current 2021–2026 structure appears to be following the same rhythm, with price recently pushing above the trendline that has guided DOGE since its post-2021 decline. Source: X Trader Tardigrade notes that in the 2014–2017 cycle, a similar breakout occurred when DOGE was trading near the $0.0002–$0.0003 range, shortly before a parabolic rally unfolded. In the present cycle, DOGE is now breaking its multi-year trendline around the $0.12–$0.14 zone, suggesting a comparable shift in long-term momentum. If the historical analogy continues to play out, the breakout could signal the early stages of a larger upside move, with sustained strength above the trendline acting as confirmation that Dogecoin has entered a new bullish phase.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-19 15:33:04

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading at $89,024.1. This surge isn’t just a number on a screen; it represents a powerful wave of optimism washing over the cryptocurrency landscape. But what’s fueling this remarkable rally, and is this momentum sustainable? Let’s break down the factors behind Bitcoin’s latest triumphant climb. What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Surge? The recent Bitcoin price movement above $89,000 is not happening in a vacuum. Several key catalysts are converging to create this bullish environment. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Moreover, macroeconomic factors like inflation concerns are pushing investors towards assets perceived as stores of value. Therefore, Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity, with its fixed supply cap, makes it an attractive hedge for many. Breaking Down the $89,000 Bitcoin Price Level Reaching a Bitcoin price of $89,024.1 is a significant psychological and technical milestone. For traders, breaking through previous resistance levels often signals further upward potential. However, it’s crucial to understand the market dynamics at play. Exchange Activity: The price point was recorded on Binance, one of the world’s largest and most liquid cryptocurrency exchanges. Trading Pair: The quote is against USDT (Tether), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, which is the most common benchmark for crypto trading. Market Sentiment: Such a clear breakout typically fuels positive sentiment, attracting more attention and potentially more capital. Is This a Sustainable Rally for Bitcoin? While the surge in the Bitcoin price is exhilarating, seasoned investors know that volatility is part of the game. The journey to $89,000 has been marked by both rapid gains and sharp corrections. Key questions now revolve around whether this level can act as a new support floor. For the rally to be sustainable, we need to see consistent buying pressure and strong on-chain metrics, such as growing wallet addresses and reduced exchange reserves. Furthermore, regulatory clarity in major economies will play a pivotal role in determining long-term stability. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Watching the Bitcoin price hit new highs can trigger a fear of missing out (FOMO). Instead of impulsive decisions, consider these points: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on price movements. Understand the technology and market drivers. Risk Management: Only allocate capital you are prepared to lose. The crypto market is inherently volatile. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves investing a fixed amount regularly, which can reduce the impact of volatility. Secure Your Assets: If you hold Bitcoin, use reputable hardware wallets or secure custodial solutions, not just exchange accounts. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin’s Valuation The breakthrough past $89,000 opens the door to discussions about the next major targets. Many analysts look towards the previous all-time high and beyond. However, the path will likely include periods of consolidation and testing. The overall health of the global economy, technological upgrades to the Bitcoin network, and broader adoption in payment systems and decentralized finance (DeFi) will all influence the future Bitcoin price trajectory. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s ascent above $89,000 is a landmark event that reinforces its position at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. This rally is fueled by a combination of institutional confidence, macroeconomic trends, and its core value proposition as digital gold. While the future remains unwritten, this milestone provides a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s resilience and growing mainstream acceptance. For investors, it underscores the importance of a disciplined, informed approach in navigating this dynamic and transformative market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What was the exact Bitcoin price mentioned in the article? A1: The article reports that Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $89,024.1 on the Binance USDT market when it rose above the $89,000 level. Q2: Why is breaking $89,000 significant for Bitcoin? A2: Surpassing $89,000 is a major psychological and technical milestone. It indicates strong buying pressure, breaks past potential resistance levels, and can significantly boost overall market sentiment, often attracting more investors. Q3: What is USDT, and why is the Bitcoin price quoted against it? A3: USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 value with the US dollar. It’s the most common trading pair for cryptocurrencies because it provides a stable reference point against the volatile price of assets like Bitcoin, making valuation easier. Q4: Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price is above $89,000? A4: Investment decisions should never be based solely on current price.

He says liquidity now runs everything. He ties Bitcoin’s future to how quickly dollars are created and how discreetly that creation is sold to the public. In his latest essay, Arthur frames money printing as a language game run by politicians and central bankers, where new acronyms exist to hide inflation while keeping markets alive. He says Bitcoin no longer moves on a clean four‑year rhythm and instead reacts to how aggressively balance sheets expand. Arthur traces this thinking back to the post‑2008 world. After March 2009, risky assets escaped what he calls a deflation trap. The S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, gold, and Bitcoin all surged as central banks pushed liquidity into the system. The crypto leverage trader points out that when returns are normalized to a 2009 base, Bitcoin’s performance sits in a category of its own. Central banks rename money printing and keep it moving Arthur wrote:- “In democratic systems of one human, one vote, the plebes vote out the incumbent party when inflation surges. In autocratic systems, the plebes enter the streets and topple the regime. Therefore, politicians know that ruling in an inflationary environment is a death sentence for their careers. However, the only politically palatable way to pay for the massive amount of global debt is to inflate it away.” Arthur walks through how QE works in steps. He says the Fed buys bonds from a primary dealer like JP Morgan. He says the Fed creates reserves from nothing and credits the bank. He says the bank then buys new Treasury debt because yields beat reserves. He says the Treasury receives the cash into the TGA. He says spending follows. He says asset prices rise first. He says goods and services inflation comes later when the government spends. Source: Arthur Hayes/Maelstrom Arthur then says money market funds hold about 40% of outstanding T‑bills, while banks hold around 10%. He uses Vanguard as an example. Under RMP, the Fed buys bills from a fund and credits its reverse repo account. That cash earns interest. If new bills yield more than the reverse repo rate, the fund buys them. The Treasury receives that cash. Arthur says this directly funds government issuance. If bill yields do not beat the reverse repo rate, Arthur says funds lend into the repo market. He describes repo loans backed by Treasury bonds. With the upper Fed Funds rate near 3.75%, funds can earn more in repo than at the Fed. Housing, Bitcoin, and the end of the four‑year cycle Hedge funds tend to borrow in repo to buy bonds, and the Bank of New York Mellon clears the trade, so that this so-called Fed‑created money ends up financing longer‑dated government debt. Arthur calls this “a thin disguise” for QE that still feeds both asset prices and spending. Cryptopolitan verified that the Fed has always classified RMP as technical, not stimulative, so it can be expanded or shrunk without a clear public vote as long as reserves stay “ample,” though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent still effectively controls the short end of the curve through issuance. Arthur ties RMP to housing through Treasury buybacks. After Trump eased tariffs, Bessent said buybacks could calm markets. Arthur says bill issuance can fund buybacks of 10‑year bonds, pushing yields lower, which reduces mortgage rates. You can see now that this structure forces continued bill reliance, which will logically kill the four‑year Bitcoin cycle.CoinGlass’ data shows that Bitcoin fell about 6% after RMP began, while gold rose 2%. “Since the post-2008 Global Financial Crisis March 2009 lows, risky assets like stonks (S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indices), gold, and Bitcoin flew out of the deflationary river Styx and notched up insane returns,” Arthur wrote in his essay. And whenever the Fed adds liquidity, the dollar weakens, and then China, Europe, and Japan will all respond with their own credit creation to protect exporters. Arthur expects that to happen this time too and predicted that the synchronized balance sheet will see massive (perhaps even unprecedented) growth in 2026. Arthur also believes that Bitcoin could trade between $80,000 and $100,000 while markets debate RMP, but sees a rally to $124,000 and shortly $200,000 after that once RMP is accepted as QE. “$40 billion per month is great, but as a percentage of dollars outstanding, it’s much less in 2025 than in 2009. Therefore, we cannot expect its credit impulse at current financial asset prices to be as impactful. For this reason, the current misguided belief that RMP said Arthur.

Enabled by LayerZero, the integration allows TRX, TRON’s native utility token, to be seamlessly bridged to the Base network. As a result, users can access TRX directly within the Base App via decentralized exchanges on Base, such as Aerodrome. “The integration between TRON and Base is a meaningful step toward making blockchain networks operate more seamlessly together,” said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. “Bringing TRON and Base together is an important milestone in expanding how blockchain networks connect and scale. Each ecosystem will complement the other by improving interoperability, broadening access for developers and users, and supporting secure on-chain activity across networks. It reflects our shared focus on building solutions that address the needs of real users.” The integration is closely aligned with TRON’s mission to provide efficient, accessible, and secure settlement infrastructure for users and institutions worldwide. Since the launch of its mainnet in 2018, TRON has evolved into a foundational component of the global digital financial ecosystem, with cumulative transfer volume exceeding $23 trillion. The network currently supports more than 350 million user accounts, with over $23 billion in total value locked across its ecosystem. On average, TRON processes approximately 10 million daily transactions, facilitates over $24 billion in daily transfer volume, and serves over 3.37 million daily active accounts on the blockchain. Against this backdrop of scale and real-world usage, the integration reflects a broader shift toward greater connectivity across blockchain ecosystems. By bridging TRON with Base’s scalable Layer 2 environment, the collaboration helps reduce friction between centralized and decentralized financial systems and enables more seamless cross-chain participation. Together, TRON and Base are advancing interoperable infrastructure that expands access, reduces friction, and supports real-world use at scale. The integration reflects a shared vision for building connected blockchain ecosystems that serve developers, users, and institutions globally. About TRON DAO TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps. Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON blockchain has experienced significant growth since its MainNet launch in May 2018. Until recently, TRON hosted the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin, which currently exceeds $80 billion. As of December 2025, the TRON blockchain has recorded over 351 million in total user accounts, more than 12 billion in total transactions, and over $23 billion in total value locked (TVL), based on TRONSCAN.

Ethereum ETFs Record $96.6M Daily Outflow as BlackRock Leads Selling U.S. spot Ethereum exchange traded funds recorded a net outflow of $96.6 million in the latest trading session, according to daily flow data shared by market analysts. The figures show broad weakness across the ETF complex, with redemptions outweighing new allocations for the day. Ethereum ETF Daily Outflows Table. Source: Ted Pillows on X BlackRock accounted for the largest single move. The asset manager sold roughly $102.2 million worth of Ethereum from its ETF product, making it the main driver behind the overall net outflow. Other issuers posted limited activity, which failed to offset the scale of BlackRock’s selling. The data reflects a continuation of uneven investor demand for Ethereum ETFs in December. While some sessions earlier in the month saw modest inflows, recent days have leaned negative, pointing to cautious positioning among institutional participants as flows remain sensitive to broader market conditions and short term price action. Open interest climbs while ETH price lags Meanwhile, Ethereum derivatives data shows a clear divergence between positioning and price. Aggregated open interest continued to rise on major perpetual futures venues, while ETH price failed to reclaim its prior local high near the $3,000 area, according to TradingView and Hyblock Capital data. Ethereum Price and Open Interest Divergence. Source: Hyblock Capital, Maartunn on X The chart shows Ethereum trading around $2,950 while open interest expanded to roughly $11.79 billion. That represents a notable increase over recent sessions, signaling fresh leverage entering the market even as spot price momentum remains capped below resistance. Historically, rising open interest without follow through in price often reflects crowded positioning rather than confirmed trend continuation. This setup suggests the market is building pressure. When open interest rises but price stays range bound or weak, the imbalance can resolve through increased volatility. Traders typically watch such conditions closely, as either a continuation move or a forced unwind may follow once price breaks decisively above resistance or slips back toward lower support zones. Ethereum Order Book Shows Heavy Bid Support Near $2,700–$2,800 Binance order book data shows more than $150 million in buy orders stacked between the $2,700 and $2,800 range for Ethereum, according to a chart shared by market analyst Ted Pillows. The bids sit below the current trading zone near $2,950, forming a dense liquidity pocket that could act as near term downside support. Ethereum Binance Order Book Bid Wall $2,700 to $2,800.

Multiple bid layers appear spread across the zone, suggesting coordinated demand instead of short term scalping activity. Such clustering often reflects institutional positioning or larger players placing limit orders well ahead of potential pullbacks. Price action over recent sessions shows Ethereum rebounding after dipping toward the high $2,800s, while the bid wall remains intact. If price retraces again, the stacked orders could slow or absorb selling pressure.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $87,946.82 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden movement has left many investors wondering about the underlying causes and the potential implications for their portfolios. Let’s break down what’s happening. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Drop Below $88,000? Market corrections are a normal part of any financial asset’s lifecycle, and Bitcoin is no exception. The recent dip in the Bitcoin price can be attributed to a confluence of factors. Firstly, profit-taking by short-term traders after a period of gains often creates selling pressure. Secondly, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as interest rate anxieties, can trigger risk-off sentiment across all speculative assets, including crypto. Finally, technical analysis indicates that the $88,000 level was a key psychological support; breaking through it likely accelerated the sell-off. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? For long-term holders, often called ‘HODLers,’ this price action may be viewed as a temporary volatility event. However, for active traders, it signals a need to reassess strategies. Here are three immediate considerations: Risk Management: Ensure your stop-loss orders are updated to protect your capital from further downside. Market Sentiment: Monitor trading volume and social sentiment to gauge whether this is a short-term correction or the start of a deeper trend. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For those looking to accumulate, a lower Bitcoin price can present a strategic DCA opportunity. How Does This BTC Movement Compare to Historical Trends? Historically, Bitcoin has experienced numerous drawdowns of 20% or more during its bull markets. These pullbacks are often followed by periods of consolidation before the next leg up. Therefore, while watching the Bitcoin price fall can be unsettling, it’s essential to maintain perspective. The fundamental drivers of Bitcoin adoption—such as institutional investment and its role as a digital store of value—remain intact. This current movement is a reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Volatility Instead of reacting emotionally to the chart, consider these practical steps. First, diversify your crypto holdings beyond just Bitcoin to spread risk. Second, use reliable on-chain data and analysis, not just price charts, to inform your decisions. Finally, remember that successful investing is about discipline. Setting clear entry and exit points based on your research, not fear or greed, is crucial when the Bitcoin price makes a sharp move. In conclusion, the drop below $88,000 is a significant technical event that warrants attention. However, it does not necessarily invalidate the long-term bullish thesis for Bitcoin. Market cycles are defined by both explosive growth and healthy corrections. By understanding the reasons behind the move and maintaining a disciplined approach, investors can navigate this volatility with greater confidence. The key is to focus on the underlying technology and adoption trends, not just the daily fluctuations in the Bitcoin price . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is the Bitcoin price drop a sign of a bear market? A: Not necessarily. A single drop below a support level is a common occurrence in bull markets and is often considered a healthy correction before the next upward move. Q: Should I sell my Bitcoin now? A> That depends entirely on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Long-term holders typically advise against selling during downturns, while traders might use it as an exit signal based on their technical analysis. Q: What is the next major support level for BTC? A> Analysts will be watching previous resistance-turned-support zones, often around $84,000 and $80,000, as potential areas where buying interest could return. Q: Could the Bitcoin price fall further? A> Yes, all asset prices can always move in either direction. Continued negative macroeconomic news or large-scale liquidations could push the price lower. Q: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A> For investors using a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy, a lower price can be advantageous. However, trying to ‘catch the falling knife’ by timing the exact bottom is extremely risky. Q: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? A> Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. A sustained drop in BTC’s price typically leads to correlated downward movement in altcoins, often with even greater intensity.

Price performance below a key technical level has led to questions concerning the appropriateness of holding XRP or whether the money should be moved elsewhere. At the same time, emerging investment opportunities are also being considered by investors wondering what the best cryptocurrency to invest in is. On the same note, a presale token at a price of $0.035 is also being considered within discussions of the best investment to take when looking ahead to 2026. XRP Short-Term Structure Indicates Caution The current market sessions reveal that XRP is entering a more fragile position from its technical perspective. This is due to the fact that the token has dropped by about 2.6% and is currently close to the level of $1.90 due to an inability to keep the momentum above the level of resistance. Market activities have increased since the price has touched the Fibonacci level of $1.93. Volume showed a dramatic increase during the rejection, which is consistent with selling activity rather than just the result of illiquidity. Market structure has transitioned from ranging attempts on the charts to ranging rejection, with sellers currently in control. As long as XRP is contained below $1.93-$1.95, any advances would be classified as corrective rather than trend-forming. This has led investors to question whether XRP is a preferable answer on its own to the question of best crypto to buy for long term sustainable gains into 2026. Mutuum Finance Strong Presale Momentum There is growing interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , especially as its presale is at a critical juncture before an inflection point. Currently, Phase 6 is at around 98% capacity, and token allocation is decreasing at an alarming rate. Currently, Phase 6 is priced at $0.035, an increase by 250% or 3.5 times compared to entry costs at Phase 1 of $0.01. Since its presale began, it has raised $19,500,000, and it now has 18,530 MUTM token holders. Sales in phase 6 are nearing completion, and it is important to note that the chance to invest at current prices is slipping away fast. In phase 7, immediately following phase 6, a nearly 20% rise in value has been indicated at $0.04, although the launch price of MUTM is at $0.06. Positioned as it is, investors at this level expect a targeted 380% return on investment following launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stablecoin The long-term outlook is also affected by the stablecoin framework being developed by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The development updates show that the platform will offer an overcollateralized stablecoin connected to its lending platform, intended for purposes such as borrowing, liquidity flow, and value anchoring. This works in tandem with overall DeFi requirements for stability throughout market cycles, especially considering volatility trends around larger assets such as XRP. This stablecoin will be directly incorporated into borrowing and lending processes on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), adding to utility rather than just trading on speculation. This dynamic has garnered interest from investors considering where to invest in cryptocurrency to buy right now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Independent Audit Process The confidence in execution has been strengthened through security updates. The independent audit is underway, with Halborn Security assessing Mutuum’s contracts for lending and borrowing. The code is completed and put under formal analysis, indicating readiness for upcoming milestones. Engagement with the community has been facilitated by the use of a live dashboard with a leaderboard showing the top 50 holders. Within the 24-Hour Leaderboard, there is an award of $500 MUTM for the #1 ranked member of the day if there is one transaction within the 24-hour period ending 00:00 UTC. Simultaneously, there has been a $100,000 giveaway with ten winners to take home $10,000 in MUTM, encouraging late presale engagement. Market dynamics offer a different story. XRP is seen facing the challenge of stabilizing near the support level, though there is limited optimism in the short term. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going into the narrowing window for the presale. This issue is closely being considered by the investors contemplating the best cryptocurrency to invest in now. This is even before the completion of Phase 6.

This has provided the backdrop for gains of varying strength today, with Ethereum up by 2% in the past 24 hours, while most other major coins (including Bitcoin and Solana) have struggled to make any real headway. With the macroeconomic picture remaining mixed , investors continue to trade under uncertainty, yet the oversold status of the market means that a traditional end-of-year rally could be very close. In view of this possibility, we’re highlighting our best altcoin to buy today, choosing upcoming layer-two network Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , which has the potential to rally hard when it lists early next year. Best AItcoin To Buy Today That Could 100x in 2026 – 19 December 2025 Bitcoin Hyper has now raised a hugely impressive $29.6 million in its ongoing presale , which makes it one of the biggest sales of 2025. This would suggest that investors are increasingly gaining confidence in the new project, which is planning to launch a full layer-two network for Bitcoin. Determinism is the backbone of a credible rollup. Bitcoin Hyper is exploring how to maintain fully deterministic parallel SVM execution, enabling verifiable state commitments and trust-minimized execution anchored to Bitcoin.

It will have a particular focus on DeFi, enabling Bitcoin holders to tap into the enormous value of their holdings, and to make additional profits on top of any price appreciation. On a technical level, Bitcoin Hyper will make use of Solana’s Virtual Machine, giving it a speed and scalability that will make it one of the most capable L2s in crypto when it launches. On top of this, it will also employ zero-knowledge rollups, adding privacy and security to its mix of market-leading features. Its native token, HYPER, will be necessary to pay for its low transaction fees, with users receiving a proportionate quantity of HYPER whenever they deposit Bitcoin with the L2’s smart contract. Accordingly, HYPER will have a max supply of 21 billion tokens, at 1:10 ratio with Bitcoin itself. Holders will also be able to stake the token for a regular income, with the coin’s protocol currently paying out a yield of 39% APY. HYPER Could Be One of the Biggest New Coins of 2026: Here’s How to Buy Early Such features make Bitcoin Hyper one of the most exciting new tokens of 2025 and 2026, as its presale indicates. And while there isn’t that much time left until the sale ends, latecomers can still join by going to the official Bitcoin Hyper website. By connecting a compatible wallet (e.g. Best Wallet, MetaMask), they can buy any specified amount of HYPER, using ETH, USDT or even fiat. The token is currently available at a price of $0.013445, although this will rise again later today. It will continue to rise every few days until the sale ends, so interested investors should act sooner rather than later, in order to make the biggest possible gains. And while the wider crypto market still remains largely uncertain, Bitcoin Hyper’s launch early next year could coincide with an overdue resurgence. This is why it’s our best altcoin to buy today, and why it may remain one of the best new alts to buy for quite some time to come.

Bitcoin Whale Moves 5,152 BTC Worth $445 Million To Binance On-chain data identified by whale transaction tracker Lookonchain has revealed that a long-term Bitcoin holder deposited 5,152 BTC, valued at approximately $444.73 million, into Binance. The data, sourced from Arkham Intelligence, shows the wallet belongs to an entity tagged as Bitcoin OG (1011short), a trader known to hold a massive combined long position estimated at around $695 million across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The size and destination of the transfer immediately drew attention, as coins sent to exchanges are typically interpreted as becoming available for trading activity. Moving such a large amount of BTC onto Binance increases immediate sell-side liquidity and shows that the whale address is in preparation for selling. This follows the recent trend of whale addresses selling their Bitcoin holdings and a general lack of buying pressure for the cryptocurrency. Interestingly, Lookonchain data shows that the same Bitcoin OG (1011short) wallet recently added another 12,406 ETH to its long exposure, pushing its current holdings to 203,341 ETH worth about $577.5 million, alongside 1,000 BTC valued near $87 million and 250,000 SOL worth roughly $30.7 million. Despite increasing exposure, the wallet is now down more than $70 million, having seen profits fall from over $120 million to less than $30 million at the time of writing. Bearish Whale Behavior Is Not Isolated This Binance deposit is not occurring in isolation. Lookonchain also noted activity from another whale address, 0x94d3, which has taken explicitly bearish action over the past several hours. According to the data, the whale sold 255 BTC worth approximately $21.77 million at an average price of $85,378 before opening a 10x leveraged short position on 876.27 BTC, valued at about $76.3 million. The same wallet also initiated a leveraged short on 372.78 ETH worth roughly $1.1 million. Bitcoin’s recent price action makes these whale moves especially impactful. The leading cryptocurrency has failed to hold above $90,000 again and recently fell to a 24-hour low of $84,581. This movement has seen Bitcoin trading in a volatile range, repeatedly revisiting support zones around the mid-$80,000 region. Upside follow-through above $90,000 has been limited, and this has left the cryptocurrency vulnerable. Interestingly, a careful look at on-chain data shows that any movement that looks like accumulation in recent days is not organic buying but only reshuffling among wallets.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|ZRX|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-19 16:00:08

How Significant Is Cango’s Weekly Bitcoin Mining Output? Cango mines 125.8 BTC, which, at current valuations, represents a multi-million dollar weekly revenue stream. This output is a key performance indicator for any mining operation. To put it in perspective, mining this volume requires substantial computational power and energy efficiency.

Alongside the weekly production, Cango disclosed it now holds a total of 7,290 BTC. This growing treasury is a strategic asset. Companies typically choose between selling mined Bitcoin for immediate operational funds or holding it as a long-term investment on their balance sheet. Cango’s decision to accumulate a large reserve suggests a bullish long-term outlook on Bitcoin’s value. This strategy can influence market perceptions and investor confidence. Holding such assets also provides a financial cushion against Bitcoin’s price volatility and can be used for future expansion or as collateral. The process of how Cango mines BTC involves several critical factors: Hash Rate: The total computational power dedicated to mining. Energy Sourcing: Securing cost-effective and reliable electricity. Hardware Efficiency: Utilizing the latest ASIC miners for optimal performance. Strategic Location: Operating in regions with favorable regulations and climate.

Additionally, regulatory scrutiny around the environmental impact of mining is increasing globally. Companies must navigate these challenges while maintaining operational efficiency to stay profitable. Why Should Investors Watch Public Mining Companies? For those interested in the crypto space, publicly traded mining firms like Cango offer a unique investment avenue. They provide exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Announcements like Cango mines 125.8 BTC serve as tangible proof of operational success. Investors can analyze these production metrics, alongside holdings and cost structures, to assess a company’s health. However, it’s crucial to remember that these stocks can be volatile, often more so than Bitcoin itself, due to their operational leverage. In summary, Cango’s weekly mining achievement is a powerful indicator of its operational strength and strategic positioning. The fact that Cango mines BTC at this scale demonstrates its significant role in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Its growing treasury of 7,290 BTC reflects a confident, long-term strategy.

The Base Case For Shiba Inu Price In his X post, Quantum Ascend listed “Altseason Targets” as a conservative level (“$0.47 e-8,” as written), a “Primary” target of $0.00014, and a “Blow-Off” target of $0.00035. In the video, the analyst anchored the roadmap to Elliott Wave-style structure and Fibonacci extensions, and emphasized that the bullish path is conditional, not guaranteed. Starting from SHIB’s 2021 peak and the subsequent collapse, the analyst said the drawdown returned price to a historically meaningful zone: “Count out the five wave moves there pretty cleanly, but since then, nothing but a drawdown… Came back down right into this wave four low.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Scores US Regulated Derivatives Entry Via Coinbase From that setup, Quantum Ascend argued the decline can be read as a “crashing pattern” that often resolves with a reversal back toward prior highs. “So you have your five waves down, and typically what’ll happen, price will roll back up to the fourth wave, and then what it does is it’s going to come take out this fifth wave. This is six, come take out that fifth wave, even if it’s just a little for a wave seven, then it’s done and it turns back the other direction, right? So when we’re looking at it from this perspective, we can see pretty textbook for the level it went to,” the analyst said. “So now that you see the case for a new high… we got to start taking these fibs into play here and figure out, all right, where’s some logical price levels for this thing to end up.” Quantum Ascend then flagged the biggest constraint: SHIB’s magnitude of drawdown relative to prior-cycle behavior. “The one thing that’s stopping me from saying, yep, 100%, we’re going to see new highs, is going back to 2021, price is down 93% at the worst and right now down 92%,” the analyst said. “Back in 2021, coins that set their highs in 2017 and had a 90% plus drawdown did not set new highs in the 2021 cycle… So this is a four-year range down 90 plus percent. It fits the parameter of some of those other coins that never ended up going off into a new all-time high.” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Remains A Familiar Crypto Name As Losses Pile Up If that historical analog holds, the analyst said SHIB could be tracing a larger corrective structure rather than a fresh impulse. “If that’s the case, then this count would be five waves up and then we have an A, B into the retracements, and then C would start taking us much lower. That coincides with a recession-depression type feel,” the analyst said, adding: “And I do believe that that is the base case moving forward here… It’s just really important to understand the broader macro climate. Like this Shiba isn’t going unless everything else is lined up.” The Bullish Case For SHIB Price Even so, Quantum Ascend laid out upside zones using confluence between broader and nearer-term Fibonacci ranges. The analyst’s stated primary target for an “altseason environment” is the 1.618 Fibonacci extension at roughly $0.00014 which translates to a 1,800% rally from the current price. He added: “My blow-off is going to be a full 4.236 extension here of this range.” The blow-off scenario hits $0.00035, but was presented by him as technically possible but unlikely. Market-cap math was used as a reality check. “The thing I’ll say about SHIB is it’s at a $4.2 billion market cap right now. That’s pretty big, especially for what it is,” the analyst said, estimating that a move to the conservative area would imply roughly a $25 billion valuation and that the most extreme scenario would push into triple-digit billions. “That is massive getting up there… That’s like a 50x from where we’re at. And at that point, you’re talking 200 billion for a coin that doesn’t really do anything… In no way, shape, or form is this my base case.” $SHIB | @Shibtoken 📽️ Macro Structure Points to New Highs ↗️ Altseason Targets🎯 ➤➤ Conservative: $0.47 e-8 ➤➤ Primary: $0.00014 ✅ ➤➤ Blow-Off: $0.00035 Here’s the Roadmap👇 pic.twitter.com/nWxQsVtLvv — Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend) December 18, 2025 Despite publishing upside targets, Quantum Ascend stressed exit discipline over maximal upside capture, noting he does not hold SHIB. “I don’t own this coin, but if I did, I would be layered out all in this area [from the 0.5 Fibonacci level at $0.00004699] … I’d be done by the time it got up to that 1.618 Fibonacci at $0.00014,” the analyst said, arguing that “dollar cost averaging both in and out is a great strategy” in a meme-coin trade that ultimately depends on broader liquidity and risk appetite. At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00000738.

According to Politico , Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott now faces mounting challenges to pass the landmark legislation after pushing a committee vote into 2026, with lawmakers warning that Congress’s traditional election-year gridlock could derail the effort entirely. The bill aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets and to determine which federal agencies oversee different crypto sectors. Its passage hinges on Republicans reaching an agreement with Senate Democrats on several sticking points, including ethics concerns surrounding President Donald Trump’s family’s crypto ventures, which could become campaign flashpoints. Sen. Moreno warns U.S. lawmakers: “No deal is better than a bad deal.” U.S. crypto legislation may be delayed #Regulation #CLARITYAct https://t.co/Z9QlO4yiD4 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 9, 2025 Republicans hope to deliver what would be a signature legislative achievement of Trump’s second term. Campaign Cash Complicates Political Calculus The crypto and banking industries are preparing massive campaign spending pushes that could scramble the political dynamics as elections approach. Politico asserts that the crypto sector has already poured over $140 million into the Fairshake super PAC network, backing industry-friendly candidates across both parties. In a significant development this week, major U.S. banks launched the American Growth Alliance, a nonprofit that will deploy “ tens of millions of dollars ” to advance their interests in the crypto debate, particularly around restricting yield programs on stablecoins. These competing financial incentives create complicated pressures for Democrats, especially. While passing legislation could keep them in crypto firms’ good graces, failing to reach a deal might actually incentivize continued industry support since bipartisan backing would be needed for future legislative efforts. Senator Cynthia Lummis noted that the industry’s willingness to contribute to both parties creates “ a powerful incentive for politicians to pussyfoot around. “ @SenLummis says she wants a markup on the crypto market structure bill next week even as staff are “exhausted” from nonstop revisions. #Crypto #USPolicy #Lummis https://t.co/RadNIvnWLp — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 9, 2025 The crypto industry’s political advocacy group, Stand With Crypto , escalated the pressure this week, announcing it will score lawmakers based on how they vote during market structure markups and warning that “ failure to pass Market Structure jeopardizes everything that this community has built and fought for. “ Window for Action Rapidly Closing Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) warned that lawmakers have until roughly March to finalize the bill, after which “ we’re in the political silly season. “ The compressed timeline comes as bipartisan negotiations stretch deeper into an election year marked by heightened political tensions. Scott said this week that lawmakers are “ making steady, bipartisan progress ” while working through the text “ in a thoughtful, deliberate way ,” emphasizing his focus on “ building a durable framework that provides regulatory clarity, protects investors, and keeps America at the forefront of financial innovation. “ Democrats say they’re focused on substance rather than political considerations. Senator Ruben Gallego also emphasized the urgency of action following an October meeting with crypto executives, warning that failure to pass legislation could push crypto industries overseas or into illicit markets. Negotiations Continue Amid Multiple Pressure Points The Senate effort follows months of stalled progress after the record-breaking government shutdown and disagreements over decentralized finance regulation. While the House passed its Digital Asset Market Clarity Act in July with bipartisan support , giving the CFTC primary oversight of digital commodities, the Senate has been developing its own framework, using different terminology, such as “ ancillary assets ,” to define non-security tokens. Scott must also navigate concerns from some GOP members, with Senator John Kennedy defending the delayed markup as “inevitable” while praising the chairman for creating “a sense of urgency” amid productive negotiations. Recent developments have intensified the legislative urgency beyond campaign finance considerations. The pro-crypto advocacy group Stand With Crypto warned that inaction would jeopardize years of industry development. Teachers’ union AFT calls on Congress to kill the crypto market-structure bill before it advances. warning that the bill threatens pensions and 401(k)s, #Crypto #Pensions https://t.co/YTicn3pURn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 10, 2025 Meanwhile, opposition emerged this week from the American Federation of Teachers, which warned the legislation could expose public-sector pensions to unsafe assets by allowing companies to tokenize stock and bypass traditional securities oversight. AFT President Randi Weingarten said the bill “ poses profound risks to the pensions of working families ,” arguing it would replace existing safeguards with a framework that leaves retirement plans more vulnerable than they are today.

The move comes as inflation remains high in the country. The yen is still weak against the dollar, and real wages keep falling. The crypto market did not react harshly. Bitcoin has climbed to $88,176.99 while Ether is at $2,976.43. But both coins are still in the red in the past seven days. BOJ said the decision was unanimous Members of the BOJ policy board voted unanimously. They agreed to raise the short-term policy rate from 0.5% to 0.75%. The decision came after a two-day meeting that began on Thursday. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the outcome was anticipated. Many economists foresaw it. This is the central bank’s first rate hike since January of 2025. The BOJ has been carefully considering when to raise rates. It is watching the impact of US tariffs on Japan’s economy and monitoring wage growth. Uncertainties about tariffs have eased. Japanese firms are expected to raise wages next year, according to a statement from the bank. Japan is the fourth-largest economy in the world. The yen is gaining some strength against the US dollar and other major fiat currencies. For the Japanese people, this means cheaper fuel and imported goods. Following the BOJ announcement, Japan’s 10-year government bond prices slid further after months of continuous pressure. Yields rise as prices fall. This drove yields above 2% for the first time since 2006, pointing to continued weakness in bond prices. Is Bitcoin going downhill? Due to the yen carry trade, Bitcoin could slide by 30%. The yen carry trade involves borrowing cheaply in yen to invest in higher-risk assets. Investors may start offloading their risky investments in assets such as Bitcoin and Ether, driving the market further down. However, Crypto entrepreneur Arthur Hayes has been advocating for a weaker yen. Earlier in the day, Hayes voiced his input about a weaker Japanese yen. He said, “Don’t fight the BOJ: -ve real rates is the explicit policy.” Don’t fight the BOJ: -ve real rates is the explicit policy. $JPY to 200, and $BTC to a milly. pic.twitter.com/PdZh87ruVI — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) December 19, 2025 Hayes predicts that the JPY will jump to 200 against the dollar. This scenario will drive capital into the crypto market, pushing Bitcoin to $1 million. But the Bank of Japan governor, Kazuo Ueda, said real interest rates remain deeply negative. He added that interest rates will continue to rise and the BOJ will not stop if economic data aligns with its forecast. The governor did not offer more details on the pace of interest rate increase. The upcoming weeks will reveal the direction of the crypto market. As Christmas and New Year’s approach, crypto markets could trade sideways or slide further due to the holidays.

In a complaint filed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, the SEC accused VBit founder and former CEO Danh C. Vo of misleading thousands of investors. Regulators claim the company sold unregistered investment contracts linked to hosted Bitcoin mining operations. Source: SEC At the center of the case are so-called “Hosting Agreements” promoted by VBit between late 2018 and early 2022. The SEC says the contracts were pitched to retail investors as a largely hands-off way to generate passive income through Bitcoin mining. Why the SEC Says VBit’s Mining Contracts Were Securities Bitcoin mining typically involves running specialized computers to validate transactions on the Bitcoin network in exchange for newly minted coins. The SEC alleges Vo used the technical complexity of the process to promote a turnkey model in which investors were told they owned mining rigs that would be pooled and operated entirely by VBit. Returns were marketed as proportional to each investor’s share of computing power, or hashrate. According to the complaint, nearly all of VBit’s customers entered into these Hosting Agreements, which were sold in tiered packages ranging from lower-cost plans to premium offerings that purportedly included up to eight mining rigs. Investors were encouraged to choose hosted mining rather than operating equipment themselves through discounted pricing, longer contract terms, and promises of steady returns without operational involvement. The SEC alleges those representations were false. Court filings state that VBit sold far more hosting agreements than it had the mining equipment to support. In 2020, the company allegedly sold agreements covering more than 3,300 rigs while operating fewer than 1,000. In 2021, agreements reportedly covered more than 8,400 rigs, while only 1,643 were in operation. As a result, the hashrate promised to investors could not be delivered. The agency further alleges that investors never owned or controlled specific mining equipment and were entirely dependent on Vo and VBit’s operations to generate profits. Trump son Eric Trump-backed American Bitcoin intends to use the net proceeds from $220 million raised in a new share issuance to fund for Bitcoin equipment purchase. #EricTrump #AmericanBitcoin #Hut8 https://t.co/23zTABD4tb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 On that basis, the SEC argues the Hosting Agreements meet the definition of investment contracts under the Supreme Court’s Howey test and therefore should have been registered as securities. Investors Locked Out as SEC Says Mining Firm Moved Funds Offshore Under U.S. law, an arrangement can be deemed a security if investors contribute money to a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits derived primarily from the efforts of others. The SEC claims VBit’s hosting model satisfies all four elements, placing it within federal securities rules governing registration, disclosure, and anti-fraud protections. The complaint also accuses Vo of fabricating investor account balances through an online portal that displayed hypothetical mining returns unrelated to actual Bitcoin production. The bitcoins that were mined were allegedly controlled exclusively by Vo. The SEC says that between December 2020 and November 2021, Vo transferred approximately $48.5 million of investor funds to personal accounts, distributed millions to family members, and used investor money for cryptocurrency trading. After learning of the SEC’s investigation in 2021, Vo allegedly left the United States. VBit later announced it had been sold to an entity called Advanced Mining Group, which the SEC describes as a shell company used to maintain the appearance of ongoing operations. By mid-2022, investors were locked out of their accounts. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement, civil penalties, and a ban preventing Vo from serving as an officer or director of a public company. A jury trial has been requested.

Viral headlines about extreme price targets capture attention instantly, igniting hope, FOMO, and anxiety among traders. Yet beneath this hype lies a critical disconnect: the scale, adoption requirements, and structural realities that would underpin such valuations are rarely discussed. Understanding these factors is essential for investors seeking a rational perspective amid sensational predictions. Zach Humphries recently addressed this issue in a video posted on his X handle. He cautioned the XRP community against spreading unrealistic short-term price targets. While he remains bullish on XRP’s long-term potential, Humphries emphasized that telling people that XRP will hit $100 “soon” fuels emotion-driven trading rather than informed decision-making. He stresses that responsible communication is key to keeping long-term investors in the market. XRP $100 Price Prediction Rant Continued. I’m bullish on XRP but telling people absurd short term predictions is not helping keep people in the market! Let me explain $XRP $RLUSD pic.twitter.com/I1EqceadZU — Zach Humphries (@ZachHumphries) December 18, 2025 The Market Cap Behind $100 XRP A $100 XRP price is not just a number—it represents an extraordinary scale. With approximately 50 billion tokens in circulation, a $100 valuation would imply a $5 trillion market capitalization. This exceeds the size of Apple, Microsoft, and most historical market peaks combined. Humphries underscores that reaching this milestone would require global dominance in payments, sustained multi-billion-dollar institutional inflows, and near-total replacement of existing financial rails. The sheer magnitude of this scenario highlights why such short-term predictions are unrealistic. Adoption Realities and Structural Constraints XRP’s current trajectory is anchored in its utility as a bridge currency for cross-border payments, but widespread adoption is far from instantaneous. Full-scale integration with financial systems requires regulatory clarity, institutional confidence, and the gradual replacement of entrenched payment infrastructures. Humphries noted that pilot programs and small-scale experiments, while promising, cannot translate into overnight global adoption. Real adoption occurs over years or even decades, making rapid, extreme price targets highly speculative. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Psychological Impact of Hype One of Humphries’ core concerns is the emotional effect of viral predictions. Claims of $100 XRP trigger hope and FOMO, prompting traders to act impulsively rather than strategically. Many enter the market thinking they are “early,” only to be discouraged or liquidated when expectations fail to materialize. By contextualizing potential price targets within adoption and liquidity realities, investors can avoid emotional trading traps and maintain a long-term perspective. Focusing on Fundamentals Over Sensationalism Humphries’ message is a reminder that XRP’s real value lies in its adoption, utility , and the gradual accumulation of institutional and retail support. Long-term optimism should be grounded in tangible progress, not inflated short-term speculation. While the $100 target may represent a theoretical ceiling, it is neither immediate nor inevitable. Understanding the structural and market mechanics behind XRP allows investors to make informed decisions and remain patient through market cycles. In conclusion, XRP’s future is promising, but it is defined by adoption and utility rather than viral hype. Zach Humphries’ cautionary stance reinforces the need for realism, highlighting that the path to extreme valuations is gradual and measured—not instant.

The company argues that states lack authority to regulate these markets. Instead, Coinbase says federal law assigns exclusive supervision to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Consequently, the lawsuits aim to block state gaming regulators from enforcing local gambling rules on event-based contracts. The legal push reflects rising tension as prediction markets expand across the United States. Moreover, Coinbase seeks clarity before launching new products nationwide. The company warns that uneven state rules threaten innovation and consumer access. Hence, the dispute centers on who controls a fast-growing financial sector. Coinbase’s Case for Federal Authority Coinbase claims Congress already settled jurisdiction through commodity law. The firm says prediction markets qualify as commodities under federal definitions. Therefore, the CFTC should regulate them alone. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal has emphasized that state actions conflict with congressional intent. He argues that lawmakers excluded only limited categories from commodity coverage. Besides, sports-related events never appeared on that exclusion list. Coinbase maintains that this structure leaves no room for state intervention. Additionally, the company argues that prediction markets differ from casinos in structure and incentives. These platforms match buyers and sellers without setting odds. Consequently, Coinbase believes state gambling laws do not apply. In Illinois, Coinbase requested court protection to prevent enforcement actions. The company warned that state interference would cause immediate business harm. Moreover, Coinbase stressed that uncertainty could disrupt its upcoming product rollout. Beginning January 2026, the firm plans to offer event-contract trading nationwide. Illinois customers appear central to that expansion strategy. Hence, Coinbase wants legal certainty before operations begin. States Push Back as Markets Grow Prediction markets have grown rapidly over the past year. Platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket have processed billions in trading volume. However, that growth has drawn scrutiny from state regulators. Several states argue that sports-linked contracts resemble unlicensed betting. Consequently, they have issued enforcement notices against operators. Connecticut regulators recently targeted Kalshi, Robinhood, and Crypto.com. They claimed those firms offered illegal sports wagering products. However, Kalshi challenged the action in federal court. A judge temporarily halted enforcement while reviewing the dispute. Significantly, Coinbase’s lawsuits could set a national precedent. If courts side with federal oversight, states may lose regulatory leverage. On the other hand, a loss could fragment the market across jurisdictions. Moreover, the timing matters as major exchanges enter the space. Coinbase’s partnership with Kalshi underscores institutional confidence in prediction markets. Hence, the outcome may shape how Americans trade on real-world events.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-19 16:07:06

The U.S. Department of Justice is poised to release hundreds of thousands of Jeffrey Epstein files on December 19th. This massive document dump promises to shed light on the disgraced financier’s powerful network. However, a startling detail has emerged: these records reportedly contain notes from a meeting about Bitcoin at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion, involving former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Tether co-founder Brock Pierce. What Do the Jeffrey Epstein Files Contain? According to a report by Walter Bloomberg, the impending release centers on a vast trove of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The files are expected to detail the scope of Epstein’s associations and operations. While the primary focus remains on the serious criminal allegations, a fascinating subplot involves the digital asset world. The documents are said to chronicle a specific meeting where the future of money was discussed. This meeting reportedly took place at Epstein’s now-infamous Upper East Side mansion. The attendees were two figures from seemingly different spheres: Larry Summers, a pillar of traditional economic policy, and Brock Pierce, a pioneer in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Their topic of discussion? Bitcoin. Why is the Bitcoin Meeting in the Epstein Files Significant? The inclusion of a Bitcoin discussion within the Jeffrey Epstein files is profoundly significant for several reasons. It provides a rare, documented glimpse into how early crypto ideas permeated elite circles, even those shrouded in controversy. Historical Context: It places Bitcoin conversations within a specific, controversial timeline and social circle, offering researchers a new data point on its early adoption narrative. Credibility Questions: Any association with Epstein’s network automatically casts a long shadow, forcing the crypto community to confront uncomfortable questions about its earliest advocates and their connections. Regulatory Scrutiny: The involvement of a former top U.S. financial official like Larry Summers could influence how regulators today view the origins and early promotion of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Tether. Who Are the Key Figures Named in the Files? Understanding the players is crucial to grasping the story’s weight. The Jeffrey Epstein files connect two very different worlds through these individuals. Larry Summers served as the 71st U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under President Clinton and later as Director of the National Economic Council. He represents the apex of traditional, centralized financial power and policy-making. Brock Pierce is a venture capitalist and one of the founding members of the Tether stablecoin project and the Bitcoin Foundation. He embodies the disruptive, decentralized ethos of early cryptocurrency evangelism. The mere fact that their paths crossed in this setting is a startling detail emerging from the documents. What Could the Epstein Document Release Mean for Crypto? The impending publication of the Jeffrey Epstein files is not just a news event; it’s a potential catalyst for reflection and reputational reckoning within cryptocurrency. The industry has long battled perceptions of being a haven for bad actors. This revelation, however tangential, feeds that narrative and could have tangible effects. For Tether specifically, any renewed scrutiny of its co-founder’s past associations could prompt questions from partners, exchanges, and regulators. More broadly, it reminds the market that the decentralized nature of crypto does not absolve its prominent figures from the consequences of their real-world associations. The full impact, however, will depend on the exact contents revealed on December 19th. Conclusion: A Story of Money, Power, and Secrecy The release of the Jeffrey Epstein files promises to be a watershed moment, unraveling threads that connect elite finance, politics, and scandal. The reported Bitcoin discussion adds a complex, modern layer to this story. It shows how the idea of decentralized currency was being debated in the most centralized and secretive of rooms. For the crypto community, it’s a stark reminder that its history is intertwined with the broader, and sometimes darker, narrative of global power and influence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When will the Jeffrey Epstein files be released? A: The U.S. Department of Justice is scheduled to release the documents on December 19, according to reports. Q: What is the crypto connection in the Epstein files? A: The files reportedly contain details of a meeting at Epstein’s mansion where former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Tether co-founder Brock Pierce discussed Bitcoin. Q: Why does a Bitcoin meeting matter in this context? A: It provides historical context on Bitcoin’s early outreach to traditional finance elites and raises questions about the associations of key crypto figures. Q: Could this affect Tether (USDT)? A: While the meeting was historical, any renewed scrutiny of a co-founder’s past could lead to reputational questions, though the direct operational impact on the stablecoin is unclear. Q: Where can I find the files when they are released? A: They will likely be published on the U.S. Department of Justice or relevant federal court websites. Major news outlets will also provide analysis and excerpts. Found this dive into the intersection of scandal and cryptocurrency revealing?

President Putin recently urged the executive power to speed up its implementation, including measures to curb the widespread illegal minting of digital currencies. Moscow moves to clean up Russia’s economy on Putin’s order Authorities in Russia are taking on the task to “whiten” the nation’s economy, reports in the local press revealed this week. Crypto will be in the focus of these efforts, alongside cash and gold. Systematic work to reduce the size of the “gray” sector has already started at the government, after the intervention of the head of state, an article by the business daily Vedomosti unveiled Friday. On December 15, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Grigorenko presided over a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers to discuss expediting the drafted plan. The latter will be revised by the Ministry of Finance by December 19, to take into account the tight new deadlines suggested by Vladimir Putin, and submitted by December 22. A series of legislative amendments and new laws must be proposed by the relevant ministries and filed by January 26, the report detailed, quoting a source from the Minfin who emphasized: “A significant number of bills will be prepared, both establishing new regulations and amending existing ones.” The government presented Putin with the plan to “clean up” the economy at a meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects on December 8. The Russian leader noticed that most of the tasks in it were slated for the last quarter of 2026, months after the scheduled increase of VAT in January, and ordered that the whole process be accelerated. Putin reportedly stressed Russian officials should take it as a priority to ensure that “nothing goes into the shadows, everything operates legally, and the corresponding revenues flow into the budget.” Russia to legalize crypto and criminalize illegal mining The authors of the plan have identified several key areas where the government will focus its regulatory efforts, including cross-border trade, labor relations and lending services. Among them is the legalization of financial flows, including tighter controls on the movement of cash and gold, especially their export in the light of concerns over capital flight. Another major task is the adoption of legislation regulating transactions involving digital assets, including the circulation of cryptocurrencies. The executive arm in Moscow is also confirming previously announced intentions to impose harsher penalties for illegal crypto mining. Earlier this month, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that Russian authorities plan to introduce criminal liability for offenses such as the minting of digital coins with stolen electricity. Smaller violations of the existing legislation will result in administrative liability, Novak also revealed, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Russia legalized mining in 2024, introducing a registration regime for mining enterprises. However, the share of registered crypto farms remains quite small, around 30%. While the first regulated crypto business in Russia is admittedly benefiting its economy, the country is facing a number of issues with the industry, such as energy shortages which led to the prohibition of the activity in a dozen regions and an intensifying crackdown on unauthorized mining operations. Turnover from the industry and the growing use of cryptocurrencies under sanctions convinced the Russian government it needs to properly regulate these flows, including investments, beyond a temporary “experimental” legal regime introduced earlier this year. Comprehensive rules for the crypto market are now expected in 2026. The framework should expand investor access , although not by much, and introduce licensing for cryptocurrency exchanges.

56047080,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/stablecoins-are-quietly-becoming-daily-money-across-the-global-south,1766160815,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/56047080.jpeg,Stablecoins Are Quietly Becoming Daily Money Across the Global South,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/stablecoins-are-quietly-becoming-daily-money-across-the-global-south,"Over the past weeks the crypto market has been dominated by a deep sell-off, heavy liquidations and shrinking liquidity. Away from that noise, there is a strong trend that sees stablecoins becoming a common financial tool across large parts of the Global South. In places where inflation undermines salaries, where bank transfers are slow or unreliable, and where people depend on cross-border income, digital dollars have become a kind of quiet infrastructure. The pattern shows up in every serious dataset. Chainalysis’ 2024 geography report found that Latin America accounts for some of the strongest stablecoin usage worldwide. Argentina remains one of the clearest examples. Even though inflation has recently fallen from triple-digit levels under the new government, Argentinians continue to rely on dollar-linked assets to preserve purchasing power and navigate capital controls. More than sixty percent of the country’s crypto transaction volume consists of stablecoins, a share mirrored in Brazil and Colombia. Across the region, people use digital dollars less as a speculative tool and more as a practical way to hold value and manage everyday expenses in unstable monetary environments. Similar dynamics appear in Sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria, despite recurring conflicts with regulators and exchange operators, repeatedly ranks near the top of global crypto adoption indices. Nigerian users receive billions of dollars worth of digital assets each year, and a significant part of that flow is stablecoin activity. Some of it represents informal remittances. Some of it reflects an attempt to escape the country’s fragmented exchange-rate system, where official and street prices for the naira often diverge. Digital dollars offer a more predictable reference point than bank rates that can shift overnight. Across Southeast Asia the drivers are different but lead to the same result. Remittances are a primary use case. In markets such as the Philippines and Vietnam, large populations receive income from abroad. Conventional remittances remain expensive, often cutting deeply into wages sent home. Several studies, including those by the World Bank, put global remittance costs around four to seven percent for a typical transfer. Stablecoins have become a low-friction alternative. They travel quickly, often within minutes, and can be converted or spent locally through informal networks or crypto-to-goods platforms. For many families, the difference in fees is meaningful. What ties these regions together is not a shared view of technology but a shared set of pressures. Inflation, currency controls, high remittance costs, unreliable banking and the need for cross-border resilience create a natural demand for a digital version of the dollar. Stablecoins fill that gap. They move over a range of networks, from older chains to faster and more scalable networks or newer Layer 2 rollups. The underlying assets may sit in regulated custodians in the United States or elsewhere, but the instruments themselves circulate freely and continuously. At the consumer level, this shift is most evident in the kinds of purchases people make with digital dollars. In many markets, stablecoins are used to pay for everyday needs through intermediaries that convert crypto balances into practical goods and services. One such service, Netherlands-based Cryptorefills , offers access to a broad catalogue that includes more than 7,000 distinct gift card brands, alongside prepaid mobile credit, utility payments, eSIMs, as well as flight and hotel bookings across more than 300 airlines and over 1 million hotel properties worldwide. Because the platform spans multiple consumer categories and operates in more than 180 countries, its transactions offer a useful read on how people spend digital dollars in practice. The company reports that stablecoins account for a clear majority of purchases on its platform, with use of fast and scalable networks such as Solana and newer Layer 2 systems rising sharply. Although one dataset cannot represent the entire market, the mix of products and the geographic spread of customers make it a relevant indicator of how digital dollars circulate in day-to-day commerce. The adoption is not uniform. In Europe and North America stablecoins appear more as an efficiency tool than a necessity. Fintech firms and payment providers test them for treasury operations, inter-company transfers and cross-border settlements. Some merchants experiment with on-chain invoicing or payouts. These developments matter, but they do not carry the urgency found in markets where the local currency struggles to hold value or where people depend on income from abroad. There is also a growing policy debate. Analysts at Standard Chartered recently warned that widespread stablecoin use could draw deposits away from emerging-market banks. An estimate in one of their studies suggested that, under certain conditions, stablecoin savings in vulnerable economies could rise from the current base to more than a trillion dollars within a few years. Whether this plays out or not, it reflects the extent to which digital dollars have entered mainstream economic thinking in developing countries. Yet for most users the reasoning is simpler. Stablecoins work predictably. They settle fast, cost little to send, and behave similarly across applications. People adopt them because they need a reliable unit of account and a way to move value without the usual frictions. From Buenos Aires to Lagos to Manila, this practicality matters more than ideology or speculation. If the trend continues, the broader financial system will eventually have to adjust. For now, the rise of stablecoins across the Global South is less a technological revolution than a straightforward response to long-standing economic pressures. They have become a tool of everyday life, used quietly, without fanfare, by people trying to make their income last, pay their bills, or support their families abroad. In that sense the story is not about crypto at all. It is about how millions of people manage uncertainty, and how they build financial routines that work when the traditional ones do not.

Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.00004137 to $0.00004728. In 2031, we expect the Bonk price to reach a maximum of $0.00007683 with an average of $0.00007388. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 88.87 trillion. It is important to note that 87.99 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem that also drive Bonk’s price. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

The coin has increased by up to 3.79% during the day. BONK’s key support sits at $0.00000788. On December 19, 2025, Bonk’s price analysis indicates that the trend is in the positive direction as buyers regain control. The memecoin increased to $0.00000804 after finding support around the $0.00000759 level. BONK is up 3.79% in the last 24 hours, signaling bullish momentum and raising hopes for bullish traders as the coin recovers its recent losses. Bonk 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day BONK price analysis indicates an uptrend. This movement suggests a bullish trend as buying activity dominates selling activity. However, the chances of reversal seem high in the face of the larger downtrend. The area between the upper and lower bands of the Bollinger Bands indicator defines market volatility. As the bands are expanding, this signals an increase in volatility. The upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, serving as the resistance band, is at $0.00001038. Its lower limit, acting as the support, is around $0.00000787. BONK/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral region. Its value is 36; however, its curve is ascending. The continual upward movement of the RSI confirms a positive market sentiment. Moreover, considering the larger downtrend, this marks stability in the trading atmosphere after the return of the buying interest. BONK/USD 4-hour price chart analysis The 4-hour price chart for BONK also presents a bullish scenario of the market events. The BONK/USD pair value slightly increased to $0.0000804. The buying activities remained quite intense compared to the selling activities during the day, as the trend has changed in the past few hours. This suggests an encouraging signal for investors waiting for a dip. Volatility is increasing but is still on the lower end, which confirms higher market predictability. Moving ahead, the upper boundary of the Bollinger Bands indicator is at $0.00000894, confirming the resistance threshold. Conversely, the lower boundary of the Bollinger Bands indicator is at $0.00000753, securing stable support. BONK/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI graph displays an upward curve because of the recent support. In the past four hours, its value has improved to 42. This signals rising buying interest and, therefore, upward price movement. The RSI value can move further up in the neutral region if the bulls keep trending by the next trading session.

Bonk price analysis predicts a bullish outcome regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has ascended to $0.00000804, as an upturn was recorded today. Moreover, the overall market sentiment remained positive. Technical indicators support the bears, but the price charts favor the bulls for today. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has numerous side projects that enhance its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will approach $0.00008, making it a worthwhile investment tool. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk up? After a significant dip from $0.00001002 to $0.00000759 over the past few days, BONK is now experiencing some recovery as stakeholders start buying again. Support still exists at $0.00000788 and is expected to hold over the next trading sessions. Will Bonk reach $0.000045? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.0000189. Over the last few weeks, BONK saw a downtrend below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.00004 by 2028. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. However, analysts are optimistic about BONK, and some suggest long-term targets of $0.0001. Recent news/opinions on Bonk BONK ETP goes live on six (6) Swiss exchanges.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history. Source: Coingecko In December 2022, Bonk was launched with a price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, giving a bullish outlook according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value. In June 2023, Bonk’s price did not experience much action, and it gradually decreased to $0.0000001927 in September 2023. In October 2023, Bonk started to see bullish sentiment, with the price reaching $0.0000005518, which eventually reached $0.00002445 on December 15, 2023. Bonk closed 2023 with a price tag of $0.00001407, significantly higher than the price at the start of the year but almost 50% down from the highest price point of 2023. Bonk hit key highs in 2024, including $0.00003771 in March and an all-time high of $0.00004115 in May, before dipping to $0.0000223 in August. A late-year rally peaked at $0.00005825 in November, with the token closing 2024 at $0.00003043. At the start of January 2025, Bonk was trading at $0.00002976, and after further depreciation, it plunged to $0.000018 by February, as the market sentiment turned negative. In March, the token dipped to $0.00000959, but it recovered to $0.0000122 in April and $0.000021 in May as Bonk demand increased. In June, Bonk corrected down to $0.00001201, but in July 2025, it became bullish again and reached $0.00004072. In the middle of August, BONK was trending near $0.00002374, and at the start of October, Bonk was trading near $0.00002056. In November, Bonk traded between $0.00000847 – $0.00001379, and at the start of December, the coin is trading between $0.000009769 – $0.00001015.",Crypto Price Predictions|Bonk,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|ICO|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|WALLET|BONK|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-19 16:17:00

The ADRs will trade under the ticker MPJPY starting December 19, replacing the existing OTC trading under the ticker MTPLF. Dylan Le Clair, the company’s head of Bitcoin strategy, stated that the ADRs are currently limited to OTC trading, rather than being listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq. However, he noted that they still offer significantly lower trading fees, materially improved settlement, and much broader brokerage access. He also noted that the structure of the ADRs removes barriers for both institutional and retail investors seeking compliant ADR frameworks due to custodial and regulatory requirements. Metaplanet filed with the U.S. SEC on December 12 to register American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). The company plans to register 200 million American Depositary Shares (ADS) with a nominal value of approximately $10 million. Each ADS represents one ordinary share. Meanwhile, the Deutsche Bank Trust Company is acting as the depositary bank, and MUFG Bank is serving as the custodian in Japan. Gerovich says Metaplanet is responding to institutional and retail investors Simon Gerovich, the president of Metaplanet, said his company is responding to feedback from U.S. retail and institutional investors looking for easier access to the company’s equity. He added that launching the ADRs in the U.S. market is another step toward promoting global participation in Metaplanet. Metaplanet revealed that the ADRs will be denominated in U.S. dollars and will be traded through the U.S. securities trading infrastructure. The company’s initiative also aims to enhance transparency and accessibility for global investors while meeting the demands of U.S. investors. “This directly reflects feedback from U.S. retail and institutional investors seeking easier access to our equity.” – Simon Gerovich , President of Metaplanet Metaplanet revealed that the ADRs will have a 1:1 ratio with common shares, with a CUSIP number of 59141L 109. The company emphasizes that this ADR program will not be used for fundraising. It will also not affect the total number of preferred or common shares issued. Metaplanet shares climb over 6% after ADR announcement Metaplanet’s shares jumped 6.65% to 433 JPY (~$2.80) after the ADR program was announced. The day’s prices swung between 401 JPY (~$2.55) and 433 JPY (~$2.80). The share price beat expectations, rising despite the challenging macroeconomic environment in Japan. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 0.75%, marking the highest level in 30 years. The BOJ’s rate hike supports the Yen, but places pressure on riskier assets. However, Metaplanet’s equity does not appear to be affected by this trend. Metaplanet’s share price is expected to establish a new support level if it consolidates above the 440 JPY price range. However, it remains to be seen whether the MSCI will remove companies with high crypto holdings like Metaplanet from specific indices in 2026. Meanwhile, the company is changing its capital-raising structure to finance the purchases of more BTC without affecting the value for existing shareholders. Metaplanet plans to create two new classes of preferred shares, MARS and MERCURY. MARS shares are a financing tool featuring monthly-adjustable dividends, while MERCURY shares offer a fixed annual dividend of 4.9%. MERCURY shares also include a conversion option that is linked to the performance of Bitcoin’s price. Metaplanet said these financial strategies support its position as the world’s fourth-largest publicly traded Bitcoin treasury. Its holdings are currently valued at about $2.7 billion.

Could a simple banking change unlock the future of cryptocurrency in America? The US Federal Reserve is now considering a proposal that might just do that. According to a recent report, the Fed wants public feedback on creating new ‘payment accounts’ – a streamlined version of traditional master accounts. This move could dramatically ease crypto firm access to the central bank’s vital payment network, potentially removing a major barrier that has frustrated the industry for years. What Are Fed Payment Accounts and Why Do They Matter? The Federal Reserve’s proposal centers on creating specialized payment accounts. These accounts would function as a scaled-down alternative to the complex master accounts currently required to connect directly to the Fed’s payment systems. For cryptocurrency companies, this represents a potential breakthrough. The existing process for obtaining master accounts involves rigorous requirements that have effectively blocked many digital asset firms from participating in the traditional financial infrastructure. Think of it this way: master accounts are like VIP passes to the financial system’s most exclusive club. The new payment accounts would be like general admission tickets – still providing access, but without the impossible entry requirements. This distinction matters because direct access to the Fed’s payment network allows for faster, more secure transactions and reduces dependency on intermediary banks. How Could This Transform Crypto Firm Access? The implications for crypto firm access are substantial. Currently, many cryptocurrency businesses struggle to find banking partners willing to work with them. This creates operational challenges and adds layers of complexity to their financial operations. With direct Fed payment accounts, these companies could potentially: Process transactions more efficiently without multiple banking intermediaries Reduce settlement times for customer deposits and withdrawals Lower operational costs associated with maintaining multiple banking relationships Improve regulatory compliance through direct oversight relationships However, the proposal isn’t without its challenges. The Federal Reserve must balance innovation with risk management. They need to ensure that any new system maintains the security and stability of the national payment infrastructure while accommodating new types of financial institutions. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Banking? This development signals a potential shift in how regulators view cryptocurrency businesses. By creating a pathway for crypto firm access to payment systems, the Federal Reserve acknowledges the growing importance of digital assets in the broader financial ecosystem. The public comment period allows various stakeholders – including traditional banks, crypto companies, and consumer advocates – to shape the final proposal. Several key questions remain unanswered. Will these payment accounts come with specific restrictions for cryptocurrency companies? How will the Fed manage the unique risks associated with digital assets? What requirements will companies need to meet to qualify for these accounts? The answers to these questions will determine whether this proposal represents a genuine opening or another regulatory hurdle. Looking forward, successful implementation could create a template for other countries considering how to integrate cryptocurrency businesses into their financial systems. It represents a middle ground between complete isolation and unrestricted access – potentially setting a new standard for crypto banking worldwide. The Bottom Line: A Step Toward Financial Integration The Federal Reserve’s payment account proposal represents a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry. While details remain to be finalized, the mere consideration of specialized accounts for non-traditional financial institutions marks progress. For crypto companies, this could mean easier access to essential banking services. For consumers, it might translate to more reliable and efficient cryptocurrency services. And for the financial system as a whole, it represents an important step toward integrating innovative technologies while maintaining stability and security. Ultimately, the success of this initiative will depend on finding the right balance. The Federal Reserve must create a system that provides genuine crypto firm access without compromising the integrity of the payment network. If they succeed, this could become a landmark moment in the evolution of both traditional finance and digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are Fed payment accounts? Fed payment accounts are proposed specialized accounts that would provide access to the Federal Reserve’s payment network without requiring the complex master account status. They’re designed as a more accessible option for non-traditional financial institutions, including cryptocurrency companies. How do these differ from traditional master accounts? Traditional master accounts come with extensive requirements and oversight. The proposed payment accounts would be a scaled-down version with potentially simpler requirements, making them more accessible to cryptocurrency firms and other emerging financial institutions. When might these accounts become available? The Federal Reserve is currently in the public comment phase. After gathering feedback, they’ll need to finalize regulations and implementation plans. The timeline remains uncertain, but the proposal indicates serious consideration of this approach. Will all cryptocurrency companies qualify for these accounts? Not necessarily. The Federal Reserve will likely establish specific criteria for qualification, which may include regulatory compliance standards, financial stability requirements, and risk management protocols that companies must meet. How will this affect cryptocurrency users? If implemented successfully, users might experience faster transaction processing, potentially lower fees, and more reliable banking services from their cryptocurrency platforms. However, the exact impact will depend on how individual companies utilize these accounts. What risks does the Federal Reserve need to consider? Key risks include maintaining payment system security, preventing money laundering, ensuring adequate capital reserves, and managing the unique volatility associated with cryptocurrency assets while integrating new types of financial institutions.

This came as the pundit explained that the CLARITY Act could pass next year, which he predicts will positively impact the altcoin’s adoption. Why XRP Investors Should Think Again About Selling Their Coins In an X post , Finance Bull told XRP investors to think again if they are considering selling their coins right now. He reminded them that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that the CLARITY Act is expected in early 2026, which the pundit indicated will benefit the token when that happens. Finance Bull explained that when the CLARITY Act passes, Ripple will be forced to declare the fate of its XRP in escrow , and that when that happens, the company won’t sell its holdings. Instead, he predicts that they will pre-allocate it to bank corridors, sovereign rails, liquidity hubs powering cross-border settlement, institutional infrastructure, and countries integrating next-generation payment rails. Finance Bull further remarked that this flips the entire conversation, as what looks like overhead supply is already reserved, meaning that XRP won’t face a sell-off as some investors may fear. He added that the real move is locked liquidity flowing into banks, FX routes, and custody frameworks, which would boost the altcoin’s adoption. The pundit stated that this isn’t about market-making but about monetary wiring and that once Ripple releases its official escrow roadmap, the re-pricing will be instant, irreversible, and demand-driven. Interestingly, Finance Bull claimed that BlackRock will be one of the institutions that will adopt the altcoin when there is regulatory clarity through the CLARITY Act. Notably, BlackRock is one of the crypto ETF issuers that has yet to file for a spot XRP ETF , but the pundit has suggested that could change soon. Ripple Secures Another Institutional Partnership In a press release , Ripple announced a strategic partnership with TJM Investments, providing a boost for XRP’s adoption. The crypto firm stated that under the terms of the partnership, it has invested in THM and will continue to provide best-in-class infrastructure to support TJM’s execution and clearing services. This builds on the existing relationship between Ripple’s multi-asset prime brokerage platform, Ripple Prime , and TJM. Ripple stated that the expanded partnership will enable TJM offer its clients improved capital and collateral efficiency as well as enhanced clearing stability and balance-sheet support. This development comes as Ripple continues to explore ways to enhance the utility of RLUSD and XRP. The firm recently announced plans. The firm recently announced plans to begin testing RLUSD on Base, Optimism, Unichain, and Ink.

While short-term reactions have appeared near support, the overall structure suggests the altcoin is still in a consolidation-to-distribution phase rather than a confirmed trend reversal. XRP Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, XRP remains firmly below the descending trendline that has capped price action since the major breakdown from higher levels. This trendline continues to act as a dominant dynamic resistance, and each approach toward it has resulted in renewed selling pressure. The price is also trading below both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, reinforcing the bearish-to-neutral bias. The primary overhead supply zone is located around the $2.4 to $2.5 region, where previous breakdowns and failed reclaim attempts occurred. As long as XRP remains below this area, upside moves are likely to remain corrective. On the downside, XRP is currently trading just above a major demand zone around the $1.7 to $1.8 range. This zone has historically attracted buyers and represents the most important structural support on the daily chart. A sustained daily close below this region would significantly weaken the market structure and expose deeper downside risk. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, XRP has broken below a local descending wedge, reflecting persistent lower highs and lower lows. The recent bounce from the lower boundary of the broader channel appears reactive rather than impulsive, indicating a lack of strong buyer commitment. Short-term resistance sits around the $2 to $2.1 area, where price previously consolidated before breaking lower. This zone has now flipped into supply and aligns with the upper boundary of the descending channel. Until Ripple reclaims this level with strong momentum, upside attempts are likely to face rejection. If price fails to hold above the current support and loses acceptance below the $1.8 region, the probability of a deeper liquidity sweep increases. Such a move would likely target the lower end of the broader demand zone and potentially extend the corrective phase before any meaningful recovery can develop. Overall, Ripple remains structurally weak across both timeframes, with trend resistance overhead and critical support directly below the current price. A clear shift in structure and a reclaim of key resistance levels are required before a sustained bullish scenario becomes viable.

Even a modest shock to energy prices can ripple through economies, triggering sudden volatility across currencies, equities, and debt markets. Among cryptocurrencies, XRP could experience one of the most dramatic reactions—not from hype, but from macroeconomic forces that reveal its utility under stress. Chain Cartel, in a recent post on X, outlined how a sharp spike in oil prices could force a yen unwind and rapidly reprice XRP, highlighting a connection between energy markets, currency risk, and crypto liquidity that is rarely discussed outside specialist circles. Oil Price Spikes and Imported Inflation Oil markets remain volatile due to geopolitical tensions in key producing regions, including Venezuela and Iran. Supply disruptions at chokepoints such as the Strait of Hormuz could trigger rapid price increases. For Japan, which imports nearly all of its energy, higher oil prices directly translate into imported inflation. THE OIL SHOCK THAT COULD FORCE A YEN UNWIND AND REPRICE XRP OVERNIGHT This isn’t crypto hype. It’s macro sequencing. An oil spike (Venezuela/Iran geopolitics, chokepoints) is the fastest way to export inflation. For Japan, an energy importer, that pressure boxes the BOJ.… pic.twitter.com/tna8UyIMKe — Chain Cartel (@chaincartel) December 18, 2025 Rising inflation puts the Bank of Japan (BoJ) in a difficult position. Historically committed to ultra-loose monetary policy, the BoJ would face a stark choice : raise interest rates to defend the yen and contain inflation, or risk a sudden loss of control over price stability. Either scenario sets the stage for financial stress. The Yen Carry Trade and Liquidity Risks The yen carry trade, a longstanding global leverage mechanism, magnifies these risks. Investors borrow low-yield yen to fund higher-yielding assets abroad. When Japanese rates rise, or markets anticipate tightening, carry trades unwind violently. Historical examples—1998, 2008, 2016—show that such unwinds spark sharp yen appreciation, forced deleveraging, and simultaneous sell-offs in FX, equities, and bonds. The challenge is settlement speed. Traditional nostro/vostro and correspondent banking networks are slow under stress. When leveraged positions collapse, liquidity can vanish just when it is needed most, exacerbating market instability. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP as a Crisis-Resilient Liquidity Tool This is where XRP’s real-world utility comes into play. Unlike traditional systems, XRP enables real-time FX settlement, requires no pre-funded accounts, and provides neutral bridge liquidity . Its corridors are available 24/7, even in stressed market conditions. Japan is uniquely positioned to benefit. With deep SBI–Ripple partnerships and a regulatory environment favorable to DLT, XRP’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors are already operational. In a carry trade unwind, XRP shifts from a niche payment tool to a critical liquidity infrastructure, able to move capital instantly when conventional rails stall. From Macro Shock to Market Repricing Liquidity assets rarely adjust gradually under extreme stress; they gap. If an oil shock forces Japan to act, leveraged positions may unwind almost overnight, creating a repricing scenario for XRP. Here, the cryptocurrency’s value would stem not from speculation, but from its ability to resolve real-world settlement failures and deliver instant liquidity when markets are most fragile. In short, XRP isn’t just a speculative asset . In the face of a severe oil-induced macro shock, it could become a market-critical instrument, turning a moment of crisis into a showcase of its infrastructure value.

Buyers are trying to hold the mid-range, but momentum remains weak across higher timeframes. The current PA (price action) shows signs of temporary relief, but the broader sentiment points to continued caution from institutional players. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC is still trading within the descending channel formed over the past couple of months. Both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages are above the price, acting as resistance near $103K and $108K. So far, each bounce attempt has been capped inside the descending channel. Source: TradingView Key support remains at $80K, which has already been tested twice. If this zone fails, the next major demand lies around $72K. The RSI is also curling upward from oversold, hinting at short-term bullish momentum, but there’s no strong reversal yet. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4H chart, BTC broke down from the rising wedge that had formed earlier in December. After sweeping the $90K lows, buyers are attempting to reclaim ground, but the move lacks volume. The price is trying to establish a local higher low, but the structure still leans bearish. There is a visible rejection near $88K, which was the prior support-turned-resistance. If buyers can’t flip that area soon, another retest of the $80K area will be likely. The RSI has also recovered from the lows but remains below 60, signaling limited strength. As a result, there is still a high chance of more downside if the BTC does not break back above $90K soon. Source: TradingView Sentiment Analysis Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index The Coinbase Premium Index remains in negative territory, showing persistent selling pressure from U.S.-based institutions. This divergence has been present throughout the last couple of months and is yet to reverse. Every local pump has been met with stronger negative premium readings, suggesting that Coinbase whales are offloading into strength. Until this flips back into positive or at least neutral, macro upside remains capped. Overall, sentiment remains risk-off on the U.S. side, confirming that institutions are not yet ready to re-accumulate aggressively.

The plan aims to fundamentally restructure its EIGEN token incentives system. This overhaul directly targets how participants are rewarded for securing the network and generating value. What’s Driving the Change in EIGEN Token Incentives? The core objective is clear: align rewards with real, measurable contributions. The current proposal, reported by CoinDesk, seeks to move away from a static model. Instead, it wants to tie EIGEN token incentives directly to network activity and the fees generated. This creates a more sustainable and performance-driven economy. Imagine a system where your rewards aren’t fixed but grow with the ecosystem’s success. That’s the future EigenLayer envisions. The goal is to foster genuine participation and long-term security, not just passive holding. How Will the New Incentive System Work? The proposal introduces a novel structure with two primary pillars. First, it emphasizes securing Actively Validated Services (AVS). These are the critical middleware services built on top of EigenLayer. Second, it rewards expansion within the broader EigenCloud ecosystem. To manage this dynamic system, the foundation plans to form a dedicated incentives committee. This committee’s crucial role will be to adjust token issuance parameters. Therefore, they can respond to network growth and changing conditions. Reward Contributors: Users who actively help secure AVS operations. Boost Ecosystem Growth: Participants who expand the utility and reach of EigenCloud. Dynamic Adjustments: A committee ensures the EIGEN token incentives remain effective and fair. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges? This revolutionary shift promises several key advantages. For the network, it enhances security by directly rewarding those who protect it. For token holders, it creates a clearer link between their actions and their rewards. This can lead to a more robust and valuable ecosystem overall. However, implementing such a change is not without its hurdles. Governance complexity increases when a committee has significant control. Furthermore, the community must trust this committee to make adjustments that benefit the entire network, not just select groups. Striking this balance will be critical for success. Why Should the Crypto Community Pay Attention? EigenLayer’s restaking model is already a major innovation in decentralized finance. This proposal to refine its EIGEN token incentives represents the next logical step. It shows a project maturing from launch phase to sustainable growth. Other projects in the space will likely watch the outcome closely. A successful implementation could set a new standard for aligning tokenomics with real-world utility and security. The focus on fee generation is particularly noteworthy, as it grounds the token’s value in actual economic activity. Conclusion: A Step Towards a More Sustainable Future The EigenLayer Foundation’s proposal marks a bold step forward. By overhauling the EIGEN token incentives , it aims to build a more resilient, active, and valuable network. The shift towards activity-based rewards could significantly deepen user engagement and strengthen the protocol’s foundational security. Ultimately, this move underscores a commitment to long-term health over short-term gains. The crypto community now awaits the governance vote, which will determine if this visionary plan becomes reality. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of the new EIGEN token incentives proposal? A1: The main goal is to restructure rewards so they are based on network activity and fee generation, rather than a static model, to better incentivize security and ecosystem growth. Q2: Who will manage the new incentive system? A2: A new incentives committee will be formed to oversee and adjust the token issuance parameters based on network performance and needs. Q3: What are Actively Validated Services (AVS)? A3: AVS are middleware services (like oracles, bridges) built on EigenLayer that require economic security. The new incentives aim to reward users who help secure these services. Q4: How does this benefit an ordinary EIGEN token holder or staker? A4: It creates a clearer, more direct link between active participation (like securing AVS) and rewards, potentially leading to higher returns for those who contribute meaningfully to the network. Q5: When will this proposal be implemented? A5: It is currently a governance proposal. Implementation depends on the outcome of a community vote by EIGEN token holders. Q6: Could this change make the tokenomics more complex? A6: Yes, it introduces more dynamic variables. However, the intent is to create a fairer and more sustainable model that responds to real ecosystem use. Found this analysis of the evolving EIGEN token incentives helpful?

None of that helped the market though. Bitcoin punished almost every strategy that aimed to profit from big price swings. Directional crypto funds ended November down 2.5%, putting them on track for their weakest year since many dropped more than 30% three years ago. The pain spread well beyond these funds. Long-term, research-heavy strategies that filled portfolios with blockchain projects and altcoins fell about 23% after severe drawdowns. Only the cautious players made it out ahead. According to Crypto Insights Group, quant models built around altcoins broke down as liquidity disappeared, akin to the chaos during the FTX and Terra Luna crash of 2022, saying the market felt far less mature than many had assumed. Bitcoin’s early rally created plenty of movement but very little usable liquidity. Price jumps came fast and disappeared just as quickly, making it hard for managers to enter or exit without slipping. At the same time, institutional money poured in through ETFs and structured products. Wall Street firms tightened spreads and ate into once-profitable arbitrage trades. The long-loved spot-futures carry, known as the basis trade, delivered almost nothing. What used to give reliable double-digit returns each month barely produced scraps. Trouble appeared even before the fall sell-off. Altcoins failed to produce a summer run. Token launches stalled. Retail stayed quiet. An index tracking the performance of alternative coins hit its lowest level since the 2020 pandemic. Managers were waiting for momentum that never came. October crash wipes out positions and exposes weak systems Everything worsened on Oct. 10, when Trump’s campaign pledge to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods pushed Bitcoin down 14% within hours. Close to $20 billion in leveraged positions vanished. For Thomas Chladek, managing director at Forteus, the meltdown hit while he was in the air. “I was boarding a flight from Asia to Europe,” Chladek said . “I was checking a few managed accounts and mid-flight everything started collapsing.” Chladek said, “The Trump tweet may have triggered a risk-off mood, but it’s not responsible for an 80% crash in certain coins. The issue was mismanagement of collateral that triggered cascading liquidations in a dry market after market makers pulled out.” Yuval Reisman, founder of Atitlan Asset Management, described the year as driven by “Trump volatility,” with sudden moves tied to policy and politics. Altcoin mean-reversion funds, which depend on short-term price corrections, were hit the hardest. Many tokens dropped more than 40% in hours. Kacper Szafran, founder of M-Squared, said his company shut down strategies that relied too much on thin order books. M-Squared fell 3.5% in October, its worst result since November 2022, before posting a 1.6% gain last month. Meanwhile, market-neutral funds avoided most of the damage. Bohumil Vosalik, chief executive of 319 Capital, said funds with well-placed collateral “were able to generate 1% to 3% of gross returns in less than an hour.” His company closed October up 1.5% and November up 0.4%, bringing year-to-date gains to 12.2%.

Musk's Cryptic Post Explodes Confusion,https://coinpaper.com/13229/which-doge-musk-s-cryptic-post-explodes-confusion,"A viral chart documenting a sharp decline in U.S. federal employment during President Trump's second term has sparked unexpected confusion in cryptocurrency markets. The graphic's reference to ”DOGE” has created ambiguity between Dogecoin traders and discussions of government workforce reductions. The chart, shared by analyst Crémieux and amplified by Elon Musk, shows federal employment dropping from over 3.0 million workers to approximately 2.75 million in 2025. Crémieux's caption stating ”DOGE really did axe the federal workforce” has generated cross-market interpretation challenges. Cryptocurrency Community Reacts to Government Narrative Dogecoin, the meme-based cryptocurrency trading under the ticker DOGE, experienced heightened social media activity following the chart's circulation. The connection stems from confusion between the cryptocurrency and references to the Department of Government Efficiency, which also uses the DOGE acronym. Elon Musk's involvement compounds the confusion. The Tesla and SpaceX executive has long associations with Dogecoin, frequently posting content that moves the cryptocurrency's price. His comment on the federal workforce chart, stating ”The matrix was reprogrammed,” appeared in threads where discussions of both government efficiency and cryptocurrency overlap. Cryptocurrency tracking platforms recorded an increase in search volume for Dogecoin-related terms, coinciding with the chart's viral spread. Social media threads that mixed government workforce commentary with cryptocurrency speculation created informational noise, obscuring both topics. The memecoin community has historically demonstrated sensitivity to Musk's social media activity. Previous posts referencing Dogecoin, even tangentially, have triggered trading volume spikes and price volatility. The current situation presents a more complex dynamic where government policy discussions carry cryptocurrency ticker symbols. Market Impact Remains Unclear Amid Narrative Overlap Traditional financial analysis struggles to establish direct causation between federal workforce data and cryptocurrency price movements. Dogecoin trades primarily on sentiment and social media momentum rather than fundamental economic indicators. The viral chart entered an environment where the DOGE ticker already carried significant speculative interest. The memecoin has gained 1.99% in the last 24 hours, trading at around $0.1313 at the time of writing.

The company said trading of its sponsored Level I ADRs will begin Friday on the U.S. over-the-counter market under the ticker symbol MPJPY, according to an announcement. Each ADR will represent one ordinary Metaplanet share and will trade in U.S. dollars. The program is being launched with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas acting as depositary, while MUFG Bank will serve as custodian for the underlying shares in Japan. Metaplanet Shares Jump After Company Upgrades U.S. Trading Structure Metaplanet said the decision followed growing demand from U.S. retail and institutional investors who have been seeking a more direct and efficient way to gain exposure to the company’s equity. Chief executive Simon Gerovich said the move reflects feedback the company has received over several quarters and marks another step in expanding global access to Metaplanet’s stock.

Instead, the structure is intended to improve settlement efficiency, lower transaction costs, and increase transparency for U.S. investors who face operational and regulatory hurdles when trading foreign-listed stocks directly. Metaplanet’s shares have previously traded in the U.S. under the symbol MTPLF, but that arrangement was not part of a sponsored ADR program. The company said the earlier trading format involved no formal agreement with a depositary bank and limited its ability to provide consistent disclosures and investor support. By contrast, the new sponsored ADR framework places Metaplanet directly within the program’s governance and reporting structure, aligning it more closely with standard practices used by internationally listed companies. Source: Google Finance The announcement appeared to be welcomed by the market, as Metaplanet shares rose 6.65% in Tokyo trading following the news, closing at 433 yen. After Rapid Bitcoin Accumulation, Metaplanet Taps the Brakes The U.S. listing comes as Metaplanet continues to refine its broader Bitcoin-focused balance sheet strategy. Since launching its Bitcoin acquisition plan in April 2024, the company has accumulated 30,823 BTC, making it one of the largest corporate holders globally alongside Strategy. Metaplanet acquired roughly 29,000 BTC during 2025 but paused further purchases in late September, with its most recent acquisition dated Sept. 29, according to Bitcointreastries.net data. Source: Bitcointreasuries That pause followed a period of volatility for Bitcoin treasury companies, as falling share prices pushed some firms’ enterprise values below the market value of their Bitcoin holdings. Metaplanet faced similar pressure in mid-October , when concerns emerged over its market-to-Bitcoin net asset value ratio. Metaplanet's mNAV hits 0.99, trading below $3.4B Bitcoin reserves as one in four treasury firms are trading at discount, with corporate buying down 95% since July. #Metaplanet #Bitcoin https://t.co/1KgbHxWGf5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 14, 2025 The company said that ratio has since recovered above 1 and stood at 1.12 at the time of publication. Equity Raises, Bitcoin Loans, and a Strategy-Style Structure Metaplanet has relied on a mix of equity and debt instruments to fund its Bitcoin strategy. In November, the company approved the issuance of 23.61 million Mercury Class B preferred shares through a third-party allocation, raising about ¥21.25 billion, or roughly $135 million.

Around the same time, Metaplanet disclosed a new $130 million loan backed entirely by Bitcoin under an existing $500 million credit facility. As of its latest treasury update, the company’s Bitcoin holdings were valued at roughly $2.7 billion, based on an average acquisition cost of $108,070 per coin.

A new analysis reveals that XRP whale selling pressure is intensifying, threatening to drown any short-term bullish sentiment. This persistent selling from large holders could push prices significantly lower, regardless of positive regulatory developments. What Does the Data Say About XRP Whale Selling Pressure? CryptoQuant contributor PelinayPA has identified a concerning trend. Recent data shows that most XRP flowing into major exchanges like Binance comes from massive wallets. Specifically, the analysis points to wallets holding between 100,000 and one million XRP, and those with over one million tokens. This pattern clearly indicates that whales, not everyday retail investors, are driving the current XRP whale selling pressure . Historically, such spikes in exchange deposits are a major red flag. When large amounts of a cryptocurrency move to trading platforms, it typically signals that holders intend to sell. This action increases the available supply on the market. If demand does not rise to meet this new supply, the price inevitably falls. Therefore, the current XRP whale selling pressure creates a fundamental imbalance that bulls must overcome. How Low Could XRP Price Go? The analysis identifies a critical support zone between $1.82 and $1.87. However, PelinayPA issues a stark warning. If the large-scale transfers by whales continue unabated, this support may not hold. The next likely target becomes a much lower range between $1.50 and $1.66. Several key factors support this bearish outlook: No Bullish Reversal Signs: The current chart shows no technical indicators suggesting an imminent trend change. Stiff Resistance: XRP repeatedly faces selling every time it approaches the $1.95 price level. Overwhelming Supply: The constant inflow of tokens to exchanges suggests supply is currently overpowering demand. In simple terms, the market is struggling to absorb the coins the whales are offloading. Until this XRP whale selling pressure subsides, a significant price rebound appears unlikely. ETF Hopes vs. Whale Reality: Which Will Win? This situation creates a fascinating conflict for investors. On one side, there is the potential catalyst of a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States. Such an event would likely bring a flood of new institutional capital and demand. On the other side, the present XRP whale selling pressure represents a powerful opposing force. The critical question is timing. Will ETF approval arrive before whale selling pushes the price to lower support levels? The analysis suggests the selling is happening now, while the ETF remains a future possibility. This mismatch in timing gives the whales a clear advantage in the short term. Their actions are dictating the current price action, overshadowing the hopeful narrative. What Should XRP Investors Watch For? For traders and holders, monitoring exchange flow data becomes crucial. A sustained decrease in XRP deposits to exchanges would be the first sign that the XRP whale selling pressure is easing. This would be a necessary precondition for any durable price recovery. Until then, the path of least resistance seems to be down. Investors should prepare for continued volatility and the possibility of testing the $1.50-$1.66 support zone. The battle between long-term ETF optimism and short-term whale distribution is defining XRP’s current market phase. Conclusion: A Market at a Crossroads The story of XRP is currently a tale of two forces. The hopeful promise of an ETF-driven future clashes with the immediate reality of whale distribution. While the long-term outlook may brighten with regulatory progress, the short-term price path is being carved by large holders exiting their positions. Navigating this market requires patience and a close eye on on-chain data, as the XRP whale selling pressure remains the dominant theme for now. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is causing the current XRP whale selling pressure? The selling pressure is primarily coming from wallets holding between 100,000 and over 1 million XRP. These large holders, or “whales,” are moving their tokens to exchanges like Binance, which typically indicates an intent to sell. Could an XRP ETF approval stop the price decline? While an ETF approval would be a massively positive event, bringing new demand, it might not immediately counteract sustained selling from whales. The timing of the approval versus the current selling wave is key. What is the key support level for XRP mentioned in the analysis? The analysis identifies a primary support zone between $1.82 and $1.87. If whale selling continues, the price could fall further to a secondary range of $1.50 to $1.66. How can I track XRP whale activity? You can monitor on-chain data platforms like CryptoQuant or Glassnode, which track large wallet movements and exchange inflows. A decrease in exchange deposits is a positive sign. Is this a good time to buy XRP? This depends on your investment strategy. The analysis suggests caution in the short term due to selling pressure. Long-term investors might see lower prices as an accumulation opportunity, but should be prepared for further volatility. What needs to happen for XRP to reverse its trend? A significant trend reversal would likely require two things: a sustained decrease in XRP flowing into exchanges (reduced selling pressure) and a strong new catalyst, like an ETF approval, to boost demand.

The latest findings come from blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps, which published an analysis on X showing that around 40% of AVA’s total supply was accumulated at launch by a cluster of wallets linked to the token’s deployer. Remember $AVA ? 40% bundled at launch, linked to the deployer Your AI girlfriend took all your money pic.twitter.com/31uMnlglfi — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) December 18, 2025 Wallet Clustering Points to AVA Token Sniping at Launch According to Bubblemaps, the wallets were funded shortly before launch, showed no prior on-chain activity, and bought large amounts of AVA as soon as the token became available. AVA launched on Nov. 13, 2024, on Pump.fun, a Solana-based memecoin launch platform that promotes fair and decentralized token launches. The project gained early attention as one of the first 3D AI agent tokens, backed by Holoworld AI, a Polychain Capital portfolio company. By January 2025, AVA had reached a fully diluted valuation of roughly $300 million, driven by a surge of interest in AI-themed crypto projects . Bubblemaps said its analysis identified 23 wallets, including the deployer, that were funded within tight time windows through centralized exchanges such as Binance and Bitget. Source: Bubblemaps The wallets received similar amounts of SOL and then used automated trading strategies to buy AVA at launch. The firm added that additional wallets connected to this initial cluster followed similar funding and timing patterns, which it said strongly suggests coordination rather than independent participation. In crypto markets, this practice is commonly referred to as sniping , where bots are used to purchase new tokens the moment they become tradable, often securing large allocations before retail participants can react. While sniping itself is not illegal, a heavy concentration of supply among early wallets can increase the risk of sharp sell-offs if those holders decide to exit. The firm said the analysis shows that despite AVA’s public positioning as a community-driven launch, a single coordinated entity ended up controlling a large share of the supply. AVA’s Market Reality Sets In as Token Sheds 96% From All-Time High More than a year after launch, the impact is visible in the token’s market performance. AVA is down over 79% from its launch price and more than 96% from its all-time high of about $0.33, reached on Jan. 15, 2025, according to CoinGecko data. Source: CoinGecko The token now trades near $0.01, erasing most of its early gains. This decline has occurred despite continued development by the team behind Holoworld AI. The project describes Ava as the first AI agent virtual image token, designed to power audiovisual AI agents capable of interaction and emotional expression. Holoworld claims to have created more than 10,000 3D virtual characters, partnered with over 25 IP and NFT brands, and attracted more than 1 million users. Even so, those developments have not prevented a steep drop in AVA’s market value. AVA has a fixed total supply of 1 billion tokens, with 50 million released at launch as part of a 5% public sale. The broader token distribution includes long-term allocations for community incentives, the team, private investors, liquidity, and ecosystem development, many of which are subject to vesting schedules. The episode adds to a growing list of cases where Bubblemaps has flagged concentrated token ownership shortly after launch. In recent months, the firm has published similar analyses involving PEPE , the $WET presale on Solana , MYX Finance’s airdrop , and other high-profile tokens, often pointing to coordinated wallet behavior and heavy early sell pressure. While not all cases resulted in enforcement action or project failures, they have intensified scrutiny around fair-launch claims and insider transparency.

Allocation tightens. Participation rises. Price movement indicates gradual demand and not imminent upsurge. That is now evident about one new cryptocurrency that has traversed through 2025 with steady improvements. Now that Phase 6 is going into full production, the interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is generating more momentum in the crypto investing industry, particularly those who are monitoring early-stage DeFi crypto development with a clear roadmap. Mutuum Finance Presale Development and Vision In early 2025, Mutuum Finance released its token offering according to a multi-phase structure. In each of the stages, the price was introduced with a fixed quantity of tokens. The demand was exhausted one phase and the other opened at a premium price. The token began at $0.01 and it currently stands at $0.035, which is 250% of Phase 1. Mutuum Finance already raised $19.4M and exceeded 18,500 holders, which is not an indication of flash distribution but rather of the participation. The project itself is targeted at decentralized lending/borrowing. The users will be in a position to provide assets as a means of generating yield or to borrow using the security of assets in a system that readjusts the interest rates based on actual use. This is intended to help steady activity rather than cycle on attention. V1 and Security Reviews The milestone of development is now becoming the perspective of the analysts regarding MUTM. The original version of the protocol is set to launch to the Sepolia testnet in 2025/Q4, according to the statements the Mutuum Finance team went on to share on X. Liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens and an automated liquidator bot make this V1 release, and ETH and USDT are the first supported assets. The development has gone hand in hand with security preparation. Mutuum Finance has graduated a CertiK Token Scan with a 90/100 rating, and an external audit by Halborn Security is currently looking into the completed contracts. An external code test is helped with a $50k-bug-bounty. According to this arrangement, some analysts reckon that, when V1 testing is launched, MUTM may be bolstered by 2x at its present level as the market makes pricing based on live use as opposed to planned use. Stablecoin and Layer-2 Plans Moving in the future, Mutuum Finance will launch a stablecoin pegged to the interest of borrowers according to the official roadmap. This asset is intended to be interconnected with the lending structure and facilitate the less volatile applications. Other plans involved in the roadmap are expansion of the layers to be used in layer-2 to mitigate the transaction-costs and enhance the speed. This upgrade may also be used to enhance the increased usage levels as the protocol increases. The system is based on accurate pricing. To support decentralized oracle infrastructure, Chainlink data feeds, and fallback sources to aid the preservation of reliable valuations, Mutuum Finance will count on decentralised oracle infrastructure. Together with these factors, analysts in a bullish case assume possible growth of between 400% and 500% on the current status in the event of adopting it till 2026. Such crypto forecasts rely on performance and the market in general. Why Phase 6 Matters Right Now Phase 6 is already more than 99% allocated and this implies that there is minimal supply left at the level of $0.035. The second step will increase the token price by an average of 20% and it will be near the token price of the official launch of $0.06. Of the 4B total supply manufacturability 45.5% or approximately 1.82B tokens were set aside to the presale. Over 820M tokens have already been sold. This supply squeeze is modifying the behavior of investors. The recent activity has indicated that bigger allocations are coming into view with availability becoming smaller. Market commentators usually interpret this to mean that participants are getting in in advance of a shift in visibility. Closing Perspective Mutuum Finance has come to the stage when the growth metrics, growth, and token structure are aligned. A 250% increase since launch. Phase 6 is nearly complete. V1 testing is approaching. Security reviews underway. MUTM currently stands at a pivotal point for those people who monitor the potential best crypto opportunities, and those who want to know what crypto to invest in during the end of the year 2025. This phase might determine the transition of the project to the next stage of the market view as Phase 6 ends and the pricing proceeds to increase.

Bulls continue to lose ground as upside momentum fades, while sentiment across the market remains dominated by apathy and underlying fear. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Elevated Downside Risk: Loss Selling Takes Hold As STH SOPR Falls Below 1 Trading activity has thinned, relief rallies have been short-lived, and many participants appear hesitant to commit capital in a market that lacks clear directional conviction. As price drifts sideways under key resistance, the broader narrative has shifted from optimism to caution. Despite this weak price action, on-chain derivatives data tells a more complex story. According to a CryptoQuant report, Ethereum’s derivatives market on Binance is reaching record levels, highlighting a sharp rise in risk appetite and speculative positioning among traders. Leverage across ETH contracts has expanded significantly, suggesting that market participants are increasingly willing to take on risk in anticipation of a directional move. This behavior points to growing optimism beneath the surface, even as spot price struggles to reflect it. The divergence between subdued price action and rising derivatives exposure creates a tense market environment. Ethereum Leverage Reaches Extreme Levels The CryptoQuant analysis by CryptoOnchain highlights a critical shift in Ethereum’s derivatives landscape, underscoring how speculative positioning has reached extreme levels. According to the data, Ethereum’s Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) on Binance has surged to 0.611, marking a new all-time high for this metric. A rising ELR indicates that traders are taking on increasingly large leveraged positions relative to the exchange’s reserves. At the same time, the report explains that buying aggression has intensified. On December 19, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio spiked to 1.13, a level not observed since September 2023. A ratio above one indicates that aggressive buyers are dominating order flow, with traders actively lifting offers rather than passively waiting. This combination of elevated leverage and strong taker buying reflects a market leaning heavily toward bullish expectations. The convergence of these two indicators sends a clear message: traders are not only optimistic about Ethereum’s price trajectory, but they are also willing to assume substantial risk to express that view. However, this structure comes with meaningful downside risks. While high leverage can amplify upside momentum and fuel a breakout through resistance, it also creates fragility. With leverage at historic highs, even a modest price pullback could trigger cascading liquidations, increasing the probability of a sharp “long squeeze” and sudden volatility.

ETH is currently trading around the $2,950 area after a short-term rebound, yet the broader structure remains fragile. The recent bounce has pushed price back toward the descending short-term moving average, but ETH continues to trade below both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are now acting as dynamic resistance rather than support. Structurally, Ethereum has formed a series of lower highs since the October peak near $4,800, confirming a clear downtrend on the medium-term timeframe. The failure to reclaim the $3,200–$3,300 zone is particularly notable, as this area previously acted as strong support during the uptrend and has now flipped into resistance. As long as ETH remains below this range, bullish attempts are likely to be sold into. While the latest rebound came with a modest increase in volume, it remains well below the levels observed during impulsive upside moves earlier in the year. This suggests short-covering or tactical buying rather than strong spot demand.

A decisive break below this zone would expose ETH to a deeper retracement toward the $2,500 area. For the bearish structure to weaken meaningfully, Ethereum must reclaim the $3,200 level and hold above its key moving averages with expanding volume.

56049930,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248306,1766165411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Move: Klarna Now Accepts Stablecoin Funding via Coinbase Partnership,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/klarna-stablecoin-funding-coinbase/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Move: Klarna Now Accepts Stablecoin Funding via Coinbase Partnership In a groundbreaking move that bridges traditional finance with the crypto economy, Swedish fintech giant Klarna has partnered with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to introduce stablecoin funding options. This strategic alliance represents a significant step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, allowing millions of Klarna users to leverage digital assets for everyday purchases. The Klarna stablecoin funding initiative could fundamentally reshape how consumers interact with both e-commerce and digital currencies. What Does the Klarna and Coinbase Partnership Mean for Users? This collaboration enables Klarna customers to use select stablecoins—cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar—to fund their purchases through Klarna’s popular ‘Pay Later’ and financing services. Essentially, you can now shop at thousands of online retailers using digital currency through Klarna’s platform, with Coinbase facilitating the crypto transactions. This integration creates a seamless bridge between the crypto you hold and the goods you want to buy. The partnership addresses a common pain point for crypto enthusiasts: converting digital assets into spendable currency often involves multiple steps and fees. With Klarna stablecoin funding , that process becomes instantaneous. Moreover, it demonstrates growing institutional confidence in cryptocurrency’s role within mainstream financial systems. Why Is Stablecoin Funding a Game-Changer? Stablecoins offer the technological benefits of cryptocurrency—speed, transparency, borderless transactions—without the extreme price volatility associated with assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This makes them ideal for everyday commerce. Klarna’s decision to embrace this technology signals several important developments: Mainstream Validation: A major fintech player legitimizes crypto for daily use User Convenience: Streamlines spending for crypto holders Financial Innovation: Merges decentralized finance with traditional payment systems Market Expansion: Opens Klarna to the growing crypto user base For consumers, this means more flexibility and choice in how they manage their finances. You’re no longer limited to traditional bank accounts or credit lines when using Klarna’s services. What Are the Practical Benefits of This Integration? The Klarna stablecoin funding option delivers tangible advantages for different user groups. Crypto investors can now easily utilize their digital assets for purchases without going through complex conversion processes. Meanwhile, traditional shoppers gain exposure to innovative payment methods with potentially lower transaction costs. Consider these practical implications: Faster Transactions: Blockchain-based payments can settle more quickly than some bank transfers Global Accessibility: Stablecoins work across borders without currency conversion hassles Financial Inclusion: Provides options for those with limited access to traditional banking Portfolio Utility: Turns crypto holdings into spendable assets instantly However, users should remain aware of cryptocurrency’s regulatory landscape and ensure they understand the terms governing these transactions. How Does This Impact the Broader Fintech and Crypto Landscape? Klarna’s move represents more than just a new payment option—it’s a strategic positioning at the intersection of two rapidly evolving industries. As fintech companies seek differentiation and crypto platforms pursue mainstream adoption, such partnerships create powerful synergies. This collaboration likely signals a trend toward deeper integration between traditional financial services and blockchain technology. Other fintech firms may now feel pressure to explore similar crypto integrations to remain competitive. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchanges gain valuable exposure to Klarna’s extensive merchant network and customer base. The Klarna stablecoin funding initiative could accelerate institutional adoption across the financial sector. What Should Users Consider Before Using Stablecoin Funding? While exciting, this new option requires careful consideration. Users should understand the specific stablecoins accepted, any associated fees, and how transactions appear on their crypto tax reports. Additionally, although stablecoins aim to maintain consistent value, they’re not risk-free—regulatory changes or issuer issues could impact their stability. Always review: Which stablecoins Klarna accepts through Coinbase Transaction fees compared to traditional payment methods Your country’s cryptocurrency regulations and tax implications The security measures protecting your digital assets Starting with small transactions can help you become comfortable with the process before committing larger amounts to Klarna stablecoin funding . Conclusion: A Significant Step Toward Crypto Commerce The Klarna-Coinbase partnership marks a pivotal moment in financial technology convergence. By enabling Klarna stablecoin funding , these companies have created a practical bridge between cryptocurrency holdings and everyday spending. This move not only benefits current crypto users but also introduces traditional consumers to digital assets through familiar shopping experiences. As this integration develops, watch for expanded stablecoin options, additional features, and potential imitation by competitors. The fusion of fintech flexibility with cryptocurrency innovation promises to make digital assets more useful and accessible than ever before.

According to the announcement, it has collaborated with global banks to design features like real-time transaction validation and smart contract enforcement for tokenized assets. In an interview, Thierry Chilosi, our Chief Business Officer, stated , “We Swift, will take the lead at the infrastructure level, making sure the technology is there. We’ve collaborated with Consensys for the first phase of the prototype, but working with the financial institutions is critical.” Swift collaborates with over 30 global financial institutions Swift will initially focus on enabling real-time, 24/7 cross-border payments, which should make the process more cost-effective. Its main advantage is that its existing network is already usable in over 200 countries and connects more than 11,000 banks that use it to send trillions of dollars every day. The group of more than 30 global financial institutions that will help design and build the ledger includes JPMorgan, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, MUFG, BNP Paribas, Santander, and OCBC. It also has branches from other banks in the Middle East and Africa. Thierry Chilos stated that they are currently consulting with the Central Bank to ensure they choose the best settlement model and the best tokens for the exchange to occur. The ledger project is based on Swift’s digital asset tests from the last two years. Through a number of pilot programs involving banks and other financial institutions, the organization has been looking into how well distributed ledger technology works with existing fiat currency systems. As reported by Cryotopolitan, so far, Swift has experimented with Ripple’s XRP Ledger and Hedera’s Hashgraph (HBAR). This sparked some excitement in the crypto community. SWIFT processes over $150 trillion in cross-border transactions annually. Analysts say that even a small amount of that flow moving to blockchains like XRP or HBAR might create a huge demand for these coins. Other analysts state that Swift is building ‘Ripple without saying Ripple.’ According to them, SWIFT’s development is consistent with the framework Ripple has been developing over the past decade. This model centers on a neutral settlement layer that allows financial institutions to transact with real-time finality while maintaining visibility across a shared ledger. Traditional banks set to enter the crypto space Banks are getting ready to get more involved in the crypto market in 2026. In 2026, State Street will also start offering crypto custody services. The project relies on the bank’s current connections with technology companies like Taurus, which puts the bank in a good position to serve asset managers who need regulated digital asset storage. Deutsche Bank is also advancing plans for a crypto custody platform set to launch in 2026. The project involves collaborations with firms such as Bitpanda’s technology division and Taurus. This will enable the bank to offer compliant custody for digital assets in European and other markets. In the meantime, analysts and executives, including those from Bitwise, said that 2026 might be a big year for banks to get involved in crypto, thanks to clearer regulations and more interest from users.

Skepticism is spreading among alternative cryptocurrencies. What’s causing this shake-up in the market? Which digital coins hold potential for recovery? Stay tuned to discover which altcoins are poised for a rebound. Ethereum Shows Resilience with Potential for Growth Source: tradingview Ethereum is currently trading between nearly $2900 and over $3300. Despite a recent drop of around 8% in the past week, the six-month view shows a strong recovery of about 29%. This reveals a promising potential for Ethereum. If it breaks past the first resistance near $3600, it could aim for the second at over $4000. The RSI value suggests it's nearing overbought territory, indicating buying interest. The upcoming target could represent a potential upside of roughly 21% from the current range. Ethereum has room for upward movement, making it worth watching for possible growth as it tries to push through key resistance levels. Conclusion ETH experienced a drop as confidence in altcoins wanes. This decline reflects a broader trend affecting many cryptocurrencies such as ETH, BTC, ADA, and DOT. Investors are acting cautiously, leading to reduced demand. Redistribution of assets towards more stable investments may continue if sentiment does not improve.

BMNR’s differentiated strategy—debt-free structure, dividend, and growth via Moonshot and MAVAN—positions it beyond a mere ETH holder. Leadership’s Wall Street and crypto pedigree uniquely bridges institutional capital and blockchain innovation, enhancing BMNR’s strategic value. Investors effectively get BMNR’s Moonshots and MAVAN segments for free, with upside tied to ETH adoption and potential for systemically critical scale.

Click here to find out more » Tokenization of Real World Assets (RWAs) is set to be one of the major themes of the next decade. Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (BMNR) is the largest ETH Digital Asset Treasury (DAT), has no debt, and pays a small dividend. Any future cash flows from their MoonShots and Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN) are not priced into the stock. BMNR’s leadership team is well positioned to be the bridge between crypto and Wall Street as they help to facilitate Ethereum’s continued adoption as Wall Street blockchain of choice. Current tailwinds from the crypto friendly political environment and Wall Street adoption could transform BMNR into a systemically critical business over the next decade. On October 14 th of 2025, Larry Fink declared that we are in the beginning phases of the “tokenization of all assets.” In November, J.P. Morgan rolled out their own deposit token utilizing Base, an Ethereum L2. This represents a complete 180 degree turn from where Larry Fink and Jamie Dimon once stood on crypto currency. Investors who are sleeping on this trend, should sit up and pay attention. The best way to play this trend is through BMNR. Currently BMNR is priced based on a multiple to net asset value (mNAV) that seems to fluctuate from 0.9-1.3. Sometimes it trades at a slight discount to their net asset value and sometimes it trades at a slight premium. Pricing BMNR this way misses the entire story. Investors should take every opportunity to buy BMNR at or below NAV. By doing so they gain exposure to ETH while receiving the MoonShots and Made In America Validator Network (MAVAN) segments of the business for free. BMNR Overview As of this writing on December 15 th , BMNR has a book value of about $13.3 billion dollars. The current market cap of the stock at right around $32 per share sits at approximately $13.7 billion so roughly a 1.03 mNAV. Purchasing around this price level is incredibly attractive because for all intents and purposes it’s at book value, which includes crypto, cash, and a $38 million dollar investment in Eightco Holdings Inc. (ORBS). Purchasers of BMNR stock at this level are getting any future cashflows from BMNR’s Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN) and MoonShots segments for free. BMNR’s business strategy has 4 lines of effort detailed below that will drive an eventual rerating of the stock. BMNR Corporate Presentation 5% of the Ethereum Network BMNR currently owns 3.2% of all ETH. Their goal is to get to 5%. Digital Asset Treasuries either use debt or equity to fund their crypto purchases. BMNR to date has used nothing but equity. They have zero debt. Crypto currencies are incredibly volatile. 80% declines are not out of the question. So, when DATs use debt, it opens the door to a scenario where the crypto currency may survive but the DAT may go extinct. By not carrying any debt, BMNR has eliminated this existential threat. As long as ETH exists, so will BMNR at this point. At 5%, BMNR would be a market stabilizing force for ETH as they take that 5% supply out of the market. It is likely that this percentage will increase over time either through BMNR’s continued purchases with staking revenue or sustained deflationary periods where the total amount of ETH decreases due to high transaction volume. Here’s an estimate of what those staking revenues might look like: ETH Market Cap: $375 Billion with each ETH value at around $3000 Value of BMNR’s ETH once they reach 5%: $18.75 billion $18.75 billion x 2.9% staking revenue: $543.75 million This should be incredibly high margin revenue, with maybe 5% of it used to cover the ongoing costs associated with their in-house staking network. This would put their gross profit from their staking operations at around $515 million dollars annually. Being a debt free and employee light company, this gives them a lot of cash to invest in MoonShots, make improvements to MAVEN, increase their dividend, continue to accumulate ETH, or even buy back stock. Community Participant There needs to be a bridge between traditional finance and crypto currency. Watch a couple speeches given by Jamie Dimon. Then watch a few speeches given by Vitalik Buterin. These guys might as well be from different planets. The leadership and backers of BMNR are uniquely positioned to be the bridge between these two worlds. Tom Lee, Chairman of BMNR, served as the chief equity strategist at JP Morgan for about 15 years before founding Fundstrat, a research and advisory firm where he first recommended that investors buy Bitcoin in 2017 . He later founded Fundstrat Capital where he successfully launched a suite of ETFs. He possesses a massive bullhorn to get his message out as a regular contributor on CNBC and welcome guest on financial podcasts. As an OG crypto supporter with high level institutional experience, Tom Lee is the embodiment of the bridge between crypto and wall street. Chi Tsang, CEO of BMNR, was a Managing Director at HSBC before founding m1720 , a venture capital firm focused on seed and A round tech investments. Like Tom, he comes equipped with institutional experience and an entrepreneurial streak. Appointing Chi as CEO shows they are taking the MoonShots segment of their business seriously. Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund took a 9% stake in BMNR but has since trimmed their position. Nevertheless, Peter Thiel is involved. When you look at the portfolio of companies that his Founders Fund has made early investments in, it looks like the who’s who of innovative companies from the past 20 years. Additionally, I don’t think it is beyond the realm of imagination to say that Thiel’s involvement may be positive from the regulatory standpoint due to his long history with David Sacks, the current “crypto czar” in the Trump administration. Other high-profile investors include Cathie Wood and Bill Miller. Bitmine MoonShots Bitmine will be launching and funding different businesses that help drive Ethereum adoption and bridge the gap between wall street and crypto. So BMNR is not just a holder of ETH. They are effectively a business incubator and venture fund with the goal of speeding up Ethereum's adoption. This could create a virtuous cycle where BMNR benefits by owning both ETH and companies the operate on Ethereum. Currently, BMNR’s corporate presentation (graphic show above) gives the impression that the allocation for MoonShots will be less than 1% of the total treasury value. How this allocation will evolve over time is yet to be seen, as are future funding levels. But if BMNR is targeting roughly a 1% allocation, I believe a reasonable assumption is that future funding for MoonShots will be more than covered by staking revenues, which are estimated to be 2.9% annually. Made In America Validator Network BMNR plans to stake their ETH, which currently provides a yield of roughly 2.9%. MAVAN is the dedicated infrastructure they will use to stake their ETH. It is not exactly clear if MAVAN will be used outside of just staking BMNR’s ETH but it does appear that BMNR is at least considering how they might be able to generate additional income by commercializing MAVAN. The company is being pretty tight lipped about this right now but has dropped hints that they are open to commercialization. Maybe they will be more forthcoming on their upcoming investor day on January 15th, 2026 but I'm not holding my breath. They way I ultimately read this situation is that their current focus is to launch MAVAN in the first half of 2026 and take some time to work out any issues that might exist. Once they are confident in their infrastructure, I believe they will market MAVAN to wall street as a place where they can bring ETH to be staked in a safe, secure, and regulatory compliant environment. This would turn BMNR’s MAVAN into something akin to an asset manager that can scale infinitely and earn subscription like revenue. It pairs BMNR’s asset heavy treasury of ETH with an asset light cash generator. Risks The largest risk facing BMNR is fairly obvious. A large price decline in ETH will inevitably result in a major price decline for BMNR. Major price declines in ETH would be caused mostly by either lack of adoption, lack of liquidity, lack of regulation, or a combination of these three factors. The second major risk with BMNR is that of dilution. BMNR is debt free. They fund their ETH purchases by issuing new shares, thus diluting the existing shareholders. REITs often behave in a similar fashion, issuing new shares to help fund real estate purchases. As a long-term shareholder, I’ve determined that I’m willing to live with these risks. When it comes to adoption, there is definitely competition in the L1 space. But so far Ethereum is dominating with 66% of total value locked being on Ethereum. Their nearest competitor is Solana with 8%. Furthermore, we can watch in real time institutions starting to adopt Ethereum. The following graphic from BMNR’s most recent Corporate Presentation shows just some of the companies that have begun to use Ethereum. BMNR's Corporate Presentation When it comes to liquidity risks, we are in a cutting cycle and the fed just announced they are going to start buying T-Bills in December so again the odds are in Ethereum’s favor here. When it comes to the regulatory environment, the conditions have never been more favorable than they are today. In the past year, the U.S. government has passed the Genuis Act regulating stable coins. The Clarity Act, which will provide a framework for tokenization of RWAs, has made its way through the House and is under review by the Senate. These pieces of legislation pave the way for the major players to start tokenizing assets on the blockchain. So, while there are absolutely risks with investing in BMNR, the odds are in my opinion, tilted in BMNR’s favor based on the current environment. Regarding dilution, at the upcoming shareholder meeting on January 15 th , 2026, shareholders will vote on whether or not to increase the number of common shares available for issue from 500 million to 50 billion. This is eye popping and I’m not sure why exactly they are asking for such a large amount. But this is worth monitoring and I’m looking forward to hearing more on this come January 15 th . Bears will say that with this they are just going to dilute the stock in perpetuity, drastically limiting shareholder return. That is possible but at the same meeting they will be voting on Tom Lee’s compensation package. Part of that package includes compensation based on share price appreciation. So, time will tell what all of this means. Before moving on from risks, I’ll briefly discuss competition from other DATs. Other ETH DATs growing and forming on some level will actually help increase BMNR’s value. The reason for that is because other ETH DATs are also large buyers and holders of ETH who are also interested in facilitating the adoption of Ethereum. New entrants and existing competitors will help to push the price of ETH higher, facilitate adoption, and maybe even reduce the volatility in the price of ETH. Where the competition will arise between ETH DATs is in their overall strategy. One of the main criticisms of the DAT space is that many of them often trade below their book value. For DATs that fail to differentiate themselves through their strategy and capital structure, this will be the case. But this represents an opportunity for stronger, differentiated DATs to effectively purchase ETH at a discount by buying up shares or M&A. BMNR, in my opinion, has differentiated itself with their debt free capital structure, dividend payment, and a growth strategy that takes them beyond being just holders of ETH. Conclusion ETH is currently in a 40% draw down from it’s all time high. In the midst of this draw down, we are seeing the world’s largest asset managers, banks, and payment processors adopt Ethereum. As the largest ETH DAT, BMNR has the right team in place to help facilitate the continued institutional adoption of Ethereum. With the tailwinds of a crypto friendly political environment and Wall Street adoption, we could wake up in 10 years with BMNR being a systemically critical business. For long term investors willing to go on that ride and stomach ETH's large draw downs, I give BMNR a strong buy rating especially when it trades at or below its NAV.",BMNR,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-19 17:39:07

But what does this mean for you, and how can you leverage it? Let’s break it down. What Does the Tron and Base Integration Actually Mean? The core of this news is simple: connectivity. Previously, TRX and assets within the Tron ecosystem operated largely on their own network. Now, through a bridge powered by the cross-chain messaging protocol LayerZero (ZRO), users can move TRX tokens onto the Base network. This is a strategic Tron DAO integrates with Base play designed to increase utility and liquidity for TRX holders by connecting them to a new, growing user base. Once bridged, your TRX exists on Base as a wrapped asset. This means you can then use it on any decentralized application (dApp) built on Base, with the most immediate use case being DEX trading. You’re no longer confined to Tron-based DEXs; you can explore swaps, liquidity pools, and new trading pairs on platforms native to Base. Why Should You Care About This Bridge? This integration isn’t just a technical footnote; it delivers tangible benefits. Here are the key advantages for users: Access to New Markets: Instantly trade your TRX against hundreds of tokens and assets that are native to the Base ecosystem, which is known for its low fees and high-speed transactions. Enhanced Liquidity: By bridging TRX to Base, you contribute to and can access deeper, more diverse liquidity pools across two major blockchain communities. Lower Transaction Costs: Conducting trades on Base L2 is significantly cheaper than on the Ethereum mainnet, making smaller, more frequent trades more feasible. Simplified User Experience: For users already active on Coinbase or Base, this bridge provides a familiar and secure on-ramp to interact with Tron assets without leaving their preferred environment. How Do You Bridge TRX to Base Using LayerZero? The process leverages LayerZero’s secure cross-chain technology. Here’s a simplified, step-by-step guide: Connect your Web3 wallet (like MetaMask) to a bridge interface that supports the Tron-to-Base route via LayerZero. Select TRX as the asset you want to bridge from the Tron network. Choose Base as your destination network. Confirm the transaction, which will involve paying a gas fee on the Tron network and potentially a small bridging fee. After a short wait for confirmation, your wrapped TRX will appear in your wallet on the Base network, ready for use. Remember, you will need a small amount of TRX for gas to initiate the bridge and some ETH on Base to pay for subsequent transactions like trading. Always double-check contract addresses and use official channels to avoid scams. What Are the Potential Challenges to Consider? While exciting, this new bridge comes with standard Web3 considerations. Bridging assets always introduces a layer of smart contract risk, though LayerZero is a well-audited protocol. Furthermore, you are dealing with a wrapped version of TRX on Base, which means its value is pegged to native TRX but is technically a different token. Always ensure you understand the bridge’s security model and the custody of your assets during the transfer. Conclusion: A Strategic Step Forward for Tron The decision for Tron DAO integrates with Base is a clear strategic move towards greater ecosystem interoperability. It empowers TRX holders with more choices, better liquidity, and exposure to one of the fastest-growing L2 networks. This integration strengthens Tron’s position by breaking down chain-specific silos and aligning with the industry-wide push for a connected, multi-chain future. For the savvy crypto user, it represents a new tool in the DeFi toolkit. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is my TRX safe when bridging to Base? A: The bridge uses LayerZero, a reputable cross-chain protocol. However, as with any DeFi activity, there is inherent smart contract risk. Always bridge through trusted, official interfaces. Q: What can I do with my TRX on Base? A> Primarily, you can trade it on Base-native DEXs like Uniswap, BaseSwap, or Aerodrome. You can also provide liquidity in pools or use it in other Base dApps that accept it. Q: Are there fees for bridging TRX to Base? A> Yes. You will pay a gas fee on the Tron network to initiate the transfer and a small bridging fee. You will also need ETH on Base to pay for transaction fees once your assets arrive. Q: Can I bridge my TRX back from Base to Tron? A> Yes. The bridge facilitated by LayerZero is bidirectional. You can use a similar process to move your wrapped TRX from Base back to native TRX on the Tron network. Q: Does this integration mean TRX is now an Ethereum token? A> No. TRX remains the native token of the Tron blockchain. On Base, you hold a “wrapped” representation of TRX (like wTRX) that is backed 1:1 by the native token held in a bridge contract. Q: Why did Tron DAO choose Base for this integration? A> Base offers a secure, low-cost, and high-throughput Ethereum L2 environment with strong institutional backing from Coinbase and a rapidly expanding DeFi ecosystem, making it an ideal partner for growth.

This single transaction, valued at approximately $348 million, is more than just a number on a screen. It represents a significant on-chain event with potential implications for market liquidity, institutional strategy, and the broader stablecoin ecosystem. But what does such a colossal movement of digital dollars actually signify? Let’s dive deep into the mechanics and meaning behind this headline-grabbing USDC transfer . What Does a $348 Million USDC Transfer Signal? When a sum this large moves between wallets, especially within the same corporate entity, it naturally sparks curiosity. A USDC transfer of this magnitude from an institutional arm to a primary exchange could indicate several operational or strategic shifts. Primarily, it often points to liquidity management. Exchanges need vast pools of stablecoins to facilitate smooth trading, withdrawals, and market-making activities. Therefore, this movement likely represents Coinbase consolidating its USDC reserves to ensure seamless user experience and operational efficiency on its main trading platform. Why Should Crypto Investors Pay Attention? Large stablecoin movements are a key on-chain metric for savvy investors. They don’t always predict immediate price action, but they provide crucial context about capital flows and exchange health. Here’s what this specific USDC transfer might tell us: Liquidity Preparation: Moving such a large sum to the main exchange could signal an anticipation of higher trading volumes or large withdrawals, ensuring the platform is prepared. Operational Efficiency: Consolidating funds can streamline internal processes, reducing transaction costs and settlement times for users. Market Sentiment Indicator: While not a direct buy/sell signal, massive stablecoin inflows to exchanges have historically sometimes preceded increased buying activity across crypto markets. Understanding these flows helps build a clearer picture of underlying market mechanics beyond just price charts. Decoding the USDC Transfer: Institutional vs. Retail Implications The distinction between ‘Coinbase Institutional’ and ‘Coinbase’ is crucial. Coinbase Institutional serves large clients like hedge funds, family offices, and corporations. A USDC transfer from this entity to the main retail exchange suggests a funneling of capital from the institutional side to support the broader, retail-facing platform. This could mean institutional clients are redeeming USDC , or more optimistically, that Coinbase is pooling resources to bolster liquidity for a potentially bustling retail market. It highlights the interconnectedness of different market segments within a single ecosystem. The Bigger Picture: USDC and Stablecoin Dominance This event underscores the critical role of USDC , the world’s second-largest stablecoin, in the digital asset economy. As a fully-reserved dollar digital currency, its movements are a proxy for fiat capital entering and exiting the crypto space. A smooth, high-value USDC transfer like this also demonstrates the robustness of the underlying Ethereum blockchain and the maturity of institutional-grade crypto infrastructure. It’s a testament to how far the industry has come in handling billion-dollar settlements with transparency and speed. Actionable Insights for the Everyday Crypto User So, what should you, as an investor or enthusiast, take away from this news? First, don’t panic. Large internal transfers are common and often routine. However, use tools like Whale Alert to stay informed. Monitoring large USDC transfer events can help you gauge market sentiment and liquidity conditions. Secondly, recognize that a healthy, liquid exchange is vital for your trading success. Movements that ensure platform stability are ultimately positive for the user experience. In conclusion, the 348 million USDC transfer is a powerful reminder of the scale at which the cryptocurrency market now operates. While it may be a routine operational procedure for Coinbase, it provides a valuable, transparent look into the capital management strategies of a leading exchange. It reinforces the importance of USDC as a liquidity backbone and demonstrates the seamless movement of value that blockchain technology enables. For the astute observer, such events are less about shock and more about understanding the continuous, massive flow of capital that powers the modern digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a USDC transfer? A USDC transfer is the movement of USD Coin, a regulated digital dollar stablecoin, from one blockchain wallet address to another. Every transaction is recorded on a public ledger. Why did Coinbase move 348 million USDC internally? This likely represents internal liquidity management. Exchanges often move funds between hot wallets (for trading) and cold storage or between different business units (like Institutional and Retail) to optimize for security, efficiency, and customer demand. Does a large USDC transfer mean the price of Bitcoin will change? Not directly. While large stablecoin inflows to exchanges can sometimes precede buying pressure, an internal transfer like this is more indicative of exchange operations than a specific market bet. It’s one data point among many. How can I track large crypto transactions like this? You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens like USDC, or follow social media accounts of services like Whale Alert, which automatically detect and report large transactions. Is my USDC safe on Coinbase after such a large movement? Yes. This transaction demonstrates active liquidity management, which is a sign of a professionally run exchange. User funds are typically held in separate accounts from an exchange’s operational wallets. What is the difference between Coinbase and Coinbase Institutional? Coinbase is the main retail platform for individual investors. Coinbase Institutional is a separate service offering tailored products, trading, and custody solutions for large-scale clients like investment funds and corporations.

Carbon Credit Generation: Your sustainable driving and charging habits can generate verifiable carbon credits on the Sui blockchain , creating a new environmental asset. Therefore, your EV becomes more than just transport; it’s a tool for earning and contributing to a greener planet. Why Is the Sui Blockchain the Right Choice for This? Blockchain projects live or die by their ability to handle real-world use. The Sui blockchain offers specific advantages crucial for a system involving millions of data points and micro-transactions. Its high throughput and low latency mean reward payouts can be fast and efficient, avoiding network congestion. Moreover, its object-centric model and secure programming language, Move, are ideal for managing unique digital assets like carbon credits and driver profiles with clear ownership rules. What Are the Challenges and the Bigger Picture? Of course, pioneering technology faces hurdles. Mainstream adoption requires simplifying the user experience so drivers don’t need to understand blockchain intricacies. Regulatory clarity around data ownership and tokenized rewards is also evolving. However, the potential is transformative. This model paves the way for a decentralized energy economy where individuals are empowered participants, not just consumers. Conclusion: A Compelling Step Towards a Sustainable Web3 Future DLP Labs’ move onto the Sui blockchain is more than a niche tech story. It’s a compelling blueprint for how blockchain can create tangible, positive incentives in the physical world. By rewarding sustainable behavior with digital assets on a secure ledger, it aligns individual profit with planetary health.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is now trading at $86,993.64. This move has sent ripples through the crypto community, prompting investors to ask: what’s driving this decline, and is it a temporary dip or the start of a larger correction? What Caused the Bitcoin Price to Fall? Market corrections are a normal part of any financial asset’s lifecycle, and Bitcoin is no exception. The recent dip in the Bitcoin price below $87,000 can be attributed to a combination of technical and macroeconomic factors. Firstly, after a strong rally, profit-taking by short-term traders is almost inevitable. Secondly, broader market sentiment can be influenced by global economic indicators, such as interest rate decisions or inflation data, which affect risk assets like crypto. Understanding these pressures is crucial for any investor. Therefore, let’s break down the immediate context surrounding this Bitcoin price movement. Analyzing the Current BTC Trading Environment The Bitcoin price action on Binance shows a clear break below a psychological threshold. When major levels like $87,000 are breached, it often triggers automated sell orders, which can accelerate the downward move. However, it’s essential to look at volume and market depth to gauge the strength of the sell-off. Support and Resistance: The $87,000 level acted as support; its breach turns it into a new resistance zone. Market Sentiment: Fear and uncertainty can lead to panic selling, but they also create potential buying opportunities for long-term holders. Liquidity: Major exchanges like Binance provide the liquidity needed for large trades, which stabilizes prices over time. This environment demands a calm and strategic approach from traders. Should You Be Worried About Your Bitcoin Investment? Seeing the Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling. However, volatility is ingrained in cryptocurrency markets. For long-term investors, these dips are often viewed as chances to accumulate more assets at a lower cost basis, a strategy known as ‘buying the dip.’ The key is to have a clear plan and not make decisions based on emotion. Remember, Bitcoin has a history of recovering from significant drawdowns. Its long-term adoption trajectory, driven by institutional interest and technological developments, remains a powerful fundamental story. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Right Now What should you do in response to this Bitcoin price movement? First, assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon. If you’re trading, consider setting stop-loss orders to manage downside risk. If you’re investing, dollar-cost averaging can help smooth out volatility. Always conduct your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. In conclusion, the drop in the Bitcoin price below $87,000 is a significant market event that highlights the inherent volatility of digital assets. While it presents short-term challenges, it also reinforces the importance of a disciplined, long-term perspective in the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency investing. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did the Bitcoin price fall below $87,000? The drop is likely due to a mix of profit-taking after a rally, broader macroeconomic concerns affecting risk assets, and technical selling triggered at key support levels. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? For investors with a long-term view, price dips can represent buying opportunities. However, timing the market is difficult, so strategies like dollar-cost averaging are often recommended. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels is impossible. Traders watch for the next major support zones, but the market is influenced by countless unpredictable factors. Will this affect other cryptocurrencies? Yes, Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. When BTC experiences significant volatility, altcoins typically follow its lead, often with greater intensity. Where can I reliably check the Bitcoin price? Reputable cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and data aggregators like CoinMarketCap provide real-time and accurate price information. What’s the long-term outlook for Bitcoin? Despite short-term volatility, the long-term narrative for Bitcoin remains focused on its potential as a store of value and hedge against inflation, driven by adoption and finite supply.

They all had their glory moments earlier this year, but their recent performance has been quite the opposite. We decided to check whether these digital assets can deliver substantial gains in 2026 and which one is best positioned to outperform. For additional insight, we consulted four of the most popular AI-powered chatbots. PI is the ‘Wildcard’ ChatGPT estimated that XRP has the “cleanest setup” and has the best chance for “sustained, risk-adjusted gains” throughout 2026. It claimed that institutional interest towards the asset has been growing, while the regulatory clarity has improved following Ripple’s victory in the legal battle against the US SEC. The chatbot described Cardano’s native token as a “strong contender.” It highlighted the “methodical” development of its ecosystem and devoted community and predicted that it can quickly catch up in case the broader crypto market heads north. Pi Network’s PI is seen as a “wildcard.” ChatGPT argued that the token poses the highest risk and uncertainty, forecasting that its potential rally next year will depend heavily on real utility, increased adoption, and clear tokenomics. “If those pieces fall into place, PI could massively outperform – but if not, expectations may deflate quickly.” Grok, the chatbot integrated within X, also claimed that XRP has the strongest potential among that pack. It went even further, envisioning a new all-time high for Ripple’s native token in 2026, driven by its real-world utility in cross-border payments and favorable regulatory tailwinds. According to Grok, ADA could post steady growth through tech upgrades, whereas PI (“being new and more speculative”) might deliver volatile pumps but faces a higher risk of a further decline. More in Favor of XRP Perplexity agreed with the thesis of the aforementioned AI-powered chatbots. It claimed that Ripple’s cross-border token has the strongest potential and could explode to a new record above $8.60 next year. It was more conservative regarding Cardano’s cryptocurrency, stating that its potential rally would hinge on the launch of a spot ADA ETF in the USA. PI is seen as the underdog since its price is limited by supply pressure and the lack of support coming from leading exchanges like Binance. Google’s Gemini estimated that all cryptocurrencies in question have great potential. It claimed that XRP could flip Ethereum (ETH) next year if institutional adoption picks up, whereas ADA might jump to uncharted territory if the ecosystem continues to evolve. Gemini was surprisingly bullish for PI, too, calling it the asset with “the highest moonshot” upside. At the same time, it warned that it has the highest risk of crashing to virtually zero sometime in 2026.

GeeFi has rapidly solidified its status as a prime magnet for capital, initiating its journey with a completely sold-out Phase 1 that distributed 10 million tokens , secured $500,000 , and established a dedicated foundation of over 2,400 investors . This momentum has only intensified, with cumulative sales now exceeding 24 million tokens and funds raised surpassing the $1.4 million mark. With fewer than 1 million tokens left in Phase 2, demand for this comprehensive non-custodial wallet ecosystem is skyrocketing. Analysts are confident that Phase 3 will launch in just a few days, sparked by intensifying rumors of major exchange listings. Utility Beats Institutional Partnerships Ripple has navigated a complex year, seeing its price slide 13% in 2025 despite a landmark SEC victory , $1 billion in ETF inflows , and expanded partnerships with firms like TJM Investments . While legacy projects rely on slow institutional adoption, GeeFi is capturing attention as the project experts label 2026’s 100x gem . At its core, GeeFi is a robust non-custodial wallet engineered to solve the fragmented nature of crypto. It provides a unified dashboard where users can securely oversee assets across more than 14 networks without the hassle of switching between multiple applications or interfaces. The GeeFi Team adopted a product-first philosophy, launching a fully operational ecosystem in 2024 after commencing development in 2023, rather than selling empty promises. Beyond secure storage, the platform is evolving rapidly. The roadmap includes an upcoming Decentralized Exchange (DEX) for frictionless token swaps and Crypto Cards that will empower users to spend their digital holdings in the real world. With an Android app currently live and an iOS version under construction, GeeFi is proving its utility every day, reinforcing the widespread prediction that it is 2026’s 100x gem . Presale Profits That Outshine the Market The GeeFi presale is currently wrapping up Phase 2, offering tokens at the incredibly low price of $0.06 . This entry point locks in a guaranteed 667% return for early backers once the token lists at the confirmed $0.40 price. The upside potential is staggering. A strategic investment of $1,800 today could explode to $90,000 if the token reaches the $3 valuation forecasted by analysts, delivering a massive 4,900% ROI . Buying pressure for GEE tokens is accelerating. With less than 1 million tokens remaining , Phase 2 has successfully raised over $1.4 million and sold 24 million tokens . Market analysts have applauded the presale’s structure and predict that Phase 3, expected to begin within days, will sell out rapidly as excitement mounts over potential exchange listings. This aggressive accumulation confirms the belief that GeeFi is positioned to be 2026’s 100x gem . Unlock Passive Income with Staking GeeFi rewards long-term commitment through a high-yield staking program designed to generate significant passive returns. Token holders can lock their GEE tokens to earn 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or an industry-leading 55% APR for a 12-month term . For investors who prioritize liquidity, a flexible staking option offers up to 10% APR with no lock-up period , ensuring rewards continue to grow without restricting access to capital. To drive community expansion, GeeFi has launched a generous referral program. Users who share their unique referral link receive a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made by their network. This mechanism not only grows the user base but also allows early supporters to compound their holdings effortlessly, creating a powerful engine for wealth accumulation. Secure Your Position Before Phase 3 The opportunity to back a project with a live product and verified utility at such a low valuation is exceptionally rare. The GeeFi presale offers a closing window to acquire tokens at a price that likely won’t be seen again. With a deflationary token model, a working mobile app, and a roadmap featuring a DEX and crypto debit cards, GeeFi is ready for mass adoption. The rapid pace of sales indicates that institutional and retail buyers are moving fast. Do not miss the chance to invest in what analysts are confirming is 2026’s 100x gem .

The recent approval of a Whitehat Safe Harbor Agreement marks a pivotal shift in how major protocols can proactively defend their vast treasuries. This policy directly addresses a critical vulnerability in the crypto space: the legal gray area that often deters the very experts who could prevent catastrophic losses. What Exactly Did the Lido Community Approve? The Lido community, through its decentralized governance, has formally ratified a Safe Harbor Agreement specifically for white-hat hackers. This legal framework provides clear, pre-approved permission for ethical security researchers to act in the event of an active exploit or hack targeting Lido’s smart contracts. With over $26 billion in total value locked (TVL), Lido’s staked Ethereum represents a colossal potential target. This agreement transforms white-hats from potential legal targets into authorized first responders. Why Is This Safe Harbor Agreement a Game-Changer? Previously, a white-hat hacker discovering a live exploit faced a terrible dilemma. Intervening to drain funds to safety could be construed as unauthorized access or theft, opening them to legal prosecution. This chilling effect meant valuable hours could be lost while protocols scrambled to contact lawyers instead of saviors. The Lido safe harbor agreement removes this barrier. It establishes a legal ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ card for good-faith actors, creating a formal channel for emergency response. The benefits of this approach are immense: Institutional Safeguard: It provides a clear legal framework, encouraging top-tier security talent to engage. Faster Response Times: Ethical hackers can act immediately without fearing lawsuits, potentially saving millions. Enhanced Trust: It signals to users that the protocol is taking innovative, proactive steps to secure their assets. How Does This Protect Lido’s $26 Billion in Assets? The core purpose of the Lido community approving this safe harbor agreement is risk mitigation. By pre-authorizing defensive actions, Lido creates a rapid-reaction force for its treasury. Think of it as a digital fire department with a master key. If a hack is detected, vetted white-hats can legally ‘counter-hack’—moving user funds to a secure, temporary wallet before the malicious actor can drain them. This process, often called a ‘white-hat rescue,’ can be the difference between a minor incident and a devastating headline. What Challenges and Considerations Remain? While a bold step, the agreement is not a silver bullet. Key challenges include defining the precise boundaries of ‘good-faith’ action and establishing a swift verification process to distinguish white-hats from black-hats during a crisis. Furthermore, the community must maintain rigorous oversight of the agreement’s use to prevent any potential abuse. However, by being the first major DeFi protocol to formalize this approach, the Lido community is setting a crucial precedent that others will likely follow. A New Standard for DeFi Security The decision by the Lido community to approve this safe harbor agreement represents more than just a policy update; it’s a philosophical shift in cybersecurity. It acknowledges that in the borderless, fast-paced world of blockchain, traditional legal structures are often too slow. By empowering ethical hackers with clear protections, Lido is not only safeguarding its own $26 billion but also pioneering a collaborative defense model for the entire industry. This move could inspire a new wave of institutional-grade security frameworks across DeFi. In conclusion, the Lido community’s approval of the white-hat safe harbor agreement is a masterstroke in proactive risk management. It turns a major vulnerability—the legal peril of helping—into a structured strength. By formally aligning the incentives of security researchers with the protection of user funds, Lido is building a more resilient and trustworthy foundation for the future of staked assets. This precedent may well become a mandatory blueprint for any protocol managing significant value. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a white-hat hacker in crypto? A white-hat hacker is an ethical security researcher who attempts to find vulnerabilities in software or systems to help fix them before malicious actors can exploit them. What does ‘safe harbor’ mean in this context? It refers to a legal agreement that provides protection from liability or prosecution for individuals (white-hat hackers) who take specific, pre-authorized actions to secure assets during a security breach. Can any hacker claim protection under Lido’s agreement? No. The agreement is designed for proven, ethical actors. Actions must be taken in demonstrable good faith to rescue assets, not for personal gain, and would likely involve coordination with Lido’s security teams. Does this agreement prevent hacks from happening? Not directly. Its primary goal is to mitigate damage *during* an active exploit by enabling a faster, legally-sanctioned emergency response to recover user funds. Will other DeFi protocols adopt similar safe harbor agreements? It is highly likely. Lido is a leading protocol, and its approach sets a powerful precedent. Other projects managing large treasuries will probably develop similar frameworks to enhance their security posture. How does this affect the average LDO staker? It significantly increases the safety net for your staked assets. It adds an additional layer of emergency defense on top of existing audits and security measures, potentially reducing the risk of permanent fund loss from a smart contract exploit.

In a significant move for decentralized finance, Monad adds support for USD1 stablecoin , a digital asset issued by World Liberty Financial. This integration, announced by WLFI on X, marks a pivotal step in expanding the utility and accessibility of the MON token. For users and developers, this means new avenues for stable transactions, lending, and earning yield within a rapidly growing network. What Does It Mean When Monad Adds Support for USD1? When a blockchain platform like Monad integrates a new stablecoin, it’s far more than a simple listing. It’s a strategic enhancement of its core financial infrastructure. The announcement that Monad adds support for USD1 stablecoin directly addresses a key need in any DeFi ecosystem: reliable, low-volatility assets. USD1, pegged to the US dollar, provides a trusted medium of exchange and store of value. Therefore, this move signals Monad’s commitment to building a robust and user-friendly financial environment. Users can now leverage USD1 for various purposes with greater efficiency. Why Is Stablecoin Integration a Big Deal for Monad? Stablecoins are the lifeblood of practical DeFi applications. They allow users to transact, provide liquidity, and hedge against crypto market volatility without exiting the blockchain. The decision for Monad to add support for USD1 stablecoin unlocks several immediate benefits for its community: Enhanced Liquidity: More trading pairs and deeper pools for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Monad. Reduced Volatility Risk: Users can park funds in a stable asset during market uncertainty. Broader Utility: Enables stable payments, remittances, and salary distributions on the network. Attracting New Users: Simplifies the onboarding process for those cautious of crypto’s price swings. This integration is a clear response to user demand for more versatile financial tools. Moreover, it positions Monad as a more competitive layer in the multi-chain DeFi landscape. Who Is Behind the USD1 Stablecoin? The USD1 stablecoin is issued by World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a financial institution focused on bridging traditional and digital finance. Their involvement adds a layer of institutional credibility to the asset. For Monad, partnering with an established issuer helps mitigate concerns about reserve backing and regulatory compliance that sometimes plague algorithmic stablecoins. This collaboration suggests a focus on sustainable, long-term growth rather than speculative short-term gains. Consequently, the news that Monad adds support for USD1 stablecoin carries weight beyond mere technical integration. What Are the Actionable Takeaways for MON Holders? If you’re involved with the Monad network, this development opens new doors. First, explore DeFi protocols on Monad that will likely list USD1 pairs—this could mean new farming or staking opportunities with potentially attractive yields.

The fact that Monad adds support for USD1 stablecoin is a call to actively engage with the network’s expanding toolkit. Looking Ahead: The Future of Monad and Stable Assets This is likely just the beginning. Successful integration of USD1 could pave the way for more fiat-backed or even commodity-pegged stablecoins on Monad. The network’s scalability and low-cost features make it an ideal home for high-frequency stablecoin transactions. As adoption grows, we might see more traditional finance players using Monad’s infrastructure via gateways like USD1. The strategic move to have Monad add support for USD1 stablecoin is a foundational step toward a more inclusive and efficient financial system. In summary, the integration of USD1 into the Monad ecosystem is a transformative development. It strengthens the network’s economic foundation, provides users with essential tools for managing risk, and signals serious growth ambitions. By bridging the gap between crypto volatility and real-world price stability, Monad is not just adding a token—it’s building a more resilient and practical financial future for its users. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the USD1 stablecoin? A1: USD1 is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial (WLFI). It is designed to maintain a 1:1 value peg with the US dollar, providing a stable digital asset for transactions and DeFi activities. Q2: How can I use USD1 on the Monad network? A2: Once the integration is live, you can likely acquire USD1 through supported bridges or exchanges, then use it within Monad’s DeFi ecosystem for trading, providing liquidity, lending, borrowing, or as a stable payment method. Q3: Is USD1 on Monad different from USDT or USDC? A3: Yes, USD1 is a separate stablecoin issued by a different entity (WLFI). While it serves the same purpose—maintaining a USD peg—it operates on its own legal and technical framework. Its integration expands choice within the Monad ecosystem. Q4: Does this integration make MON token more valuable? A4: It enhances the utility of the entire Monad network. A more useful and liquid ecosystem can increase demand for the native MON token, as it is used for gas fees, governance, and securing the network, potentially positively impacting its value over time. Q5: Are there any risks in using USD1? A5: As with any stablecoin, primary risks involve the issuer’s ability to maintain full collateralization and redeemability. Users should review WLFI’s transparency reports regarding reserves. On-chain, smart contract risk on Monad is also a consideration. Q6: Will this lead to more stablecoin integrations on Monad?

It becomes a test of clarity, trust, and accountability—especially when the messaging around a decentralized network is inaccurate. This reality hit hard when Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, publicly called out Coinbase for mislabeling the XRP Ledger, underscoring that in crypto, precision matters as much as uptime. Coinbase Faces XRPL Transaction Delays On December 18, 2025, Coinbase reported delayed XRP transactions on its status page, noting that some users were experiencing slow sends and receives. The exchange reassured customers that fiat deposits, withdrawals, and trades remained unaffected, and that funds were safe. Hey @coinbase , reminder on this. @msvadari is right (as usual) — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 18, 2025 While the impact on most users was limited, the timing was critical: a recent XRPL protocol upgrade had gone live, blocking older nodes from participating in network consensus. The delays highlighted a fundamental challenge: exchanges rely on maintaining current infrastructure to interact seamlessly with decentralized networks. When node versions fall behind, even a robust blockchain like the XRPL can appear slow or unresponsive to users. The Misnomer: “Ripple Network” vs. XRP Ledger The controversy centered on terminology. Coinbase referred to the issue as affecting the “Ripple Network,” a misrepresentation that Ripple’s leadership quickly corrected. Mayukha Vadari, a prominent Ripple engineer, also chimed in, advising against conflating Ripple Labs—the company—with the decentralized XRP Ledger itself. Garlinghouse reinforced this point on X, humorously but firmly noting that Coinbase needed to update its messaging. The distinction is critical: the XRPL is maintained by a global validator set, not controlled by Ripple Labs. Mislabeling the network can mislead users about responsibility for technical issues and the true nature of the ledger’s decentralized governance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Upgrades, Nodes, and Exchange Preparedness The underlying cause of the delays was a network upgrade. The XRPL recently implemented a protocol amendment that blocked nodes running outdated software, requiring all validators and exchange nodes to upgrade to remain fully operational. Failure to do so results in delayed transactions or temporary disconnection from the network. For Coinbase, this incident underscores a recurring theme in crypto infrastructure: exchanges must stay in sync with protocol changes. Network upgrades ensure security, performance, and feature improvements, but they also demand vigilance from service providers. Delays are not failures of the blockchain itself but of lagging infrastructure. Lessons for Users and the Industry This episode offers a dual lesson. First, terminology matters. Accurate communication preserves trust in both the network and the service provider. Second, infrastructure readiness is non-negotiable. As decentralized networks like the XRPL evolve rapidly, exchanges and custodial services must update continuously to avoid operational friction. Garlinghouse’s intervention highlights a broader truth: in crypto, even minor misrepresentations can ripple through public perception. Ensuring accuracy—both in system updates and messaging—is essential to maintaining confidence in digital assets.

This urgent development comes as lawmakers intensify scrutiny of AI’s impact on minors, following tragic incidents that have raised alarms about chatbot interactions with vulnerable youth. The cryptocurrency and tech communities are watching closely as these regulations could set precedents affecting all AI-powered platforms. Why OpenAI’s ChatGPT Teen Safety Update Matters Now The timing of OpenAI’s announcement is no coincidence. With 42 state attorneys general recently demanding better protections from Big Tech companies and federal AI standards under development, the pressure on AI developers has reached a critical point. OpenAI’s updated Model Spec represents a proactive attempt to address growing concerns about how AI chatbots interact with Generation Z, who constitute ChatGPT’s most active user demographic. Understanding OpenAI’s New Teen Protection Framework OpenAI’s updated guidelines establish stricter boundaries for ChatGPT interactions with users under 18. The company has implemented several key restrictions: Prohibition of immersive romantic roleplay, even in non-graphic scenarios Strict limits on first-person intimacy and violent roleplay Enhanced caution around body image and disordered eating topics Priority on safety over autonomy when potential harm is detected Refusal to help teens conceal unsafe behavior from caregivers These rules apply even when users attempt to bypass them through fictional, hypothetical, or educational framing—common tactics that previously allowed some users to circumvent safety measures. The Four Core Principles Behind ChatGPT’s Teen Safety Approach OpenAI has articulated four fundamental principles guiding its updated teen safety measures: Principle Description Safety First Prioritizing teen protection even when conflicting with intellectual freedom Real-World Support Directing teens toward family, friends, and professionals for well-being Age-Appropriate Interaction Communicating with warmth and respect without condescension Transparency Clearly explaining ChatGPT’s capabilities and limitations as an AI How AI Regulation Is Shaping ChatGPT’s Future The push for comprehensive AI regulation is accelerating, with several legislative developments influencing OpenAI’s approach. California’s SB 243, set to take effect in 2027, specifically targets AI companion chatbots and includes requirements that closely mirror OpenAI’s new guidelines. The legislation mandates regular reminders to minors that they’re interacting with AI and encourages breaks from extended sessions. Senator Josh Hawley has proposed even more restrictive legislation that would ban minors from interacting with AI chatbots entirely, reflecting growing bipartisan concern about AI’s potential harms to young people. Technical Implementation: How OpenAI Enforces ChatGPT Safety OpenAI employs multiple technical systems to implement its safety guidelines: Real-time automated classifiers that assess text, image, and audio content Detection systems for child sexual abuse material and self-harm content Age-prediction models to identify minor accounts automatically Human review teams for content flagged as indicating acute distress These systems represent a significant evolution from previous approaches that relied on post-interaction analysis rather than real-time intervention. Expert Perspectives on ChatGPT’s Teen Safety Measures Industry experts have offered mixed reactions to OpenAI’s announcement. Lily Li, founder of Metaverse Law, praised the company’s willingness to have ChatGPT decline certain interactions, noting that breaking engagement cycles could prevent inappropriate conduct. However, Robbie Torney of Common Sense Media highlighted potential conflicts within OpenAI’s guidelines, particularly between safety provisions and the “no topic is off limits” principle. Former OpenAI safety researcher Steven Adler emphasized that intentions must translate into measurable behaviors, stating: “I appreciate OpenAI being thoughtful about intended behavior, but unless the company measures the actual behaviors, intentions are ultimately just words.” Parental Resources and Shared Responsibility OpenAI has released new AI literacy resources for parents and families, including conversation starters and guidance on building critical thinking skills. This approach formalizes a shared responsibility model where OpenAI defines system behavior while families provide supervision and context. The company’s stance aligns with Silicon Valley perspectives emphasizing parental responsibility, similar to recommendations from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which recently suggested more disclosure requirements rather than restrictive regulations for child safety. FAQs About OpenAI’s ChatGPT Teen Safety Rules What specific behaviors does ChatGPT now prohibit with teen users? ChatGPT now avoids immersive romantic roleplay, first-person intimacy, and discussions that could encourage self-harm or disordered eating, even when framed as fictional or educational. How does OpenAI detect underage users? The company uses age-prediction models to identify accounts likely belonging to minors, automatically applying stricter safety guidelines to these interactions. What happens when ChatGPT detects potential self-harm content? Automated systems flag concerning content in real-time, with potentially serious cases reviewed by human teams who may notify parents if acute distress is detected. How do these changes relate to upcoming AI regulation? OpenAI’s guidelines anticipate legislation like California’s SB 243, which requires similar protections for minors interacting with AI companion chatbots. Who are the key figures mentioned in discussions about AI safety? Important voices include Lily Li of Metaverse Law, Robbie Torney of Common Sense Media, former OpenAI researcher Steven Adler , and policymakers like Senator Josh Hawley . The Critical Challenge: Implementation Versus Intention The most significant question surrounding OpenAI’s announcement isn’t about the guidelines themselves, but whether ChatGPT will consistently follow them. Previous versions of the Model Spec prohibited sycophancy (excessive agreeableness), yet ChatGPT, particularly the GPT-4o model, has demonstrated this behavior repeatedly. The tragic case of Adam Raine, who died by suicide after prolonged ChatGPT conversations, revealed that despite flagging over 1,000 messages mentioning suicide, OpenAI’s systems failed to prevent harmful interactions. This implementation gap represents the fundamental challenge for all AI safety measures: well-intentioned guidelines mean little without reliable enforcement mechanisms. Conclusion: A Turning Point for AI Ethics and Regulation OpenAI’s updated teen safety rules for ChatGPT mark a significant step toward responsible AI development, but they also highlight the immense challenges ahead. As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into daily life, particularly for younger generations, the balance between innovation and protection grows more delicate. The cryptocurrency and technology sectors should view these developments as both a warning and an opportunity—a chance to build safer, more transparent AI systems that earn public trust while pushing technological boundaries. The coming months will reveal whether OpenAI’s guidelines translate into meaningful protection or remain aspirational documents. With legal risks increasing for companies that advertise safeguards they don’t properly implement, the era of AI accountability may finally be arriving.

RIVN shares went vertical after Rivian joined the list of AI chip and automation companies. Rivian (RIVN) traded at a 12-month high above $22, with a vertical expansion in the past day. It only took days for RIVN to accelerate its gains, after Rivian announced a pivot to building its own AI chip on December 11. Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) rallied to a one-year high, sparked by the company’s pivot to AI chip engineering. | Source: Google Finance RIVN traded at $22.62, breaking into new 12-month highs. The shares are still below their initial peak above $86, and are trading close to five-year lows. RIVN performance reflects the company’s years of relative obscurity compared to other EV producers. Rivian pivots to AI, sparks a stock rally After announcing an AI push, Rivian still had to overcome its previous failure as a car company. RIVN shares spent years at suppressed prices, down to lows of $10, before breaking out in the past week. As Cryptopolitan reported , Rivian’s push was also to rebuild its reputation. Rivian’s move into AI, automation, and proprietary chips happens at a time when other companies try to pivot into some form of AI usage. Rivian has yet to show real results as a chip producer, recalling Oracle’s failed attempt to adopt AI infrastructure . Can RIVN make a lasting turnaround? RIVN rises in a climate where traders and investors seek all possible growth stocks linked to the AI narrative, as well as real AI capabilities. The potential for a RIVN rally attracted speculative investors, including risk-takers from WallStreetBets. RIVN was also taken up by crypto investors, who are also closely watching stocks for their upside potential and the potential for sudden rallies. RIVN shares are moderately shorted, close to their usual historical levels at 18.3% of the float. In November, short positions reached over 20% of the float. RIVN still has a reasonable 2.59 days to cover short open interest, with new shares flowing in to cover positions as of December 19. Despite the hype around the shares, there is no outsized and irrational short squeeze yet. However, traders are chasing the current price expansion, expecting a hike as high as $27. Wedbush raised the RIVN target to $25 in 2026, up from a previous target of $16. Rivian still gets more than 95% of its revenues from car sales, expecting a boost from the R2 SUV for the US market. The current talk of AI is happening without a real product pipeline, and is seen as a risk for a sharp reversal. On the positive side, Rivian is also expected to get a boost from partnerships with other AI companies and use cases for its AI chip. Some traders are comparing Rivian to Robinhood (HOOD), which broke out after a two-year period of trading near its lower range.

Known, a San Francisco-based dating app, is leveraging voice AI technology to transform how people connect, moving beyond superficial profiles to foster genuine, in-person relationships. With an impressive $9.7 million in recent funding, this innovative approach is capturing attention from major investors like Forerunner and NFX, signaling a potential paradigm shift in the multi-billion dollar dating industry. How Does Voice AI Create Better Matches? The core innovation of Known lies in its voice-powered onboarding system. Instead of filling out tedious forms, users engage in a conversational interview with an AI agent. This dynamic interaction allows the system to ask follow-up questions based on previous answers, uncovering nuanced preferences that users might not think to include in a written profile. The average onboarding session lasts 26 minutes, with some users spending over an hour and a half—a testament to how engaging and revealing the process can be. Celeste Amadon, co-founder of Known, explains the breakthrough: “For the first time, we could know enough about somebody to serve them a date that would make sense. And if we could do that much faster with less rejection rate, we could create a user experience that could get people out on more dates.” Why Are Investors Betting on This AI Dating Startup? The startup’s $9.7 million funding round represents significant validation from the venture capital community. Notably, this marks Forerunner Ventures’ first investment in a dating app, with partner Eurie Kim highlighting the unique approach: “Celeste is a really thoughtful founder to understand the mindset of the consumer, which is a young female. In a conversation, you can get a lot of those nuances out, but in the past, the conversation required a $10,000 matchmaker.” Key investors include: Forerunner Ventures (first dating app investment) NFX PearVC Coelius Capital What Results Has This Dating App Achieved? During its San Francisco beta testing phase, Known demonstrated remarkable effectiveness. The platform reported that 80% of its introductions led to physical dates—a significantly higher conversion rate than traditional swipe-based apps. This success stems from several innovative features: Feature Benefit Voice AI Onboarding Captures authentic personality traits and preferences 24-Hour Response Window Reduces ghosting and encourages timely connections AI-Powered Match Suggestions Provides personalized recommendations based on deep understanding Restaurant Selection Assistance Helps plan ideal first date locations How Does Known Encourage More In-Person Dates? The app’s design philosophy centers on moving connections from digital to physical spaces as quickly as possible. When two users match, they have 24 hours to accept the introduction and another 24 hours to agree to a date. This time-limited approach prevents endless messaging and encourages real-world meetings. After dates, users provide feedback to the AI, which refines future match suggestions. Amadon addresses the broader social context: “There’s been a million pieces written about the loneliness epidemic in the U.S. And I do really think that it’s our generation’s largest problem.” This perspective drove her and co-founder Asher Allen to drop out of Stanford and build Known. What’s Next for AI Dating Technology? Known is part of a growing trend of AI-enhanced dating platforms. Other startups, including Overtone from Hinge CEO Justin McLeod, are exploring similar territory. Even established players like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge are integrating AI features to maintain user engagement. Despite increasing competition, Amadon remains optimistic: “When it comes to other startup dating products, I’ve been so happy to see a lot of people building in the space because I think it shows that it’s time to shift away from a swipe-based model.” The company currently charges $30 per successful date during its beta phase but plans to experiment with different pricing models. With three full-time engineers and four go-to-market specialists, plus several contractors, Known plans to expand its team using the recent funding. Frequently Asked Questions What is Known? Known is a dating app that uses voice AI technology to create more meaningful matches and encourage in-person dates. Who founded Known? The company was founded by Celeste Amadon and Asher Allen, both Stanford dropouts who previously worked on AI-powered applications. Which investors have funded Known? The startup has raised $9.7 million from investors including Forerunner Ventures , NFX , PearVC , and Coelius Capital . How does Known’s voice AI work? Users engage in a conversational interview with an AI agent that asks dynamic follow-up questions, creating a more authentic and detailed profile than traditional forms. When will Known launch publicly? The app is currently in beta testing in San Francisco and plans to launch early next year. How successful has Known been in testing? In its San Francisco beta, 80% of introductions led to physical dates, significantly higher than industry averages for swipe-based apps. The Future of Connection Known represents a transformative approach to digital dating, leveraging voice AI to combat the loneliness epidemic through genuine human connection. By focusing on quality over quantity and prioritizing in-person meetings, the startup addresses fundamental flaws in existing dating platforms. With substantial investor backing and promising early results, Known is positioned to redefine how technology facilitates romance in the modern age.

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes thinks so, presenting a compelling Bitcoin price prediction that hinges on how the market interprets the Fed’s recent maneuvers. His analysis suggests we might be on the cusp of a monumental move, but the timing depends on one critical market perception. What is Arthur Hayes’s Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction? Arthur Hayes, a respected voice in crypto, has outlined a specific path for Bitcoin’s price. He projects an initial recovery to around $124,000, followed by a potential surge to a staggering $200,000. However, this isn’t based on mere speculation. Hayes ties this Bitcoin price prediction directly to U.S. monetary policy, specifically the Federal Reserve’s Treasury purchase program, known as the Reinvestment Policy (RMP). Why Does the Fed’s RMP Matter for Bitcoin? The core of Hayes’s argument is market perception. The Fed’s RMP currently adds about $40 billion in liquidity to the system each month. The crucial question is: will traders and institutions view this as a form of Quantitative Easing (QE)? Current View: The market largely sees RMP as weaker than traditional QE, creating less credit expansion. Hayes’s Insight: The moment this perception changes, and RMP is seen as equivalent to QE, it could trigger a rapid revaluation of assets like Bitcoin. This shift in understanding is the essential catalyst for his bullish Bitcoin price prediction . What’s the Timeline for This Bitcoin Rally? Hayes provides a clear, phased outlook based on policy expectations. He doesn’t foresee an immediate moonshot. Instead, he anticipates a period of consolidation first. Rest of 2024: Bitcoin likely trades between $80,000 and $100,000 as the market grapples with RMP uncertainty. March 2025: Expectations for RMP’s inflationary impact on asset prices are projected to peak. Post-Peak: Even after a potential correction, Hayes believes Bitcoin could establish a formidable support level near $124,000. This structured timeline gives context to his long-term Bitcoin price prediction . What Are the Risks to This Optimistic Forecast? Every prediction has its caveats. Hayes identifies a key risk factor: policy reversal. His entire thesis assumes the Fed continues its liquidity provision. He explicitly states that the trend depends on New York Fed President John Williams not halting the current policy. A sudden shift from the Fed could derail the projected price path, making this a critical variable for any investor considering this Bitcoin price prediction . Conclusion: Patience for the Perception Shift Arthur Hayes’s analysis offers a masterclass in connecting macroeconomic policy to crypto asset valuation. His $200,000 Bitcoin price prediction is not a guarantee, but a conditional forecast based on a specific financial narrative taking hold. The opportunity lies in the market’s eventual recognition of the Fed’s actions as a potent form of stimulus. For investors, the message is clear: watch the Fed’s language and the market’s interpretation as closely as the Bitcoin chart itself. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is the Fed’s RMP policy? A: The Reinvestment Policy (RMP) is where the Federal Reserve buys U.S. Treasury securities. This adds liquidity (cash) to the financial system, similar to but currently viewed as smaller in scale than past Quantitative Easing (QE) programs. Q: Why would this make Bitcoin’s price go up? A> Increased liquidity often seeks higher-yielding assets. If the market sees RMP as strong stimulus, that money could flow into perceived inflation hedges like Bitcoin, driving up demand and price. Q: Is the $200K prediction guaranteed if the Fed continues RMP? A> No. Hayes’s prediction requires the market to *perceive* RMP as equal to QE. The policy continuing is just one part; the market’s emotional and analytical reaction is the other, crucial part. Q: What should I watch to see if this prediction is playing out? A> Monitor financial news for how analysts and major institutions talk about the RMP. A shift in narrative calling it “stealth QE” or similar would be a signal the catalyst Hayes describes is activating. Q: Does Hayes think Bitcoin will crash if this doesn’t happen? A> His analysis suggests a range-bound market ($80K-$100K) through year-end if the perception doesn’t shift, not necessarily a crash. The downside risk he highlights is an active halt of liquidity by the Fed. Ready to dive deeper into the forces shaping cryptocurrency’s future?

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly rising to the top of that list. As one of the most closely watched presale tokens in the market, MUTM is now nearing $20 million in total funding, with Phase 6 of its presale reaching 98% completion, signaling tightening supply and growing investor urgency. At a price point of only $0.035, it is clear why analysts are saying that Mutuum Finance is the best crypto to invest in, especially for new, under-the-radar altcoins seeking explosive upside. Unlike so many new offerings, Mutuum is founded on a sophisticated DeFi lending and borrowing platform, featuring interest-bearing tokens, yield-generative optimization, as well as all the trappings of a long-term strategy, rather than simply seeking mainstream adoption. Having already brought over 18,530 individual addresses into its fold, it is clear why Mutuum is quickly gaining mainstream recognition as the next crypto to hit $1, making its way out of the presale realm and firmly into mainstream financial ecosystem development. Stage 6 Presale Sees Increased Momentum for MUTM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has moved into Presale Stage 6 with token sales at $0.035, hence indicating a 15% jump from the previous presale stage. In the next stage, Presale Stage 7, the cost of the token will rise to $0.04, indicating a 20% jump and positioning this presale stage as one of the last chances for investors to purchase the token at a discount. More than 18,530 investors have already participated in the presale, with the amount contributed exceeding $19.5 million. Investors wanting to take advantage of the growth potential at the early stages are attracted to MUTM by the dual-lending protocol and the soon-to-be-launched V1 Sepolia Testnet. Mutuum Finance is a Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending protocol, enabling interested parties to earn interest on their funds while maintaining control. The platform provides a full DeFi experience, one that is safe, convenient, and more flexible compared to traditional lending platforms, establishing MUTM as the best crypto to invest in for individuals seeking low-cost, highly functional cryptocurrencies. Collateralized USD Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance has been getting ready to launch its stablecoin, which will be pegged to the value of USD, with full collateral on the Ethereum blockchain network. The team has its code audited and certified by CertiK to ensure its authenticity and reliability. There is also a Bug Bounty Program with a reward of 50,000 USDT launched with CertiK to encourage participants to point out vulnerabilities. To enhance community interaction, Mutuum Finance is also participating in a token giveaway event worth $100,000, in which ten participants shall receive MUTM tokens amounting to $10,000. This promising project has already acquired an impressive 95.0/100 trust level from CertiK, thereby validating its high level of security. In view of its revolutionary lending platform and secured environment, it is expected that Mutuum Finance shall deliver a progressive and secured DeFi experience, making it the next crypto to hit $1. Upcoming Lending and Borrowing Protocol on Sepolia Testnet Mutuum Finance will soon be rolled out with Version 1 of the lending and borrowing protocol on the Sepolia Testnet by the end of 2025. Early participants will get the chance to interact with major assets such as ETH and USDT using liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. The testnet version of the project will enable participants to get hands-on experience with the service, gaining insight into the service functionality and the benefits of investing in MUTM, thereby establishing it as a promising and cheap DeFi coin. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is almost done with Phase 6, with more than 18,530 unique holders participating with $19.5 million at a token price of $0.035, just before Phase 7 when the cost of the token will go up to $0.04. Mutuum Finance also serves as a dual lending solution, features an interest-bearing token, a fully collateralized stablecoin, and is also working on V1 Sepolia Testnet and much more, making it useful and growing in the early stages of the DeFi ecosystem, and confirming it as the best crypto to invest in for early-stage participants and the next crypto to hit $1.

56052154,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248336,1766169012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Revolutionary: Coinbase to List ZKP, Unlocking a New Era of Privacy",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-list-zkp-privacy-token/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary: Coinbase to List ZKP, Unlocking a New Era of Privacy In a move that signals a major shift towards privacy-focused technology, cryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase has announced it will list ZKP. This decision is more than just another asset addition; it’s a powerful endorsement of zero-knowledge proof technology and its potential to reshape how we think about transaction privacy on the blockchain. For investors and tech enthusiasts alike, understanding why Coinbase is listing ZKP is crucial for navigating the next wave of crypto innovation. Why is Coinbase Listing ZKP a Big Deal? When Coinbase decides to list a new token, the market pays attention. The exchange’s rigorous asset review process acts as a significant filter, lending credibility to the projects it supports. Therefore, the decision for Coinbase to list ZKP is a strong vote of confidence in the underlying zero-knowledge proof technology. This move provides the ZKP project with unparalleled mainstream visibility and access to millions of retail investors. It validates the growing institutional and user demand for enhanced privacy solutions without compromising on security or regulatory compliance. What Exactly is ZKP and Its Technology? Before diving into the market impact, let’s break down the core concept. ZKP stands for Zero-Knowledge Proof. In simple terms, it’s a cryptographic method that allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any specific information beyond the validity of the statement itself. Imagine proving you are over 21 without showing your driver’s license—you confirm the fact without exposing your birthdate or address. For blockchain, this technology is revolutionary. It enables: Enhanced Privacy: Users can verify transactions without exposing sender, receiver, or amount details publicly on the ledger. Scalability: By bundling and verifying many transactions off-chain with a single, succinct proof, networks can process more data faster. Regulatory Compatibility: It offers a path for privacy that can still allow for selective disclosure to authorized parties, addressing a key concern for regulators. The fact that Coinbase is listing a token representing this technology highlights its move from niche cryptographic research to a mainstream financial utility. What Are the Immediate Benefits and Potential Challenges? The announcement that Coinbase will list ZKP brings immediate excitement, but a balanced view is essential. The primary benefits are clear: Increased Liquidity and Access: A listing on a top-tier U.S. exchange dramatically increases trading volume and makes the asset accessible to a vast new audience. Market Validation: It signals to the broader crypto ecosystem that privacy-enhancing technologies are investable and here to stay. Educational Catalyst: It pushes zero-knowledge proofs into public discourse, encouraging more developers and users to understand the technology. However, challenges remain. The regulatory landscape for privacy coins and tokens is still evolving. How will ZKP navigate this? Furthermore, will the token’s utility keep pace with its market valuation? Investors should research the ZKP project’s roadmap, tokenomics, and real-world use cases beyond the hype of the Coinbase listing. How Does This Shape the Future of Crypto? Coinbase’s decision to list ZKP is a landmark moment that points to a specific future for cryptocurrency: one where privacy is not an optional extra but a fundamental feature. It demonstrates that major platforms are preparing for a world where users demand control over their financial data. This listing could catalyze a wave of similar integrations, pushing other exchanges and projects to prioritize privacy-preserving tech. For the savvy observer, it’s a clear indicator to watch the zero-knowledge proof sector closely. Conclusion: A Pivotal Step Forward The news that Coinbase will list ZKP is far more significant than a simple exchange update. It represents a strategic embrace of next-generation privacy technology by a leading industry gatekeeper. This action provides legitimacy, liquidity, and a learning opportunity for the entire market. While due diligence is always paramount, this development marks a pivotal step in the maturation of the crypto space, moving it towards a more sophisticated, secure, and user-empowered future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the ZKP token? A1: The ZKP token is a cryptocurrency associated with zero-knowledge proof technology. It likely functions within a specific ecosystem to power transactions, pay for services, or participate in governance related to privacy applications. Q2: When will Coinbase list ZKP? A2: The official announcement states Coinbase intends to list ZKP. The exact date and time for trading to begin are typically communicated in a follow-up announcement from the exchange, so users should monitor Coinbase’s official blog and social channels. Q3: Is ZKP a privacy coin like Monero? A3: While both focus on privacy, they use different technologies. ZKP is based on zero-knowledge proof cryptography, which can be applied in various ways, potentially offering more flexible privacy options that can be tailored for different levels of disclosure compared to the default anonymity of coins like Monero. Q4: What should I do before investing in ZKP? A4> Conduct thorough research. Understand the ZKP project’s whitepaper, its team, its real-world utility, token supply, and how the token is used within its network. Remember, a Coinbase listing provides access and credibility but is not a guarantee of a project’s success. Q5: Will other exchanges follow Coinbase and list ZKP? A5: It is highly likely. A Coinbase listing often creates a “listing effect,” where other major and minor exchanges follow suit to offer the asset to their own user bases, increasing the token’s overall market presence. Q6: Does this mean privacy features are becoming mainstream in crypto? A6: Yes, this is a strong signal in that direction. A leading, compliance-focused exchange like Coinbase embracing a privacy-centric token suggests the industry is finding ways to integrate these features in a manner that can coexist with evolving regulatory frameworks.

In a brutal triple blow, industry giants iRobot, Luminar, and Rad Power Bikes all filed for bankruptcy protection, exposing deep cracks in the hardware startup ecosystem that mirror the volatility we’ve seen in crypto markets. This isn’t just about three companies failing – it’s a warning signal about the fundamental challenges of building physical products in today’s global economy, where supply chain disruptions and trade tensions create perfect storms for hardware ventures. Why Hardware Startups Are Facing Unprecedented Challenges The simultaneous collapse of these three prominent hardware companies reveals systemic issues plaguing the industry. Each represents a different sector – home robotics, automotive technology, and electric mobility – yet they all succumbed to similar pressures. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts who understand market dynamics, this hardware crisis demonstrates how global economic factors can devastate even well-established companies, much like regulatory changes can impact crypto projects. The hardware industry’s current struggles highlight why diversification between digital and physical assets remains crucial for investors. The Bankruptcy Breakdown: Three Hardware Giants Fall Let’s examine what went wrong with each company and what their failures mean for the broader hardware ecosystem: Company Core Business Primary Failure Factors Market Impact iRobot Home Robotics (Roomba) Failed Amazon acquisition, tariff pressures, increased competition Home automation sector uncertainty Luminar Lidar Technology Slow autonomous vehicle adoption, high R&D costs, supply chain issues Autonomous vehicle timeline concerns Rad Power Bikes Electric Bicycles Chinese supply chain dependency, market saturation, regulatory challenges E-mobility investment caution These bankruptcies didn’t happen in isolation. They represent converging trends that are making hardware development increasingly risky: Global trade tensions creating unpredictable tariff environments Supply chain fragility exposing dependency on overseas manufacturing Intense competition from cheaper international alternatives Capital intensity requiring sustained investment without guaranteed returns Market timing risks where technology readiness doesn’t match consumer adoption Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Exposed The Rad Power Bikes case particularly highlights how supply chain dependencies can become fatal weaknesses. Despite being a market leader in electric bicycles, the company couldn’t escape its deep integration with Chinese manufacturing partners. When geopolitical tensions increased and shipping costs soared, their business model collapsed. This supply chain fragility mirrors concerns in cryptocurrency mining hardware, where geographic concentration creates similar vulnerabilities. Hardware companies are learning what crypto miners already know: geographic diversification isn’t just smart – it’s essential for survival. Global Trade Tensions Crush Hardware Margins Trade policies have become hardware’s silent killer. iRobot’s struggle intensified after increased tariffs made their manufacturing more expensive, while competitors using different geographic strategies maintained lower costs. The hardware industry faces a perfect storm where political decisions directly impact bottom lines, creating unpredictable operating environments. For crypto investors watching this unfold, it’s a reminder of how regulatory environments can make or break technology sectors, whether they’re building physical robots or digital assets. What This Means for Hardware Industry Investors This brutal week offers several crucial lessons for anyone investing in or building hardware companies: Diversify manufacturing across multiple regions and countries Build financial resilience for extended market downturns Develop software moats that complement hardware offerings Monitor geopolitical risks as carefully as market risks Consider hybrid models combining hardware with recurring revenue streams The hardware industry isn’t dying, but it is evolving. Companies that survive will be those that adapt to these new realities, much like cryptocurrency projects that navigate regulatory landscapes while maintaining technological innovation. FAQs: Understanding the Hardware Bankruptcy Crisis What caused iRobot’s bankruptcy? iRobot, maker of the Roomba vacuum, faced multiple challenges including a failed acquisition by Amazon , increased tariffs affecting manufacturing costs, and intense competition from cheaper alternatives. The company struggled to maintain profitability as market conditions deteriorated. Why did Luminar Technologies fail? Luminar Technologies, a lidar company, invested heavily in autonomous vehicle technology that hasn’t reached expected adoption rates. The slow progress of self-driving cars combined with high research costs created unsustainable financial pressure. You can learn more about their technology on their company website . What happened to Rad Power Bikes? Rad Power Bikes, despite being an e-bike market leader, became overly dependent on Chinese supply chains. When geopolitical tensions increased shipping costs and created logistical challenges, their business model collapsed under the pressure. Are all hardware startups at risk? Not all hardware startups face immediate risk, but those with similar characteristics – single-source manufacturing, high capital requirements, and dependency on favorable trade policies – should examine their vulnerabilities. The current environment demands more resilient business models. What can hardware companies learn from these bankruptcies? Key lessons include diversifying supply chains, building financial buffers for market downturns, developing software-based competitive advantages, and closely monitoring geopolitical risks that could impact operations. The Future of Hardware Innovation This brutal week serves as a sobering reality check for the hardware industry. While the failures are dramatic, they don’t signal the end of hardware innovation. Instead, they mark a necessary evolution toward more sustainable business models. Companies that learn from these collapses – by building more resilient supply chains, creating hybrid hardware-software offerings, and developing geographic diversification strategies – will define the next generation of hardware success stories. For cryptocurrency observers, these events offer valuable parallels about how external pressures can impact technology sectors, reminding us that both physical and digital innovations must navigate complex global landscapes.

His statement is coming at a sensitive time for the RWA sector, which witnessed an explosion of institutional interest in 2024 and 2025. In a long X post that Zhang penned in his native language of Chinese, the co-founder accused RWA.xyz of sharing biased data and selectively reporting blockchain networks. What did Conflux’s co-founder say about RWA.xyz? In his X post, Forgivenever implied that the RWA.xyz platform has deliberately avoided reflecting the true scope of activities happening on non-EVM compatible chains or those he claims fall outside a group of protocols favored by the West. His allegations imply the platform is no longer impartial and now dictates which projects and networks become visible as more institutional investors get involved. Zhang claims that by leaving out or under-reporting the actual RWA volume on fringe, less-popular, or non-Western platforms like Conflux, RWA.xyz is pushing out a skewed erosion of the global RWA market. According to him, the platform’s new methodology, which it switched to a month ago after it underwent a revamp, prioritizes narratives over unfiltered on-chain facts. He suggested that the new approach to data curating does not take into account the significant liquidity pools in the growing Asian market. Prior to the revamp, RWA.xyz claimed industry-wide RWA scale was around $300 billion. However, after the redesign, that figure became $410 billion, and two new metrics were introduced. The first metric is the Reported Asset Value, which is the $410 billion and covers assets that are tokenized as digital certificates on private or permissioned chains, even though they lack true on-chain transfers or genuine public distribution. The second metric introduced is the Distributed Asset Value, which is rated at $18 billion and covers assets that have been distributed via on-chain protocols of blockchains and exchanges and that are accessible to crypto investors who can hold them via wallets or custodians. As far as Zhang is concerned, the second metric is what represents the true crypto-relevant scale. According to him, the other metric, which has the hyped $410 billion value, is 91% dominated by Canton’s private chain, who he claims is the new “sugar daddy.” He implied that it replaced Figure’s Provenance chain, which he claims was the first entity to bribe the RWA.xyz platform and has been relegated to second position behind Canton since it has gone public and won’t be “renewing its subscription.” Zhang alleged that Figure bribed the platform so as to forcibly stuff a home equity loan company’s data into the industry’s statistics table, inflating the real $18 billion in RWA assets that have actually been sold to investors to over $300 billion. Now, it is Canton doing the bribing, which is why Figure only makes up 3% of the Reported Asset Value while Canton makes up 91%. He alleged that it was not the first time RWA.xyz was dabbling in data manipulation, citing Figure’s loans, which served to boost numbers before reclassifying them. Zhang implied that commercial incentives are what drive inclusions. According to him, after excluding Figure’s inflated anomalies from the Distributed Asset Value, it regains some fair reference value. Zhang claims in his post that RWA.xyz has been scamming US investors in the crypto and stock sectors. He claims that the platform now has its sights set on the Hong Kong market after seeing that Asia’s RWA sector is booming. How true are the allegations? The claims that Zhang made in his post were corroborated by his followers, who also claimed discrepancies. When one user asked which of the data aggregation platforms provided accurate data, another claimed most of the others are better than RWA.xyz since none of them contain such exaggeration. It is true that compared to RWA.xyz, which reports a TVL in tokenized treasuries and private credit exceeding $21 billion, data from other major aggregators like DefiLlama show notable gaps. DefiLlama uses a permissionless bottom-up indexing method and usually displays higher numbers for certain protocols and even includes data from chains that RWA.xyz has yet to fully acknowledge or integrate. This is especially true in the private credit sector, where DefiLlama lists emerging protocols on L1 networks that are not present on RWA.xyz’s league table. When Figure co-founder, Mike Cagney called out DefiLlama in September for excluding Figure’s data from its platform, the aggregator defended the action by revealing that Figure’s data was not verifiable and lacked any true on-chain footprints. Meanwhile, RWA.xyz has defended its methodology by claiming it “standardizes and verifies first-party data” to ensure institutional-grade accuracy. Still, there are critics, like Zhang, who believe the so-called verification process is essentially a whitelist. The discrepancy Zhang speaks of is most noticeable when one considers the Asian RWA market. It becomes clear that RWA.xyz is heavily dominated by US-based entities like Ondo and BUIDL, while tokenized commercial paper and green bonds occurring on Eastern infrastructure like Conflux and various Hong Kong-based pilots go underrepresented.

This enforcement action marks a pivotal moment in the regulatory scrutiny of crypto firms and their leadership. The move to bar these former FTX executives underscores the SEC’s commitment to holding individuals accountable for corporate misconduct. What Sanctions Is the SEC Seeking Against the Former FTX Executives? The SEC is pursuing significant sanctions against three central figures in the FTX collapse: former co-founder Gary Wang, former Director of Engineering Nishad Singh, and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. According to reports from The Block, the regulator aims to prohibit them from serving as officers or directors of any public company. While the individuals have not admitted to the SEC’s allegations, they have consented to proposed legal orders. These orders would formally bar them from future securities fraud and restrict specific professional activities for a period of five years. However, it is crucial to note that these measures still require final approval from a federal court to take effect. Why Is This SEC Action a Landmark for Crypto Regulation? This case represents more than just penalties for a single failed company; it is a landmark statement on governance and accountability in the digital asset space. The SEC’s push for an officer bar targets the individuals at the helm, signaling that regulators will pursue personal consequences for leadership failures. For the crypto market, this action sets a clear precedent. It demonstrates that traditional securities laws apply forcefully to crypto enterprises, especially those that interface with public investors. The consequences for the involved former FTX executives are severe, potentially ending their careers in corporate leadership for the foreseeable future. Moreover, this action is part of a broader pattern of intensified SEC scrutiny. It serves as a stark warning to other projects and their founders about the importance of compliance, transparency, and proper corporate structure. The message is unambiguous: the era of operating in regulatory gray areas is closing rapidly. What Are the Immediate and Long-Term Implications? The immediate effect is a powerful deterrent. Other crypto founders and executives are now on clear notice about the potential personal repercussions of regulatory violations. In the long term, this enforcement could accelerate a shift towards more robust compliance frameworks within crypto companies seeking legitimacy and longevity. Increased Scrutiny: Other crypto firms can expect deeper investigations into their corporate governance and securities offerings. Investor Protection Focus: The SEC is reinforcing its mandate to protect investors from fraud and misrepresentation, regardless of the technological backdrop. Career Consequences: The personal officer bar highlights that legal settlements can have lasting impacts beyond fines, affecting one’s professional standing. For the crypto industry, navigating this new landscape means prioritizing legal counsel and transparent operations from the outset. The case of these former FTX executives will likely be studied for years as a cautionary tale of what happens when rapid growth outpaces compliance and ethical governance. Conclusion: A New Chapter of Accountability Begins The SEC’s move to bar key former FTX executives from officer roles is a watershed moment. It closes a painful chapter for investors burned by the exchange’s collapse while boldly opening a new one defined by stricter accountability. This enforcement action is not merely punitive; it is a foundational step toward maturing the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By applying established rules on securities fraud and corporate officer conduct, regulators are drawing a necessary line in the sand. The path forward for the industry now demands a unwavering commitment to the very principles of transparency and integrity that blockchain technology promises. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Which former FTX executives are facing the SEC’s officer bar? A1: The SEC action targets former FTX co-founder Gary Wang, former Director of Engineering Nishad Singh, and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. Q2: Have the executives admitted guilt in this SEC case? A2: No. The reported filings state that the individuals have not admitted to the SEC’s allegations. They have, however, consented to the proposed legal orders that include the officer bar. Q3: How long would the officer ban last? A3: The consented-to orders would bar them from serving as officers or directors of public companies and restrict certain activities for a period of five years. Q4: Is this SEC action finalized? A4: Not yet. The proposed orders require approval from a federal judge before they become official and enforceable. Q5: What does this mean for other crypto companies? A5: This action sets a strong precedent. It signals the SEC’s willingness to pursue personal penalties against executives for securities law violations, urging all crypto firms to prioritize legal compliance and corporate governance. Q6: Can these individuals work in crypto again? A6: The reported orders would specifically bar them from officer or director roles at public companies. It does not necessarily prohibit all employment in the crypto or tech sectors, but their leadership opportunities would be severely limited for the duration of the bar.

Scaramucci Says The Setup Is Already In Motion",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/2500-solana-scaramucci-setup-already-in-motion/,"SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci said he still sees a path to Solana reaching $2,500 over a five-to-ten-year horizon, arguing that tokenization plus clearer US regulation could turn Solana into a core financial “rail system.” Scaramucci made the remarks in an interview with SolanaFloor filmed during last week’s Solana Breakpoint conference and released on Dec. 18. Why Solana Is Still Poised For $2,500 Scaramucci framed the $2,500 thesis as a long-duration bet that won’t play out cleanly. “It’s not going to come without… volatility,” he said, pointing to what he called a messy US regulatory year and sticky inflation as headwinds that “probably slowed down our trajectory.” “If you had asked me at the beginning of the year” whether Washington would pass stablecoin legislation and “the market structure, the CLARITY bill,” he said he would have expected both. “That did not happen.” Still, he argued “the timing is still right,” with the caveat that price will likely remain jumpy until those macro and regulatory variables resolve. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Support Shattered, Potential $100 Test Looms, Says Analyst To explain the patience required, Scaramucci leaned on a tech-investing analogy, recalling Amazon’s drawdowns by 90% before mass adoption. The lesson, in his words: stay with “great technology” through uncertain stretches because durable infrastructure eventually gets adopted. Asked what surprised him most this cycle, Scaramucci singled out the Trump and Melania memecoins. He described their Solana launch as “a compliment to Solana” because it was selected for “ability to handle large scale large volume transactions with great certainty and finality.” But he also argued the episode backfired on policy. “I think those coins slowed down the regulatory process in the US,” he said, suggesting that the optics of a US president entering the memecoin business created a political “foil” that opponents could use to resist crypto bills. “I think we would have gotten everything that we wanted this year had the president sort of stayed out of the meme coin business,” he added, calling it “short-term regulatory” damage. He also claimed the memecoin surge “sucked out all the liquidity from a lot of the altcoins,” which he said “hurt the industry,” even as it showcased Solana’s throughput. Tokenization Is The Endgame Scaramucci’s core argument was simple: tokenization is coming, and Solana is positioned to host a meaningful share of it. He said Paul Atkins, whom he described as a longtime personal friend, delivered what Scaramucci considers an underappreciated prediction: “In 5 years all of our assets are going to be tokenized.” Scaramucci then pushed his own conclusion: “What’s going to be the number one rail system to tokenize on? It’s going to be Solana.” He argued superior systems tend to win through adoption, not ideology. “If you have something that works better than something else, it gets adopted,” he said, comparing Solana’s trajectory to the internet’s jump from dial-up to today’s high-bandwidth reality. He also flagged operational progress on the network. “I don’t want to jinx us,” he said, but suggested Solana had gone “two years now without any” downtime. Related Reading: Solana Value Proposition Extends Beyond Tech Into Economic Infrastructure SolanaFloor challenged Scaramucci on why SkyBridge tokenized a $300 million fund on another chain. Scaramucci said it was “a very small fund,” and that a larger fund “will likely get tokenized on Solana.” He also rejected maximalism: “I don’t believe in chain monogamy,” he said. His view is that “three or four chains” will win, naming Solana and Avalanche. He argued Avalanche can be attractive for certain compliance-driven deployments, while Solana is where “stocks and bonds are going to be tokenized” and where “the larger funds are going to be tokenized.” Scaramucci also disclosed his personal positioning: “My largest personal position even greater than Bitcoin is my position in Solana and I have it all staked,” he said, adding he owns Avalanche and Bitcoin and holds a “very small position” in Ethereum. Scaramucci tied the next leg of the cycle to US policy and liquidity. If the US passes market-structure rules next year, he said, prices should respond. If inflation cools and the Fed can cut more aggressively under a new chair, he argued that would add liquidity and reinforce a “positive flywheel.” At press time, SOL traded at $125.

56053285,646928,1766170837,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56053285.jpeg,Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: The supply Imbalance Between The Assets Is Widening – Here’s What To Know,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ethereum-supply-imbalance/,"Given the heightened volatility in the broader cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin has fallen below the pivotal $90,000 level, while Ethereum has dropped below the $3,000 price mark. Following the recent pullback, a key divergence has been spotted between the two leading cryptocurrency assets, which could shape the market dynamics. A Growing Divide Between Bitcoin And Ethereum As volatility in the cryptocurrency market grows, a crucial divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum is gaining strength, attracting attention in the sector. The report states that the long-running comparison between Bitcoin and Ethereum is about to reach a new stage. On-chain data indicates a growing supply disparity between the two biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap. This divergence is a sign that Ethereum’s supply dynamics are changing more dramatically as a result of things like network activity, staking, and fee burning, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance and holder behavior remain consistent. It is worth noting that this marks the second time in this current cycle that the development is taking place. In the coming months, investors may be compelled to reassess their positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum due to this growing disparity, which is beginning to alter market narratives. Mignolet noted that buying liquidity is currently drying up. Meanwhile, the remaining liquidity is just moving around the market instead of growing. What this simply implies is that liquidity is slowing down, and in the absence of fresh inflows of new capital, the supply imbalance between Bitcoin and Ethereum cannot be fixed. During past scenarios, this BTC and ETH supply imbalance has been corrected only through declines in the price of both assets. Interestingly, this is precisely what transpired when BTC was trading above the $100,000 mark. As seen on the chart, the same pattern is currently resurfacing, hinting at a potential shift in market dynamics and direction. Mignolet claims that if fresh liquidity does not enter the crypto market, it may experience an extended period of consolidation or brief bounces. However, such moves would be pointless bounces, likely followed by further downward moves in the end. BTC And ETH Set TO See Massive Rotation Recent supply dynamics and capital flows are starting to align in a way that signals an impending massive rotation between Bitcoin and Ethereum. After examining the ETH/BTC chart, Melijn The Trader revealed that the pair is poised to experience its largest rotation in 8 years. This rotation has the potential to completely change how capital flows between the two largest assets in the market over the next few months. According to the expert, the last time this rotation occurred, Ethereum saw a notable 50x upward move. With the same trend resurfacing in addition to deeper liquidity and institutional firepower, a similar price explosion could repeat itself, which Merlijn believes will catch most crypto investors off guard. At the time of writing, CoinMarketCap’s data shows that BTC’s price was trading at $87,920 while ETH’s price was trading dangerously close to the $2,968 support level.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinmarketcap|ETH|ETH-BTC|Ethereum|Melijn The Trader,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-19 19:00:37

With the broader digital asset market enduring sustained selling pressure and macroeconomic headwinds, this well‑known altcoin finds itself at a pivotal technical crossroads. Long‑term traders and analysts are now revisiting past cycles for insight , asking whether the next major breakout might be on the horizon based on repeating behavior. According to reported analysis by TheCryptoBasic , XRP’s current technical condition—specifically its extended period below a key long‑term indicator—mirrors setups from previous cycles that were followed by sizeable upward moves. Sources show that XRP has now spent nearly 70 days trading below its 50‑week simple moving average (SMA), a metric many chartists regard as a structural dividing line between bearish compression and sustained bullish trends. The Historical Pattern The 50‑week SMA has emerged as a focal point in XRP’s price analysis due to its historical ability to signal reversals after extended dips. In technical terms, when XRP breaks below this long‑term moving average and remains there for roughly 50 to 84 days, it has previously marked the end of prolonged downtrends and foreshadowed strong upside moves upon reclaiming the level. This pattern has appeared multiple times over the past several years. In 2018, after dipping below the 50‑week SMA for about 70 days, XRP ultimately rallied more than 200% from its low. Again in 2021, a shorter spell under the same moving average—around 49 days—preceded a rebound of roughly 70%. The most dramatic example came in 2024, when XRP spent 84 days beneath the 50‑week SMA during a downturn. Upon reversing, it surged toward $3.66 in mid‑2025, a run that represents an approximately 850% increase from the cycle’s bottom. Such history has fueled speculation among some market observers that XRP’s latest stretch below this moving average could represent not just capitulation but the accumulation of latent strength ahead of a potential breakout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Current Technical Landscape Despite this historical context, XRP’s near‑term technical picture remains mixed. The digital asset recently lost the critical $2 support level, and price action continues to reflect broader bearish trends driven by both macro pressures and extended crypto market drawdowns. Technical indicators such as short‑term moving averages and momentum oscillators still suggest sellers retain the upper hand, and bearish chart patterns, including possible double‑top formations, have also been noted by seasoned analysts. At the same time, other data points suggest a potential bottom may be forming. Oversold conditions on weekly indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), along with evidence of compression at the lower end of the range, hint that downward pressure could be nearing exhaustion. What Could Come Next? If history repeats in a meaningful way and XRP continues its pattern of extended time beneath the 50‑week SMA followed by a strong reversal, the implications could be substantial. From the current base—near recent lows around $1.80–$1.85—replicating a full 850% run would imply multi‑digit price targets well above previous all‑time highs. Even a more conservative version, representing about half that magnitude, would still signal a dramatic shift relative to present price levels. However, it’s crucial to emphasize that past performance is not predictive. While cyclical analysis can illuminate potential scenarios, the broader market remains influenced by macro catalysts, investor sentiment, regulatory developments, and technical feedback loops. For traders and long‑term holders alike, the coming weeks will be telling—not just in confirming or negating this recurring pattern, but in revealing whether XRP’s next chapter will align with its most explosive rally in recent history.

CT's knee-jerk reaction is to whine about the return but the real takeaway is that is was 6th place DESPITE the negative return (Boomers putting on a HODL clinic). Even took in more than $GLD … pic.twitter.com/68uq3HFRuO — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 19, 2025 IBIT is currently the only ETF among the top flow leaders showing a year-to-date loss, with returns down roughly 9.6%. Yet the fund has still attracted approximately $25.4 billion in net inflows, placing it ahead of a range of established equity and commodity products — including the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), which is up more than 64% over the same period. Investor Demand Signals Shift Toward Long-Term Allocation The divergence between price performance and investor demand underscores a structural shift in how capital is engaging with Bitcoin exposure through regulated vehicles. Rather than reacting to short-term price movements, investors appear to be using periods of drawdown to accumulate positions via ETFs. \Balchunas describes the trend as a “HODL clinic,” suggesting that longer-term allocators are increasingly driving flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , treating them as strategic holdings rather than momentum trades. Equity ETFs Still Dominate, but Bitcoin Stands Out By comparison, the largest inflows in 2025 have gone to broad-based equity ETFs such as Vanguard’s S&P 500 tracker VOO, which has drawn more than $145 billion in net inflows alongside a mid-teens return. Other top-ranking funds include large-cap and total market products such as IVV, VTI, and SPYM, all benefiting from strong equity market performance. IBIT’s presence among these vehicles is notable given Bitcoin’s higher volatility and its relatively recent introduction as an ETF asset class. Bitcoin ETFs Outpace Gold Despite Underperformance The data also highlights a contrast with gold ETFs. While GLD has benefited from strong price appreciation in 2025, its inflows have lagged behind IBIT’s, indicating that performance alone has not been the primary driver of allocation decisions this year. According to Balchunas, the more significant takeaway may be what IBIT’s inflows imply for future cycles. If a Bitcoin ETF can attract more than $25 billion in a year marked by negative returns, the potential for substantially larger inflows during a strong market environment could be considerable. As spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to mature within traditional portfolio frameworks, flow data is increasingly being viewed as a leading indicator of long-term adoption. IBIT’s 2025 performance suggests that, even amid price weakness, investor conviction in regulated Bitcoin exposure remains resilient.

In an open letter posted on X on December 19, MANTRA CEO John Patrick Mullin proposed handling the migration manually “for maximum safety and assurance that it will be conducted with accuracy and efficiency.” In response to questions raised by Mullin regarding the number of OKX users’ OM tokens and the number of OM tokens OKX holds, OKX stated that the number of OKX user OM tokens to be migrated is 34,097,848, while the number of OKX’s $OM tokens to be migrated is 124,441,487. The exchange called on MANTRA to confirm to them by December 20, 2025, that all of the $OM tokens on their platform will be migrated, adding that it was consistent with Mullin’s public statements that MANTRA will support the migration of the $OM tokens. Mullin responded by offering to migrate all tokens between January 3 and 5, approximately two weeks later than OKX’s preferred timeline, citing concerns about year-end holiday disruptions. Transparency demands and formal warnings The dispute between the two parties reached new heights on December 12, after OKX shared a long and detailed post on X on what happened during the crash of the OM token, in what it labeled as “clarify the facts,” adding that the “MANTRA team continues to push a misleading narrative.” Last week, Mullin publicly questioned OKX’s handling of the token migration and demanded disclosure of the exchange’s OM holdings. On December 8, he shared on X that OKX’s migration announcement contained factual errors, claiming the exchange had unilaterally created specific dates without consulting MANTRA. OKX responded with a letter demanding that MANTRA commit to migration plans by December 20, or face delisting procedures. MANTRA’s reply adopted more diplomatic language compared to the previous week, expressing full support for ensuring proper migration procedures. Mullin stated that MANTRA will itself handle the migration of 100% of OM tokens under OKX’s control. He wrote, “Given the size of you and your users’ holdings, we will migrate manually for maximum safety and assurance that it will be conducted with accuracy and efficiency. The exact process is one that we have used with several other exchanges and is tried and tested.” He further outlined a detailed process involving tranches of approximately 20 million OM tokens sent to a specific EVM address, with each batch taking roughly 15 minutes to complete. Mullin asked the OKX team to provide the MANTRA address they wish to use for the proposed migration process as a first step. Will OKX agree to MANTRA’s proposed migration date? The current friction has reopened wounds from April 2025, when OM crashed by more than 90% in hours, erasing over $5 billion in market capitalization. Given the state of their relationship, OKX agreeing to MANTRA’s proposed timeline is currently unknown, and their next move will be monitored closely. This is a developing story.

The move shows traders leaning heavily into borrowed positions at a time when Ethereum’s price remains fragile, raising the stakes for both sharp rebounds and sudden pullbacks. Leverage Spikes as Aggressive Buying Returns According to on-chain analytics account CryptoOnchain, Ethereum’s Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) on Binance reached 0.611, the highest reading on record. The metric tracks how much borrowed capital traders are using relative to exchange reserves, with higher values pointing to greater risk across open positions. At the same time, the ETH Taker Buy Sell Ratio jumped to 1.13, a level last seen in September 2023. CryptoOnchain pointed out that a ratio above one means market buyers are outweighing sellers, showing traders are willing to pay the market price to enter long positions. “The convergence of these two metrics sends a clear message: traders are not only highly optimistic about ETH’s price action (strong buying pressure) but are also willing to take on massive risks to back this sentiment (historic leverage),” the market watcher concluded. Some technical traders echoed that cautious optimism, with analyst Ted Pillows posting on X that ETH had bounced after touching the $2,700 to $2,800 support band. He said holding that zone keeps a move toward $3,100–$3,200 in play, while a breakdown could drag prices back to around $2,500. However, CryptoOnchain cautioned that the current setup is a “double-edged sword.” While it provides the impetus to kick ETH’s price past higher resistance levels, the accumulation of leveraged positions at historical highs also leaves the market vulnerable to extreme volatility, meaning that the smallest correction “increases the probability of a long squeeze.” Price Action Clashes With Soft Network Signals The leverage buildup comes just one day after broader warnings about Ethereum’s weakening structure. As reported previously, ETH had dropped about 12% over the prior week and was struggling below major resistance near $3,660, with several analysts pointing to lower targets if support continues to fail. At the time of writing, the asset was trading just above $2,900, up over 3% on the day but still down about 9% in the last seven days and more than 4% over the past month. Additionally, the token has lost about one-third of its value over the past three months, and slightly over 20% year-on-year, which has pushed it over 40% below its August all-time high near $5,000. Volatility remains elevated, with ETH moving between roughly $2,780 and $3,000 over the past 24 hours, while daily trading volume has climbed to nearly $39 billion, suggesting heightened speculative activity rather than steady spot demand. That view lines up with earlier on-chain data shared by CryptoOnchain, which showed active sending addresses near a one-year low. The analyst said retail participation appears muted, a pattern often seen after extended choppy price action. Historically, such phases have lined up with accumulation by longer-term holders, but they can also limit short-term upside without fresh demand.

What makes this venture truly groundbreaking? It’s not just another AI company—it’s a bold attempt to build ‘world model’ AI that could fundamentally challenge the dominance of large language models. With reports of a staggering $5 billion+ valuation target before even launching, this move signals a potential paradigm shift in how AI understands and interacts with reality. Who is Yann LeCun and Why Does His New Startup Matter? Yann LeCun isn’t just another AI researcher. As a Turing Award winner, NYU professor, and former Chief AI Scientist at Meta, his credentials are impeccable. His decision to launch AMI Labs (Advanced Machine Intelligence) represents a significant vote of confidence in a different approach to artificial intelligence. While he serves as Executive Chairman rather than CEO, his involvement provides immediate credibility and attracts top-tier talent and investment. What Exactly is World Model AI? World model AI represents a fundamental departure from current LLM architecture. Instead of simply predicting the next word in a sequence, world models attempt to understand environments and simulate cause-and-effect relationships. Think of it as giving AI a sense of physical reality and logical consequences. Traditional LLMs World Model AI Predict text sequences Simulates environments Prone to hallucinations Aims for logical consistency Statistical pattern matching Causal reasoning Creative but unreliable Deterministic predictions The core promise of world model AI lies in solving what LeCun and others see as fundamental limitations of current systems. By building AI that understands how the world works, developers hope to create more reliable, trustworthy systems that don’t ‘make things up’—a persistent problem with today’s generative AI. Why is AMI Labs Seeking Such a Massive Valuation? The reported €3 billion (approximately $3.5 billion) valuation target for AMI Labs might seem audacious for a pre-launch startup. However, context is crucial. The AI investment landscape has transformed dramatically, with top-tier AI scientists commanding unprecedented valuations: Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab: $12 billion seed round valuation Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs: $1 billion valuation at launch Multiple AI startups with founding teams from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic raising at billion-dollar+ valuations What investors are betting on isn’t just technology—it’s the potential for paradigm-shifting innovation. World model AI represents what many consider the next evolutionary step beyond LLMs, and having Yann LeCun at the helm makes AMI Labs a particularly attractive proposition. Who Will Lead AMI Labs as CEO? In a strategic move, AMI Labs has recruited Alex LeBrun as its CEO. LeBrun brings substantial experience from his role as co-founder and CEO of Nabla, a successful medical transcription AI startup. His background includes: Early work at Nuance Communications (which powered original Siri technology) Founding and selling natural language startups to major tech companies Leading Facebook’s AI division Growing Nabla to significant scale with $120 million in funding LeBrun’s transition to AMI Labs CEO comes with an interesting twist: Nabla has signed a partnership to use AMI’s models as they develop, creating a potential early application for the world model technology in healthcare. How Does This Impact the Broader AI Startup Ecosystem? The emergence of AMI Labs signals several important trends in the AI investment landscape: Premium on AI Research Pedigree : Founders with proven research backgrounds command unprecedented valuations Shift Toward Alternative Architectures : Investors are betting on approaches beyond transformer-based LLMs Convergence of Research and Commercialization Top academics are increasingly launching ventures to commercialize their research Intensifying Competition : With Google DeepMind and other labs also working on world models, we’re seeing a new arms race in AI architecture What Are the Potential Challenges for AMI Labs? Despite the excitement, AMI Labs faces significant hurdles: Technical Complexity : Building reliable world models is an unsolved research problem Market Timing : LLMs continue to dominate both mindshare and investment Execution Risk Translating research breakthroughs into commercial products Competition : Multiple well-funded teams are pursuing similar approaches Expectation Management : With a massive valuation comes immense pressure to deliver Frequently Asked Questions What is Yann LeCun’s background in AI? Yann LeCun is a Turing Award winner, NYU professor, and former Chief AI Scientist at Meta . He’s renowned for his work on convolutional neural networks and reinforcement learning. How does world model AI differ from ChatGPT-style LLMs? World models focus on understanding environments and simulating cause-and-effect, while LLMs primarily predict text sequences based on statistical patterns. Who is Alex LeBrun? Alex LeBrun is the new CEO of AMI Labs, previously co-founder and CEO of Nabla , a medical AI startup. He has extensive experience in natural language processing and AI leadership. What other companies are working on world models? Google DeepMind and Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs are among the notable organizations developing similar technology. How much funding has Nabla raised? Nabla has raised $120 million total, including a $70 million Series C in June 2024 from investors including LeCun himself. The Transformative Potential of World Model AI The launch of AMI Labs represents more than just another well-funded AI startup. It signals a growing recognition within the AI community that current approaches have fundamental limitations that require architectural innovation. World model AI offers the promise of more reliable, trustworthy systems that understand rather than just generate—a crucial step toward artificial general intelligence. For investors, the massive valuation reflects both the pedigree of the founding team and the transformative potential of the technology. For the AI ecosystem, it represents healthy diversification beyond the LLM-dominated landscape. And for technology users, it offers hope for AI systems that reason rather than hallucinate, understand rather than mimic. As Yann LeCun’s AMI Labs begins its journey with unprecedented ambition and resources, the entire AI world will be watching. Will world model AI deliver on its promise to overcome LLM limitations? Can this approach scale to commercial viability? The answers to these questions could reshape the future of artificial intelligence.

The full-scale launch of the state-issued coin is slated to begin in the second half of next year, but the authorities in Moscow intend to start using it sooner. Russian government to spend digital rubles on payroll and repairs The Cabinet of Ministers in Moscow has adopted a list of expenditures that can be covered using the Bank of Russia’s central bank digital currency (CBDC). Budget payments with the new incarnation of the national fiat can now commence by the end of the year, the RIA Novosti news agency reported Friday. Items on the list include social security transfers, salaries, and other payments in the public sector, as well as funding for capital construction, repair, and maintenance of state-owned facilities. The report quoted a notice published on the website of the Ministry of Finance: “The Russian government has approved a list of budget expenditures for which the digital ruble may be used as early as 2025.” The department remarked that such payments will be made exclusively at the request of their recipients. “Only the citizen themselves can open a digital ruble account,” the Minfin statement clarifies. The list has been drafted in accordance with the law “On Amendments to the Budget Code of the Russian Federation,” which entered into force earlier this year. It provides the legal basis for the execution of the federal budget using the digital ruble account of the Federal Treasury, the Minfin explained. The Treasury of the Russian Federation is an executive body overseeing the spending of budget money by different administrators and recipients of government-allocated funds. It was established after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, initially as a structure within the Russian finance ministry, and later transformed into a separate agency subordinated to the Minfin. At the end of November, the Treasury announced it’s officially starting to accept revenues in the CBDC from January 1, as reported by Cryptopolitan. “This year, the first payments in the digital ruble were also made,” its head, Roman Artyukhin, reminded during a meeting with Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. Digital ruble payments gaining traction ahead of 2026 launch The Ministry of Finance emphasized it’s working closely with the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) on the integration of the digital ruble into the budget process. It confirmed that institutions and other organizations will be able to use the CBDC to transfer funds to and from various budgets from the beginning of next year. The digital ruble , which is the third form of the national currency after cash and electronic “bank” money, has been under development for quite a few years. A pilot project, which is expanding now, was launched in 2023. Following a call from President Vladimir Putin earlier this year for mass adoption of the sovereign coin, the CBR published a schedule for its gradual introduction for public use. This will be done in several stages, with the first one set to begin on September 1, 2026. In late November, the monetary authority unveiled that transfers between individual wallets will be free of charge while payments to businesses will carry the lowest fees on the market – 0.3% for commercial transactions and 0.2% for payments covering housing and utility bills. The Russian digital currency will also be integrated into existing banking apps, the regulator announced in December. This aims to keep transaction costs low as developing a dedicated application would be more expensive.

In one devastating week, three prominent hardware startups—iRobot, Luminar, and Rad Power Bikes—filed for bankruptcy. This isn’t just bad luck; it’s a systemic warning for anyone building physical products today. For the crypto community, this serves as a crucial parallel: building tangible value in a volatile, interconnected global system is fraught with peril. The challenges facing these hardware startups—supply chain issues, global trade tensions, and relentless cheap overseas competition—mirror the regulatory and market pressures that crypto projects navigate daily. Understanding why these companies failed provides vital lessons for any venture operating at the intersection of technology, manufacturing, and global finance. Why Are Hardware Startups Failing? The recent wave of bankruptcies points to a perfect storm of external pressures and internal missteps. While each company had unique problems, common themes emerge. The core business model of creating innovative physical products is under immense strain. High capital costs, long development cycles, and thin margins leave little room for error when market conditions shift. For investors and builders in tech, whether in crypto or hardware, this highlights the importance of resilient business models that can withstand geopolitical and economic shocks. The Crushing Weight of Global Trade Tensions Geopolitics has become a direct business cost. Tariffs and trade restrictions, particularly between the U.S. and China, have dismantled previously reliable supply chains. Companies that relied on cost-effective Chinese manufacturing found their margins evaporating overnight. This environment of global trade tensions creates uncertainty that makes long-term planning nearly impossible. Startups are forced to choose between higher costs or complex, multi-country supply webs that introduce new risks and delays. Company Core Product Key Bankruptcy Trigger iRobot Robotic Vacuums (Roomba) Failed acquisition by Amazon amid regulatory scrutiny over global trade tensions and competition. Luminar Automotive LiDAR Sensors Slower-than-expected adoption in the auto industry and intense supply chain issues. Rad Power Bikes Electric Bicycles Rising costs, inventory glut, and fierce cheap overseas competition. Supply Chain Issues: The Silent Startup Killer Modern hardware is a symphony of components from around the world. When that symphony falters, the entire product fails. The pandemic exposed deep fragility, but the problems persist. Key challenges include: Component Shortages: A missing $5 chip can halt production of a $5,000 device. Logistical Nightmares: Shipping delays and soaring freight costs eat directly into profits. Inventory Risk: Holding stock is expensive, but running out is catastrophic. Startups often get this balance wrong. Demand Forecasting: Predicting market demand a year in advance, when parts must be ordered, is a gamble. These supply chain issues are a relentless drain on capital and morale, leaving startups vulnerable to even minor market shifts. The Relentless Pressure of Cheap Overseas Competition Innovation alone cannot protect a market. A startup can pioneer a category, like robotic vacuums or direct-to-consumer e-bikes, only to be flooded by copycats. These competitors often benefit from lower labor costs, state subsidies, and less regulatory overhead. They can undercut on price, forcing the original innovator into a margin war it cannot win. This cheap overseas competition commoditizes innovation at a staggering speed, making it difficult for startups to recoup their massive R&D investments. What Can Crypto and Tech Learn from This Hardware Apocalypse? The collapse of these hardware startups is not an isolated event. It’s a case study in modern business risk. The lessons are stark: Diversify Your Foundations: Relying on a single supplier, manufacturer, or market is a recipe for disaster. Build redundancy into your operational model. Control Your Core Technology: If your product can be easily reverse-engineered and manufactured cheaper elsewhere, you have no moat. Seek patents, unique integrations, or software locks. Manage Cash Relentlessly: Hardware burns cash. So does developing blockchain infrastructure. Extend your runway by every possible means. Regulatory Strategy is Key: iRobot’s fate was sealed by regulators. Whether it’s trade policy or crypto regulation, understanding the political landscape is non-negotiable. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Builders The bankruptcies of iRobot, Luminar, and Rad Power Bikes are a sobering reminder that brilliant technology is not enough. Success requires navigating a complex web of global logistics, trade policy, and cutthroat competition. For the crypto and tech world, these stories underscore that building the future is as much about robust, adaptable business engineering as it is about software code or circuit design. The era of easy money for flashy hardware is over. The next generation of startups must be built for resilience, not just growth.

FAQs: Hardware Startup Bankruptcies Which major hardware startups recently filed for bankruptcy? Three notable companies filed in a short period: iRobot (maker of Roomba), Luminar Technologies (LiDAR for autonomous vehicles), and Rad Power Bikes (electric bicycles). What was the main reason for iRobot’s bankruptcy? iRobot’s decline was precipitated by the collapse of its acquisition by Amazon , which faced significant antitrust scrutiny from regulators like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) , coupled with intense market competition. How do supply chain issues affect hardware startups? They cause critical component shortages, skyrocketing production and logistics costs, and make accurate inventory planning impossible, severely straining the limited capital of startups. What is meant by ‘cheap overseas competition’? It refers to manufacturers, often based in regions with lower production costs, that quickly replicate innovative products and sell them at lower price points, eroding the market share and profitability of the original innovator. Are all hardware startups doomed? No, but the barrier to success is now much higher. Startups need exceptionally strong moats, careful capital management, and strategies to mitigate risks from global trade tensions and supply chain volatility.

Spot prices moved up 2.3% to $69.6/oz, locking in a weekly jump of 8.1% after hitting $67.20 earlier in the session. The move capped a wild year where silver climbed 132%, far ahead of gold’s 65% rise. Cryptopolitan has analyzed that strong investor demand is what kept pushing the gains, and the shortage in supply couldn’t let the market cool off. Gold also moved higher. Spot gold rose 0.3% to $4,346.69/oz by late morning in New York, while U.S. gold futures added 0.4% to $4,380. Gold was set to end the week up more than 1%, helped by growing bets that the Federal Reserve will cut rates next year . That call gained strength after new numbers showed inflation slowing and the labor market weakening. Metals react to inflation data and investor flows Other metals jumped too. Platinum added 3.2% to $1,977.85 after touching its highest level in more than 17 years on Thursday. Palladium moved 0.4% to $1,701.75 after hitting a nearly three-year peak earlier in the session. Both metals were heading for weekly gains. Phillip Streible of Blue Line Futures said “ETF flows (in silver) continue to dominate that theme as well as some speculation from the retail investor.” He said the fresh macro data drove more demand toward metals after the U.S. consumer price report showed a 2.7% rise in November. Economists had expected 3.1%, so the softer reading strengthened the case for rate cuts. The U.S. Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest level since September 2021. Streible said, “We’ve seen the lower inflation data, the weakening labor report. It really reaffirms that the Federal Reserve should keep on their easing path. Second is a lot of the uncertainty around what central bank policy is going to entail.” Traders kept pricing in at least two 25-basis-point cuts next year, based on LSEG data. U.S. stocks move after AI volatility and new Oracle-TikTok deal U.S. equities also pushed higher on Friday. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2%, the S&P 500 rose 0.9%, and the Dow added 259 points, or 0.5%. Oracle led the move after a rough week where investors worried about its cloud business. That concern started when a report said a key backer had pulled out of one of Oracle’s data-center projects, a blow that also hit Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. Oracle shares jumped 8% after joining a group set to run TikTok’s U.S. operations. In a memo to workers, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said the U.S. unit will be overseen by a joint venture made up of Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX. The deal is expected to close on January 22. The agreement keeps TikTok alive in the U.S. after President Joe Biden signed a law requiring a divestment of the platform’s American division over national-security concerns. President Donald Trump had already extended the deadline several times and later signed an executive order approving a possible divestment plan for ByteDance. Under the new setup, Oracle will check and confirm that TikTok follows “agreed upon National Security Terms”, according to the memo.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC has risen above $88,000 , trading at $88,005.99 on the Binance USDT market. This breakthrough represents more than just a number—it signals renewed confidence and potential shifts in the broader financial landscape. Let’s explore what’s driving this surge and what it could mean for your portfolio. What Does BTC Rising Above $88,000 Actually Mean? When we say BTC rises above $88,000 , we’re discussing a key psychological and technical barrier. This price point isn’t arbitrary. It often acts as a resistance level that, once broken, can trigger further upward momentum. The fact that this movement is happening on a major exchange like Binance adds legitimacy to the price action. Therefore, this isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a statement of strength from the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Key Factors Fueling Bitcoin’s Current Surge Several converging elements are creating the perfect environment for Bitcoin’s growth. First, institutional adoption continues to accelerate, with more traditional finance players entering the space. Second, macroeconomic factors like inflation concerns are pushing investors toward assets perceived as stores of value. Moreover, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event is historically linked to bullish cycles, creating positive market sentiment. Consider these specific drivers: Increased Institutional Investment: Major funds and corporations are allocating more capital to Bitcoin. Regulatory Clarity: Progress in cryptocurrency regulation reduces uncertainty for investors. Technological Advancements: Improvements in blockchain scalability and security enhance Bitcoin’s utility.

Seeing BTC rise above $88,000 might trigger different reactions. For long-term holders, this reinforces their investment thesis. For newcomers, it presents both opportunity and caution. The crucial approach is to avoid emotional decisions. Instead, focus on fundamentals: your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall portfolio strategy. Remember, cryptocurrency markets are volatile, and what goes up can experience corrections. Here are actionable insights for different types of investors: For New Investors: Consider dollar-cost averaging rather than investing a lump sum at current highs. For Experienced Traders: Monitor key support and resistance levels around this new $88,000 benchmark. For Everyone: Ensure you’re using secure wallets and reputable exchanges for any transactions. The Road Ahead: What’s Next After $88,000? Breaking through $88,000 opens the door to the next psychological target: $90,000. However, the path won’t necessarily be straight up. Markets typically test new support levels after significant breakthroughs. The key question is whether Bitcoin can maintain momentum above this threshold. If it consolidates successfully above $88,000, it establishes a new floor for future growth. This BTC rise above $88,000 could be the precursor to the next major bull market phase. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s ascent past $88,000 marks a pivotal moment that reflects growing mainstream acceptance and investor confidence.

While this is great for Bitcoin’s status as digital gold, it has led investors to seek out greater levels of value farther down the risk curve, representing potential breakout values of the next market cycle. In this emerging paradigm shift, the focus has turned toward DeFi crypto initiatives which remain relatively early in their adoption cycles yet already reflect intelligible levels of progress. In this emerging landscape, one initiative rapidly gaining traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is quickly emerging as a standout and is already gaining steam as the top crypto to invest in 2026. Currently selling at $0.035 with fully immersed levels into Presale phase #6, which is rapidly reaching the end of its cycle with near-completion status, MUTM has already garnered nearly $20 million with more than 18,530 separate accounts holding tokens, reflecting levels of market conviction not easily underestimated. With its focus on providing a decentralized lending and borrowing platform with added emphasis on interest-bearing tokens and sustainable yield strategies and a rapidly activated plan to implement its provisions with a forthcoming V1 Testnet launch, Mutuum is rapidly emerging with intentions of sitting not only as a viable alternative to such stalwart assets as Bitcoin, but as the next-generation DeFi crypto with a strong potential payoff as the market peers into the horizon in 2026 and beyond. Bitcoin Under Pressure in The Short Term With Key Levels Crucially Important Bitcoin (BTC) is currently in a neutral to bearish cycle in the short term, as it is trading below key moving averages and has slowing momentum, with the RSI close to the oversold range. This formation indicates a possible short-term rebound but has not yet confirmed a turn-around situation. Market participants are closely monitoring the key resistance range of $92,000 to $95,000, as well as the crucial support levels of $87,000 to $88,000 and $83,000 to $80,000. Within the rather cautious market sentiment, the demand for brand-new, highly promising projects demonstrates the early adoption of underlying value, as seen by the rising interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM Presale Almost Fully Subscribed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly setting itself up as the top crypto to invest in 2026. It is currently in phase 6 of its presale and is almost fully allocated, with over 18,530 participants and more than $19.5 million in contribution. It is currently priced at $0.035, one of the last chances for investors before entering phase 7, in which the cost will be 20% higher at $0.04. The presale performance is a clear indication of the attractiveness of MUTM as a cryptocurrency with both potential and use value for DeFi crypto. Unlike most other altcoins, Mutuum Finance’s key focus is not trading but use and adoption. The transparency, lending frameworks, and use-driven models of MUTM make it a DeFi crypto with long-term potential. Collateral Management for the More Sophisticated Investor Mutuum Finance uses an integrated risk management system that safeguards both the protocol itself as well as its users. The protocol utilizes collateralization ratios, lending, as well as deposit caps, designed to ensure systemic stability. If positions are discovered under required collateralization levels, liquidations are carried out, accompanied by penalty charges and liquidation premiums. Collateral efficiency is attained by optimal LTV ratio management, especially in highly collateralized loaning conditions. Additionally, the reserve provisioning protects against market volatility, where surplus reserves are used for high-risk assets that can withstand market fluctuations. The combination of these protocols guarantees that Mutuum Finance is safe, stable, and efficient in all market conditions. The Best DeFi Crypto to Watch in 2026 The fact that Bitcoin is consolidating around $87,000 – $95,000 means that traders and investors are seeking out higher growth rates, and their attention is turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). At a current price of $0.035, with over 18,530 unique holders and almost $20 million raised in phase 6 of its presale, MUTM provides genuine DeFi crypto utilization through its dual lending model, interest-bearing tokens, and imminent V1 Sepolia testnet. Get on board now before phase 7 begins and pushes the price up to $0.04.

Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR up?

Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy.

The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility creating an atmosphere of extreme fear are challenges that monero traders could face that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and the broader monero project gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets.

During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313.

Short-term price swings have failed to establish a clear directional bias, reinforcing a broader sense of uncertainty among traders and investors. While price remains historically high, internal market conditions suggest that underlying stress is building beneath the surface, particularly within the mining sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Elevated Downside Risk: Loss Selling Takes Hold As STH SOPR Falls Below 1 A recent analysis by Axel Adler highlights growing pressure on Bitcoin miners using the Miner Financial Health Index, a composite metric that assesses mining profitability relative to price. Readings above 80% historically signal excessive profitability and late-cycle conditions, while levels below 20% indicate financial strain and elevated risk for miners. Currently, the index sits near 22%, once again approaching the Alert zone. This places miner profitability near one of its weakest levels since 2022, despite Bitcoin trading well above its summer 2022 price range. Similar conditions have typically appeared during post-correction phases or shortly after halving events, when revenue compression collides with high network difficulty. This divergence between elevated price levels and deteriorating miner fundamentals raises important questions about the sustainability of Bitcoin’s current structure as the market searches for its next equilibrium. Miner Economics Signal Growing Stress Beneath Bitcoin’s Price Adler’s analysis further examines the demand–supply balance within Bitcoin’s mining economics, offering deeper insight into why miner profitability continues to deteriorate. This index tracks the ratio of transaction fee revenue relative to new coin issuance, effectively measuring how much users are willing to pay for blockspace compared to the rate of supply expansion. Historically, readings above 70% indicate strong demand and a risk-on environment, while levels below 30% reflect structural weakness. Currently, the demand–supply balance sits near 38% on a 30-day average. While not yet in outright stress territory, the metric has declined steadily from local highs above 60%, placing it firmly in a neutral-weak zone. This trend suggests that organic demand for blockspace remains subdued, with users showing little urgency to outbid one another through higher fees. For a clear improvement in conditions, Adler notes that the index would need to reclaim levels above 50%, likely requiring a surge in transaction activity or a meaningful on-chain catalyst. This weakness is mirrored in absolute miner revenue. Bitcoin miner revenue, measured in US dollars and smoothed over seven days, has fallen to roughly $40 million after a recent peak. Although consistent with 2025 averages, this level remains well below revenue spikes seen during periods of heightened network activity. With difficulty remaining elevated, declining revenues amplify pressure on less efficient miners, reinforcing the stress signaled by both profitability and demand metrics. Related Reading: Legendary Bitcoin OG Deepens Ethereum Bet Despite Losses Exceeding $70 Million Bitcoin Price Struggles to Reclaim Key Trend Levels Bitcoin’s price action on the daily chart reflects a market struggling to regain structural strength after a sharp corrective phase. BTC is currently trading around the $88,000 area following a rebound from recent lows, but the broader trend remains fragile. The selloff from the $120,000–$125,000 region marked a clear break in momentum, with price slicing below the short-term moving averages and triggering accelerated downside pressure. Notably, Bitcoin lost the daily 50-day and 100-day moving averages during the decline, confirming a shift toward a bearish short-term structure. While the 200-day moving average continues to trend higher and remains intact, price is now consolidating just below it, turning this level into a critical zone of resistance. As long as BTC fails to reclaim and hold above this long-term trend line, upside attempts are likely to face selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Structure Turns Bearish As Structural Indicators Flip Negative The sharp increase in sell volume during the breakdown contrasts with relatively muted buying volume on the rebound, suggesting that recent upside moves are corrective rather than impulsive. Structurally, Bitcoin is forming a lower-high pattern, which keeps downside risk elevated if support near $85,000–$86,000 fails. For bulls to regain control, BTC must reclaim the 200-day moving average and establish higher highs. Until then, the chart favors consolidation or further volatility rather than a sustained recovery.

GeeFi has quickly become a key target for investment capital, starting with a sell-out Phase 1 that sold 10 million tokens , raised $500,000 , and cultivated a strong community of over 2,400 investors . This initial success has only grown, with total token sales now climbing past 24 million and funds raised exceeding $1.4 million . With under 1 million tokens available in Phase 2, interest in this non-custodial wallet and ecosystem is peaking. Analysts widely predict Phase 3 will launch in days, spurred by growing whispers of listings on major exchanges. Real Utility vs. Regional Expansion Avalanche is currently testing critical support at $11.65 while expanding in the MENA region and focusing on purpose-built blockchains. While established platforms work on long-term plans, astute investors are turning to GeeFi , a project many experts are calling 2026’s 100x gem . At its heart, GeeFi is a sophisticated non-custodial wallet designed to eliminate the complexity of managing crypto. It provides a single, secure dashboard for overseeing assets across 14+ networks , removing the need for multiple apps and interfaces. The GeeFi Team has focused on delivering a functional product before asking for investment, having launched a complete platform in 2024 after starting development in 2023. The ecosystem extends far beyond asset storage. Its roadmap includes a forthcoming Decentralized Exchange (DEX) for simple trading and Crypto Cards that will let users spend digital assets globally. With its Android app already live and an iOS version on the way, GeeFi is proving its value daily and reinforcing its reputation as 2026’s 100x gem . A Presale Opportunity with Explosive Potential The GeeFi presale is now in the final stages of Phase 2, with tokens available for just $0.06 . This price point offers early participants a guaranteed 667% return based on the confirmed listing price of $0.40 . The potential for further growth is immense. An investment of $1,800 today could swell to $90,000 if the token achieves the $3 valuation that analysts project, representing a remarkable 4,900% ROI . The demand for GEE tokens is intensifying. With fewer than 1 million tokens left , Phase 2 has already raised over $1.4 million from the sale of 24 million tokens . Industry observers have praised the presale’s execution and believe Phase 3 will sell out almost instantly due to rumors of imminent exchange listings. This strong buying momentum confirms the widespread belief that GeeFi is on track to become 2026’s 100x gem . Maximize Earnings with High-Yield Staking GeeFi offers a compelling staking program that rewards long-term holders with substantial passive income. Participants can lock their GEE tokens to earn 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or an impressive 55% APR for a 12-month commitment . For those who value flexibility, a liquid staking option provides up to 10% APR with no lock-up requirement , ensuring rewards continue to accumulate without restricting access to funds. To further accelerate growth, GeeFi has integrated a powerful referral program. Users who share their referral link earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made through their network. This system not only expands the community but also allows early supporters to build their holdings effortlessly, creating a dynamic wealth-generation tool. Secure Your Tokens Before They’re Gone An opportunity to invest in a project with a live product and clear utility at such a low price is exceedingly rare. The GeeFi presale is a limited-time chance to acquire tokens at a valuation that may never be seen again. With a deflationary token design, a functional mobile application, and a roadmap including a DEX and crypto debit cards, GeeFi is set for significant adoption. The rapid sales pace shows that both retail and institutional investors are moving quickly. Don’t miss this opportunity to invest in what analysts confirm is 2026’s 100x gem .

The payment and loan company will add USDC as a source of funding for its loans. Klarna announced it will allow USDC deposits, made possible through a Coinbase partnership. The payment and loan platform reaches out to large-scale holders of stablecoins, aiming to add their liquidity to its portfolio. Breaking crypto news! Klarna is adding USDC-denominated funding via @coinbase , tapping into a brand-new pool of institutional investors. A major step toward a more diversified, digitally powered funding model. Treasury evolution in progress! — Klarna (@Klarna) December 19, 2025 The announcement arrives just weeks after Klarna shared plans to launch its own USD-backed stablecoin. However, USDC usage may arrive first, using the existing infrastructure of Coinbase Custody. USDC was one of the fast-growing stablecoins in 2025, expanding its supply from 42B to over 78B tokens for the past 12 months. Klarna has been keeping a distance from crypto while building its own presence and brand for retail loans and the market for installment payments. This time, Klarna did not turn to crypto retailers, instead aiming to draw in the large-scale holders of stablecoins. Klarna’s business model centers around offering zero-interest loans in buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) offers for consumer products. Klarna onboards USDC as a source of capital In 2025, stablecoin holders were seeking various sources of yield, putting their assets in DeFi vaults with differing levels of risk. Klarna may offer a much lower risk for USDC holders. The available pool of stablecoins may become a part of Klarna’s usual pool of available capital. Klarna uses capital acquired through its banking arm, accepting direct deposits or issuing bonds. ‘ Stablecoin connects us to an entirely new class of institutional investors, ’ said Niclas Neglén, Klarna’s CFO, in a statement. USDC deposits are as close as possible to direct fiat liquidity, as the stablecoin is fully regulated for the US market. Klarna and many other fintech apps for now avoid crypto-collateralized stablecoins. Coinbase holds assets on behalf of third parties through Coinbase Custody. As of December 2025, the platform carries around $50M in USDC. The USDC stablecoin is widely distributed and not concentrated in top addresses. The stablecoin is widely used by both crypto insiders and institutions. The inclusion of Klarna may take some of the liquidity from existing platforms. The partnership is one of the recent cross-overs between traditional and mainstream finance. Circle is also bridging the gap between fintech and crypto-insider activity, with significant growth in payment usage in 2025. Klarna meets financing headwinds One of the key challenges of Klarna is the cost of funding. The company also aims to increase the share of longer-term loans in 2026. The company achieved 32% revenue growth in Q3, but had a net loss of $14M due to bad loan write-offs. KLAR shares also trade near their lowest range at $30.79. KLAR is one of the new tokens for 2025 that is trading under its ICO price. The company suffers pressure as trust in consumer credit remains low, noting the potential risk of bad loans.

The filings in Manhattan federal court formalize settlement terms for executives who cooperated extensively with prosecutors during Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial but still face permanent securities law injunctions. Ellison, Wang, and Singh agreed to permanent injunctions barring future violations of federal antifraud provisions, along with five-year conduct-based restrictions, according to SEC Litigation Release 26450. The proposed judgments require court approval before taking effect. The U.S. SEC said it has filed proposed final consent judgments in the Southern District of New York against Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, Zixiao “Gary” Wang, former CTO of FTX, and Nishad Singh, former co-lead engineer of FTX. Subject to court approval, the… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 19, 2025 Notably, the latest SEC enforcement action was conducted by Amy Burkart alongside investigators Devlin Su, Ivan Snyder, David Brown, Brian Huchro, and Pasha Salimi under the supervision of Laura D’Allaird and Amy Flaherty Hartman from the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit. FTX Executives Consent to Permanent Securities Fraud Injunctions The SEC’s original complaints alleged that from May 2019 through November 2022, the executives participated in raising over $1.8 billion from investors through false claims about FTX’s safety measures and risk controls. Prosecutors charged that Bankman-Fried , Wang , and Singh exempted Alameda Research from automated risk mitigation while granting the trading firm unlimited access to customer deposits. Wang and Singh wrote software that diverted FTX customer funds to Alameda, while Ellison directed misappropriated assets toward the hedge fund’s trading operations. Bankman-Fried subsequently transferred hundreds of millions in additional customer funds to Alameda for venture investments and personal loans to executives, including Wang and Singh. The three defendants consented to final judgments without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations. Beyond permanent antifraud injunctions under Securities Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Securities Act Section 17(a), they accepted conduct-based restrictions that would prevent similar violations for five years. Cooperation Yields Divergent Criminal Sentences Despite Securities Bars Just days ago, it was discovered that Ellison completed approximately 11 months at Danbury Federal Correctional Institution before transferring to community confinement in October, with her projected release now set for February 2026. Caroline Ellison moved to community confinement after 11 months, projected release February 2026 following FTX fraud cooperation. #FTX #Crypto https://t.co/gFUZ1a4Tdu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 17, 2025 Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced her to two years despite defense requests for probation, praising her substantial cooperation while maintaining that the fraud’s severity warranted incarceration. During her September 2024 sentencing hearing, Ellison expressed deep remorse while holding back tears. “ On some level, my brain doesn’t even comprehend all the people I harmed, ” she told the court. Her attorneys had requested no prison time, but Kaplan rejected what he termed a “ literal get-out-of-jail-free card ” despite acknowledging her unprecedented cooperation. Federal prosecutors emphasized Ellison’s critical testimony in their September sentencing recommendation, noting the “ what ” and “ how ” of the crimes would have been difficult to prove without her three days of trial testimony. She revealed that Bankman-Fried instructed executives to invest billions in customer assets that had been secretly siphoned from FTX through Alameda Research. Wang and Singh received time-served sentences with supervised release after testifying that Bankman-Fried directed the creation of an “ allow negative ” feature that granted Alameda nearly unlimited access to customer funds. Both avoided additional prison time entirely following their cooperation. FTX Bankruptcy Delivers Creditor Repayments Exceeding Original Claims FTX’s Chapter 11 reorganization plan resumed distributions in May 2025, delivering between 119% and 143% to eligible creditors who completed verification requirements through designated service providers BitGo or Kraken. Around 98% of affected users with claims under $50,000 received 119% of their declared funds under the bankruptcy court’s approved restructuring framework. Bankman-Fried remains incarcerated at a low‑security Federal Correctional Institution Terminal Island in Los Angeles , serving his 25-year sentence following conviction on seven fraud and conspiracy counts.

56054941,646969,1766174448,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56054941.jpeg,Prepare For Impact: Billionaire Shiba Inu Investor Moves Billions In SHIB To Exchanges,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investor-moves-billions/,"New reports have revealed that a billionaire Shiba Inu investor has transferred billions of SHIB tokens to a crypto exchange, setting the stage for possible market shifts. Typically, large exchange inflows of this size precede heightened market volatility as traders assess whether the move signals a distribution or a strategic repositioning. The outcome of this large-scale transfer could also influence Shiba Inu’s near-term price , which has been trending down for months. Billionaire Shiba Inu Whale Moves 469 Billion SHIB Blockchain analyst EmberCN was the first to report the large-scale movement on X this Thursday, highlighting that a top whale had transferred a significant amount of SHIB tokens to a centralized exchange. Fresh on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence shows that more than 48 hours ago, the anonymous whale had moved 469 billion SHIB, worth approximately $3.64 million, to OKX. The transfer was reportedly split into two transactions: one for 468.982 billion SHIB and the other for just 5 million tokens. Following this, Arkham Intelligence revealed that the whale had executed another substantial transfer of 464.308 billion SHIB and 550,066 SHIB to OKX the next day. At the time, the value of these coins was about $3.48 million and $4.12 million, respectively. In his post, EmberCN referenced a 2023 disclosure revisiting an initial 2020 transaction by the same whale, which resulted in massive unrealized gains at the top. The blockchain analyst revealed that the whale had initially acquired 1.03 trillion SHIB in 2020 using just 37.8 ETH valued at around $13,700 at the time. This purchase represented roughly 17.4% of the total SHIB supply, making it one of the most profitable Shiba Inu trades ever recorded. At the peak of the 2021 bull market, the whale’s 1.03 trillion SHIB was valued at roughly $9.1 billion. Despite the explosive price rally, the investor largely maintained the position and avoided selling most of the holdings in the years that followed. Even after the SHIB price crash earlier this year, there were no official reports of whales moving funds to take profits. Current data indicates that despite its most recent 469 billion SHIB transfer, the whale still controls up to 96.22 trillion SHIB, accounting for about 16.4% of the total supply . At present market prices, these holdings are valued at roughly $707.3 million, underscoring the sheer magnitude of this whale’s holdings. EmberCN notes that the anonymous whale’s address history is fully visible on Arkham Intelligence, offering detailed insights into past transactions. Is The Whale Selling Or Repositioning? Currently, it’s unclear whether the anonymous 469 billion- and 464.3 billion SHIB transfers were sold or simply repositioned . In most cases, transfers from a private wallet to exchanges are viewed as early signs of potential selling activity , especially when the volume is large. For transactions of this size, liquidating the tokens could influence Shiba Inu’s price dynamics. The meme coin is already trading at $0.0000073, down 13.04% over the past week. So far, the market has yet to show a clear reaction to the whale’s transfer. Nevertheless, a potential market sell-off could have drastic effects on SHIB’s already weak market .",Shiba Inu|Arkham Intelligence|EmberCN|meme coin|OKX|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-19 20:00:48

In such phases, broad sentiment often clouds judgment, making higher-timeframe signals especially valuable. XRP, a long-standing focal point of both technical analysts and long-term investors, is now exhibiting a familiar setup—one that has historically preceded powerful upside expansions after prolonged consolidation. As market participants debate whether the current lull represents weakness or preparation, respected analyst Dark Defender has highlighted a development that could redefine XRP’s near- to medium-term outlook. His analysis, shared on X, draws attention to a higher-timeframe technical signal that has repeatedly marked the end of corrective phases in XRP’s historical price cycles. The RSI on the 3-Day time frame tells us the dip is in, a sideways period can last a couple of days, but the Surge is inevitable. #XRP is unstoppable with the upcoming scarcity. Christmas & the New Year will Shine. Road to DD. pic.twitter.com/PEa0jGBiXh — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 19, 2025 Why the 3-Day RSI Matters Central to Dark Defender’s thesis is the behavior of the Relative Strength Index on the 3-day time frame. Unlike lower-timeframe RSI signals, which are often prone to noise, the 3-day RSI captures broader market psychology and trend exhaustion. According to the chart, XRP’s RSI has now completed a reset from compressed levels, a condition that previously aligned with major trend reversals rather than short-lived bounces. This signal does not suggest an immediate breakout. Instead, it implies that downside pressure has largely played out, opening the door for a period of sideways price action. Historically, XRP has tended to consolidate briefly after such RSI resets before transitioning into impulsive upward moves. Sideways Action as a Launchpad, Not a Weakness Periods of consolidation are often misinterpreted as a loss of momentum, but in structurally sound markets, they serve a different purpose. In XRP’s past cycles, similar sideways phases followed sharp corrections and allowed the price to stabilize above key support levels. The current structure mirrors this behavior, with XRP holding its broader trend framework intact rather than breaking into lower ranges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Dark Defender’s chart highlights how comparable consolidations in previous years ultimately resolved to the upside, once accumulation was complete and momentum indicators aligned. Structural Scarcity and Supply Dynamics Beyond pure technicals, XRP’s long-term supply mechanics continue to support a scarcity-driven narrative grounded in verifiable data. XRP has a fixed maximum supply, with no mining-based issuance. Additionally, transaction fees on the XRP Ledger are permanently burned, incrementally reducing the circulating supply as network usage grows. While escrowed XRP is released on a transparent schedule, these releases are largely anticipated by the market and do not introduce surprise inflation. Over time, this combination of fixed supply and gradual token burn reinforces scarcity, particularly during periods of rising demand. Seasonal Momentum and Market Timing Market timing also plays a subtle but important role. Historically, the final weeks of the year and the transition into the new year often coincide with renewed positioning across crypto markets. While seasonality alone is never a reliable predictor, it can amplify moves that are already supported by strong technical and structural foundations. In this context, Dark Defender’s outlook for strength around the Christmas and New Year period aligns with historical behavior rather than speculative optimism. The Path Toward Higher Valuations Taken together, the 3-day RSI reset, resilient price structure, and confirmed supply mechanics form a coherent bullish framework for XRP. While short-term volatility remains possible, the broader signals suggest that the current phase may represent preparation rather than exhaustion. If historical patterns repeat , XRP’s ongoing consolidation could mark the early stages of a renewed expansion, reinforcing the growing belief that the asset’s long-term trajectory remains firmly upward.

With volatility still part of the game, staking has become one of the most reliable ways to earn passive income while holding long-term positions. But not all platforms are created equal. Choosing the best place to stake crypto can mean the difference between steady daily rewards and disappointing returns. In this guide, we explore the 9 best crypto staking platforms for maximum yields in 2026, starting with a platform that has quickly positioned itself as a go-to option for both beginners and high-capital investors. 1. HashStaking – The Best Place to Stake Crypto in 2026 When it comes to combining high yields, flexibility, and simplicity, HashStaking stands out as one of the best crypto staking platforms available today. Designed for investors seeking high returns without complexity, HashStaking delivers consistent crypto staking rewards across a wide range of assets. Unlike many platforms that overcomplicate staking or hide fees behind confusing structures, HashStaking keeps things transparent. Users can stake popular assets, monitor daily rewards, and withdraw earnings with ease. This approach makes it perfect for investors looking for a dependable, long-term staking solution rather than short-term hype. Why HashStaking Stands Out One of the most significant advantages of HashStaking is its structured staking plans. Instead of vague APY promises, users choose clearly defined staking nodes with fixed durations, daily rewards, and predictable outcomes. This clarity is a major reason many investors consider HashStaking the best place to stake crypto heading into 2026. Another standout feature is its strong support for major networks. If your goal is to stake ETH , Solana, or other high-demand assets, HashStaking offers multiple options tailored to different budgets and risk levels. Besides, rewards are credited daily, allowing investors to compound earnings faster than platforms that pay weekly or monthly. Security also plays a central role. HashStaking uses advanced encryption, account protection measures, and operational safeguards designed to protect user funds while maintaining smooth performance. Example of HashStaking Plans To understand how the platform works, here are two staking options available on HashStaking: Solana Staking Node Staking Amount: $5,500 Daily Rewards: $75.90 Staking Duration: 7 days Total Rewards: $531.30 This plan is ideal for investors seeking short-term exposure with consistent daily returns on a high-performance network. Polkadot Staking Node Staking Amount: $50,000 Daily Rewards: $1,800 Staking Duration: 28 days Total Rewards: $50,400 Designed for larger portfolios, this plan demonstrates how longer staking periods can significantly boost total returns. How to Get Started with HashStaking Create an account using your email address, a username, a password, and an optional referral code. Deposit supported crypto assets Choose a staking plan that fits your budget and reward expectations Activate staking and begin earning daily rewards Withdraw or reinvest earnings at the end of your staking cycle This easy sign-up is one of the reasons HashStaking appeals to both newcomers and experienced investors. 2. Binance Staking Binance is one of the most recognized names in crypto. Its staking services are best suited for users who already trade on the exchange and want to earn rewards on idle assets. Binance supports a wide range of tokens and offers both flexible and locked staking options, making it a convenient choice — though yields are often lower than those on specialized platforms like HashStaking. 3. Coinbase Staking Coinbase is popular among beginners due to its clear interface and regulatory focus. Users can easily stake ETH and other supported assets directly from their accounts. While returns are generally lower, the platform appeals to investors who prioritize simplicity and compliance over high yields. 4. Kraken Staking Kraken offers a stable and transparent staking experience. Known for its strong security practices, it supports several proof-of-stake assets with predictable reward rates. Kraken is often chosen by conservative investors who value reliability over maximum returns. 5. Lido Finance Lido has become a leading option for Ethereum holders who want to stake without locking up liquidity. By issuing liquid staking tokens, Lido allows users to stake ETH while still using their assets across DeFi platforms. This flexibility makes it a popular choice for more advanced users. 6. OKX Earn OKX provides a mix of fixed and flexible staking products across multiple cryptocurrencies. The platform frequently offers promotional yields, making it appealing for users who actively monitor opportunities and rotate assets. 7. KuCoin Staking KuCoin supports staking for a wide range of altcoins, making it attractive to investors with diversified portfolios. While it may not always offer the highest yields, its accessibility and variety remain strong selling points. 8. Rocket Pool Rocket Pool is a decentralized solution focused on Ethereum staking. It allows users to stake ETH with lower minimum requirements than running a validator independently, appealing to decentralization-focused investors. 9. Crypto.com Crypto.com rounds out the list with staking options tied to its broader ecosystem. Rewards vary depending on lock-up periods and account tiers, making it suitable for users already engaged with the platform’s services. Conclusion While each platform on this list serves a different type of investor, HashStaking clearly leads for those seeking high daily rewards, structured plans, and an easy way to stake ETH and other major assets without unnecessary complexity. If you want to maximize returns while keeping control of your investment strategy, HashStaking should be your first consideration. Start staking now with a free $100 trial plan.
