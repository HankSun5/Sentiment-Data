56006672,646680,1766098844,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56006672.jpeg,Mixed Signals for XRP as Price Weakness Collides With Bold Analyst Targets,https://bitcoinist.com/mixed-signals-xrp-as-price-weakness-analyst-target/,"XRP is closing out 2025 caught between two opposing forces. On one side, price action has weakened, technical indicators are flashing caution, and liquidity has thinned as the holidays approach. On the other hand, analysts continue to publish ambitious upside targets, while fresh narratives around utility, adoption, and yield generation keep the token in focus. The result is a market struggling to reconcile near-term pressure with longer-term expectations. After spending much of the year underperforming other large-cap cryptocurrencies, XRP has slipped below the closely watched $2 level. That breakdown has sharpened debate over whether the market is entering a deeper correction or simply extending a prolonged consolidation phase. XRP Price Structure Shows Growing Strain Technical analysts point to mounting downside risks. XRP has formed what some describe as a higher-timeframe double-top near the $3.30–$3.40 region, with momentum indicators rolling over. The $1.85–$1.90 zone is now acting as a critical support area. A confirmed break below that range could expose XRP to a deeper pullback toward the $1.60–$1.65 region, aligning with key Fibonacci retracement levels. Additional on-chain metrics add to the cautious tone. XRP continues to trade well above its realized price, a condition that in previous cycles has preceded mean-reversion pullbacks. Meanwhile, moving averages and momentum indicators, such as the MACD, remain tilted to the downside, reinforcing the view that sellers retain control in the short term. Analysts Split Between Caution and Optimism Despite the weak chart structure, some analysts argue that the broader narrative has not changed materially. Vincent Van Code has noted that while XRP’s price performance disappointed in 2025, there has been no clear fundamental shock to explain the decline. Legal clarity around Ripple, ongoing institutional interest, and XRPL development remain intact, suggesting the disconnect may be driven more by market structure and liquidity than by fundamentals. Others are more explicit with upside targets. Analyst Dark Defender , who previously identified the $1.88 support zone, argues that XRP has completed a corrective phase under Elliott Wave analysis. From that perspective, targets around $5.85 remain possible in the next major advance, though timing depends heavily on broader market conditions. Utility Narratives and Speculation Add Noise Beyond price charts, new narratives are complicating sentiment. Reports highlighting XRP-based yield strategies, including mining-related platforms, have circulated widely; however, these claims vary in transparency and risk, and are not directly tied to XRP’s core protocol. Separately, unconfirmed rumors suggesting that EA Sports may explore XRP for in-game payments have briefly reignited discussion around mass adoption, even as no official confirmation has emerged. XRP currently sits at an uncomfortable crossroads. Technical pressure is real, downside risks remain, and patience is being tested. At the same time, bold analyst targets and recurring adoption stories ensure the token remains one of the most closely watched assets heading into early 2026.

He said the faster team will take Americans back to the lunar surface for the first time in more than fifty years. He made the point during a Bloomberg TV interview on his first day, right after meeting President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. He said both companies understood the rule clearly and that the one that finishes first will carry US astronauts under the Artemis program. Isaacman juggling SpaceX, Blue Origin and delays at NASA SpaceX and Blue Origin already have contracts with NASA to develop their lunar landers. SpaceX holds more than $4 billion in NASA deals to move astronauts to the moon using its Starship spacecraft. That plan, at least for now, puts SpaceX in the lead. But this advantage is not locked in, because NASA’s former acting administrator Sean Duffy announced in October that the agency would “open up” the SpaceX contract to competition. He said he grew frustrated by delays in Starship’s timeline. Starship has hit several technical issues over the past year.Those setbacks have drawn critics who say the slow pace could allow China to land its astronauts on the moon before the United States. Jared made it clear that whichever lander becomes available first will be the one NASA uses to push forward the Artemis mission. Jared also founded Shift4 Payments Inc., and he becomes NASA’s leader at a time when the agency faces funding questions tied to proposals from both Congress and the White House. He pushed back on concerns and said NASA can work with either a $20 billion or $25 billion yearly budget, and that both numbers are meaningful enough to carry out the agency’s plans. Trump signs executive order for Artemis 2028 project Jared said Trump approved a new executive order during their meeting. The order restates the core of the Artemis program and tells NASA to return astronauts to the moon by 2028 and build a lunar base by 2030. Jared told Bloomberg that the order “takes things to a whole other scale.” He said NASA is not returning to the moon only to leave footprints. He said the goal is long-term infrastructure that supports science, economic activity, and national security interests. The order does more than that.It directs the government to remove the National Space Council and move its authority to the Office of Science and Technology Policy.That council was set up in 1989 to advise presidents on space policy. The order also launches work on next-generation missile-defense systems under Trump’s Golden Dome plan, which calls for new tools to find and track threats from low-Earth orbit to cislunar space. Artemis relies on Boeing’s Space Launch System and Lockheed Martin’s Orion capsule. The program is expected to cost $93 billion by 2025 and so far has flown only one mission. NASA has delayed the first Artemis landing several times, most recently pushing the target year to 2027. In July, Congress approved almost $10 billion for Artemis as part of Trump’s major tax and spending package. The money supports the fourth and fifth SLS flights that the administration once considered cutting in favor of cheaper commercial options.

XRP has not been immune to these conditions, as heightened volatility and broader macroeconomic pressures have weighed on prices. Despite this environment, several market observers argue that sharp intraday swings point to structural issues rather than purely organic trading activity. While price declines have unsettled many participants, others interpret the turbulence as a tactical opportunity. Within the XRP community, certain commentators maintain that abrupt moves are being driven by large players seeking to exploit leverage and liquidity, and that patient accumulation during these periods could be advantageous. Indicators Fueling Manipulation Claims Concerns around market conduct were amplified by observations shared by The Kobeissi Letter, a platform that monitors global capital markets. You can’t make this up: Bitcoin just surged +$3,000 in 1 hour and reclaimed $90,000 as $120 million worth of levered shorts were liquidated. Minutes later, $200 million worth of levered longs were liquidated, with Bitcoin now down to $86,000. That’s a $140 BILLION swing in… pic.twitter.com/R1KLZq6iqs — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 17, 2025 The group highlighted an unusual episode involving Bitcoin, where the asset recorded a rapid increase of roughly $3,000 within a single hour on December 17. During that window, Bitcoin moved from the high-$80,000 range to briefly trade above $90,000. This sudden advance triggered significant liquidations among traders positioned for downside movement, with losses estimated at over $120 million. Shortly after these positions were cleared, Bitcoin reversed direction and retreated sharply toward the mid-$80,000 range. According to The Kobeissi Letter, the entire sequence resulted in a dramatic swing in Bitcoin’s market capitalization, estimated at approximately $140 billion within two hours. Observers noted that such an abrupt expansion and contraction in valuation raised questions about whether the move was engineered to force liquidations, rather than reflecting a shift in long-term market sentiment. The scale of the fluctuation drew particular attention, as it exceeded the entire market capitalization of several major altcoins. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Impact on XRP Price Action The turbulence in Bitcoin markets quickly spread to other digital assets, including XRP. Although XRP’s market capitalization is significantly smaller, it still experienced notable volatility during the same timeframe. XRP rose from around $1.90 to nearly $2.00 within two hours before reversing course and falling below $1.90 shortly thereafter. This sequence translated into billions of dollars added to XRP’s valuation in a brief period, followed by an even larger contraction. Such rapid changes reinforced claims that liquidity-driven strategies employed by large trading entities may be influencing price behavior across multiple assets, not just Bitcoin. Some market participants referenced previous downturns as evidence of similar dynamics, arguing that sharp corrections have often coincided with periods of elevated leverage and thin order books. These episodes, they contend, tend to disadvantage retail traders while benefiting institutions capable of moving substantial capital. Community Response and Accumulation Strategy Against this backdrop, prominent XRP commentator Digital Asset Investor expressed a willingness to continue increasing his holdings during price weakness. He suggested that repeated volatility episodes reflect strategic actions by institutional players and indicated that he intends to take advantage of lower prices rather than reduce exposure. This perspective aligns with comments from other analysts who have previously encouraged accumulation during downturns. In recent months, several market watchers have stated that retracements below key psychological levels could offer renewed entry points for long-term investors who missed earlier opportunities. As of the latest data, XRP trades near the lower end of recent ranges, a development that some interpret as validating these earlier expectations. Nevertheless, analysts continue to emphasize that such views represent personal opinions rather than guarantees of future performance. While allegations of market manipulation remain unproven, the recent sequence of rapid price movements has intensified debate around trading practices in the crypto market. For certain XRP proponents, these conditions reinforce a long-term accumulation approach, even as uncertainty persists across the broader financial landscape.

Meta wants both models in the first half of 2026, according to Alexandr Wang, the company’s chief AI officer, during an internal Q&A with Chris Cox. Alexandr also said Meta is starting work on early world models, which means AI systems that learn by taking in visual data from their environment. Meta changed its whole AI structure in the summer.The company hired Alexandr to run a division called Meta Superintelligence Labs. Zuck then went on a hiring spree and grabbed more than twenty researchers from OpenAI. He built a group of over fifty people with deep AI skills. Meta is trying to load up on specialists because image generation is now one of the main battlegrounds between big model companies. Google and OpenAI models are going to be tough to compete with Meta released a video generator called Vibes in September. The tool was made with Midjourney. A few days later, OpenAI rolled out its own product, Sora, to keep up. The back-and-forth showed how fast each company reacts. Google had already kicked off another wave earlier in the year with Nano Banana, which boosted monthly users of Gemini from 450 million in July to more than 650 million by late October. That jump placed even more pressure on the other players. The tension rose again in November when Google launched the third version of Gemini.Right after that, people inside OpenAI said Sam Altman declared a “code red” to push the company to win back top scores on model tests.OpenAI then released a new version of ChatGPT Images. Sam later met journalists and said image creation is now one of the biggest reasons users return to AI apps, calling it a “sticky” feature. The message was clear: the image fight is not slowing down. Google announced Gemini 3 Flash on Wednesday. The model is built to run faster and at lower cost, and it is meant for wide use. It carries many of the reasoning skills found in Gemini 3 Pro but in a smaller system. The whole plan is simple. Instead of keeping the best tools locked behind enterprise plans, Google wants these models inside mass-market apps. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said, “With this release, Gemini 3’s next-generation intelligence is now rolling out to everyone across our products including Gemini app + AI Mode in Search. Devs can build with it in the Gemini API, Google AI Studio, Gemini CLI, and Google Antigravity and enterprises can get it in Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Tech|Meta,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-18 23:54:43

The news that Synthetix returns to Ethereum mainnet marks a pivotal moment, suggesting that the foundational blockchain has overcome its past struggles and is ready to reclaim its throne for high-performance financial applications. Let’s explore what this homecoming means for traders, the DeFi ecosystem, and the future of on-chain derivatives. Why is Synthetix Returning to Ethereum Now? For years, the narrative around Ethereum centered on high gas fees and network congestion, pushing many DeFi projects to seek alternatives. Synthetix, a leader in derivatives trading, was no exception. However, the landscape has transformed. According to the project’s founder, the extreme congestion that once plagued Ethereum has been “significantly resolved.” This isn’t just about lower fees; it’s about proven capacity. The founder emphasized that Ethereum now possesses the robust infrastructure needed to support the complex, high-volume world of synthetic assets reliably. What Does This Mean for DeFi and Derivatives Trading? The decision for Synthetix returns to Ethereum mainnet is a powerful vote of confidence. It tells us that after a period of exploration across various Layer 2 and alternative networks, core financial innovation is recentering on Ethereum’s unparalleled security and liquidity. For users, this consolidation offers significant benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: Unifying activity on the mainnet pools liquidity, potentially leading to better prices and tighter spreads for synthetic asset traders. Simplified User Experience: No more bridging assets between chains. Users can interact with Synthetix directly within the vast Ethereum ecosystem. Stronger Security: Ethereum mainnet remains the most secure and battle-tested environment for managing valuable financial contracts. This move could trigger a domino effect, encouraging other DeFi derivatives platforms to reaffirm their commitment to the Ethereum base layer. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the return is a cause for optimism, it doesn’t mean the journey is without its watchpoints. The success of this move hinges on Ethereum’s ability to maintain its improved performance as adoption grows. Furthermore, Synthetix must successfully reintegrate its sophisticated system, ensuring a seamless experience for stakers (SNX holders) and traders alike. However, the opportunities are immense. A high-performance Synthetix on Ethereum mainnet could act as a catalyst, attracting more institutional interest in on-chain derivatives. It solidifies Ethereum’s position not just as a settlement layer, but as a live, functioning global financial marketplace. Conclusion: A New Chapter for On-Chain Finance The announcement that Synthetix returns to Ethereum mainnet is more than a technical migration; it’s a symbolic homecoming. It underscores Ethereum’s remarkable evolution and resilience. For the DeFi community, it represents a maturation—a move towards consolidating innovation on the most secure and liquid foundation available. This strategic pivot by a leading protocol could very well mark the beginning of a new, more unified and powerful era for decentralized derivatives trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is Synthetix? A: Synthetix is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to mint and trade synthetic assets (synths). These synths track the value of real-world assets like currencies, commodities, and cryptocurrencies, all on the blockchain. Q: Why did Synthetix leave Ethereum in the first place? A: Primarily due to high transaction fees (gas costs) and network congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, which made frequent trading and interactions prohibitively expensive for users. Q: What has changed on Ethereum to allow this return? A: Key upgrades, particularly “The Merge” to Proof-of-Stake and the implementation of proto-danksharding (EIP-4844), have significantly improved network capacity and reduced base transaction costs, resolving much of the prior congestion. Q: Will my SNX tokens or synths be affected? A: The protocol will manage the migration. Users should follow official Synthetix announcements for specific instructions, but typically, such returns are designed to be smooth for token holders. Q: Is this good for the price of SNX? A> While price predictions are uncertain, the return to Ethereum mainnet is fundamentally positive. It could increase protocol usage, attract more liquidity, and strengthen SNX’s value proposition within the core DeFi ecosystem. Q: Does this mean Synthetix is abandoning other chains like Optimism? A> Not necessarily. Many protocols operate a multi-chain strategy. The return to mainnet likely means Ethereum will host the primary, canonical version, while Layer 2 solutions may still be used for specific scaling or experimental features.

Since early October, declining investor sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty have weighed heavily on cryptocurrencies, with the total market capitalization falling by more than $1.3 trillion during this period. XRP has followed this trend, giving up tens of billions of dollars in market value as selling pressure intensified. After managing to stay above the psychologically important $2 level for much of the decline, XRP eventually slipped below that support in mid-December. The loss of this level accelerated downside movement and reinforced bearish sentiment. Despite this, some market analysts argue that the current structure does not necessarily signal long-term weakness. Instead, they believe XRP may be entering a phase that has historically preceded strong recoveries. Every cycle, when $XRP breaks below the 50-week SMA and stays there for roughly 50–84 days, a strong rally has followed. History: – 2017: 70 days below → +211% – 2021: 49 days below → +70% – 2024: 84 days below → +850% – Now: 70 days below the 50-week SMA Right now, XRP… pic.twitter.com/Ii5ewdZjQu — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 17, 2025 XRP’s Position Relative to the 50-Week Moving Average According to market analyst Steph, XRP’s recent behavior around the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) deserves close attention. This indicator is widely used to assess long-term market trends. XRP has now spent several consecutive weeks trading below this level, a condition that typically reflects sustained selling pressure. However, historical chart data suggests that extended periods beneath the 50-week SMA have often been followed by sharp upward moves. Steph’s analysis indicates that XRP has previously remained below this moving average for periods ranging from roughly 50 to 84 days before staging notable recoveries. These past instances form the basis of current speculation that XRP may again be approaching a turning point. Historical Precedents Since 2018 Weekly price data shows that this setup has appeared multiple times over the past several years. Following XRP’s major decline from its early 2018 peak, the asset spent several weeks trading below the 50-week SMA during the middle of that year. After establishing a low during that period, XRP later recorded a substantial rebound within a few months. A comparable pattern emerged again toward the end of 2021. XRP dropped below the same long-term average and remained there for several weeks before recovering in early 2022. While the resulting price increase was more modest than in 2018, it still represented a meaningful recovery from the local low. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 More recently, a similar structure was developed in 2024. XRP fell below the 50-week SMA and stayed under it for nearly three months. When prices eventually recovered, the rally that followed was significantly stronger than previous instances, pushing XRP to new cycle highs. This episode has become a key reference point for analysts assessing the current market phase. Assessing the Current Setup As of now, XRP has been trading below the 50-week SMA for approximately 10 consecutive weekly candles, equating to just over two months. If the duration aligns with prior cases, analysts suggest the asset could remain under pressure for several more weeks before a clearer trend reversal emerges. Some projections estimate that matching the longest historical duration would extend this phase toward the end of the year. Based on prior percentage gains, speculative price targets vary widely. Analysts emphasize that these figures are theoretical and depend heavily on market conditions, liquidity, and broader investor sentiment. Even so, the repetition of similar technical structures continues to attract attention from long-term traders. Additional technical indicators have also entered the discussion. Analyst Chart Nerd has noted that momentum tools such as the Relative Strength Index and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence suggest selling pressure may be easing. These signals are often associated with stabilization phases, though they do not guarantee immediate price appreciation. While XRP remains under technical strain, historical data show that comparable periods of weakness have previously preceded strong recoveries. Analysts caution that past performance does not ensure future results, but the recurring interaction with the 50-week SMA remains a focal point for market participants monitoring XRP’s next major move.

56008517,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=867974,1766102415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56008517.jpeg,Legendary Bitcoin OG Deepens Ethereum Bet Despite Losses Exceeding $70 Million,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/legendary-bitcoin-og-deepens-ethereum-bet-despite-losses-exceeding-70-million/,"Ethereum is facing renewed selling pressure as the broader market struggles with fear, uncertainty, and growing bearish expectations. After weeks of weakness, many analysts are now openly calling for a prolonged bear market stretching into 2026, arguing that Ethereum remains below key structural levels and lacks strong momentum. Related Reading: From Cycles To Continuity: Why Bitcoin’s 4-Year Pattern May Be Breaking Bulls are attempting to defend the $2,800 mark, a level that has become critical for maintaining short-term confidence, but price action continues to reflect hesitation rather than conviction. Volatility remains elevated, and market sentiment is dominated by caution rather than optimism. Against this fragile backdrop, on-chain data reveals a notable divergence between price action and behavior from experienced market participants. According to data from Hyperdash, the Bitcoin OG, known for shorting the market during the October 10 crash, has once again increased his exposure to Ethereum. This trader, widely followed for his high-conviction and well-timed positioning, just added another 12,406 ETH to his long positions, signaling confidence at current price levels despite the prevailing bearish narrative. While retail sentiment weakens and analysts debate deeper downside scenarios, strategic accumulation by seasoned players suggests that Ethereum may be approaching a decisive phase. Whether this marks early positioning ahead of a recovery or a high-risk bet in a deteriorating market remains the key question ahead. A High-Conviction Bet Under Pressure Lookonchain reports that the Bitcoin OG continues to hold substantial, high-conviction positions across multiple assets, despite the ongoing market weakness. According to the latest data, his current exposure includes 203,341 ETH valued at approximately $577.5 million, 1,000 BTC worth around $87 million, and 250,000 SOL valued near $30.7 million. This level of concentration highlights a willingness to endure significant volatility rather than reduce risk in an increasingly uncertain environment. That conviction, however, has come with meaningful drawdowns. The wallet is now down more than $70 million from its peak. At one point, unrealized profits exceeded $120 million, but recent price declines have reduced that figure to less than $30 million. The swing illustrates how quickly market conditions can shift, even for traders with a strong track record and well-timed entries in the past. From a broader market perspective, this positioning reflects a sharp contrast between sentiment and behavior. While many participants have turned defensive and analysts debate the likelihood of a prolonged bear market, this wallet remains heavily exposed, suggesting a belief that current levels may still offer asymmetric upside. At the same time, the drawdown serves as a clear reminder that size and conviction do not remove risk in a structurally fragile market.

Price is currently trading below the 50-week moving average and hovering near the 100-week MA, a level that historically acts as an important inflection point for medium-term trend direction. The failure to hold above the short-term averages confirms that sellers have regained control of the structure. From a trend perspective, ETH remains above the rising 200-week moving average, which continues to define the long-term bullish framework. However, the widening gap between the faster and slower averages has started to compress, signaling a transition phase rather than trend continuation. Volume has expanded on down weeks, reinforcing the idea that recent downside moves are driven by active distribution rather than passive consolidation. Related Reading: XRP Liquidity Dries Up: Futures Buy Volume On Binance Falls from $5.8B to $250M The $2,800 area now represents a critical demand zone. A sustained hold above this level would suggest that the correction is a controlled pullback within a broader range. Conversely, a weekly close below it would expose ETH to a deeper retracement toward the $2,400–$2,500 region, where the 200-week MA and prior consolidation converge. Overall, the chart reflects a market caught between long-term structural support and short-term bearish momentum. Ethereum needs a decisive reclaim of the 50-week moving average to neutralize downside risk and restore confidence in trend continuation.

56008518,646635,1766102417,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56008518.jpeg,Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Make Coinbase’s List In Latest Product Launch,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shib-in-coinbase-list/,"Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have secured a place in Coinbase’s latest product expansion, a notable moment for meme coins within the regulated crypto derivatives market. Coinbase confirmed the launch of US perpetual-style futures trading in an announcement on X for a range of altcoins on Coinbase Derivatives, available around the clock. Coinbase Expands Derivatives Access With Meme Coins Included According to a recent announcement on X , US Perpetual-Style Futures are now live on Coinbase Derivatives. Among a lineup dominated by established layer-one networks and infrastructure tokens, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu stood out as the only meme-based assets included, showing how these tokens are being positioned within institutional-grade trading environments. The new product rollout allows both retail and institutional traders to access US-regulated perpetual-style futures through approved Futures Commission Merchants. Coinbase is effectively placing both meme coins alongside assets such as Cardano, Chainlink, and Polkadot in its derivatives ecosystem with its extension of this offering to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. In the case of Shiba Inu, the newly listed futures contract comes with a 1,000x multiplier. This means that demand for structured exposure to these leading meme coins has grown beyond spot trading, with traders increasingly seeking hedging and leverage tools tied to them. What This Means For DOGE And SHIB Moving Forward Recent price action for both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has offered little encouragement. Both cryptocurrencies are currently locked in an extended declining price action and low whale activity, except for a spike in whale activity witnessed by Shiba Inu earlier in the month. This occurred in tandem with a +1.06 trillion net change to the amount of SHIB on exchanges, which is also another sign of the intense selling pressure surrounding the meme coin. However, behind the scenes, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu might be working towards a bullish momentum in their fundamentals. For one, the availability of perpetual-style futures for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu could add to how traders interact with these assets. Futures markets often attract higher trading volumes and more sophisticated participants, which can influence price discovery and volatility patterns. As the largest crypto exchange in the United States, Coinbase provides the best regulated gateway for institutional traders. Therefore, this development may increase institutional visibility for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in the US market while also providing traders with new ways to manage risk. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.000007523, down by 3% in the past 24 hours. Notably, the meme coin is currently trading at its lowest price point in over a year. Dogecoin is also trading at its lowest price point in over a year. The king of meme coins is currently trading at $0.1256, down by 3.2% in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|altcoins|Cardano|chainlink|coinbase|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Futures Commission Merchants|meme coins|Polkadot|shib|Shiba Inu,EN,0,0,DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-19 00:00:17

Whale Alert, the blockchain tracking service, reported that a colossal 80,000 ETH was transferred from an unknown wallet directly to a Beacon Depositor. Valued at approximately $226 million, this single move has sent ripples through the crypto community, prompting urgent questions about its origin and intent. What Does This Massive 80,000 ETH Transfer Mean? When 80,000 ETH is transferred in one go, it’s not a routine transaction. It’s a statement. The destination—a Beacon Depositor—is a critical clue. This address is specifically designed to receive Ether for staking on the Ethereum 2.0 network. Therefore, this transfer strongly suggests a major player, or ‘whale,’ is committing a vast fortune to secure the network and earn staking rewards. This action demonstrates profound confidence in Ethereum’s long-term proof-of-stake model. Who Could Be Behind the $226 Million Whale Move? The sender’s identity remains a mystery, hidden behind an ‘unknown wallet.’ However, we can analyze the possibilities. The sheer scale points to a deep-pocketed entity. Potential actors include: A Crypto Investment Fund: Institutional capital moving into staking for yield. A Large Exchange: Consolidating user funds for institutional staking services. An Ultra-Wealthy Individual: A private whale making a strategic, long-term bet on Ethereum. The anonymity fuels speculation, but the destination reveals a clear strategic direction: staking. Why Is Staking 80,000 ETH a Big Deal for the Network? Committing 80,000 ETH transferred to staking is a powerful vote of confidence. It provides several key benefits to the Ethereum ecosystem: Enhanced Security: This large stake makes the network more expensive and difficult to attack. Increased Decentralization: While large, it adds another significant validator to the pool. Price Stability Signal: Staked ETH is locked up, reducing immediate sell pressure and signaling long-term holder belief. This move goes beyond personal gain; it actively strengthens the infrastructure of the entire network. What Are the Risks and Rewards for the Whale? Staking such a monumental sum is not without its challenges. The whale now faces a classic risk-reward scenario. On the reward side, they will earn consistent staking yields, currently estimated between 3-5% annually on their 80,000 ETH . However, the primary risk is illiquidity. Staked ETH is locked until a future network upgrade enables withdrawals. This means the $226 million is committed for the foreseeable future, exposing the holder to market volatility without the option for a quick exit. How Should Retail Investors Interpret This Signal? For everyday crypto enthusiasts, this 80,000 ETH transferred event is a masterclass in market signaling. You don’t lock up a quarter-billion dollars in an asset you believe is failing. This whale’s action suggests a bullish long-term outlook on Ethereum’s value and the sustainability of its staking economy. However, it’s crucial to remember this is one data point. Smart investors should see it as a strong, positive indicator to be weighed alongside broader market trends, not as a sole trigger for investment decisions. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Ethereum Staking The transfer of 80,000 ETH to a Beacon Depositor is more than just a large number on a screen. It is a definitive, capital-intensive endorsement of Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake. This whale has placed a $226 million bet on the network’s future security and success. While the identity remains secret, the message is transparent: institutional-grade confidence in Ethereum is not just growing; it’s being actively staked. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Beacon Depositor in Ethereum? A: A Beacon Depositor is a smart contract address on the Ethereum network specifically designed to receive and process Ether that users want to ‘stake’ or lock up to help secure the newer, proof-of-stake Ethereum blockchain (often called Ethereum 2.0). Q2: Why would someone transfer 80,000 ETH to stake it? A: The primary motivations are to earn passive staking rewards (like interest) and to support the security and operation of the Ethereum network. For a holder of such a large amount, the annual rewards can be substantial. Q3: Can the whale access this 80,000 ETH now? A> No. Once ETH is staked via a Beacon Depositor, it is locked and cannot be withdrawn or traded until a future Ethereum upgrade enables staking withdrawals. This is a long-term commitment. Q4: Does this large transfer affect the price of ETH? A: It can have an indirect effect. By locking up a large supply (80,000 ETH), it reduces the amount of ETH readily available for sale on exchanges, which can help reduce selling pressure. It also signals strong holder confidence, which can influence market sentiment. Q5: What is Whale Alert? A: Whale Alert is a popular blockchain tracking and analytics service that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions (typically over $1 million) and reports them publicly via social media, providing transparency into major market movements. Q6: Is staking ETH safe? A: Staking on the official Ethereum network is generally considered safe from a protocol perspective. However, it involves locking funds for an indeterminate period and carries smart contract risk (though the deposit contract is heavily audited) and the market risk of ETH price fluctuation during the lock-up period.

White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks posted to X, noting that Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and Agriculture Committee Chair John Boozman had confirmed that the bipartisan crypto bill will reach the Senate next month. ”We are closer than ever to passing the landmark crypto market structure legislation that President Trump has called for. We look forward to finishing the job in January!” Sacks says negotiators are hoping the House-approved CLARITY Act will be sent to the Senate for debate and amendment in January, the official start date of the legislative process, ahead of a potential floor vote. The announcement arrives as lawmakers and industry leaders scramble to develop a common regulatory framework for digital asset markets. Sacks’ revelation comes as the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) says it is granting banks the ability to conduct riskless principal transactions related to crypto assets. TradFi banks that had been dipping their toes in via pilots now have the approval to go for full-scale crypto integration. The OCC has, over time, reversed the cautionary approach it took between 2021 and 2024, when it imposed strict guardrails and joined the Fed in warning about crypto risks, such as liquidity and volatility. According to the letter from the OCC, traditional banks are explicitly permitted to engage in riskless principal crypto-asset transactions, where the banks act as matched intermediaries in trades without the need to hold assets. As it stands, only a few purely crypto banks , such as Anchorage Digital, hold OCC charters. With approval, more hybrids could emerge soon. CFTC set to take lead as CLARITY Act redraws U.S. crypto rulebook The CLARITY Act, now enacted by the House in July 2025 (H.R. 3633), will grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) a key regulatory role across most digital assets. It also aims to establish clearer meanings for “digital commodities” and reduce the regulatory perimeter that has kept the industry in legal limbo for years. Supporters of the bill argue that it will reduce regulatory uncertainty for crypto firms by establishing clearer compliance pathways, encourage innovation, and strengthen investor protections. “The CLARITY Act might offer the clear rules of the road that the industry in America needs to innovate,” Sacks said, underscoring the Biden and Trump administrations’ mutual focus on strengthening American competitiveness in the emerging markets. While the House delivered the CLARITY Act on a bipartisan basis over the past year, the Senate has constructed its own drafts of legislation. The Senate Agriculture and Senate Banking Committees have circulated drafts of discussions similar to those in the House legislation, but on topics such as decentralized finance and anti-money laundering standards. U.S. regulators continued to work on the CLARITY Act during the record 43-day government shutdown in October and November, meeting with executives from companies such as Coinbase, Ripple, Kraken, Circle, and tech-focused venture capital firms a16z and Paradigm . Industry cheers clearer crypto rules Cryptocurrency companies and investors have generally welcomed signs that Congress is leaning toward clearer regulatory guardrails. Industry advocates have also stated that a firm market structure framework could help mitigate some of the legal uncertainty that has prompted innovation abroad, as well as deter institutions from engaging in such activities. Yet a handful of consumers and investor watchdog groups have argued that a faster stream towards regulation should also guarantee firm protection from fraud and market manipulation, especially in the area of decentralized finance (DeFi), where regulatory limits are often unclear.

This significant event, sourced from leading exchange Deribit, has the potential to influence short-term price volatility and trader sentiment across the entire crypto landscape. Understanding the mechanics and implications of this expiration is crucial for any informed market participant. What Does Today’s Massive Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean? At 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 19th, a critical deadline arrives for thousands of derivative contracts. Options give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a predetermined price. When these contracts expire, it forces a final settlement, often leading to increased trading activity as market makers hedge their positions. The sheer scale of today’s Bitcoin options expiry makes it a focal point for analysts. Simultaneously, Ethereum options valued at $460 million will also expire, adding another layer of complexity to the market’s movements. However, the spotlight remains firmly on Bitcoin due to the staggering notional value involved. Decoding the Key Metrics: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain To gauge market sentiment, experts look at two vital metrics from the expiring batch. First is the put/call ratio. For today’s Bitcoin options , this ratio is 0.77. A ratio below 1 indicates more call options (bets on price increases) than put options (bets on decreases), suggesting a generally bullish sentiment among options traders. In contrast, the Ethereum batch has a put/call ratio of 1.06, showing a slightly more cautious or bearish tilt for ETH. The second critical metric is the “max pain” price. This is the strike price at which the maximum number of options would expire worthless, causing the most financial loss to options buyers. For Bitcoin, the max pain is $88,000, and for Ethereum, it’s $3,100. Market forces often, but not always, gravitate toward this price at expiry as sellers try to minimize their payouts. How Could This Expiry Impact Bitcoin’s Price Action? While options expiry does not directly dictate long-term price trends, it can create short-term volatility and liquidity events. Here’s what traders are watching for: Increased Volatility: The hours leading up to and following the expiry can see heightened price swings as large positions are closed or rolled over. Pin Risk: The price may experience “pinning” near the max pain price ($88,000 for BTC) as the expiry deadline approaches. Gamma Exposure: Market makers who sold these options will adjust their Bitcoin hedge positions, which can amplify price moves in either direction. Therefore, retail traders should be prepared for potential choppiness. However, it’s essential to remember that this is a scheduled event, and its effects are typically absorbed by the market within a day or two. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Navigating an options expiry requires a calm and strategic approach. Instead of reacting to every tick, consider these insights: Don’t Chase the Noise: Short-term volatility is not a reliable indicator of long-term direction. Avoid making impulsive trades based solely on expiry-related moves. Watch Key Levels: Monitor the max pain prices ($88,000 for BTC, $3,100 for ETH) as potential short-term support or resistance zones. Review Your Strategy: Use this event as a reminder to check your own portfolio’s risk exposure and ensure your stop-losses are in place. In conclusion, the expiry of $2.65 billion in Bitcoin options is a significant market event that highlights the growing sophistication and scale of the crypto derivatives space. While it may stir short-term turbulence, the underlying market fundamentals remain the primary driver for Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Informed traders who understand these mechanics can better position themselves to navigate the waves rather than be swept away by them. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are Bitcoin options? A: Bitcoin options are financial derivatives that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a specific price on or before a certain date. They are used for hedging risk or speculating on price movements. Q: What does a put/call ratio of 0.77 mean? A: A put/call ratio of 0.77 means there are 77 put options for every 100 call options set to expire. This indicates that, among this batch of options, more traders were betting on a price increase (calls) than a decrease (puts), suggesting bullish sentiment. Q: What is the “max pain” price? A: The max pain price is the strike price at which the total financial loss for all options buyers (of both calls and puts) is maximized at expiration. It’s a theoretical level where the most options expire worthless. Q: Do options expiries always cause a big price move? A> Not always. While they can increase volatility due to hedging activity, the effect is often short-lived. The market usually anticipates these scheduled events, and major price movements depend on broader market conditions. Q: Where does the $2.65B data come from? A: The data is reported by Deribit, which is the world’s largest cryptocurrency options exchange by volume and open interest. Their metrics are widely watched as a benchmark for the market. Q: Should I change my long-term investment strategy because of this expiry? A> Generally, no. Options expiries are short-term technical events. Long-term investment decisions should be based on fundamental analysis, project development, and macroeconomic factors, not single derivative expiry dates.

The latest reading from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index confirms it. Sitting at a mere 16, this crucial sentiment gauge has plunged deeper into ‘extreme fear’ territory. For investors, this number is more than just a statistic—it’s a powerful signal flashing in the emotional storm of the market. Let’s decode what this extreme reading truly means and, more importantly, how you can respond. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Now? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index just dropped to 16, a one-point fall from the previous day. This firmly places market psychology in the ‘extreme fear’ zone. Think of this index as the market’s emotional heartbeat. It ranges from 0 (maximum fear) to 100 (maximum greed). A score of 16 is a stark indicator that negative sentiment is overwhelming traders and investors. This pervasive fear often creates opportunities, but it also signals high risk. Understanding the mechanics behind this number is your first step to smarter decisions. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This index isn’t a guess; it’s a data-driven composite. Alternative.me compiles it using six key market factors. Each factor gives us a piece of the overall sentiment puzzle. Here is the breakdown: Volatility (25%): Sharp price swings, especially downward, increase fear. Market Volume (25%): High sell-off volume signals panic. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of discussions on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct polls of market participant sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A flight to Bitcoin often indicates a ‘safe-haven’ fear trade. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’ spikes during fear. Therefore, the current score of 16 reflects a perfect storm where most of these metrics are flashing red. Should You Buy When There’s Extreme Fear in Crypto? The famous Warren Buffett quote, ‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,’ is often cited in crypto circles. A low Crypto Fear & Greed Index can signal a potential buying opportunity for long-term believers. Historically, periods of extreme fear have preceded significant market rebounds. However, this is not a guaranteed ‘buy’ signal. It simply means assets may be oversold from an emotional standpoint. You must pair this data with your own research, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Never invest based on sentiment alone. Actionable Insights for Navigating Market Fear Seeing a 16 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be unsettling. Here is how to channel that information into a strategy: Review, Don’t React: Use this time to review your portfolio’s fundamentals, not to make panic sells. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): If you believe in the long-term thesis, consider spreading buys over time to average your entry price. Secure Your Holdings: Ensure your assets are in secure wallets. Fear-driven times can see increased phishing and scam activity. Set Alerts: Watch for a sustained rise in the index as an early sign of sentiment improvement. Remember, the index measures crowd emotion. Your goal is to understand the crowd, not necessarily follow it. The Bottom Line on Today’s Crypto Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 16 is a clear snapshot of a market gripped by anxiety. While it highlights short-term pain and volatility, it also provides a valuable contrarian data point for disciplined investors. The key takeaway is to use this tool as a gauge of market psychology, not as a crystal ball. By separating emotion from analysis, you can make clearer decisions whether you choose to wait, accumulate, or simply hold steady. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 16 mean? A: A score of 16 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’ in the market. It suggests that negative sentiment and panic selling are currently dominant among investors. Q: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is compiled and published by the data provider Alternative.me. It has become a widely referenced benchmark for crypto market sentiment. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time look at shifting market emotions. Q: Is it safe to buy cryptocurrency when the index shows extreme fear? A> It can present opportunities, as prices may be oversold. However, ‘extreme fear’ can also precede further declines. It should be one factor in a broader, research-based investment strategy, not a standalone signal. Q: Has the index been this low before? A: Yes. The index has hit single digits during major crypto winters, such as the end of 2018 and mid-2022. These periods were followed by eventual recoveries, though timing is unpredictable. Q: Does the index predict Bitcoin price? A> No, it does not predict price. It measures current sentiment, which is a driver of price volatility. It is a complementary tool for understanding market psychology. Share Your Thoughts Does the ‘extreme fear’ reading change your outlook on the market? Share this article with your network on Twitter or LinkedIn to discuss whether this is a moment of danger or opportunity.

The issue centers on a proposed “de minimis” tax exemption, a rule meant to spare small crypto payments from capital gains taxes. Under current IRS guidance, digital assets are treated as property. That means every purchase made with crypto, even a cup of coffee, counts as a taxable event that requires tracking cost basis and reporting gains or losses. Supporters of the exemption say this framework makes daily use impractical and discourages crypto from functioning as money. Bitcoin Groups Warn of Flawed Crypto Tax Exemption The debate intensified this week after representatives of the Bitcoin Policy Institute, a nonprofit advocacy group, said lawmakers are considering limiting the exemption to stablecoins only. Conner Brown, the group’s head of strategy, said on X that limiting a de minimis exemption to stablecoins would be a “severe mistake,” arguing that it would exclude ordinary Bitcoin payments from relief while favoring assets that rarely generate capital gains in the first place. I’m hearing very concerning news out of Capitol Hill today. De Minimis tax legislation may be limited to only stablecoins, leaving everyday Bitcoin transactions without an exemption. This would be a severe mistake. BPI will be publishing a response. Stay tuned. — Conner Brown (@BitcoinConner) December 17, 2025 The idea behind the exemption is straightforward, allowing small personal crypto transactions to be excluded from capital gains reporting, similar to how foreign currency transactions are treated. Most proposals have suggested a per-transaction threshold of around $300, paired with an annual cap of roughly $5,000 in total tax-free gains. The concern raised by Bitcoin advocates is that recent drafts or negotiations may narrow the scope of the exemption to stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a steady price , usually pegged to the U.S. dollar, which means most transactions do not produce capital gains. Critics argue that granting them a de minimis exemption offers little practical relief while leaving Bitcoin users facing the same reporting burden. Why would you even need a de minimis tax exemption for stablecoins? They don't change in value. This is nonsensical. The wealth effect that would be unleashed via a de minimis tax exemption for bitcoin would be material. It should be the sole focus. Stablecoins shouldn't even… https://t.co/FS5JW8vhTB — Marty Bent (@MartyBent) December 18, 2025 Some commentators have questioned the logic of prioritizing stablecoins. Marty Bent, founder of media outlet Truth for the Commoner, wrote on X that stablecoins “don’t change in value,” making a small-gain exemption unnecessary. Can Bitcoin Be Used Like Cash? Lummis Thinks Taxes Are the Problem Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming has been one of the most vocal supporters of the idea. In July, she introduced legislation proposing a $300 exemption for crypto transactions, along with a $5,000 annual limit. Her proposal also included exemptions for digital assets donated to charities and tax deferral for crypto earned through mining or staking. Lummis has long argued that the exemption would make Bitcoin practical for everyday use, instead of something people are forced to treat only as a long-term holding. That argument resurfaced in October when Block founder Jack Dorsey pressed lawmakers to lift tax rules that make daily Bitcoin payments difficult. Lummis replied publicly, saying she was working on the issue and urging supporters to speak up. @SenLummis has responded to @jack 's call for a Bitcoin tax exemption for small transactions, stating she is ""Working on it."" #CryptoTax #Bitcoin https://t.co/6S4GtW7Vpf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 9, 2025 The exchange put fresh focus on a problem the crypto industry has raised for years. Bitcoin was introduced as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Over time, however, transaction fees, slow settlement, and tax obligations have pushed most users toward holding rather than spending it. As discussions continue, Congress appears closer than it has been in years to revisiting crypto tax rules. In December, Representative Max Miller, who sits on the House Ways and Means Committee, said a draft bill on digital asset taxation has already circulated among lawmakers and could advance before the August 2026 recess. U.S. lawmakers target August 2026 for a comprehensive crypto tax bill to clarify reporting, staking, and small-transaction rules. #CryptoTax #CryptoNews #Blockchain https://t.co/Gr8rKi9NF6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 10, 2025 Starting in 2026, the IRS plans to introduce new reporting rules , including 1099-DA forms from centralized exchanges, giving tax authorities a clearer picture of crypto activity.

Onchain data reveals this early holder deposited a colossal 5,152 BTC, worth approximately $440 million, to the Binance exchange. This single action by a Bitcoin OG immediately raises critical questions about market sentiment and potential price implications for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Who Is This Mysterious Bitcoin OG? The entity, identified by the address ‘1011short’, represents the classic profile of a Bitcoin OG. These are the early believers who accumulated Bitcoin long before it became a mainstream asset. According to reports from Onchain Lens, this particular whale isn’t just a Bitcoin holder. The address also maintains significant long positions in Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), painting a picture of a diversified but currently pressured crypto investor. Notably, the portfolio shows an unrealized loss of $76.6 million, adding a layer of intrigue to the massive Binance deposit. Why Would a Bitcoin OG Move $440M to an Exchange? When a Bitcoin OG of this magnitude moves funds, the market pays attention. Such a large deposit to a centralized exchange like Binance typically signals one of a few intentions. The immediate assumption is often preparation for a sale, which can exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. However, the reasons can be more nuanced. Let’s break down the potential motives behind this whale’s move: Profit-Taking or Loss Mitigation: The OG might be locking in gains from earlier prices or seeking to cut the $76.6 million unrealized loss on other holdings. Portfolio Rebalancing: Moving assets to exchange wallets is often the first step in reallocating a portfolio, possibly shifting weight between BTC, ETH, and SOL. Use of Exchange Services: The funds could be destined for Binance’s earn products, staking, or as collateral for lending. OTC Deal Preparation: Large holders frequently use exchanges to facilitate private, over-the-counter trades to minimize market impact. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Market? The action of this Bitcoin OG serves as a powerful on-chain signal. While a single transaction doesn’t dictate market direction, it provides valuable insight into the behavior of major players. The fact that this early adopter chose to move such a significant sum to a liquid exchange suggests a potential shift in strategy. For retail investors, monitoring these flows is crucial. It highlights the importance of on-chain analytics in understanding market dynamics beyond just price charts. Therefore, while concerning on the surface, it’s a data point that requires context from broader market trends. How to Interpret Whale Movements Like a Pro Seeing a Bitcoin OG move half a billion dollars can be alarming. However, savvy investors know to look deeper. First, check if this is part of a larger trend. Are other OGs moving funds? Second, analyze exchange net flows. Is Binance seeing more deposits than withdrawals overall? Third, consider the macro context. Is the move likely related to broader financial conditions or Bitcoin-specific news? By asking these questions, you move from reactive speculation to informed analysis. In conclusion, the $440 million deposit by a Bitcoin OG is a stark reminder of the influence early holders still wield. It underscores the market’s sensitivity to whale activity and the critical role of transparency through on-chain data. While the short-term price impact remains to be seen, the event reinforces a key lesson: in crypto, watching the wallets of the pioneers can be as important as watching the charts. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin OG? A: “OG” stands for “Original Gangster” or “Original.” In crypto, a Bitcoin OG refers to an early investor or miner who acquired Bitcoin in its first few years, often before 2013. Q2: Does a large deposit to Binance always mean a sell-off? A: Not always. While it increases the likelihood, large deposits can also be for trading, staking, using financial services, or preparing for an OTC (Over-The-Counter) deal that may not immediately hit the public order books. Q3: How can I track whale movements like this? A: You can use on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers that track large transactions (often labeled “whale alerts”) from known early adductor or exchange wallets. Q4: Should I sell my Bitcoin if I see a whale depositing to an exchange? A: One transaction should not be the sole reason for an investment decision. Use it as one data point among many, including technical analysis, market sentiment, and your own investment strategy. Q5: What is an ‘unrealized loss’? A: An unrealized loss is a decrease in the value of an asset that you still hold. It becomes a “realized” loss only if you sell the asset at the lower price. The reported $76.6M loss for this OG is based on current market prices versus their acquisition cost. Q6: Why is the address called ‘1011short’? A: Blockchain addresses are alphanumeric strings. “1011short” is likely a label or identifier given by the analytics platform (Onchain Lens) to make tracking this specific, notable wallet easier for its users.

Hoskinson’s statement drew the interest of many reporters who sought to extract more details from this prominent figure in the crypto industry. Therefore, they made attempts to invite him to an interview to comment on the topic. During the interview, several questions were raised. However, Hoskinson pointed out that this matter is a delicate topic about which one cannot say anything. What he chose to comment on was the question of why there is no one else in the industry who has raised this concern. He argued that he had a strong feeling that some individuals in the crypto ecosystem were reluctant to discuss the issue. Hoskinson cautions about Trump’s move in the crypto industry Earlier, when Trump decided to launch his own meme coin just three days after being sworn in as the US president, Hoskinson issued a warning , claiming that this move could significantly harm the cryptocurrency industry, particularly in the United States. At this time, he noted that what was initially perceived as a careful and bipartisan effort to establish straightforward regulations for digital assets in America had swiftly turned into a partisan issue . This situation presented a significant obstacle to crucial legislation and provided a convenient target for critics in the cryptocurrency industry. At this particular moment, the 2026 midterm elections were drawing closer. “The moment the Trump coin was introduced, the perception shifted from ‘crypto is bipartisan’ to ‘crypto means Trump, which is bad and corrupt,’” Hoskinson explained further, noting that the situation changed into a campaign slogan for the midterm elections scheduled next year. Hoskinson called on other crypto founders to weigh in on the topic of discussion. However, very few of them voiced this view. This shocked the Cardano founder. According to him, these crypto founders were instructed not to comment on this matter. He added that they were threatened that if they said anything about it, their access would be cut short. This meant that one would not have the opportunity to participate in the legislative process or meet with Trump. Hoskinson admitted that many individuals initially accepted this idea. Nonetheless, he highlighted that the US president’s connection to the crypto ecosystem ultimately blurred the line between policy and personal interests, thereby harming the industry’s image in Washington. This move came at a time when lawmakers were discussing strategies to regulate digital assets. Following this outcome, Hoskinson claimed that Trump caused a significant shake-up in the crypto market, arguing that he could be called to testify if Democrats regained power. Hoskinson disapproves of Trump’s World Liberty Financial project Even before the introduction of the meme coin, Trump, his family members, and business partners initiated a big crypto project known as World Liberty Financial . At that time, he was still holding campaigns and making pledges for the upcoming November election. The Cardano founder raised concerns regarding this crypto project. According to him, the timing set for this initiative was questionable. Hoskinson argued that as a private citizen of the United States, he can perform such actions, but he must also consider the fact that people are still watching his decisions. “You shouldn’t just jump into something and then create rules around it.

CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index has dropped to a mere 17, down one point from the previous day. This crucial metric acts as a barometer for the entire altcoin market, and its current reading suggests a challenging environment for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. If you’re wondering what this means for your portfolio, you’re in the right place. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does It Matter? The Altcoin Season Index is a simple yet powerful tool. It measures whether altcoins, as a group, are outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Think of it as a scorecard for the ‘risk-on’ sentiment in crypto. The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, to see how many have beaten Bitcoin’s returns. A score of 75 or above officially signals an ‘altcoin season’—a period where investors confidently rotate capital into smaller, riskier assets for potentially higher gains. Conversely, a low score like 17 indicates Bitcoin dominance is strong, and capital is flowing towards perceived safety. What Does a Score of 17 Truly Signal for the Market? A score of 17 is far from the 75 threshold needed for an altcoin season. This number tells a clear story: the vast majority of major altcoins are struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. For traders and long-term holders, this environment presents specific challenges and opportunities. Challenges for Altcoin Investors: Low momentum across the board can lead to stagnation or underperformance compared to simply holding Bitcoin. Potential Opportunities: A low index can sometimes precede a market rotation. Savvy investors might use this time to research fundamentally strong projects at lower valuations. Market Sentiment Gauge: The index reflects broader risk appetite. A low score often correlates with cautious or fearful sentiment in the wider crypto market. How Should You Navigate a Weak Altcoin Season Index? So, the Altcoin Season Index is low. What actionable steps can you take? First, avoid panic. Market cycles are normal. This is a time for strategy, not reaction. Consider reviewing your portfolio’s balance between Bitcoin and altcoins. You might also focus on dollar-cost averaging into projects with solid fundamentals, rather than chasing short-term pumps. Furthermore, use this period for education and due diligence. When the index eventually turns, you’ll be prepared with a researched watchlist. Remember, the goal isn’t to time the market perfectly, but to make informed decisions based on clear data like this index provides. Conclusion: Patience and Perspective Are Key The drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 17 is a significant data point, highlighting the current strength of Bitcoin and the relative weakness of the altcoin market. It serves as a reminder that crypto investing requires patience and an understanding of market cycles. While it may not be a classic ‘altcoin season’ right now, these periods of consolidation often set the stage for the next major move. By monitoring tools like this index and maintaining a disciplined strategy, you can navigate both seasons of boom and bust with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a good score for the Altcoin Season Index? A: A score above 75 is considered the threshold for an ‘altcoin season,’ indicating widespread altcoin outperformance. A score closer to 100 signals a very strong season. Q: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A: The index is typically updated daily, tracking the 90-day performance window on a rolling basis. Q: Does a low index mean all altcoins are losing money? A: Not necessarily. It means most are underperforming Bitcoin. Some individual altcoins may still post positive gains, just at a slower rate than Bitcoin. Q: Should I sell all my altcoins when the index is low? A: A low index is a signal, not a sell command. Your decision should be based on your investment thesis for each asset, risk tolerance, and portfolio strategy. It may be a time for caution and rebalancing. Q: Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? A: You can find the index on the CoinMarketCap website under their market data or research sections.

The price has held firm within a well-defined area of support. However, it is being seen that there is interest in early investment options as investors seek the best cryptocurrency to invest in, weighing calculated risks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale token at $0.035 has seen investment flows due to uncertainty with Dogecoin. Dogecoin Price Activity: Warning Signs and Prospects Dogecoin had been showing signs of a recovery after the market downturn while testing the $0.1332 support level. Derivatives market information had been showing that Open Interest had risen to $1.49 billion, showing that market participants had been opening longs on the expectation of a recovery. The long position had been seen to rise above 51% despite the information that the market had been experiencing liquidation. Additionally, the MACD has been approaching a bearish crossing, and this has been maintaining the possibility of downward reversals in case of a failure of support levels. Nonetheless, institutional inflows have been restricted, as Dogecoin inflows for the Dogecoin ETF have been very low, amounting to $171,920 in a single session. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off as Phase 6 Looms Close Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently being considered one of the most undervalued cryptos available. Investors have little time left for the currently available price of $0.035 for the coins before the next level at Phase 7 kicks in and drives the price towards $0.04 with a 20% surge. To date, they have managed to raise $19.5 million, while the total number of holders of the total MUTM has climbed to 18,520 since inception. This valuation marks an incredible 250% jump from Phase One’s launch price of $0.01, showing just how quickly prices can move. This launch price will be $0.06, leaving incoming investors poised for a possible return of 420% when prices open. Mutuum Finance has an increasing opportunity of being classified amongst the next big cryptos. Utility, Transparency, and Buyer Confidence Mutuum Finance is following through on its fundraising efforts by announcing the confirmation of its V1 protocol launch on the Sepolia testnet in 2025. The launching of the V1 protocol will enable the project to have its first Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot, including ETH and USDT lending, on the first day of its operation making Mutuum Finance the best cryptocurrency to invest in. Now, a live dashboard features the top 50 token holders, and a leaderboard replenishes daily, increasing engagement by awarding a $500 MUTM bonus for those in the top rankings after making a transaction within a 24-hour period after a minimum transaction has been performed. The leaderboard resets at 00:00 UTC daily. As Phase 6 ends, the opportunity to claim tokens at $0.035 gets narrower. With the pricing mechanics of Phase 7 and the valuation emphasis, those looking for the best crypto to buy now and the best cheap crypto to buy now will instead be attracted to something with progress to offer instead of simple projections. Looking Ahead in a Shifting Market Focus on Dogecoin challenges the conviction level of traders on support levels, while the capital is flowing towards a presale that contains milestones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a promising next big crypto in the world of cryptocurrencies for those who put a premium on timing, transparency, and early entry into the crypto space.

In a recent interview, he pointed directly at former President Donald Trump’s actions as a source of significant damage to the crypto market . Hoskinson argues that what should be a bipartisan effort for clear regulation has devolved into partisan conflict, creating uncertainty that hurts every investor and builder in the space. How Did Trump’s Memecoin Launch Disrupt the Crypto Market? Hoskinson identified a key moment of disruption: the launch of a Trump-branded memecoin just before the presidential inauguration. This move, according to Hoskinson, transformed cryptocurrency legislation from a technical policy discussion into a political football. The result? Vital conversations about consumer protection and innovation stalled as the focus shifted to partisan loyalty over substantive debate. This politicization injects volatility and fear into the crypto market , making it harder for serious projects to thrive. The Controversial Plan for a Government Bitcoin Reserve Another major point of criticism centers on Trump’s mentioned proposal for a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. Hoskinson calls this “the government picking winners and losers,” a fundamental breach of the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency. He suggests the plan is not a thoughtful economic strategy but a political tool. The inclusion of certain altcoins like Cardano (ADA) in discussions about this reserve seemed, to Hoskinson, more like an attempt to quiet critics than a genuine policy evaluation based on technology or utility. This approach creates several problems for the crypto market : Market Distortion: Government favoritism can artificially inflate or suppress specific assets. Eroded Trust: It undermines trust in the market’s organic, merit-based dynamics. Regulatory Uncertainty: It signals that future regulation may be arbitrary and politically motivated. Standing Up for Integrity in the Crypto Market Hoskinson revealed that his outspoken criticism likely cost him an invitation to a high-profile presidential dinner. However, he emphasized that protecting the industry’s integrity is more important than access. His stance highlights a crucial conflict in the crypto market : the tension between seeking legitimacy through political engagement and maintaining the core principles of decentralization and neutrality. For founders like Hoskinson, the long-term health of the ecosystem depends on resisting short-term political games. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Regulation? The current situation presents a clear challenge. The crypto market needs sensible, clear, and fair regulation to achieve mass adoption and protect users. However, when political figures intertwine their personal brand or agenda with the industry, it corrupts the process. The path forward requires a return to focus on the technology’s potential, its risks, and frameworks that foster innovation while ensuring security—free from the damaging influence of partisan spectacle. In conclusion, Charles Hoskinson’s critique serves as a crucial alarm bell. The politicization of cryptocurrency, exemplified by recent actions, poses a genuine threat to market stability and ethical development. The industry’s future growth depends on navigating these political waters without compromising its foundational values. For the crypto market to mature, it must be driven by technology and community, not political maneuvering. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly did Charles Hoskinson criticize about Trump’s crypto actions? Hoskinson criticized two main actions: the launch of a Trump memecoin, which he says turned crypto legislation into a partisan issue, and the proposal for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which he views as inappropriate government market manipulation. Why is a government Bitcoin reserve considered damaging to the crypto market? It is seen as “picking winners and losers,” which goes against cryptocurrency’s decentralized nature. It can distort prices, create unfair advantages, and set a precedent for politically-driven intervention rather than rules-based regulation. How does political partisanship hurt the cryptocurrency industry? It creates regulatory uncertainty, scares away institutional investment, and stalls important policy discussions. When crypto becomes a partisan tool, achieving balanced, effective legislation becomes much harder. Did Hoskinson’s comments have any personal consequence for him? He believes they led to him not being invited to a presidential dinner, but he stated that defending the industry’s integrity was more important than that access. What is the solution for better crypto market regulation? The solution involves developing clear, technology-neutral rules through transparent, bipartisan collaboration that focuses on consumer protection, innovation, and market stability, without political favoritism. Should crypto projects engage with politicians at all? Engagement is necessary for education and sensible lawmaking, but it must be done carefully to avoid co-option and to ensure the industry’s core principles of decentralization and fairness are not compromised.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) Shows Downside Signals Despite Fresh Inflows,https://bitcoinist.com/are-bears-still-control-bitcoin-btc-shows-downside/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price action has entered a conflicted phase, with renewed institutional inflows clashing against clear signs of market stress. After peaking above $126,000 earlier this year, the world’s largest crypto has retreated sharply and is now trading more than 30% below its all-time high. Related Reading: Bipartisan SAFE Crypto Act Unveiled: New Task Force To Combat Digital Asset Scams While some capital has returned through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), broader market signals suggest that selling pressure and weak participation continue to weigh on sentiment. Consequently, recent weeks have shown that Bitcoin’s recovery attempts remain fragile. Long-Term Holders Drive Persistent Supply Pressure A major source of downside pressure has been sustained selling by long-term holders. Data from K33 Research shows that roughly 1.6 million BTC that had been dormant for at least two years has been sold since early 2023. In 2025 alone, more than $300 billion worth of long-held Bitcoin has re-entered circulation. Analysts note that this type of distribution creates gradual, grinding declines rather than sharp capitulation events. With fewer active buyers in the market, the reactivated supply has proven difficult to absorb. Blockchain data indicates that the past month marked one of the heaviest long-term holder sell-offs in over five years, reinforcing the idea that structural selling remains unresolved. ETF Inflows Return, But Demand Remains Uneven Institutional demand has shown brief signs of recovery. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded roughly $457 million in net inflows on December 17, snapping a multi-day outflow streak. Fidelity’s Bitcoin fund accounted for the majority of the inflows, with BlackRock also posting gains. Despite this rebound, ETF activity has been inconsistent. December inflows remain modest compared with earlier in the year, following nearly $3.5 billion in ETF outflows in November. Market observers say these inflows, while supportive, have not yet been large or sustained enough to offset ongoing sell-side pressure from long-term holders and cautious retail participation. Technical Signals and Market Structure Favor Bears From a technical perspective, Bitcoin continues to flash bearish signals. The price has traded within a broad $82,000–$95,000 range for over a month, forming patterns such as an inverse cup and handle on the daily chart. Bitcoin has also slipped below key moving averages, while momentum indicators suggest sellers remain in control. Recent liquidation events have reinforced this weakness. Around $152 million in Bitcoin positions were liquidated in a single day, and derivatives open interest has declined since the October market crash tied to macroeconomic shocks and tariff-related concerns.

That sounds catastrophic if you’ve never watched XRPL governance do its thing. But the important nuance is right there in the name: amendment blocking is a safety feature, not a network failure mode. When new protocol rules activate, old software can’t reliably interpret ledgers anymore, so the network forces those servers into a non-participating state rather than letting them guess. Related Reading: XRP Price Falls To Critical Support Level, Is It Time To Panic? So does “almost half the servers” going amendment-blocked matter if activity spikes? “Not at all,” Krippenreiter replied to one user. “All dUNL validators are safe, so all ‘trusted’ validators will continue to validate as expected. (and behave under load)… For everything else there is ‘FeeEscalation’.” The point he’s making: consensus comes from a trusted validator set, and fee escalation is designed to push transaction costs higher as the ledger gets busy, throttling spam and overload attempts. Other XRPL watchers mostly treated it as routine maintenance, not an existential moment. “Is this unusual or dangerous? No. This happens almost every amendment cycle,” another user wrote, listing prior change windows and noting that lagging nodes typically upgrade later. The XRPL amendment process itself is built around a long lead time: an amendment needs sustained supermajority support from trusted validators for two weeks before it flips on. Related Reading: Best XRP Buy Zone? Analyst Breaks Down The Key Levels Still, the optics aren’t nothing. Having hundreds of public servers fall behind at once can be a real-world nuisance for wallets, explorers, and businesses that lean on third-party infrastructure. Even if consensus is fine, fewer up-to-date nodes can mean less redundancy at the edges — more brittle public endpoints, more support tickets, more “why is my transaction not going through?” posts. And there is a concrete upgrade path. XRPL.org’s release notes for rippled 2.6.2 describe a new fixDirectoryLimit amendment plus a critical bug fix — the kind of stuff you don’t want to procrastinate on if you run production infrastructure. The short version: no, XRPL isn’t “going down.” But if you’re still running old rippled in late 2025, the network is about to remind you that upgrades aren’t optional. At press time, XRP traded alongside the broader market wide sentiment, down -1.5% over the past 24 hours.

This appointment signals a significant shift in how America approaches digital asset oversight, bringing specialized crypto expertise directly to the helm of one of the nation’s key financial regulators. For investors and industry participants, this leadership change could accelerate the clarity everyone has been waiting for. Who Is Mike Selig and Why Does His CFTC Chairmanship Matter? The Republican-led Senate officially appointed Mike Selig to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to reports from Coindesk. Selig brings crucial experience from his previous role as senior legal advisor to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto task force. His background positions him uniquely to navigate the complex intersection of traditional finance and emerging digital assets. This appointment comes at a critical juncture. The CFTC is actively developing proposals that could reshape how cryptocurrencies operate within regulated markets. Selig’s leadership is expected to provide the momentum needed to move these initiatives from discussion to implementation. What Immediate Changes Can We Expect from the New CFTC Chairman? Industry observers anticipate Selig will accelerate key tasks within the agency’s ongoing “crypto sprint.” This initiative represents an intensive review of digital asset issues aimed at establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework. The new CFTC chairman inherits several pressing matters that demand attention. The agency currently focuses on two major proposals: Including stablecoins in tokenized collateral systems Integrating blockchain technology into regulatory oversight mechanisms These developments could create more structured pathways for cryptocurrency integration into mainstream finance. However, they also present challenges in balancing innovation with investor protection. How Will the Crypto Sprint Benefit from New Leadership? The “crypto sprint” initiative gains substantial momentum with Selig’s appointment. As the new CFTC chairman, he brings firsthand understanding of regulatory challenges from his SEC experience. This perspective could help bridge gaps between different regulatory approaches to digital assets. Several factors make this leadership transition particularly significant: Regulatory Coordination: Selig’s SEC background facilitates better inter-agency cooperation Technical Understanding: Direct experience with crypto legal issues informs practical rulemaking Timely Action: The crypto sprint receives focused leadership during a crucial development phase Market participants should watch for increased regulatory clarity in coming months. The new CFTC chairman has both the expertise and mandate to advance concrete proposals. What Challenges Face the New CFTC Chairman? Despite the promising outlook, significant hurdles remain. Regulatory frameworks must address diverse digital assets while maintaining market integrity. The new CFTC chairman must navigate complex jurisdictional questions, particularly regarding which assets fall under CFTC versus SEC oversight. Additionally, technological integration presents practical challenges. Blockchain-based regulatory systems require robust infrastructure and industry cooperation. Selig’s success will depend on building consensus among commissioners, industry stakeholders, and other regulatory bodies. Conclusion: A New Era for Cryptocurrency Regulation The appointment of Mike Selig as CFTC chairman represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency regulation. His specialized background and the timing of this transition create ideal conditions for meaningful regulatory progress. As the new CFTC chairman accelerates the crypto sprint, market participants can anticipate clearer guidelines that balance innovation with necessary safeguards. This leadership change comes when the industry desperately needs regulatory certainty. With stablecoin frameworks and blockchain integration on the agenda, Selig’s tenure could define how America regulates digital assets for years to come. The path forward requires careful navigation, but the direction seems clearer than ever. Frequently Asked Questions What is the CFTC’s role in cryptocurrency regulation? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates commodity futures, options, and swaps markets in the United States. For cryptocurrencies, the CFTC typically oversees derivatives products like Bitcoin futures and has authority over commodities spot markets involving fraud and manipulation. How does Mike Selig’s background help him as CFTC chairman? Selig previously served as senior legal advisor to the SEC’s crypto task force, giving him direct experience with digital asset regulation from another major financial regulator. This background helps him understand both the technical aspects of cryptocurrencies and the regulatory challenges they present. What is the “crypto sprint” mentioned in the article? The crypto sprint is a CFTC initiative focused on intensively reviewing digital asset issues to establish a regulatory framework. It involves concentrated efforts to address pressing questions about how cryptocurrencies should be regulated within existing financial systems. How might stablecoins be affected by new CFTC proposals? The CFTC is developing proposals to include stablecoins in tokenized collateral systems. This could create new use cases for stablecoins within regulated financial markets while establishing clearer rules for their operation and oversight. What immediate changes should cryptocurrency investors expect? While immediate changes may be limited, investors should anticipate accelerated regulatory clarity in coming months. The new CFTC chairman is expected to advance concrete proposals that could affect how cryptocurrencies are traded, stored, and integrated into traditional finance. How does this appointment affect the relationship between CFTC and SEC? Selig’s SEC background could improve coordination between the two agencies regarding cryptocurrency regulation.

56012161,646674,1766109616,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56012161.jpeg,Ethereum Retail Participation Vanishes: Hits One-Year Low In Network Activity,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-retail-participation-vanishes-one-year-low/,"Ethereum is struggling to maintain a convincing bullish narrative as market conditions continue to deteriorate and a growing number of analysts begin to call for a broader bear market. After months of heightened volatility and repeated corrective phases, price action alone has failed to restore confidence, leaving participants increasingly cautious. This hesitation is now being reflected clearly in on-chain data, reinforcing the idea that the current weakness is not purely technical, but structural. According to a recent CryptoQuant report, Ethereum’s network activity has dropped to levels that strongly suggest a withdrawal of retail participation. Active sending addresses have fallen toward the 170,000 mark, a threshold historically associated with reduced engagement from smaller investors. In past cycles, retail activity typically expands during bullish phases as new participants enter the market, then contracts sharply once confidence fades and price momentum weakens. Prolonged volatility and corrective price action have likely eroded Ethereum’s short-term conviction , pushing retail participants either to the sidelines or out of the market entirely. This absence matters. Retail flow often plays a critical role in sustaining momentum during recoveries, and without it, upside moves tend to stall quickly. On-Chain Signals Point to Exhaustion, Not Capitulation According to CryptoOnchain’s analysis , Ethereum’s sharply depressed on-chain activity aligns with a classic phase of seller exhaustion rather than active capitulation. In this regime, selling pressure gradually diminishes as participants willing to exit have largely done so, yet fresh demand has not meaningfully returned. The result is a fragile equilibrium where price may stabilize, but upside remains limited in the absence of new buyers. The lack of retail participation plays a central role in this dynamic. Retail flow typically provides the initial momentum during early rebounds, amplifying price moves once confidence begins to recover. With active sending addresses at one-year lows, that catalyst is currently missing, which helps explain why upside attempts have been shallow and short-lived. However, this same environment has historically attracted larger, long-term participants. Institutional and high-conviction holders often accumulate during periods of low activity, when liquidity is thin, and sentiment is decisively negative. Importantly, a credible recovery signal would not emerge from price action alone. CryptoOnchain emphasizes that a sustainable shift would require a gradual rebound in active sending addresses alongside price stabilization. That combination would point to returning demand and improving network utilization. Conversely, continued stagnation or further declines in address activity would increase the risk of Ethereum entering a deeper consolidation or even a demand-destruction phase. While current conditions highlight clear short-term weakness and retail disengagement, similar on-chain setups have historically formed near structural bottoms, creating the potential for medium-term trend shifts if activity begins to recover. Ethereum Price Struggles at Key Structural Support Ethereum’s price action on the 3-day chart reflects a market caught between structural support and persistent bearish pressure. After failing to hold above the $3,200–$3,300 region, ETH has rolled over and is now consolidating near the $2,850 area, a zone that aligns closely with the 200-day moving average. This level has historically acted as a medium-term inflection point, making it critical for bulls to defend in order to avoid a deeper trend shift. The recent rejection from the $4,000–$4,800 highs marks a clear lower high within the broader structure, reinforcing the idea that momentum has weakened since late 2025. While price briefly reclaimed the 100-day moving average during the mid-year rebound, it failed to sustain acceptance above it, and ETH has since slipped back below the shorter-term averages. This suggests that rallies are still being sold into rather than accumulated aggressively. Price action aligns with a market transitioning into consolidation rather than immediate capitulation. If ETH loses the $2,800–$2,750 support zone decisively, downside risk opens toward the $2,400 region, where the long-term trend support converges. Conversely, any bullish recovery would require ETH to stabilize above the 200-day moving average and reclaim the $3,200 level with expanding volume. Until then, the chart favors a cautious, range-bound outlook with downside risks still present.

On Wednesday, BTC briefly surged from the $86,000 area toward $90,000, offering short-term investors a moment of relief after weeks of downside volatility. That rebound, however, proved short-lived. Price quickly retraced back to the $86,000 level, once again stalling bullish momentum and reinforcing the perception that sellers remain firmly in control. Related Reading: From Cycles To Continuity: Why Bitcoin’s 4-Year Pattern May Be Breaking This failed recovery attempt has weighed heavily on sentiment, particularly among short-term holders who entered positions at higher levels during the previous consolidation range. According to a report by Axel Adler, on-chain data reveals that this cohort has entered a clear stress regime. Bitcoin’s price has fallen below the average purchase price of short-term holders, a condition that historically increases the probability of reactive selling behavior. The stress is further reflected in the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR, 30-day), which has declined to 0.98. This reading indicates that short-term holders are, on average, realizing losses when they sell. Such environments often coincide with deteriorating confidence and heightened sensitivity to further downside moves. With BTC unable to hold recent relief rallies and short-term participants increasingly underwater, the market enters a fragile phase. The coming days will be critical in determining whether this pressure evolves into deeper capitulation or stabilizes into a base-building process. Short-Term Holders Under Stress as Loss-Taking Accelerates Adler explains that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR 30D) is a critical gauge of short-term market stress, as it measures whether recent coin sales are occurring at a profit or a loss. Values above one indicate that short-term holders are selling profitably, while readings below one signal loss realization. Historically, sustained periods below one reflect deteriorating confidence and raise the risk of further downside, as loss-taking behavior can cascade into additional sell pressure. A continued decline in SOPR would likely intensify this dynamic and open the door to new local lows. By contrast, a meaningful recovery would require the metric to reclaim and hold above the one level, signaling that selling pressure is being absorbed and losses are no longer dominant. This stress is reinforced by the Short-Term Holders Positive vs Negative Sentiment chart. The indicator classifies holders based on whether they are in profit or at a loss. Over the past five weeks, sentiment has shifted decisively toward the orange and purple zones, representing negative positioning. The growing dominance of underwater holders increases the probability of panic-driven selling. Together, both charts deliver a consistent message: short-term participants are under pressure, and the current environment remains fragile until clear signs of relief emerge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Structure Turns Bearish As Structural Indicators Flip Negative Bitcoin Tests Critical Support as Bears Persist Bitcoin continues to trade under pressure, with the chart showing price consolidating around the $87,000 area after a sharp corrective move from the October highs near $125,000. The rejection from the upper range marked a clear shift in market structure, as BTC lost the 50-day and 100-day moving averages and failed to reclaim them on subsequent rebounds. The blue moving average has now turned downward, reinforcing the short- to medium-term bearish bias. Price is currently hovering just above the 200-day moving average, plotted in red, which sits near the $86,000–$88,000 zone. This level represents a critical area of long-term demand and structural support. Historically, sustained closes below the 200-day average tend to coincide with deeper corrective phases or prolonged consolidation. Related Reading: XRP Liquidity Dries Up: Futures Buy Volume On Binance Falls from $5.8B to $250M Volume dynamics add to the cautious outlook. Selling pressure expanded significantly during the breakdown in October and November, while recent rebound attempts have occurred on relatively muted volume. This suggests that short-covering and tactical buying, rather than strong spot demand, are driving price stabilization. Structurally, Bitcoin is forming lower highs since the peak, keeping the broader trend vulnerable. A recovery scenario would require BTC to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 region and hold above the declining moving averages. Until then, the chart favors continued consolidation or further downside risk around the long-term support zone.

This development marks a pivotal moment for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, granting the DEXE token direct access to one of Asia’s most active trading markets. For investors and crypto enthusiasts, understanding the implications of Bithumb lists DeXe is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape. What Does It Mean When Bithumb Lists DeXe? The announcement that Bithumb lists DeXe on its Korean Won (KRW) market is more than just another exchange listing. It represents a bridge between decentralized protocol governance and a massive, regulated centralized exchange. Trading commenced at 7:00 a.m. UTC, providing Korean investors with a new avenue to participate in decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance. This move significantly boosts liquidity and mainstream visibility for the DEXE project. Why Is the DEXE Token Gaining Attention? DeXe operates as a decentralized social trading and governance protocol. Its native token, DEXE, serves several core functions that make this listing noteworthy: Governance Power: Holders can vote on key protocol decisions. Staking Rewards: Users earn rewards for securing the network. Utility in Trading: The token integrates with DeXe’s copy-trading and strategy mirroring features. Therefore, the decision that Bithumb lists DeXe validates its utility beyond typical speculative assets. It acknowledges the growing demand for tools that blend sophisticated trading with community-led governance. How Does This Benefit the South Korean Crypto Market? South Korea maintains one of the world’s most enthusiastic and technologically adept crypto communities. By choosing to list DeXe, Bithumb provides its users with early access to innovative DeFi primitives. This action has several immediate benefits: Enhanced Access: Korean traders can now use KRW to buy DEXE easily. Increased Legitimacy: A Bithumb listing acts as a stamp of approval, fostering trust. Market Diversification: It expands the portfolio of DeFi assets available to local investors. The event where Bithumb lists DeXe demonstrates the exchange’s commitment to curating a forward-thinking asset portfolio for its users. What Are the Challenges and Considerations? While the news is positive, investors should proceed with informed caution. Listing on a major exchange like Bithumb often leads to increased volatility as new money enters the market. Furthermore, users must remember that the core value of DEXE is tied to the adoption and security of the DeXe protocol itself, not just its exchange presence. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) and understand the project’s fundamentals, roadmap, and the risks associated with DAO governance. Conclusion: A Strategic Step for DeFi Adoption The move where Bithumb lists DeXe is a strategic inflection point. It signals a growing convergence between centralized finance (CeFi) giants and the decentralized world.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.02. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $3.04 and $3.29, with an average value of $3.16. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.2571 Market Cap $499.58M Trading Volume $81.91M Circulating Supply 1.94B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2544 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-hour High $0.2852 24-hour Low $0.2561 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.05% (High) 50-Day SMA $0.3555 14-Day RSI 35.28 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 17 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.6627 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is trading near support, but momentum remains bearish. A price fall below $0.25 opens the door for a deeper drop. Optimism (OP) key resistance lies at $0.28. Optimism 1-day price chart On the daily timeframe for December 19, OP is trading around $0.256, sitting near the lower Bollinger Band at $0.262, which confirms persistent downside momentum rather than a healthy mean reversion. The price remains firmly below the mid-band, near $0.304, maintaining the broader structure’s bearish tone. The RSI is weak around 32, hovering just above oversold, showing sellers still dominate without meaningful bullish divergence yet. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative and is expanding slightly, reinforcing that downside pressure has not yet fully exhausted. A clean daily close below $0.250–$0.255 risks accelerating losses toward the $0.22–$0.23 demand zone, while recovery attempts are capped below $0.30 unless momentum flips decisively. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, OP continues to trend below the Alligator averages, with price rejected near $0.28 and currently consolidating weakly around $0.256–$0.260. Volume flow remains bearish, as OBV keeps making lower lows and CMF stays negative near -0.21, confirming capital outflows rather than accumulation. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The lack of strong bullish candles after the sharp drop suggests this is a pause, not a reversal. As long as OP stays below $0.27–0.28, sellers retain control, and another push toward $0.25 remains likely before any meaningful bounce attempt. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4303 SELL SMA 5 $0.3814 SELL SMA 10 $0.3653 SELL SMA 21 $0.3401 SELL SMA 50 $0.3555 SELL SMA 100 $0.4927 SELL SMA 200 $0.6627 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3290 SELL EMA 5 $0.3651 SELL EMA 10 $0.4505 SELL EMA 21 $0.5541 SELL EMA 50 $0.6327 SELL EMA 100 $0.6769 SELL EMA 200 $0.8248 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is still in a bearish continuation phase, with momentum favoring sellers unless $0.28–$0.30 is reclaimed convincingly. Short-term relief bounces are possible, but structurally weak. Traders must take caution until clear accumulation or bullish divergence appears. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

On-chain trading infrastructure startup aPriori has announced a strategic partnership with blockchain oracle network Chainlink. This collaboration aims to fundamentally enhance cross-chain functionality and data reliability for users. For traders and developers, this means more secure and efficient movement of assets across different blockchain ecosystems. Why is the aPriori Chainlink Partnership a Game-Changer? This partnership directly tackles one of the biggest challenges in decentralized finance: fragmented liquidity and isolated data. By integrating Chainlink’s proven infrastructure, aPriori is building a more connected and trustworthy trading environment. The core of this aPriori Chainlink partnership focuses on two critical components: secure token transfers and tamper-proof market data. This move signals a strong commitment to building robust, user-centric DeFi solutions. How Does Chainlink CCIP Power aPriori’s aprMON Token? A central element of the collaboration is the integration of Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). aPriori’s Monad-based token, aprMON, will utilize CCIP as its exclusive cross-chain solution, launching as a Cross-Chain Token (CCT). This integration allows for: Secure Cross-Chain Transfers: Users can move aprMON tokens between blockchains with enhanced security, minimizing risks associated with bridge vulnerabilities. Reliable Price Data: The integration includes Chainlink Price Feeds for both APR and aprMON, providing accurate and manipulation-resistant market data. Simplified User Experience: It creates a seamless pathway for users to interact with aprMON across multiple networks without complex manual processes. This technical foundation is crucial for scaling adoption and utility. What Does This Mean for Swapr and Monad Network Growth? Separately, aPriori’s AI-based DEX aggregator, Swapr, is demonstrating impressive traction. Since its soft launch on December 5th on the Monad network, Swapr has surpassed $15 million in total trading volume . The platform maintains an average daily trading volume exceeding $1 million, establishing itself as the highest-volume DEX aggregator on Monad. The aPriori Chainlink partnership will likely further accelerate this growth by improving the underlying data and interoperability that Swapr relies on, potentially attracting more liquidity and users to the Monad ecosystem. What Are the Broader Implications for DeFi Interoperability? The strategic alignment between aPriori and Chainlink represents a broader industry trend. Projects are moving beyond single-chain limitations to build interconnected financial systems. This partnership leverages Chainlink’s established reputation for secure oracle services to bolster aPriori’s innovative trading tools. For the wider market, it sets a precedent for how infrastructure projects can collaborate to solve complex problems like cross-chain communication and data integrity, making DeFi more accessible and reliable for everyone. Conclusion: A Strategic Step Towards a Unified DeFi Future The aPriori Chainlink partnership is more than just a technical integration; it’s a strategic move to build a more resilient and connected decentralized finance landscape. By combining aPriori’s on-chain trading infrastructure with Chainlink’s battle-tested oracle and cross-chain solutions, the collaboration addresses critical needs for security, reliability, and seamless asset movement. As Swapr’s early success on Monad shows, there is strong demand for sophisticated DeFi tools. This partnership provides the foundational infrastructure to meet that demand at a larger scale, paving the way for the next wave of cross-chain innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the main goal of the aPriori and Chainlink partnership? A: The primary goal is to enhance aPriori’s interoperability and data infrastructure using Chainlink’s secure oracle networks and cross-chain protocol, enabling safer and more efficient multi-chain operations. Q: What is Chainlink CCIP, and how is aPriori using it? A: CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) is Chainlink’s solution for secure cross-blockchain communication. aPriori is using it as the exclusive cross-chain solution for its aprMON token, allowing it to move securely between different networks. Q: How does this partnership benefit an average crypto user? A: Users benefit from more secure cross-chain token transfers, reliable price information for trading decisions, and a smoother experience when using aPriori’s products like Swapr across multiple blockchains. Q: What is Swapr, and why is its volume significant? A: Swapr is aPriori’s AI-powered DEX aggregator on the Monad network. Surpassing $15 million in volume quickly indicates strong user adoption and validates the demand for advanced trading tools in emerging ecosystems. Q: Does this partnership involve any new token launches? A: The partnership involves the existing aprMON token being launched as a Cross-Chain Token (CCT) using CCIP. It does not announce a brand-new token creation. Q: How does this affect the broader Monad ecosystem? A: It brings proven, high-security infrastructure from Chainlink to Monad, potentially increasing developer confidence, attracting more applications, and boosting overall liquidity and activity on the network.

56013241,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=247903,1766111411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive Move: Anonymous Whales Withdraw $14.2 Million in Ethereum from Binance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/anonymous-whales-withdraw-eth/,"BitcoinWorld Massive Move: Anonymous Whales Withdraw $14.2 Million in Ethereum from Binance In a move that has captured the attention of the crypto community, two anonymous whales have executed a significant withdrawal from Binance. On-chain data reveals they pulled a combined 4,664 ETH, worth approximately $14.2 million. This substantial movement of Ethereum from a major exchange to private wallets often signals a shift in holder strategy, prompting analysts and investors to ask: what do these anonymous whales know? What Does It Mean When Anonymous Whales Withdraw ETH? When large, unidentified entities—commonly called ‘whales’—move cryptocurrency off exchanges, it typically suggests a long-term holding strategy. This action reduces the immediate selling pressure on the market. According to on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, one address withdrew 2,656 ETH ($7.55 million), while another took out 2,008 ETH ($5.65 million). The analyst provided deeper insight, noting the second address has been accumulating for months. Is This a Sign of Bullish Confidence? The data suggests a strong vote of confidence in Ethereum’s future. The second whale address has withdrawn a total of 6,411.4 ETH, valued at $24.83 million, over the past four months. Crucially, the analyst noted that most of these funds are being staked . Staking involves locking up ETH to help secure the network and earn rewards, which is a definitive long-term play. This pattern indicates these anonymous whales are not looking for a quick profit but are positioning for the long haul. Let’s break down the potential implications of this move: Reduced Exchange Supply: Large withdrawals decrease the liquid supply available for trading, which can positively impact price stability. Increased Staking: Moving ETH into staking contracts supports network security and demonstrates holder commitment. Market Sentiment: Whale accumulation is often viewed as a bullish signal, suggesting ‘smart money’ expects future price appreciation. How Can Retail Investors Interpret Whale Activity? While whale movements are noteworthy, they are just one piece of the puzzle. Retail investors should use this information cautiously. Whale watching can provide clues about market sentiment, but it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. The key takeaway is the demonstrated shift from exchange-held assets to staked, long-term holdings. This aligns with a broader trend of Ethereum maturation post-Merge, where earning yield through staking becomes a core value proposition. Therefore, the decision by these anonymous whales to withdraw ETH en masse points to a strategic, network-supportive accumulation phase. It underscores a growing divergence between short-term traders on exchanges and long-term believers in the Ethereum ecosystem. Conclusion: A Strategic Vote for Ethereum’s Future This $14.2 million withdrawal is more than a simple transaction; it’s a strategic statement. The consistent accumulation and subsequent staking by one of the whales reveal a calculated bet on Ethereum’s long-term viability and value. For the market, it highlights the ongoing narrative of supply consolidation and growing institutional-grade confidence in proof-of-stake Ethereum. While the identities of these anonymous whales remain secret, their on-chain footprints tell a clear story of commitment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are ‘crypto whales’? A1: Crypto whales are individuals or entities that hold large amounts of a cryptocurrency. Their trades can significantly influence market prices due to the size of their holdings. Q2: Why is withdrawing crypto from an exchange considered significant? A2: Withdrawing to a private wallet usually indicates a intent to hold long-term (HODL) or stake, reducing immediate selling pressure on exchanges. It’s often interpreted as a bullish signal. Q3: What is Ethereum staking? A3: Staking is the process of locking up cryptocurrency to support the operations of a proof-of-stake blockchain network. In return, participants earn rewards, similar to interest. Q4: Should I buy Ethereum because a whale did? A4: Not necessarily. Whale activity is a useful data point, but it should be combined with your own research, risk assessment, and investment strategy. Never invest based solely on another entity’s actions. Q5: How can I track whale movements myself? A5: You can use on-chain analytics platforms like Etherscan, Nansen, or Glassnode. These tools track large wallet transactions and provide insights into whale behavior. Q6: Does this withdrawal guarantee an Ethereum price increase? A6: No single event guarantees a price move. While reducing exchange supply is generally positive, price is influenced by many factors including broader market trends, adoption news, and macroeconomic conditions.

According to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham, mining giant Bitmain is estimated to have purchased over $229 million worth of Ethereum in just a few days. This massive Bitmain Ethereum purchase represents one of the most significant institutional moves into ETH this quarter, sending a powerful signal to the entire market. What Does Bitmain’s Massive Ethereum Investment Mean? Let’s break down the numbers. Blockchain data shows an address linked to Bitmain executed two major transactions. First, it withdrew 48,049 ETH (worth $141.78 million) from institutional platform FalconX on December 17. Then, just two days later, it pulled another 30,075 ETH ($88.31 million) from the same platform. Combined, this represents a strategic accumulation of nearly 80,000 ETH tokens. This isn’t random trading activity. The scale and timing suggest a deliberate, calculated investment strategy. When a company like Bitmain—known for its deep industry expertise—makes such a substantial move, market participants pay close attention. Why Is Bitmain Betting Big on Ethereum Now? Several factors could explain this aggressive accumulation. First, Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake has fundamentally changed its investment thesis. The network now burns transaction fees, making ETH potentially deflationary during high-usage periods. Second, consider these upcoming developments: Ethereum ETF applications are pending with the SEC The network continues to dominate in decentralized finance and NFTs Major protocol upgrades are on the roadmap Bitmain’s timing suggests they see current prices as an attractive entry point before these catalysts potentially drive value higher. Their Bitmain Ethereum purchase demonstrates conviction that goes beyond short-term speculation. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? Institutional moves of this magnitude create ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. When a mining hardware manufacturer diversifies into Ethereum holdings, it validates ETH as a store of value alongside Bitcoin. This could encourage other mining companies and traditional institutions to reconsider their crypto allocation strategies. Moreover, removing nearly 80,000 ETH from circulation reduces available supply on exchanges. This technical factor, combined with the psychological impact of seeing a major player accumulate, often creates upward price pressure. The market interprets such moves as smart money positioning for future gains. What Challenges Could Bitmain Face With This Strategy? While the Bitmain Ethereum purchase appears strategically sound, no investment is without risk. Ethereum’s price remains volatile, subject to broader market sentiment and regulatory developments. As a proof-of-stake asset, ETH doesn’t generate yield unless staked, which introduces different considerations than Bitcoin mining. Additionally, Bitmain must manage this substantial position carefully. Large holders often face scrutiny regarding their influence on network governance and price stability. However, their expertise in blockchain technology likely gives them unique insights into managing these challenges effectively. Key Takeaways From Bitmain’s Ethereum Accumulation This development offers several actionable insights for investors and observers. First, institutional accumulation often precedes major price movements. Second, diversification within the crypto space is becoming standard practice even for Bitcoin-focused companies. Finally, the sheer scale of this Bitmain Ethereum purchase suggests confidence in Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals despite short-term market fluctuations. As we conclude, remember that Bitmain didn’t become a mining giant by making reckless bets. Their substantial Ethereum investment likely results from careful analysis of technology, market dynamics, and risk-reward calculations. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, when industry leaders put hundreds of millions behind an asset, it’s worth understanding why. Frequently Asked Questions How was Bitmain’s Ethereum purchase discovered? Blockchain intelligence platform Arkham identified the transactions through on-chain analysis, linking the wallet addresses to Bitmain based on transaction patterns and known associations. Why would a Bitcoin mining company buy Ethereum? Bitmain is diversifying its portfolio. Ethereum represents a different value proposition than Bitcoin, with strong utility in decentralized applications and a transitioning economic model that may offer different growth opportunities. Does this mean Bitmain is moving away from Bitcoin? Not necessarily. This appears to be a diversification strategy rather than a replacement. Many institutional investors hold multiple cryptocurrencies to balance risk and exposure to different blockchain innovations. How might this affect Ethereum’s price? Large accumulations typically reduce available supply on exchanges, which can create upward price pressure. More importantly, they signal confidence that can influence market sentiment and attract other investors. Should retail investors follow Bitmain’s move? While institutional moves provide valuable market signals, every investor’s situation is different. Consider your own risk tolerance, investment horizon, and research before making any decisions based on this news. Where did Bitmain purchase the Ethereum? The transactions occurred through FalconX, an institutional cryptocurrency trading platform designed for large-volume transactions with minimal market impact.

The mood improved after a shock slowdown in US consumer price inflation to 2.7%, although analysts cautioned the reading looked clearly distorted lower by the government shutdown and should not be taken at face value. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $85,811, down 1% Ether : $2,836, down 0.1% XRP : $1.79, down 3.8% Total crypto market cap: $2.97 trillion, down 1.4% Bitcoin Pullback Reframes Debate Around Dormant Capital And DeFi Use Crypto traders focused on positioning and flows rather than the headline macro print. Bitfinex analysts said current data shows institutional buyers absorbing around 13% more Bitcoin than the about 450 newly mined coins produced daily on a rolling basis. “This marks the first meaningful supply flip since early November, despite recent concerns around ETF outflows.” “From a technical perspective, there is strong buying support in the $82,000–$85,000 range,” they said. “A sustained hold in this zone would reinforce bullish momentum by strengthening buyer confidence. This, in turn, could attract fresh liquidity through higher ETF inflows and reduced selling pressure, supporting further accumulation to the upside.” U.S. asset manager Bitwise forecasts a surge in crypto-linked ETFs, predicting 100+ new products could launch in the U.S. by 2026. #ETFs #Bitwise https://t.co/R4eJ2LV8Yb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 18, 2025 Some market watchers used the pullback to push a longer-term use case story. Dom Harz, co-founder of BOB, said Bitcoin’s fluctuations this week do not diminish its long-term potential. “Despite holding almost $2 trillion in market capitalization, the vast majority of BTC remains dormant, with about 0.3% actively deployed in native Bitcoin DeFi,” he said. “This untapped liquidity represents a transformative opportunity to put the asset to work for lending, borrowing, and yield generation, while BTC collateral remains natively secured on Bitcoin.” Inflation Keeps Pressure On BOJ As Yen Stability Hangs In Balance In rates, Fed pricing moved only marginally after the inflation data, with a January cut implied at 27%, while March nudged up to 58% from 54% before the release. Japan took centre stage in Asia. Markets implied around a 90% chance the BOJ would lift its policy rate by a quarter point to 0.75% later Friday, and traders watched closely for guidance on how far policymakers may want to go next. Investors currently wager on just one additional move to 1.0% in 2026. Any hint of a steeper path could steady the embattled yen, while adding pressure to government bonds. Data released on Friday showed Japan’s core CPI rose 3.0% in November, unchanged from the previous month, keeping inflation in focus heading into the BOJ decision. Equities tracked the improving tone. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.6%, South Korea climbed 1.2% after strong results from chipmaker Micron Technology, and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.2%. Central Bank Signals Complicate Global Bond And FX Trades In the US, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures held flat after the overnight rebound, and bond markets reacted cautiously to the CPI report. Ten-year Treasury yields sat around 4.126%, below a recent 3-1/2-month high of 4.2%. Central bank divergence added another thread for global markets. British bonds fell after the Bank of England cut rates as expected, but only after a tight 5-4 vote, while policymakers signalled caution on the pace of future easing and markets pushed the next fully priced cut out to June. The European Central Bank took an even tougher line, holding rates at 2.0% and signalling a likely end to its easing cycle, with markets implying only a small chance of any cut through 2026. Sweden and Norway also kept policy steady, although Norway left the door open to one or more cuts.

From an April low of $75,000 to an early October high of $126,000, Bitcoin moved about 68%. Nvidia, by contrast, swung roughly 120% from a low near $94 in April to $207 in late October. Those numbers show a clear gap in how rough the ride has been this year. Volatility Comparison Shows Shift Based on reports from Bitwise, Bitcoin will likely be calmer than Nvidia in 2026. “BTC already less volatile than Nvidia in 2025 … thanks to institutional inflows & ETFs,” Bitwise said in an X post. That change is linked to more traditional money coming in through products such as spot ETFs and other institutional channels. In short: more big, steady investors are in the mix now, and that tends to smooth out wild swings. Bitcoin maturing fast!

It expects a new all-time high and a break from the old four-year cycle. The firm listed several reasons: the halving, shifts in interest-rate cycles, and weaker boom-and-bust forces than in past runs. The company named big institutions — Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch — as potential new entrants, and it said allocations to spot crypto ETFs should rise. Bitwise added that onchain work could speed up too, and that crypto equities might beat tech stocks in returns. Long-Time Holders Are Selling Reports have disclosed heavy selling from long-term holders, a trend that complicates the bullish story. K33 Research found about 1.6 million coins that had been idle for at least two years moved since early 2023. That amount is worth roughly $140 billion. In 2025 alone, nearly $300 billion of coins that had been dormant for over one year returned to the market, according to K33 and CryptoQuant data. CryptoQuant also flagged one of the heaviest long-term holder distributions seen in more than five years in the past 30 days. Chris Newhouse, director of research at Ergonia, described the flow as a “slow bleed” caused by steady selling into thin bids, which can create a long, grinding fall that is not easy to reverse. Market Divergence And Near-Term Pressure The split with equities is clear. Nvidia shares are up about 27% year-to-date. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is down roughly 8% so far this year and has dropped nearly 30% from its record above $126,000. That gap shows crypto is not always moving with big tech. Selling by long-term holders is one reason prices are under pressure even while some investors push for fresh gains.

Metals Rally, Hit New Highs Silver’s advance has been dramatic. It is up roughly 120-130% year-to-date, a jump that outpaces gold by a wide margin. Traders point to a mix of stronger industrial demand from solar and electronics, tighter supplies, and flows into safe assets as reasons behind the move. Gold buyers have also been encouraged by signs that US inflation may cool and by shifting expectations for central bank policy, which tends to support non-yielding assets when real yields fall.

Others want exposure linked to real economy needs. Both forces are at work. Analysts say silver’s dual role — as an industrial metal and as a store of value — is amplifying moves. Energy prices and supply reports have added pressure on markets, and that has upped demand for physical metal in several trading hubs. Bitcoin Slips Under Key Level Bitcoin fell below $89,000 and was trading nearer to $88,450 in mid-session, giving back gains from earlier months. Based on reports and market feeds, BTC is about 7% lower year-to-date and roughly 30% below its October 2025 peak above $126,000. Some crypto funds recorded outflows recently, and several traders described market tone as risk-off, which has weighed on digital assets this week. Liquidity, ETF Flows And Sentiment ETF flows played a role. Where money leaves ETFs, prices can feel the impact quickly. Margin calls, profit taking after a volatile run, and investors moving to what they see as safer stores of value have all been cited by sources watching the tape. Technical levels near $84,000 to $85,000 are now being watched for support, while resistance sits close to $90,000 to $92,000.

The bankruptcy estate of Terraform Labs has launched an explosive $4 billion lawsuit against market maker Jump Trading. This Terraform Labs lawsuit alleges that secretive trading actions directly fueled the catastrophic collapse of the Terra ecosystem, sending shockwaves through the entire crypto market. What is the $4B Terraform Labs Lawsuit About? According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the administrator overseeing Terraform Labs’ bankruptcy has filed a monumental complaint. The core accusation is stark: Jump Trading allegedly engaged in undisclosed, large-scale interventions to prop up the price of TerraUSD (UST) during its de-pegging events in 2021 and 2022. The lawsuit claims these actions were not a rescue mission but a profitable scheme that ultimately made the ecosystem’s failure inevitable. How Did Jump Trading Allegedly Profit? The complaint paints a detailed picture of the alleged manipulation. Here are the key actions Jump Trading is accused of taking: Massive Secret Purchases: Executing huge buy orders of UST whenever its price fell below the $1 peg. Artificially Inflating Value: These purchases created a false impression of stability and demand. Extracting Enormous Profits: The lawsuit states Jump earned roughly $1 billion from these activities, profiting from the very volatility it was secretly managing. Therefore, the Terraform Labs lawsuit argues that these actions were not neutral market making. Instead, they were a form of manipulation that deceived the public and contributed to a massive, systemic risk. Why Does This Terraform Labs Lawsuit Matter for Crypto? This case extends far beyond a simple financial dispute. It strikes at the heart of two critical issues in decentralized finance: transparency and market integrity. The allegations, if proven, suggest a major player exploited its position and inside knowledge at the potential expense of millions of retail investors. This Terraform Labs lawsuit could set a powerful legal precedent for how market manipulation is defined and punished in the crypto space, influencing future regulation and exchange practices. What Are the Potential Outcomes of This Legal Battle? The path forward is complex and will be closely watched. First, Jump Trading will vigorously defend against these allegations. The discovery process could unveil private communications and trading data, providing unprecedented insight into the events leading to Terra’s collapse. A ruling in favor of the Terraform Labs estate could lead to massive financial penalties and stricter oversight for market makers. However, a victory for Jump would reinforce the current, often opaque, operational norms in crypto trading. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Accountability This explosive $4 billion Terraform Labs lawsuit is more than a claim for damages. It is a direct challenge to the shadowy operations that can thrive in crypto’s less-regulated corners. The case forces the industry to confront difficult questions about the role of large, influential firms and the true meaning of a free and fair market. Its resolution will undoubtedly leave a lasting mark on the future of cryptocurrency regulation and investor protection. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Terraform Labs suing Jump Trading for? A1: Terraform Labs’ bankruptcy estate is suing for $4 billion, alleging Jump Trading secretly manipulated the price of TerraUSD (UST) for massive profit, which contributed to the ecosystem’s collapse. Q2: How much did Jump Trading allegedly make? A2: The lawsuit claims Jump Trading earned approximately $1 billion in profits from its alleged market-making activities around UST. Q3: What is a “de-pegging” event mentioned in the lawsuit? A3: A de-pegging event is when a stablecoin like UST, which is supposed to maintain a 1:1 value with the US dollar, falls below or rises above that $1 price. Q4: Could this lawsuit affect other crypto companies? A4: Yes. The legal arguments and outcome could set a precedent for defining market manipulation in crypto, potentially affecting how all large trading firms and exchanges operate. Q5: Has Jump Trading responded to the lawsuit? A5: As of the initial filing reported by the Wall Street Journal, Jump Trading has not issued a public statement. A legal defense is expected. Q6: What happens to the money if Terraform Labs wins? A6: Any funds recovered would likely go to the bankruptcy estate to pay back creditors and investors who suffered losses in the Terra/LUNA collapse.

According to Schiff, $DJT constantly invents many things, reflecting that it has no true underlying value. Trump Media and Technology Group Corp (TMTG) was founded by Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss in 2021. On March 26, 2024, TMTG came to the market as a result of a merger with the special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC). The union company was worth $8 billion and began trading under the symbol $DJT. Peter Schiff denounces the financial pivot’s motive DJT began as a social media startup but shifted and became a BTC treasury. $DJT , a company owned by Donald Trump, has little intrinsic value beyond its connection to the President. It began as a social media company, pivoted into a Bitcoin treasury company, and is now merging with a fusion energy company. The constant reinvention makes clear that the… — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 18, 2025 Peter Schiff believes that in the case of $DJT, the transformation of a failed social media platform into a self-assured Bitcoin strategy and a currently merging partner with Fusion Energy proves that the product has never been about the financial underpinnings, but rather about access to political power. In July, $DJT announced that it had amassed approximately $2 billion in bitcoin and assets to track bitcoin as a part of its previously announced bitcoin treasury plan. As reported by Trump Media, the company suffered a net loss of $54.8 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to a $19.3 million loss in the same quarter of 2024, due to an increase in expenses, of which $20.3 million was attributed to legal fees. The third-quarter report showed that revenue fell to $972,900, compared to nearly $1 million in the previous quarter. The stock dropped 61 percent over the year to a share price of $13.10. As of September 30, the company had gained on Bitcoin options worth $15.3 million and owned 11,542 Bitcoins, worth nearly $1.3 billion, which is equivalent to approximately $1.3 billion. Schiff disputes Trump’s claims of a “booming economy.” Peter Schiff warned that U.S. output is “going bust.” He criticized Trump for claiming that the economy was “booming.” Schiff contested the claim. “Donald Trump claims the U.S. has a booming economy. Well, maybe the stock market is booming …the real economy is going bust,” Inflation continues to rise, and every week we learn about more layoffs.” – Peter Schiff , CEO and Chief Global Strategist of Euro Pacific Capital. The S&P 500 has increased by 16% so far this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen by 20%. Schiff stated that the stock market has, in fact, had a great run. Schiff’s concerns about inflation and job losses reflect fundamental economic factors. The U.S. consumer price index rose by 3.0% yearly in September compared to 2.3% in April, when Trump first announced his broad tariffs. In the first 10 months of 2025, companies reported 1,099,500 job cuts, according to a poll. Meanwhile, the news is still dominated by layoff announcements. In reference to the boom of Trump, Schiff called it a fiction and listed the reasons that the economy was going down, including the fact that deficits were exploding. The fiscal year 2025 government expenditure in the U.S. totaled $7.01 trillion, and the government received $5.23 trillion. The 5.23 million led to a deficit of 1.78 trillion. The imbalance has led to the rise in the U.S national debt. The National debt is currently close to $38 5 trillion. According to Schiff, the tract is “completely unsustainable.” He insisted that America’s creditors are getting the same information, which is detrimental to both the dollar and the Americans who hold it. Schiff claimed that foreign creditors of the US are aware that the national debt has reached close to $38.5 trillion. He further claimed that the foreign investors are selling their U.S. dollars and Treasury bonds for this reason. Schiff mentioned that foreign central banks are selling Treasury bonds and purchasing gold instead. Schiff claimed that the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency is about to expire, which will significantly lower living standards in the United States.

The most shocking detail? The vast majority of these crypto liquidations —where exchanges automatically close leveraged positions—hit traders betting on prices going up. This event serves as a stark reminder of the extreme risks in leveraged futures trading. What Are Crypto Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Before we dive into the numbers, let’s clarify a key concept. In perpetual futures trading, you can use leverage to amplify your bets. However, if the market moves against you and your collateral value falls below a certain point, the exchange forcibly closes your position. This is a crypto liquidation . It protects the exchange from loss but can create cascading sell-offs, accelerating price drops. Therefore, understanding these events is crucial for any active trader. The $344M Bloodbath: A Breakdown by Asset The data from the past day paints a clear and painful picture. Long positions—bets that an asset’s price will rise—were overwhelmingly on the wrong side of this move. Here are the key figures that highlight the scale of the crypto liquidations : Bitcoin (BTC): $178 million liquidated, with a staggering 65.59% of those being long positions. Ethereum (ETH): $132 million liquidated, where 58.32% were longs. Solana (SOL): $34.29 million liquidated, with longs making up a massive 82.51% of the total. This pattern shows that a sudden market downturn caught a huge number of optimistic traders off guard, triggering a domino effect of automatic selling. Why Did Longs Account for the Majority of Liquidations? You might wonder why bullish traders suffered so disproportionately. Several factors typically converge in these events. First, a sharp, unexpected price decline can happen due to macroeconomic news or large sell orders. Second, high leverage magnifies losses. A trader using 10x leverage only needs a 10% price move against them to face crypto liquidations . Finally, clustered liquidity at certain price levels means once liquidation begins, it can feed on itself, pushing prices lower and triggering more long liquidations in a vicious cycle. How Can Traders Navigate and Mitigate Liquidation Risk? While crypto liquidations are a market reality, you can take steps to protect your capital. The goal is not to avoid risk entirely, but to manage it intelligently. Use Lower Leverage: Higher leverage offers greater reward but exponentially increases your risk of liquidation. Using 3x-5x instead of 10x or more provides a much larger safety cushion. Set Strategic Stop-Losses: Don’t rely on the exchange’s liquidation price. Set your own stop-loss orders at a level you are comfortable with to exit a trade before a forced closure. Monitor Funding Rates: Extremely high positive funding rates can signal overcrowded long positions, which often precede a squeeze and a wave of long crypto liquidations . Never Over-allocate: Only risk a small percentage of your total portfolio on any single leveraged trade. The Bottom Line: Respect the Power of Leverage The recent $344 million liquidation event is a powerful lesson in market dynamics. It underscores that in volatile crypto markets, leverage is a double-edged sword. While the majority of this pain was felt by longs, the mechanics work both ways. A sharp rally can trigger equally brutal short squeezes. The key takeaway is to trade with caution, manage your risk proactively, and always understand that crypto liquidations are an ever-present danger in the futures market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly triggers a crypto liquidation? A: A liquidation is triggered when the value of your collateral in a leveraged futures position falls below the maintenance margin requirement set by the exchange. The system then automatically closes the position to prevent further loss. Q: Are liquidations always bad for the market? A: They can exacerbate volatility. A wave of long liquidations forces sell orders, pushing prices down further, which can trigger more liquidations in a negative feedback loop. Q: Can I get my money back after a liquidation? A: No. Once your position is liquidated, the loss is realized, and any remaining collateral (if any) is returned to your account. The process is automatic and irreversible. Q: Do liquidations happen on spot trading? A> No. Liquidations are specific to margin and futures trading where you borrow funds (use leverage) to trade. In spot trading, you only lose value if the asset price falls, but your coins are not forcibly sold. Q: Why were Solana (SOL) long liquidations so high at 82.51%?

You must maintain a minimum balance of 444 ASTER tokens across your Aster spot and perpetuals accounts for the entire duration of the RTX listing campaign . Dropping below this balance or transferring tokens to an external wallet will result in immediate disqualification. Therefore, it’s essential to verify your balance before the event starts and monitor it throughout. Once the campaign begins, you can check your eligibility status directly on the official Aster event page. Why Should You Consider Participating?

According to live data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, Bitcoin is currently trading at $86,085.56. This surge isn’t just a number; it represents a powerful wave of optimism washing over the digital asset landscape. But what’s fueling this impressive climb? Let’s dive into the factors behind Bitcoin’s latest price action and explore what it could signal for the future. What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Rally? Several converging factors are likely contributing to Bitcoin’s strong performance. First, institutional adoption continues to grow, with major financial firms increasing their exposure to digital assets. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often lead investors to seek alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Furthermore, positive regulatory developments in key markets can provide the clarity and confidence needed for significant capital inflows. This perfect storm of sentiment and fundamentals is creating a powerful tailwind for the BTC price . Is This a Sustainable Move for Bitcoin? While breaking $86,000 is a bullish signal, investors naturally wonder about sustainability. Key metrics to watch include trading volume and market depth. A rally supported by high, genuine volume is more robust than one driven by thin order books. Additionally, the behavior of Bitcoin in relation to traditional markets provides clues. If it continues to demonstrate a decoupling or acts as a hedge during stock market volatility, the case for a sustained higher BTC price floor strengthens. However, the market remains volatile, and prudent risk management is essential. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors This price movement offers valuable lessons and reminders for everyone in the crypto space. Volatility is Inherent: Sharp moves are standard in cryptocurrency markets. This rally highlights both the potential and the risk. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on price headlines. Understand the underlying technology and market drivers. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For long-term investors, a consistent investment strategy can help navigate unpredictable price swings. Secure Your Assets: As values rise, ensuring your Bitcoin is stored in a secure, non-custodial wallet becomes even more critical. What Does the Future Hold for BTC Price Action? Predicting the exact future BTC price is impossible, but we can analyze the trajectory. The breakthrough past $86,000 sets a new psychological resistance level that could now turn into support. The market’s focus will shift to the next key thresholds. Continued development on the Bitcoin network, such as Layer-2 scaling solutions, also enhances its utility and long-term value proposition. Therefore, while short-term corrections are always possible, the fundamental narrative for Bitcoin appears resilient. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s surge above $86,000 is a significant event that underscores its growing prominence in the global financial system. This isn’t just about a number on a screen; it’s a testament to increasing adoption, evolving market structures, and shifting investor sentiment. The journey reminds us of cryptocurrency’s dynamic nature, offering immense opportunities alongside its inherent volatility. Staying informed, disciplined, and focused on long-term fundamentals is the key to navigating this exciting landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why did Bitcoin’s price jump above $86,000? A: The rally is likely due to a combination of increased institutional buying, positive market sentiment, and Bitcoin’s perceived role as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Q: Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price is so high? A: Investment decisions should be based on your financial goals and risk tolerance, not just current price. Many investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging to invest consistently over time, regardless of price fluctuations. Q: Could the BTC price drop back down quickly? A> Yes, cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. While the trend is currently positive, prices can experience sharp corrections. It’s important to only invest what you can afford to lose. Q: Where is the safest place to buy and hold Bitcoin? A> Reputable, regulated exchanges are good for purchasing. For long-term holding, consider moving your Bitcoin to a private, non-custodial hardware wallet for maximum security. Q: How does this price affect other cryptocurrencies? A> Bitcoin often sets the trend for the broader crypto market. A strong BTC price can lead to increased investor confidence and capital flowing into other digital assets, a phenomenon known as “altcoin season.” Q: What’s the next major price target for Bitcoin? A> Analysts often watch round numbers as psychological barriers. Following $86,000, markets may look toward the $90,000 or even $100,000 levels, but this depends entirely on ongoing market dynamics.

The exchange is challenging their authority to regulate prediction markets, setting the stage for a pivotal conflict between state power and federal oversight. This lawsuit isn’t just about legal technicalities—it’s about who gets to control the emerging world of decentralized finance. Why is Coinbase suing over prediction markets? Coinbase filed lawsuits against Connecticut, Michigan, and Illinois because these states attempted to regulate prediction markets under existing gambling laws. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, made the company’s position clear on social media platform X. He argued that state governments are overstepping their authority by treating these innovative financial tools as casino games rather than legitimate markets. The core issue revolves around jurisdiction. Grewal asserts that prediction markets fall exclusively under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) regulatory umbrella. This federal agency oversees derivatives markets, including futures and options. Therefore, state gaming commissions should have no say in how these markets operate or who can participate in them. What exactly are prediction markets in crypto? Prediction markets allow users to trade contracts based on the outcome of future events. Think of them as financial instruments that let you bet on real-world occurrences using cryptocurrency. For example, you might purchase a contract predicting that a certain candidate will win an election, or that a company’s stock will reach a specific price by a certain date. These markets serve several important functions: Price discovery : They aggregate information from many participants to forecast probabilities Risk management : They allow hedging against various outcomes Information aggregation : They create collective intelligence about future events Innovation testing : They provide data about emerging trends and technologies Unlike traditional gambling, where outcomes are purely games of chance, prediction markets often involve skill, research, and analysis of real-world information. The legal battle over prediction markets jurisdiction This lawsuit represents more than just a regulatory dispute—it’s a fundamental question about how America regulates emerging technologies. Coinbase’s argument rests on the Commodity Exchange Act, which gives the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over futures contracts and similar instruments. The states’ position, however, focuses on consumer protection. They argue that prediction markets resemble gambling because participants risk money on uncertain outcomes. State regulators worry about addiction, fraud, and financial harm to vulnerable populations. This creates a classic tension between innovation and protection that courts must now resolve. Historical context matters here. Similar battles occurred when online poker emerged, with courts struggling to apply old gambling laws to new technologies. The outcome of this case could establish precedent affecting not just prediction markets, but potentially other crypto innovations waiting in the wings. What’s at stake for crypto innovation? The implications extend far beyond Coinbase’s immediate legal concerns. If states prevail, innovation could suffer significantly. Companies might hesitate to develop new financial products knowing that 50 different state regulators could impose conflicting rules. This fragmentation would create compliance nightmares and likely push innovation offshore to more welcoming jurisdictions. Conversely, if Coinbase wins, it could accelerate development in several areas: Decentralized prediction platforms could flourish without state interference New financial instruments based on event outcomes might emerge Research and forecasting tools could become more sophisticated Mainstream adoption of crypto for practical purposes beyond speculation The outcome will signal whether America embraces or resists financial innovation in the digital age. How will this affect everyday crypto users? For regular cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, this legal battle has practical implications. If states regulate prediction markets as gambling, you might face: Geographic restrictions : Services could block users from certain states Additional compliance : More identity verification and reporting requirements Limited access : Fewer platforms willing to offer these services in the U.S. Higher costs : Compliance expenses passed on to users However, if federal jurisdiction prevails, you’ll likely see more innovation, better products, and clearer rules. The CFTC’s approach would probably focus on market integrity and anti-fraud measures rather than treating participants as gamblers needing protection from themselves. The path forward for prediction markets regulation This lawsuit will likely take months or years to resolve, possibly reaching appellate courts or even the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, several developments could influence the outcome: First, Congress might intervene with new legislation specifically addressing prediction markets and similar crypto innovations. Second, the CFTC could issue clearer guidance about its jurisdiction. Third, other states might join the lawsuit or pass their own laws, creating even more legal complexity. The most probable scenario involves a negotiated settlement where states agree to defer to federal authority in exchange for certain consumer protections. However, given the strong positions on both sides, a definitive court ruling seems increasingly likely. Conclusion: A defining moment for crypto’s future Coinbase’s lawsuit represents a crucial test for cryptocurrency regulation in America. The outcome will determine whether innovative financial tools can develop under coherent federal rules or get bogged down in contradictory state regulations. This isn’t just about prediction markets—it’s about whether America can create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation while protecting consumers. The battle lines are drawn between state consumer protection concerns and federal market oversight priorities. Whichever side prevails will shape the next decade of financial innovation. For crypto enthusiasts, this legal drama deserves close attention because its resolution will either open doors to new possibilities or reinforce existing barriers. Frequently Asked Questions What are prediction markets in simple terms? Prediction markets are platforms where people can buy and sell contracts based on whether specific future events will happen. They use crowd wisdom to forecast probabilities, similar to how stock markets reflect collective opinions about company values. Why do states want to regulate them as gambling? States see prediction markets as gambling because participants risk money on uncertain outcomes. Traditional gambling laws are designed to prevent addiction, fraud, and financial harm, so states apply these existing frameworks to new technologies. What authority does the CFTC have over prediction markets? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates futures, options, and derivatives markets in the United States. Since prediction markets involve contracts based on future events, the CFTC claims they fall under its jurisdiction rather than state gambling commissions. How could this lawsuit affect other crypto services? The legal precedent could extend beyond prediction markets to other innovative crypto products. If states gain authority here, they might try to regulate decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, or other services under gambling or money transmission laws. What happens if Coinbase loses the lawsuit? If Coinbase loses, prediction markets might become unavailable in Connecticut, Michigan, and Illinois. Other states might follow with similar restrictions, potentially leading to a patchwork of regulations that makes offering these services nationally very difficult. Can I currently use prediction markets on Coinbase? As of this writing, Coinbase hasn’t launched prediction market services in the United States due to regulatory uncertainty. The lawsuit aims to clear this uncertainty so they can potentially offer these services in the future. Found this analysis helpful?

This historic pivot from its long-standing ultra-loose policy sends powerful ripples across global markets, including the cryptocurrency landscape. For investors worldwide, understanding the implications of this Bank of Japan interest rate decision is now more crucial than ever. What Did the Bank of Japan Just Do? The Bank of Japan increased its key policy rate by 25 basis points, moving it from 0.5% to 0.75%. This seemingly small adjustment carries immense symbolic weight. It represents the highest level for the rate since 1995, effectively closing a chapter on Japan’s decades-long battle with deflation and stagnant growth. This hike is the latest step in a carefully orchestrated normalization process. The journey began in March of last year when the central bank ended its groundbreaking 17-year negative interest rate policy with an initial increase to 0.1%. Gradual hikes followed, reaching 0.25% in July and 0.5% in January, culminating in this latest move to 0.75%. Why Is This Bank of Japan Interest Rate Hike So Significant? For years, Japan stood alone among major economies with its negative rates and aggressive monetary easing. This policy was a cornerstone of global liquidity. Therefore, its reversal is a seismic event. Let’s break down the key reasons this matters. End of an Era: It signals a definitive shift away from crisis-era stimulus policies that have defined global finance since 2008. Global Liquidity Shift: As Japanese yields rise, it may encourage capital to flow back into yen-denominated assets, potentially reducing liquidity in riskier global markets. Currency Market Volatility: A stronger yen can impact global trade dynamics and currency pairs, creating new winners and losers. How Could This Impact Cryptocurrency Markets? Cryptocurrency markets are deeply interconnected with global macro trends. A rising Bank of Japan interest rate influences this ecosystem in several direct and indirect ways. First, tighter monetary policy in Japan could reduce the “carry trade” liquidity that has often found its way into high-risk, high-return assets like crypto. Second, a stronger yen might pressure dollar strength, which historically has an inverse relationship with Bitcoin’s price. However, cryptocurrencies could also act as a hedge against the currency volatility this shift may trigger. For savvy investors, this environment underscores the importance of diversification and understanding macro drivers. It’s no longer enough to watch the Federal Reserve; the Bank of Japan interest rate decision is now a critical piece of the puzzle. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? This policy normalization is not without risks. The Bank of Japan must walk a tightrope. Raising rates too quickly could stifle Japan’s fragile economic recovery and trigger market instability. Moving too slowly, however, risks falling behind inflation and weakening the yen excessively. For global investors, this creates both challenges and opportunities. The challenge lies in navigating increased market correlation and volatility. The opportunity exists in identifying assets that benefit from a stronger yen or those that are resilient to shifting liquidity conditions. Cryptocurrencies, with their non-traditional correlation patterns, may offer unique strategic advantages in this new landscape. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Global Finance The Bank of Japan’s decision to lift its key rate to a 30-year high is more than a routine policy tweak; it is a historic turning point. It closes the book on an unprecedented period of monetary experimentation and opens a new, uncertain chapter for global markets. For cryptocurrency participants, this reinforces that digital assets do not exist in a vacuum. They are part of a complex, interconnected financial world where a Bank of Japan interest rate change can echo from Tokyo to the blockchain. Staying informed and adaptable is the ultimate key to navigating this evolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Bank of Japan’s key interest rate now? The Bank of Japan’s key policy rate is now 0.75%, following a 25 basis point increase from 0.5%. Why is this rate hike considered historic? This hike brings the rate to its highest level since 1995, marking a decisive end to the ultra-loose monetary policy that has defined Japan’s economy for decades. How does this affect the average cryptocurrency investor? It may influence global market liquidity and risk appetite. Tighter policy in Japan could reduce the flow of “cheap” money into risk assets, potentially increasing volatility across all markets, including crypto. Will the Bank of Japan continue to raise rates? The central bank has indicated a gradual, data-dependent approach. Future hikes are likely, but their pace will depend on inflation trends and economic growth. What does a stronger yen mean for Bitcoin? Historically, Bitcoin has an inverse relationship with the US Dollar Index (DXY). A stronger yen could contribute to dollar weakness, which has sometimes been a supportive factor for Bitcoin’s price, though this relationship is complex and not always consistent.

Bitcoin & Ethereum Funding Rates Are Showing Opposite Values In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about how the Funding Rate has developed for Bitcoin and Ethereum amid the latest market volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Slide To $2,000 If December Closes Below This Level: Analyst Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies saw some sudden price swings during the past day, with BTC’s price first rallying to $90,300 in a blink, but then crashing back toward $86,000 just as quickly. The coin’s decline later extended to $85,300. While BTC returned to about the same levels as before the flash surge, the same wasn’t true about Ethereum. After its rally to $3,000, ETH plummeted to $2,830, before another leg down to about $2,790. Before the volatility storm, the cryptocurrency was trading around $2,920. The difference in price action could be a potential factor behind the divergence that has formed in the derivatives market sentiment as gauged by the Funding Rate. The Funding Rate keeps track of the periodic amount of fees that derivatives traders are paying on all centralized exchanges. A positive value on the indicator is a sign that long investors are paying the short ones, while a negative one implies bearish positions outweigh the bullish ones. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the Funding Rate has changed for Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Funding Rate has been positive for the last few days, indicating that a bullish mentality has been dominant among the traders. This sentiment has been maintained even after the price volatility. Ethereum was also observing a positive value on the Funding Rate prior to the volatility, but unlike for BTC, the trend didn’t last. Since ETH has gone through its quick surge and flash crash, the indicator has turned red, a sign that shorts have started outpacing longs. The fact that bullish sentiment around ETH has weakened, however, may not actually be negative. According to Santiment, highly leveraged long positions have historically led to sharp liquidation events and volatility. This trend was also seen during some recent tops and pullbacks. Thus, considering that the Funding Rate is negative for Ethereum now, the risk of volatility may be lower. That said, Bitcoin’s long-heavy market could still be relevant for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be Sub-$50,000 By 2028 Without Quantum Fix, Warns Capriole Founder As Santiment explains, “all assets will still move with Bitcoin, meaning Bitcoin’s funding rates must stay neutral or go negative in order to justify a clear path back to $100K and for altcoins to rebound.” BTC Price Bitcoin has recovered back to $87,100 following its plunge on Wednesday.

They made this statement at a time when quantum computing is shifting from being a distant concept to a crucial matter this year. Notably, the developers’ efforts aim to prepare the ecosystem for a future that today’s technology cannot guarantee. This announcement followed the Solana Foundation’s release of a statement, in which it announced its partnership with Project Eleven , a tech company specializing in post-quantum security for blockchain. According to the organization, this collaboration aims to determine whether the cryptographic systems established in Solana can withstand the threat of future quantum computers. Several analysts commented on this move. They highlighted that there are heightened worries in the crypto industry regarding these advancements in quantum computing. According to them, individuals believe that there is a high likelihood that these advancements could threaten the safeguard methods blockchains apply to transactions and validators. The Solana Foundation partners with Project Eleven to strengthen its blockchains In an X post , the Solana Foundation stated that, “Quantum computers aren’t here yet, but the Solana Foundation is getting ready for that possibility.” According to the organization, they decided to partner with Project Eleven to assess their readiness for any potential quantum threats and assist with this move. Following this collaboration, reports highlighted that several developers from different blockchains, who like to strengthen their blockchains, ignited debates regarding how their networks can effectively address the dangers caused by quantum computing. In the meantime, the Solana Foundation has made its intentions clear, which are first to introduce post-quantum digital signatures on a test network. Regarding this decision, reports inquired why the organization chose Project Eleven for the plan. Respondingly, the Solana Foundation highlighted that apart from the tech firm primarily focusing on evaluating the risk to Bitcoin, it also carried out an assessment and established a testnet on Solana that utilizes digital signatures developed to be shielded against quantum computers. Sources close to the situation mentioned that this testnet was designed to determine whether transactions that can withstand quantum attacks can operate effectively at the network level with existing technology without causing interruptions. Matt Sorg, Vice President of Technology at the Solana Foundation, commented on the topic of discussion. He claimed that their duty is to ensure Solana remains protected from now on. To illustrate this commitment to protect the blockchain, reports mentioned that recent efforts by Solana developers are built on previous attempts to mitigate the dangers related to quantum computing. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the network successfully introduced an optional wallet feature, known as the Solana Winternitz Vault, in January of this year. The feature utilizes a hash-based signature system designed to protect user funds. This system develops new cryptographic keys intended for each transaction. It also permits users to freely decide if they want to use it rather than changing the protocol itself. “The culture of innovation in the Solana ecosystem will keep going with the launch of a second client and advanced consensus mechanism this year,” Sorg stated. “Initiatives like Project Eleven are important early steps to enhance the network’s strength and maintain Solana’s resilience over time.” Aptos follows Solana’s lead Apart from Solana, other blockchain networks have also reported getting ready to face similar challenges. An example of these networks is Aptos. On the blockchain network, a suggestion known as AIP-137 was submitted. This suggestion aims to launch the network’s first post-quantum signature option, pending approval by token holders. Sources familiar with the situation told reporters that this proposal would further strengthen SLH-DSA. This stateless, hash-based digital signature method is popular among researchers at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. Interestingly, Aptos Labs claimed that once this suggestion is approved, it will not need a full network migration. Following this claim, sources noted that the Ed25519 scheme, which currently manages transaction verification on Aptos, would still be considered the key signature method. For SLH-DSA, they noted that it would be made available as an optional account type, particularly for users seeking post-quantum security. Get seen where it counts.
