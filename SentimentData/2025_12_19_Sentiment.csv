56006672,646680,1766098844,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56006672.jpeg,Mixed Signals for XRP as Price Weakness Collides With Bold Analyst Targets,https://bitcoinist.com/mixed-signals-xrp-as-price-weakness-analyst-target/,"XRP is closing out 2025 caught between two opposing forces. On one side, price action has weakened, technical indicators are flashing caution, and liquidity has thinned as the holidays approach. On the other hand, analysts continue to publish ambitious upside targets, while fresh narratives around utility, adoption, and yield generation keep the token in focus. The result is a market struggling to reconcile near-term pressure with longer-term expectations. After spending much of the year underperforming other large-cap cryptocurrencies, XRP has slipped below the closely watched $2 level. That breakdown has sharpened debate over whether the market is entering a deeper correction or simply extending a prolonged consolidation phase. XRP Price Structure Shows Growing Strain Technical analysts point to mounting downside risks. XRP has formed what some describe as a higher-timeframe double-top near the $3.30–$3.40 region, with momentum indicators rolling over. The $1.85–$1.90 zone is now acting as a critical support area. A confirmed break below that range could expose XRP to a deeper pullback toward the $1.60–$1.65 region, aligning with key Fibonacci retracement levels. Additional on-chain metrics add to the cautious tone. XRP continues to trade well above its realized price, a condition that in previous cycles has preceded mean-reversion pullbacks. Meanwhile, moving averages and momentum indicators, such as the MACD, remain tilted to the downside, reinforcing the view that sellers retain control in the short term. Analysts Split Between Caution and Optimism Despite the weak chart structure, some analysts argue that the broader narrative has not changed materially. Vincent Van Code has noted that while XRP’s price performance disappointed in 2025, there has been no clear fundamental shock to explain the decline. Legal clarity around Ripple, ongoing institutional interest, and XRPL development remain intact, suggesting the disconnect may be driven more by market structure and liquidity than by fundamentals. Others are more explicit with upside targets. Analyst Dark Defender , who previously identified the $1.88 support zone, argues that XRP has completed a corrective phase under Elliott Wave analysis. From that perspective, targets around $5.85 remain possible in the next major advance, though timing depends heavily on broader market conditions. Utility Narratives and Speculation Add Noise Beyond price charts, new narratives are complicating sentiment. Reports highlighting XRP-based yield strategies, including mining-related platforms, have circulated widely; however, these claims vary in transparency and risk, and are not directly tied to XRP’s core protocol. Separately, unconfirmed rumors suggesting that EA Sports may explore XRP for in-game payments have briefly reignited discussion around mass adoption, even as no official confirmation has emerged. XRP currently sits at an uncomfortable crossroads. Technical pressure is real, downside risks remain, and patience is being tested. At the same time, bold analyst targets and recurring adoption stories ensure the token remains one of the most closely watched assets heading into early 2026.

He said the faster team will take Americans back to the lunar surface for the first time in more than fifty years. He made the point during a Bloomberg TV interview on his first day, right after meeting President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. He said both companies understood the rule clearly and that the one that finishes first will carry US astronauts under the Artemis program. Isaacman juggling SpaceX, Blue Origin and delays at NASA SpaceX and Blue Origin already have contracts with NASA to develop their lunar landers. SpaceX holds more than $4 billion in NASA deals to move astronauts to the moon using its Starship spacecraft. That plan, at least for now, puts SpaceX in the lead. But this advantage is not locked in, because NASA’s former acting administrator Sean Duffy announced in October that the agency would “open up” the SpaceX contract to competition. He said he grew frustrated by delays in Starship’s timeline. Starship has hit several technical issues over the past year.Those setbacks have drawn critics who say the slow pace could allow China to land its astronauts on the moon before the United States. Jared made it clear that whichever lander becomes available first will be the one NASA uses to push forward the Artemis mission. Jared also founded Shift4 Payments Inc., and he becomes NASA’s leader at a time when the agency faces funding questions tied to proposals from both Congress and the White House. He pushed back on concerns and said NASA can work with either a $20 billion or $25 billion yearly budget, and that both numbers are meaningful enough to carry out the agency’s plans. Trump signs executive order for Artemis 2028 project Jared said Trump approved a new executive order during their meeting. The order restates the core of the Artemis program and tells NASA to return astronauts to the moon by 2028 and build a lunar base by 2030. Jared told Bloomberg that the order “takes things to a whole other scale.” He said NASA is not returning to the moon only to leave footprints. He said the goal is long-term infrastructure that supports science, economic activity, and national security interests. The order does more than that.It directs the government to remove the National Space Council and move its authority to the Office of Science and Technology Policy.That council was set up in 1989 to advise presidents on space policy. The order also launches work on next-generation missile-defense systems under Trump’s Golden Dome plan, which calls for new tools to find and track threats from low-Earth orbit to cislunar space. Artemis relies on Boeing’s Space Launch System and Lockheed Martin’s Orion capsule. The program is expected to cost $93 billion by 2025 and so far has flown only one mission. NASA has delayed the first Artemis landing several times, most recently pushing the target year to 2027. In July, Congress approved almost $10 billion for Artemis as part of Trump’s major tax and spending package. The money supports the fourth and fifth SLS flights that the administration once considered cutting in favor of cheaper commercial options.

XRP has not been immune to these conditions, as heightened volatility and broader macroeconomic pressures have weighed on prices. Despite this environment, several market observers argue that sharp intraday swings point to structural issues rather than purely organic trading activity. While price declines have unsettled many participants, others interpret the turbulence as a tactical opportunity. Within the XRP community, certain commentators maintain that abrupt moves are being driven by large players seeking to exploit leverage and liquidity, and that patient accumulation during these periods could be advantageous. Indicators Fueling Manipulation Claims Concerns around market conduct were amplified by observations shared by The Kobeissi Letter, a platform that monitors global capital markets. You can’t make this up: Bitcoin just surged +$3,000 in 1 hour and reclaimed $90,000 as $120 million worth of levered shorts were liquidated. Minutes later, $200 million worth of levered longs were liquidated, with Bitcoin now down to $86,000. That’s a $140 BILLION swing in… pic.twitter.com/R1KLZq6iqs — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 17, 2025 The group highlighted an unusual episode involving Bitcoin, where the asset recorded a rapid increase of roughly $3,000 within a single hour on December 17. During that window, Bitcoin moved from the high-$80,000 range to briefly trade above $90,000. This sudden advance triggered significant liquidations among traders positioned for downside movement, with losses estimated at over $120 million. Shortly after these positions were cleared, Bitcoin reversed direction and retreated sharply toward the mid-$80,000 range. According to The Kobeissi Letter, the entire sequence resulted in a dramatic swing in Bitcoin’s market capitalization, estimated at approximately $140 billion within two hours. Observers noted that such an abrupt expansion and contraction in valuation raised questions about whether the move was engineered to force liquidations, rather than reflecting a shift in long-term market sentiment. The scale of the fluctuation drew particular attention, as it exceeded the entire market capitalization of several major altcoins. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Impact on XRP Price Action The turbulence in Bitcoin markets quickly spread to other digital assets, including XRP. Although XRP’s market capitalization is significantly smaller, it still experienced notable volatility during the same timeframe. XRP rose from around $1.90 to nearly $2.00 within two hours before reversing course and falling below $1.90 shortly thereafter. This sequence translated into billions of dollars added to XRP’s valuation in a brief period, followed by an even larger contraction. Such rapid changes reinforced claims that liquidity-driven strategies employed by large trading entities may be influencing price behavior across multiple assets, not just Bitcoin. Some market participants referenced previous downturns as evidence of similar dynamics, arguing that sharp corrections have often coincided with periods of elevated leverage and thin order books. These episodes, they contend, tend to disadvantage retail traders while benefiting institutions capable of moving substantial capital. Community Response and Accumulation Strategy Against this backdrop, prominent XRP commentator Digital Asset Investor expressed a willingness to continue increasing his holdings during price weakness. He suggested that repeated volatility episodes reflect strategic actions by institutional players and indicated that he intends to take advantage of lower prices rather than reduce exposure. This perspective aligns with comments from other analysts who have previously encouraged accumulation during downturns. In recent months, several market watchers have stated that retracements below key psychological levels could offer renewed entry points for long-term investors who missed earlier opportunities. As of the latest data, XRP trades near the lower end of recent ranges, a development that some interpret as validating these earlier expectations. Nevertheless, analysts continue to emphasize that such views represent personal opinions rather than guarantees of future performance. While allegations of market manipulation remain unproven, the recent sequence of rapid price movements has intensified debate around trading practices in the crypto market. For certain XRP proponents, these conditions reinforce a long-term accumulation approach, even as uncertainty persists across the broader financial landscape.

Meta wants both models in the first half of 2026, according to Alexandr Wang, the company’s chief AI officer, during an internal Q&A with Chris Cox. Alexandr also said Meta is starting work on early world models, which means AI systems that learn by taking in visual data from their environment. Meta changed its whole AI structure in the summer.The company hired Alexandr to run a division called Meta Superintelligence Labs. Zuck then went on a hiring spree and grabbed more than twenty researchers from OpenAI. He built a group of over fifty people with deep AI skills. Meta is trying to load up on specialists because image generation is now one of the main battlegrounds between big model companies. Google and OpenAI models are going to be tough to compete with Meta released a video generator called Vibes in September. The tool was made with Midjourney. A few days later, OpenAI rolled out its own product, Sora, to keep up. The back-and-forth showed how fast each company reacts. Google had already kicked off another wave earlier in the year with Nano Banana, which boosted monthly users of Gemini from 450 million in July to more than 650 million by late October. That jump placed even more pressure on the other players. The tension rose again in November when Google launched the third version of Gemini.Right after that, people inside OpenAI said Sam Altman declared a “code red” to push the company to win back top scores on model tests.OpenAI then released a new version of ChatGPT Images. Sam later met journalists and said image creation is now one of the biggest reasons users return to AI apps, calling it a “sticky” feature. The message was clear: the image fight is not slowing down. Google announced Gemini 3 Flash on Wednesday. The model is built to run faster and at lower cost, and it is meant for wide use. It carries many of the reasoning skills found in Gemini 3 Pro but in a smaller system. The whole plan is simple. Instead of keeping the best tools locked behind enterprise plans, Google wants these models inside mass-market apps. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said, “With this release, Gemini 3’s next-generation intelligence is now rolling out to everyone across our products including Gemini app + AI Mode in Search. Devs can build with it in the Gemini API, Google AI Studio, Gemini CLI, and Google Antigravity and enterprises can get it in Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Tech|Meta,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-18 23:54:43

The news that Synthetix returns to Ethereum mainnet marks a pivotal moment, suggesting that the foundational blockchain has overcome its past struggles and is ready to reclaim its throne for high-performance financial applications. Let’s explore what this homecoming means for traders, the DeFi ecosystem, and the future of on-chain derivatives. Why is Synthetix Returning to Ethereum Now? For years, the narrative around Ethereum centered on high gas fees and network congestion, pushing many DeFi projects to seek alternatives. Synthetix, a leader in derivatives trading, was no exception. However, the landscape has transformed. According to the project’s founder, the extreme congestion that once plagued Ethereum has been “significantly resolved.” This isn’t just about lower fees; it’s about proven capacity. The founder emphasized that Ethereum now possesses the robust infrastructure needed to support the complex, high-volume world of synthetic assets reliably. What Does This Mean for DeFi and Derivatives Trading? The decision for Synthetix returns to Ethereum mainnet is a powerful vote of confidence. It tells us that after a period of exploration across various Layer 2 and alternative networks, core financial innovation is recentering on Ethereum’s unparalleled security and liquidity. For users, this consolidation offers significant benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: Unifying activity on the mainnet pools liquidity, potentially leading to better prices and tighter spreads for synthetic asset traders. Simplified User Experience: No more bridging assets between chains. Users can interact with Synthetix directly within the vast Ethereum ecosystem. Stronger Security: Ethereum mainnet remains the most secure and battle-tested environment for managing valuable financial contracts. This move could trigger a domino effect, encouraging other DeFi derivatives platforms to reaffirm their commitment to the Ethereum base layer. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the return is a cause for optimism, it doesn’t mean the journey is without its watchpoints. The success of this move hinges on Ethereum’s ability to maintain its improved performance as adoption grows. Furthermore, Synthetix must successfully reintegrate its sophisticated system, ensuring a seamless experience for stakers (SNX holders) and traders alike. However, the opportunities are immense. A high-performance Synthetix on Ethereum mainnet could act as a catalyst, attracting more institutional interest in on-chain derivatives. It solidifies Ethereum’s position not just as a settlement layer, but as a live, functioning global financial marketplace. Conclusion: A New Chapter for On-Chain Finance The announcement that Synthetix returns to Ethereum mainnet is more than a technical migration; it’s a symbolic homecoming. It underscores Ethereum’s remarkable evolution and resilience. For the DeFi community, it represents a maturation—a move towards consolidating innovation on the most secure and liquid foundation available. This strategic pivot by a leading protocol could very well mark the beginning of a new, more unified and powerful era for decentralized derivatives trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is Synthetix? A: Synthetix is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to mint and trade synthetic assets (synths). These synths track the value of real-world assets like currencies, commodities, and cryptocurrencies, all on the blockchain. Q: Why did Synthetix leave Ethereum in the first place? A: Primarily due to high transaction fees (gas costs) and network congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, which made frequent trading and interactions prohibitively expensive for users. Q: What has changed on Ethereum to allow this return? A: Key upgrades, particularly “The Merge” to Proof-of-Stake and the implementation of proto-danksharding (EIP-4844), have significantly improved network capacity and reduced base transaction costs, resolving much of the prior congestion. Q: Will my SNX tokens or synths be affected? A: The protocol will manage the migration. Users should follow official Synthetix announcements for specific instructions, but typically, such returns are designed to be smooth for token holders. Q: Is this good for the price of SNX? A> While price predictions are uncertain, the return to Ethereum mainnet is fundamentally positive. It could increase protocol usage, attract more liquidity, and strengthen SNX’s value proposition within the core DeFi ecosystem. Q: Does this mean Synthetix is abandoning other chains like Optimism? A> Not necessarily. Many protocols operate a multi-chain strategy. The return to mainnet likely means Ethereum will host the primary, canonical version, while Layer 2 solutions may still be used for specific scaling or experimental features.

Since early October, declining investor sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty have weighed heavily on cryptocurrencies, with the total market capitalization falling by more than $1.3 trillion during this period. XRP has followed this trend, giving up tens of billions of dollars in market value as selling pressure intensified. After managing to stay above the psychologically important $2 level for much of the decline, XRP eventually slipped below that support in mid-December. The loss of this level accelerated downside movement and reinforced bearish sentiment. Despite this, some market analysts argue that the current structure does not necessarily signal long-term weakness. Instead, they believe XRP may be entering a phase that has historically preceded strong recoveries. Every cycle, when $XRP breaks below the 50-week SMA and stays there for roughly 50–84 days, a strong rally has followed. History: – 2017: 70 days below → +211% – 2021: 49 days below → +70% – 2024: 84 days below → +850% – Now: 70 days below the 50-week SMA Right now, XRP… pic.twitter.com/Ii5ewdZjQu — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 17, 2025 XRP’s Position Relative to the 50-Week Moving Average According to market analyst Steph, XRP’s recent behavior around the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) deserves close attention. This indicator is widely used to assess long-term market trends. XRP has now spent several consecutive weeks trading below this level, a condition that typically reflects sustained selling pressure. However, historical chart data suggests that extended periods beneath the 50-week SMA have often been followed by sharp upward moves. Steph’s analysis indicates that XRP has previously remained below this moving average for periods ranging from roughly 50 to 84 days before staging notable recoveries. These past instances form the basis of current speculation that XRP may again be approaching a turning point. Historical Precedents Since 2018 Weekly price data shows that this setup has appeared multiple times over the past several years. Following XRP’s major decline from its early 2018 peak, the asset spent several weeks trading below the 50-week SMA during the middle of that year. After establishing a low during that period, XRP later recorded a substantial rebound within a few months. A comparable pattern emerged again toward the end of 2021. XRP dropped below the same long-term average and remained there for several weeks before recovering in early 2022. While the resulting price increase was more modest than in 2018, it still represented a meaningful recovery from the local low. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 More recently, a similar structure was developed in 2024. XRP fell below the 50-week SMA and stayed under it for nearly three months. When prices eventually recovered, the rally that followed was significantly stronger than previous instances, pushing XRP to new cycle highs. This episode has become a key reference point for analysts assessing the current market phase. Assessing the Current Setup As of now, XRP has been trading below the 50-week SMA for approximately 10 consecutive weekly candles, equating to just over two months. If the duration aligns with prior cases, analysts suggest the asset could remain under pressure for several more weeks before a clearer trend reversal emerges. Some projections estimate that matching the longest historical duration would extend this phase toward the end of the year. Based on prior percentage gains, speculative price targets vary widely. Analysts emphasize that these figures are theoretical and depend heavily on market conditions, liquidity, and broader investor sentiment. Even so, the repetition of similar technical structures continues to attract attention from long-term traders. Additional technical indicators have also entered the discussion. Analyst Chart Nerd has noted that momentum tools such as the Relative Strength Index and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence suggest selling pressure may be easing. These signals are often associated with stabilization phases, though they do not guarantee immediate price appreciation. While XRP remains under technical strain, historical data show that comparable periods of weakness have previously preceded strong recoveries. Analysts caution that past performance does not ensure future results, but the recurring interaction with the 50-week SMA remains a focal point for market participants monitoring XRP’s next major move.

56008517,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=867974,1766102415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56008517.jpeg,Legendary Bitcoin OG Deepens Ethereum Bet Despite Losses Exceeding $70 Million,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/legendary-bitcoin-og-deepens-ethereum-bet-despite-losses-exceeding-70-million/,"Ethereum is facing renewed selling pressure as the broader market struggles with fear, uncertainty, and growing bearish expectations. After weeks of weakness, many analysts are now openly calling for a prolonged bear market stretching into 2026, arguing that Ethereum remains below key structural levels and lacks strong momentum. Related Reading: From Cycles To Continuity: Why Bitcoin’s 4-Year Pattern May Be Breaking Bulls are attempting to defend the $2,800 mark, a level that has become critical for maintaining short-term confidence, but price action continues to reflect hesitation rather than conviction. Volatility remains elevated, and market sentiment is dominated by caution rather than optimism. Against this fragile backdrop, on-chain data reveals a notable divergence between price action and behavior from experienced market participants. According to data from Hyperdash, the Bitcoin OG, known for shorting the market during the October 10 crash, has once again increased his exposure to Ethereum. This trader, widely followed for his high-conviction and well-timed positioning, just added another 12,406 ETH to his long positions, signaling confidence at current price levels despite the prevailing bearish narrative. While retail sentiment weakens and analysts debate deeper downside scenarios, strategic accumulation by seasoned players suggests that Ethereum may be approaching a decisive phase. Whether this marks early positioning ahead of a recovery or a high-risk bet in a deteriorating market remains the key question ahead. A High-Conviction Bet Under Pressure Lookonchain reports that the Bitcoin OG continues to hold substantial, high-conviction positions across multiple assets, despite the ongoing market weakness. According to the latest data, his current exposure includes 203,341 ETH valued at approximately $577.5 million, 1,000 BTC worth around $87 million, and 250,000 SOL valued near $30.7 million. This level of concentration highlights a willingness to endure significant volatility rather than reduce risk in an increasingly uncertain environment. That conviction, however, has come with meaningful drawdowns. The wallet is now down more than $70 million from its peak. At one point, unrealized profits exceeded $120 million, but recent price declines have reduced that figure to less than $30 million. The swing illustrates how quickly market conditions can shift, even for traders with a strong track record and well-timed entries in the past. From a broader market perspective, this positioning reflects a sharp contrast between sentiment and behavior. While many participants have turned defensive and analysts debate the likelihood of a prolonged bear market, this wallet remains heavily exposed, suggesting a belief that current levels may still offer asymmetric upside. At the same time, the drawdown serves as a clear reminder that size and conviction do not remove risk in a structurally fragile market.

Price is currently trading below the 50-week moving average and hovering near the 100-week MA, a level that historically acts as an important inflection point for medium-term trend direction. The failure to hold above the short-term averages confirms that sellers have regained control of the structure. From a trend perspective, ETH remains above the rising 200-week moving average, which continues to define the long-term bullish framework. However, the widening gap between the faster and slower averages has started to compress, signaling a transition phase rather than trend continuation. Volume has expanded on down weeks, reinforcing the idea that recent downside moves are driven by active distribution rather than passive consolidation. Related Reading: XRP Liquidity Dries Up: Futures Buy Volume On Binance Falls from $5.8B to $250M The $2,800 area now represents a critical demand zone. A sustained hold above this level would suggest that the correction is a controlled pullback within a broader range. Conversely, a weekly close below it would expose ETH to a deeper retracement toward the $2,400–$2,500 region, where the 200-week MA and prior consolidation converge. Overall, the chart reflects a market caught between long-term structural support and short-term bearish momentum. Ethereum needs a decisive reclaim of the 50-week moving average to neutralize downside risk and restore confidence in trend continuation.

56008518,646635,1766102417,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56008518.jpeg,Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Make Coinbase’s List In Latest Product Launch,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shib-in-coinbase-list/,"Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have secured a place in Coinbase’s latest product expansion, a notable moment for meme coins within the regulated crypto derivatives market. Coinbase confirmed the launch of US perpetual-style futures trading in an announcement on X for a range of altcoins on Coinbase Derivatives, available around the clock. Coinbase Expands Derivatives Access With Meme Coins Included According to a recent announcement on X , US Perpetual-Style Futures are now live on Coinbase Derivatives. Among a lineup dominated by established layer-one networks and infrastructure tokens, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu stood out as the only meme-based assets included, showing how these tokens are being positioned within institutional-grade trading environments. The new product rollout allows both retail and institutional traders to access US-regulated perpetual-style futures through approved Futures Commission Merchants. Coinbase is effectively placing both meme coins alongside assets such as Cardano, Chainlink, and Polkadot in its derivatives ecosystem with its extension of this offering to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. In the case of Shiba Inu, the newly listed futures contract comes with a 1,000x multiplier. This means that demand for structured exposure to these leading meme coins has grown beyond spot trading, with traders increasingly seeking hedging and leverage tools tied to them. What This Means For DOGE And SHIB Moving Forward Recent price action for both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has offered little encouragement. Both cryptocurrencies are currently locked in an extended declining price action and low whale activity, except for a spike in whale activity witnessed by Shiba Inu earlier in the month. This occurred in tandem with a +1.06 trillion net change to the amount of SHIB on exchanges, which is also another sign of the intense selling pressure surrounding the meme coin. However, behind the scenes, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu might be working towards a bullish momentum in their fundamentals. For one, the availability of perpetual-style futures for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu could add to how traders interact with these assets. Futures markets often attract higher trading volumes and more sophisticated participants, which can influence price discovery and volatility patterns. As the largest crypto exchange in the United States, Coinbase provides the best regulated gateway for institutional traders. Therefore, this development may increase institutional visibility for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in the US market while also providing traders with new ways to manage risk. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.000007523, down by 3% in the past 24 hours. Notably, the meme coin is currently trading at its lowest price point in over a year. Dogecoin is also trading at its lowest price point in over a year. The king of meme coins is currently trading at $0.1256, down by 3.2% in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|altcoins|Cardano|chainlink|coinbase|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Futures Commission Merchants|meme coins|Polkadot|shib|Shiba Inu,EN,0,0,DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-19 00:00:17

Whale Alert, the blockchain tracking service, reported that a colossal 80,000 ETH was transferred from an unknown wallet directly to a Beacon Depositor. Valued at approximately $226 million, this single move has sent ripples through the crypto community, prompting urgent questions about its origin and intent. What Does This Massive 80,000 ETH Transfer Mean? When 80,000 ETH is transferred in one go, it’s not a routine transaction. It’s a statement. The destination—a Beacon Depositor—is a critical clue. This address is specifically designed to receive Ether for staking on the Ethereum 2.0 network. Therefore, this transfer strongly suggests a major player, or ‘whale,’ is committing a vast fortune to secure the network and earn staking rewards. This action demonstrates profound confidence in Ethereum’s long-term proof-of-stake model. Who Could Be Behind the $226 Million Whale Move? The sender’s identity remains a mystery, hidden behind an ‘unknown wallet.’ However, we can analyze the possibilities. The sheer scale points to a deep-pocketed entity. Potential actors include: A Crypto Investment Fund: Institutional capital moving into staking for yield. A Large Exchange: Consolidating user funds for institutional staking services. An Ultra-Wealthy Individual: A private whale making a strategic, long-term bet on Ethereum. The anonymity fuels speculation, but the destination reveals a clear strategic direction: staking. Why Is Staking 80,000 ETH a Big Deal for the Network? Committing 80,000 ETH transferred to staking is a powerful vote of confidence. It provides several key benefits to the Ethereum ecosystem: Enhanced Security: This large stake makes the network more expensive and difficult to attack. Increased Decentralization: While large, it adds another significant validator to the pool. Price Stability Signal: Staked ETH is locked up, reducing immediate sell pressure and signaling long-term holder belief. This move goes beyond personal gain; it actively strengthens the infrastructure of the entire network. What Are the Risks and Rewards for the Whale? Staking such a monumental sum is not without its challenges. The whale now faces a classic risk-reward scenario. On the reward side, they will earn consistent staking yields, currently estimated between 3-5% annually on their 80,000 ETH . However, the primary risk is illiquidity. Staked ETH is locked until a future network upgrade enables withdrawals. This means the $226 million is committed for the foreseeable future, exposing the holder to market volatility without the option for a quick exit. How Should Retail Investors Interpret This Signal? For everyday crypto enthusiasts, this 80,000 ETH transferred event is a masterclass in market signaling. You don’t lock up a quarter-billion dollars in an asset you believe is failing. This whale’s action suggests a bullish long-term outlook on Ethereum’s value and the sustainability of its staking economy. However, it’s crucial to remember this is one data point. Smart investors should see it as a strong, positive indicator to be weighed alongside broader market trends, not as a sole trigger for investment decisions. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Ethereum Staking The transfer of 80,000 ETH to a Beacon Depositor is more than just a large number on a screen. It is a definitive, capital-intensive endorsement of Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake. This whale has placed a $226 million bet on the network’s future security and success. While the identity remains secret, the message is transparent: institutional-grade confidence in Ethereum is not just growing; it’s being actively staked. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Beacon Depositor in Ethereum? A: A Beacon Depositor is a smart contract address on the Ethereum network specifically designed to receive and process Ether that users want to ‘stake’ or lock up to help secure the newer, proof-of-stake Ethereum blockchain (often called Ethereum 2.0). Q2: Why would someone transfer 80,000 ETH to stake it? A: The primary motivations are to earn passive staking rewards (like interest) and to support the security and operation of the Ethereum network. For a holder of such a large amount, the annual rewards can be substantial. Q3: Can the whale access this 80,000 ETH now? A> No. Once ETH is staked via a Beacon Depositor, it is locked and cannot be withdrawn or traded until a future Ethereum upgrade enables staking withdrawals. This is a long-term commitment. Q4: Does this large transfer affect the price of ETH? A: It can have an indirect effect. By locking up a large supply (80,000 ETH), it reduces the amount of ETH readily available for sale on exchanges, which can help reduce selling pressure. It also signals strong holder confidence, which can influence market sentiment. Q5: What is Whale Alert? A: Whale Alert is a popular blockchain tracking and analytics service that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions (typically over $1 million) and reports them publicly via social media, providing transparency into major market movements. Q6: Is staking ETH safe? A: Staking on the official Ethereum network is generally considered safe from a protocol perspective. However, it involves locking funds for an indeterminate period and carries smart contract risk (though the deposit contract is heavily audited) and the market risk of ETH price fluctuation during the lock-up period.

White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks posted to X, noting that Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and Agriculture Committee Chair John Boozman had confirmed that the bipartisan crypto bill will reach the Senate next month. ”We are closer than ever to passing the landmark crypto market structure legislation that President Trump has called for. We look forward to finishing the job in January!” Sacks says negotiators are hoping the House-approved CLARITY Act will be sent to the Senate for debate and amendment in January, the official start date of the legislative process, ahead of a potential floor vote. The announcement arrives as lawmakers and industry leaders scramble to develop a common regulatory framework for digital asset markets. Sacks’ revelation comes as the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) says it is granting banks the ability to conduct riskless principal transactions related to crypto assets. TradFi banks that had been dipping their toes in via pilots now have the approval to go for full-scale crypto integration. The OCC has, over time, reversed the cautionary approach it took between 2021 and 2024, when it imposed strict guardrails and joined the Fed in warning about crypto risks, such as liquidity and volatility. According to the letter from the OCC, traditional banks are explicitly permitted to engage in riskless principal crypto-asset transactions, where the banks act as matched intermediaries in trades without the need to hold assets. As it stands, only a few purely crypto banks , such as Anchorage Digital, hold OCC charters. With approval, more hybrids could emerge soon. CFTC set to take lead as CLARITY Act redraws U.S. crypto rulebook The CLARITY Act, now enacted by the House in July 2025 (H.R. 3633), will grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) a key regulatory role across most digital assets. It also aims to establish clearer meanings for “digital commodities” and reduce the regulatory perimeter that has kept the industry in legal limbo for years. Supporters of the bill argue that it will reduce regulatory uncertainty for crypto firms by establishing clearer compliance pathways, encourage innovation, and strengthen investor protections. “The CLARITY Act might offer the clear rules of the road that the industry in America needs to innovate,” Sacks said, underscoring the Biden and Trump administrations’ mutual focus on strengthening American competitiveness in the emerging markets. While the House delivered the CLARITY Act on a bipartisan basis over the past year, the Senate has constructed its own drafts of legislation. The Senate Agriculture and Senate Banking Committees have circulated drafts of discussions similar to those in the House legislation, but on topics such as decentralized finance and anti-money laundering standards. U.S. regulators continued to work on the CLARITY Act during the record 43-day government shutdown in October and November, meeting with executives from companies such as Coinbase, Ripple, Kraken, Circle, and tech-focused venture capital firms a16z and Paradigm . Industry cheers clearer crypto rules Cryptocurrency companies and investors have generally welcomed signs that Congress is leaning toward clearer regulatory guardrails. Industry advocates have also stated that a firm market structure framework could help mitigate some of the legal uncertainty that has prompted innovation abroad, as well as deter institutions from engaging in such activities. Yet a handful of consumers and investor watchdog groups have argued that a faster stream towards regulation should also guarantee firm protection from fraud and market manipulation, especially in the area of decentralized finance (DeFi), where regulatory limits are often unclear.

This significant event, sourced from leading exchange Deribit, has the potential to influence short-term price volatility and trader sentiment across the entire crypto landscape. Understanding the mechanics and implications of this expiration is crucial for any informed market participant. What Does Today’s Massive Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean? At 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 19th, a critical deadline arrives for thousands of derivative contracts. Options give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a predetermined price. When these contracts expire, it forces a final settlement, often leading to increased trading activity as market makers hedge their positions. The sheer scale of today’s Bitcoin options expiry makes it a focal point for analysts. Simultaneously, Ethereum options valued at $460 million will also expire, adding another layer of complexity to the market’s movements. However, the spotlight remains firmly on Bitcoin due to the staggering notional value involved. Decoding the Key Metrics: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain To gauge market sentiment, experts look at two vital metrics from the expiring batch. First is the put/call ratio. For today’s Bitcoin options , this ratio is 0.77. A ratio below 1 indicates more call options (bets on price increases) than put options (bets on decreases), suggesting a generally bullish sentiment among options traders. In contrast, the Ethereum batch has a put/call ratio of 1.06, showing a slightly more cautious or bearish tilt for ETH. The second critical metric is the “max pain” price. This is the strike price at which the maximum number of options would expire worthless, causing the most financial loss to options buyers. For Bitcoin, the max pain is $88,000, and for Ethereum, it’s $3,100. Market forces often, but not always, gravitate toward this price at expiry as sellers try to minimize their payouts. How Could This Expiry Impact Bitcoin’s Price Action? While options expiry does not directly dictate long-term price trends, it can create short-term volatility and liquidity events. Here’s what traders are watching for: Increased Volatility: The hours leading up to and following the expiry can see heightened price swings as large positions are closed or rolled over. Pin Risk: The price may experience “pinning” near the max pain price ($88,000 for BTC) as the expiry deadline approaches. Gamma Exposure: Market makers who sold these options will adjust their Bitcoin hedge positions, which can amplify price moves in either direction. Therefore, retail traders should be prepared for potential choppiness. However, it’s essential to remember that this is a scheduled event, and its effects are typically absorbed by the market within a day or two. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Navigating an options expiry requires a calm and strategic approach. Instead of reacting to every tick, consider these insights: Don’t Chase the Noise: Short-term volatility is not a reliable indicator of long-term direction. Avoid making impulsive trades based solely on expiry-related moves. Watch Key Levels: Monitor the max pain prices ($88,000 for BTC, $3,100 for ETH) as potential short-term support or resistance zones. Review Your Strategy: Use this event as a reminder to check your own portfolio’s risk exposure and ensure your stop-losses are in place. In conclusion, the expiry of $2.65 billion in Bitcoin options is a significant market event that highlights the growing sophistication and scale of the crypto derivatives space. While it may stir short-term turbulence, the underlying market fundamentals remain the primary driver for Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Informed traders who understand these mechanics can better position themselves to navigate the waves rather than be swept away by them. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are Bitcoin options? A: Bitcoin options are financial derivatives that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a specific price on or before a certain date. They are used for hedging risk or speculating on price movements. Q: What does a put/call ratio of 0.77 mean? A: A put/call ratio of 0.77 means there are 77 put options for every 100 call options set to expire. This indicates that, among this batch of options, more traders were betting on a price increase (calls) than a decrease (puts), suggesting bullish sentiment. Q: What is the “max pain” price? A: The max pain price is the strike price at which the total financial loss for all options buyers (of both calls and puts) is maximized at expiration. It’s a theoretical level where the most options expire worthless. Q: Do options expiries always cause a big price move? A> Not always. While they can increase volatility due to hedging activity, the effect is often short-lived. The market usually anticipates these scheduled events, and major price movements depend on broader market conditions. Q: Where does the $2.65B data come from? A: The data is reported by Deribit, which is the world’s largest cryptocurrency options exchange by volume and open interest. Their metrics are widely watched as a benchmark for the market. Q: Should I change my long-term investment strategy because of this expiry? A> Generally, no. Options expiries are short-term technical events. Long-term investment decisions should be based on fundamental analysis, project development, and macroeconomic factors, not single derivative expiry dates.

The latest reading from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index confirms it. Sitting at a mere 16, this crucial sentiment gauge has plunged deeper into ‘extreme fear’ territory. For investors, this number is more than just a statistic—it’s a powerful signal flashing in the emotional storm of the market. Let’s decode what this extreme reading truly means and, more importantly, how you can respond. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Now? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index just dropped to 16, a one-point fall from the previous day. This firmly places market psychology in the ‘extreme fear’ zone. Think of this index as the market’s emotional heartbeat. It ranges from 0 (maximum fear) to 100 (maximum greed). A score of 16 is a stark indicator that negative sentiment is overwhelming traders and investors. This pervasive fear often creates opportunities, but it also signals high risk. Understanding the mechanics behind this number is your first step to smarter decisions. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This index isn’t a guess; it’s a data-driven composite. Alternative.me compiles it using six key market factors. Each factor gives us a piece of the overall sentiment puzzle. Here is the breakdown: Volatility (25%): Sharp price swings, especially downward, increase fear. Market Volume (25%): High sell-off volume signals panic. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of discussions on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct polls of market participant sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A flight to Bitcoin often indicates a ‘safe-haven’ fear trade. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’ spikes during fear. Therefore, the current score of 16 reflects a perfect storm where most of these metrics are flashing red. Should You Buy When There’s Extreme Fear in Crypto? The famous Warren Buffett quote, ‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,’ is often cited in crypto circles. A low Crypto Fear & Greed Index can signal a potential buying opportunity for long-term believers. Historically, periods of extreme fear have preceded significant market rebounds. However, this is not a guaranteed ‘buy’ signal. It simply means assets may be oversold from an emotional standpoint. You must pair this data with your own research, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Never invest based on sentiment alone. Actionable Insights for Navigating Market Fear Seeing a 16 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be unsettling. Here is how to channel that information into a strategy: Review, Don’t React: Use this time to review your portfolio’s fundamentals, not to make panic sells. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): If you believe in the long-term thesis, consider spreading buys over time to average your entry price. Secure Your Holdings: Ensure your assets are in secure wallets. Fear-driven times can see increased phishing and scam activity. Set Alerts: Watch for a sustained rise in the index as an early sign of sentiment improvement. Remember, the index measures crowd emotion. Your goal is to understand the crowd, not necessarily follow it. The Bottom Line on Today’s Crypto Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 16 is a clear snapshot of a market gripped by anxiety. While it highlights short-term pain and volatility, it also provides a valuable contrarian data point for disciplined investors. The key takeaway is to use this tool as a gauge of market psychology, not as a crystal ball. By separating emotion from analysis, you can make clearer decisions whether you choose to wait, accumulate, or simply hold steady. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 16 mean? A: A score of 16 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’ in the market. It suggests that negative sentiment and panic selling are currently dominant among investors. Q: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is compiled and published by the data provider Alternative.me. It has become a widely referenced benchmark for crypto market sentiment. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time look at shifting market emotions. Q: Is it safe to buy cryptocurrency when the index shows extreme fear? A> It can present opportunities, as prices may be oversold. However, ‘extreme fear’ can also precede further declines. It should be one factor in a broader, research-based investment strategy, not a standalone signal. Q: Has the index been this low before? A: Yes. The index has hit single digits during major crypto winters, such as the end of 2018 and mid-2022. These periods were followed by eventual recoveries, though timing is unpredictable. Q: Does the index predict Bitcoin price? A> No, it does not predict price. It measures current sentiment, which is a driver of price volatility. It is a complementary tool for understanding market psychology. Share Your Thoughts Does the ‘extreme fear’ reading change your outlook on the market? Share this article with your network on Twitter or LinkedIn to discuss whether this is a moment of danger or opportunity.

The issue centers on a proposed “de minimis” tax exemption, a rule meant to spare small crypto payments from capital gains taxes. Under current IRS guidance, digital assets are treated as property. That means every purchase made with crypto, even a cup of coffee, counts as a taxable event that requires tracking cost basis and reporting gains or losses. Supporters of the exemption say this framework makes daily use impractical and discourages crypto from functioning as money. Bitcoin Groups Warn of Flawed Crypto Tax Exemption The debate intensified this week after representatives of the Bitcoin Policy Institute, a nonprofit advocacy group, said lawmakers are considering limiting the exemption to stablecoins only. Conner Brown, the group’s head of strategy, said on X that limiting a de minimis exemption to stablecoins would be a “severe mistake,” arguing that it would exclude ordinary Bitcoin payments from relief while favoring assets that rarely generate capital gains in the first place. I’m hearing very concerning news out of Capitol Hill today. De Minimis tax legislation may be limited to only stablecoins, leaving everyday Bitcoin transactions without an exemption. This would be a severe mistake. BPI will be publishing a response. Stay tuned. — Conner Brown (@BitcoinConner) December 17, 2025 The idea behind the exemption is straightforward, allowing small personal crypto transactions to be excluded from capital gains reporting, similar to how foreign currency transactions are treated. Most proposals have suggested a per-transaction threshold of around $300, paired with an annual cap of roughly $5,000 in total tax-free gains. The concern raised by Bitcoin advocates is that recent drafts or negotiations may narrow the scope of the exemption to stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a steady price , usually pegged to the U.S. dollar, which means most transactions do not produce capital gains. Critics argue that granting them a de minimis exemption offers little practical relief while leaving Bitcoin users facing the same reporting burden. Why would you even need a de minimis tax exemption for stablecoins? They don't change in value. This is nonsensical. The wealth effect that would be unleashed via a de minimis tax exemption for bitcoin would be material. It should be the sole focus. Stablecoins shouldn't even… https://t.co/FS5JW8vhTB — Marty Bent (@MartyBent) December 18, 2025 Some commentators have questioned the logic of prioritizing stablecoins. Marty Bent, founder of media outlet Truth for the Commoner, wrote on X that stablecoins “don’t change in value,” making a small-gain exemption unnecessary. Can Bitcoin Be Used Like Cash? Lummis Thinks Taxes Are the Problem Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming has been one of the most vocal supporters of the idea. In July, she introduced legislation proposing a $300 exemption for crypto transactions, along with a $5,000 annual limit. Her proposal also included exemptions for digital assets donated to charities and tax deferral for crypto earned through mining or staking. Lummis has long argued that the exemption would make Bitcoin practical for everyday use, instead of something people are forced to treat only as a long-term holding. That argument resurfaced in October when Block founder Jack Dorsey pressed lawmakers to lift tax rules that make daily Bitcoin payments difficult. Lummis replied publicly, saying she was working on the issue and urging supporters to speak up. @SenLummis has responded to @jack 's call for a Bitcoin tax exemption for small transactions, stating she is ""Working on it."" #CryptoTax #Bitcoin https://t.co/6S4GtW7Vpf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 9, 2025 The exchange put fresh focus on a problem the crypto industry has raised for years. Bitcoin was introduced as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Over time, however, transaction fees, slow settlement, and tax obligations have pushed most users toward holding rather than spending it. As discussions continue, Congress appears closer than it has been in years to revisiting crypto tax rules. In December, Representative Max Miller, who sits on the House Ways and Means Committee, said a draft bill on digital asset taxation has already circulated among lawmakers and could advance before the August 2026 recess. U.S. lawmakers target August 2026 for a comprehensive crypto tax bill to clarify reporting, staking, and small-transaction rules. #CryptoTax #CryptoNews #Blockchain https://t.co/Gr8rKi9NF6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 10, 2025 Starting in 2026, the IRS plans to introduce new reporting rules , including 1099-DA forms from centralized exchanges, giving tax authorities a clearer picture of crypto activity.

Onchain data reveals this early holder deposited a colossal 5,152 BTC, worth approximately $440 million, to the Binance exchange. This single action by a Bitcoin OG immediately raises critical questions about market sentiment and potential price implications for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Who Is This Mysterious Bitcoin OG? The entity, identified by the address ‘1011short’, represents the classic profile of a Bitcoin OG. These are the early believers who accumulated Bitcoin long before it became a mainstream asset. According to reports from Onchain Lens, this particular whale isn’t just a Bitcoin holder. The address also maintains significant long positions in Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), painting a picture of a diversified but currently pressured crypto investor. Notably, the portfolio shows an unrealized loss of $76.6 million, adding a layer of intrigue to the massive Binance deposit. Why Would a Bitcoin OG Move $440M to an Exchange? When a Bitcoin OG of this magnitude moves funds, the market pays attention. Such a large deposit to a centralized exchange like Binance typically signals one of a few intentions. The immediate assumption is often preparation for a sale, which can exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. However, the reasons can be more nuanced. Let’s break down the potential motives behind this whale’s move: Profit-Taking or Loss Mitigation: The OG might be locking in gains from earlier prices or seeking to cut the $76.6 million unrealized loss on other holdings. Portfolio Rebalancing: Moving assets to exchange wallets is often the first step in reallocating a portfolio, possibly shifting weight between BTC, ETH, and SOL. Use of Exchange Services: The funds could be destined for Binance’s earn products, staking, or as collateral for lending. OTC Deal Preparation: Large holders frequently use exchanges to facilitate private, over-the-counter trades to minimize market impact. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Market? The action of this Bitcoin OG serves as a powerful on-chain signal. While a single transaction doesn’t dictate market direction, it provides valuable insight into the behavior of major players. The fact that this early adopter chose to move such a significant sum to a liquid exchange suggests a potential shift in strategy. For retail investors, monitoring these flows is crucial. It highlights the importance of on-chain analytics in understanding market dynamics beyond just price charts. Therefore, while concerning on the surface, it’s a data point that requires context from broader market trends. How to Interpret Whale Movements Like a Pro Seeing a Bitcoin OG move half a billion dollars can be alarming. However, savvy investors know to look deeper. First, check if this is part of a larger trend. Are other OGs moving funds? Second, analyze exchange net flows. Is Binance seeing more deposits than withdrawals overall? Third, consider the macro context. Is the move likely related to broader financial conditions or Bitcoin-specific news? By asking these questions, you move from reactive speculation to informed analysis. In conclusion, the $440 million deposit by a Bitcoin OG is a stark reminder of the influence early holders still wield. It underscores the market’s sensitivity to whale activity and the critical role of transparency through on-chain data. While the short-term price impact remains to be seen, the event reinforces a key lesson: in crypto, watching the wallets of the pioneers can be as important as watching the charts. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin OG? A: “OG” stands for “Original Gangster” or “Original.” In crypto, a Bitcoin OG refers to an early investor or miner who acquired Bitcoin in its first few years, often before 2013. Q2: Does a large deposit to Binance always mean a sell-off? A: Not always. While it increases the likelihood, large deposits can also be for trading, staking, using financial services, or preparing for an OTC (Over-The-Counter) deal that may not immediately hit the public order books. Q3: How can I track whale movements like this? A: You can use on-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers that track large transactions (often labeled “whale alerts”) from known early adductor or exchange wallets. Q4: Should I sell my Bitcoin if I see a whale depositing to an exchange? A: One transaction should not be the sole reason for an investment decision. Use it as one data point among many, including technical analysis, market sentiment, and your own investment strategy. Q5: What is an ‘unrealized loss’? A: An unrealized loss is a decrease in the value of an asset that you still hold. It becomes a “realized” loss only if you sell the asset at the lower price. The reported $76.6M loss for this OG is based on current market prices versus their acquisition cost. Q6: Why is the address called ‘1011short’? A: Blockchain addresses are alphanumeric strings. “1011short” is likely a label or identifier given by the analytics platform (Onchain Lens) to make tracking this specific, notable wallet easier for its users.

Hoskinson’s statement drew the interest of many reporters who sought to extract more details from this prominent figure in the crypto industry. Therefore, they made attempts to invite him to an interview to comment on the topic. During the interview, several questions were raised. However, Hoskinson pointed out that this matter is a delicate topic about which one cannot say anything. What he chose to comment on was the question of why there is no one else in the industry who has raised this concern. He argued that he had a strong feeling that some individuals in the crypto ecosystem were reluctant to discuss the issue. Hoskinson cautions about Trump’s move in the crypto industry Earlier, when Trump decided to launch his own meme coin just three days after being sworn in as the US president, Hoskinson issued a warning , claiming that this move could significantly harm the cryptocurrency industry, particularly in the United States. At this time, he noted that what was initially perceived as a careful and bipartisan effort to establish straightforward regulations for digital assets in America had swiftly turned into a partisan issue . This situation presented a significant obstacle to crucial legislation and provided a convenient target for critics in the cryptocurrency industry. At this particular moment, the 2026 midterm elections were drawing closer. “The moment the Trump coin was introduced, the perception shifted from ‘crypto is bipartisan’ to ‘crypto means Trump, which is bad and corrupt,’” Hoskinson explained further, noting that the situation changed into a campaign slogan for the midterm elections scheduled next year. Hoskinson called on other crypto founders to weigh in on the topic of discussion. However, very few of them voiced this view. This shocked the Cardano founder. According to him, these crypto founders were instructed not to comment on this matter. He added that they were threatened that if they said anything about it, their access would be cut short. This meant that one would not have the opportunity to participate in the legislative process or meet with Trump. Hoskinson admitted that many individuals initially accepted this idea. Nonetheless, he highlighted that the US president’s connection to the crypto ecosystem ultimately blurred the line between policy and personal interests, thereby harming the industry’s image in Washington. This move came at a time when lawmakers were discussing strategies to regulate digital assets. Following this outcome, Hoskinson claimed that Trump caused a significant shake-up in the crypto market, arguing that he could be called to testify if Democrats regained power. Hoskinson disapproves of Trump’s World Liberty Financial project Even before the introduction of the meme coin, Trump, his family members, and business partners initiated a big crypto project known as World Liberty Financial . At that time, he was still holding campaigns and making pledges for the upcoming November election. The Cardano founder raised concerns regarding this crypto project. According to him, the timing set for this initiative was questionable. Hoskinson argued that as a private citizen of the United States, he can perform such actions, but he must also consider the fact that people are still watching his decisions. “You shouldn’t just jump into something and then create rules around it.

CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index has dropped to a mere 17, down one point from the previous day. This crucial metric acts as a barometer for the entire altcoin market, and its current reading suggests a challenging environment for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. If you’re wondering what this means for your portfolio, you’re in the right place. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does It Matter? The Altcoin Season Index is a simple yet powerful tool. It measures whether altcoins, as a group, are outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Think of it as a scorecard for the ‘risk-on’ sentiment in crypto. The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, to see how many have beaten Bitcoin’s returns. A score of 75 or above officially signals an ‘altcoin season’—a period where investors confidently rotate capital into smaller, riskier assets for potentially higher gains. Conversely, a low score like 17 indicates Bitcoin dominance is strong, and capital is flowing towards perceived safety. What Does a Score of 17 Truly Signal for the Market? A score of 17 is far from the 75 threshold needed for an altcoin season. This number tells a clear story: the vast majority of major altcoins are struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. For traders and long-term holders, this environment presents specific challenges and opportunities. Challenges for Altcoin Investors: Low momentum across the board can lead to stagnation or underperformance compared to simply holding Bitcoin. Potential Opportunities: A low index can sometimes precede a market rotation. Savvy investors might use this time to research fundamentally strong projects at lower valuations. Market Sentiment Gauge: The index reflects broader risk appetite. A low score often correlates with cautious or fearful sentiment in the wider crypto market. How Should You Navigate a Weak Altcoin Season Index? So, the Altcoin Season Index is low. What actionable steps can you take? First, avoid panic. Market cycles are normal. This is a time for strategy, not reaction. Consider reviewing your portfolio’s balance between Bitcoin and altcoins. You might also focus on dollar-cost averaging into projects with solid fundamentals, rather than chasing short-term pumps. Furthermore, use this period for education and due diligence. When the index eventually turns, you’ll be prepared with a researched watchlist. Remember, the goal isn’t to time the market perfectly, but to make informed decisions based on clear data like this index provides. Conclusion: Patience and Perspective Are Key The drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 17 is a significant data point, highlighting the current strength of Bitcoin and the relative weakness of the altcoin market. It serves as a reminder that crypto investing requires patience and an understanding of market cycles. While it may not be a classic ‘altcoin season’ right now, these periods of consolidation often set the stage for the next major move. By monitoring tools like this index and maintaining a disciplined strategy, you can navigate both seasons of boom and bust with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a good score for the Altcoin Season Index? A: A score above 75 is considered the threshold for an ‘altcoin season,’ indicating widespread altcoin outperformance. A score closer to 100 signals a very strong season. Q: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A: The index is typically updated daily, tracking the 90-day performance window on a rolling basis. Q: Does a low index mean all altcoins are losing money? A: Not necessarily. It means most are underperforming Bitcoin. Some individual altcoins may still post positive gains, just at a slower rate than Bitcoin. Q: Should I sell all my altcoins when the index is low? A: A low index is a signal, not a sell command. Your decision should be based on your investment thesis for each asset, risk tolerance, and portfolio strategy. It may be a time for caution and rebalancing. Q: Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? A: You can find the index on the CoinMarketCap website under their market data or research sections.

The price has held firm within a well-defined area of support. However, it is being seen that there is interest in early investment options as investors seek the best cryptocurrency to invest in, weighing calculated risks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale token at $0.035 has seen investment flows due to uncertainty with Dogecoin. Dogecoin Price Activity: Warning Signs and Prospects Dogecoin had been showing signs of a recovery after the market downturn while testing the $0.1332 support level. Derivatives market information had been showing that Open Interest had risen to $1.49 billion, showing that market participants had been opening longs on the expectation of a recovery. The long position had been seen to rise above 51% despite the information that the market had been experiencing liquidation. Additionally, the MACD has been approaching a bearish crossing, and this has been maintaining the possibility of downward reversals in case of a failure of support levels. Nonetheless, institutional inflows have been restricted, as Dogecoin inflows for the Dogecoin ETF have been very low, amounting to $171,920 in a single session. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off as Phase 6 Looms Close Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently being considered one of the most undervalued cryptos available. Investors have little time left for the currently available price of $0.035 for the coins before the next level at Phase 7 kicks in and drives the price towards $0.04 with a 20% surge. To date, they have managed to raise $19.5 million, while the total number of holders of the total MUTM has climbed to 18,520 since inception. This valuation marks an incredible 250% jump from Phase One’s launch price of $0.01, showing just how quickly prices can move. This launch price will be $0.06, leaving incoming investors poised for a possible return of 420% when prices open. Mutuum Finance has an increasing opportunity of being classified amongst the next big cryptos. Utility, Transparency, and Buyer Confidence Mutuum Finance is following through on its fundraising efforts by announcing the confirmation of its V1 protocol launch on the Sepolia testnet in 2025. The launching of the V1 protocol will enable the project to have its first Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot, including ETH and USDT lending, on the first day of its operation making Mutuum Finance the best cryptocurrency to invest in. Now, a live dashboard features the top 50 token holders, and a leaderboard replenishes daily, increasing engagement by awarding a $500 MUTM bonus for those in the top rankings after making a transaction within a 24-hour period after a minimum transaction has been performed. The leaderboard resets at 00:00 UTC daily. As Phase 6 ends, the opportunity to claim tokens at $0.035 gets narrower. With the pricing mechanics of Phase 7 and the valuation emphasis, those looking for the best crypto to buy now and the best cheap crypto to buy now will instead be attracted to something with progress to offer instead of simple projections. Looking Ahead in a Shifting Market Focus on Dogecoin challenges the conviction level of traders on support levels, while the capital is flowing towards a presale that contains milestones. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a promising next big crypto in the world of cryptocurrencies for those who put a premium on timing, transparency, and early entry into the crypto space.

In a recent interview, he pointed directly at former President Donald Trump’s actions as a source of significant damage to the crypto market . Hoskinson argues that what should be a bipartisan effort for clear regulation has devolved into partisan conflict, creating uncertainty that hurts every investor and builder in the space. How Did Trump’s Memecoin Launch Disrupt the Crypto Market? Hoskinson identified a key moment of disruption: the launch of a Trump-branded memecoin just before the presidential inauguration. This move, according to Hoskinson, transformed cryptocurrency legislation from a technical policy discussion into a political football. The result? Vital conversations about consumer protection and innovation stalled as the focus shifted to partisan loyalty over substantive debate. This politicization injects volatility and fear into the crypto market , making it harder for serious projects to thrive. The Controversial Plan for a Government Bitcoin Reserve Another major point of criticism centers on Trump’s mentioned proposal for a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. Hoskinson calls this “the government picking winners and losers,” a fundamental breach of the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency. He suggests the plan is not a thoughtful economic strategy but a political tool. The inclusion of certain altcoins like Cardano (ADA) in discussions about this reserve seemed, to Hoskinson, more like an attempt to quiet critics than a genuine policy evaluation based on technology or utility. This approach creates several problems for the crypto market : Market Distortion: Government favoritism can artificially inflate or suppress specific assets. Eroded Trust: It undermines trust in the market’s organic, merit-based dynamics. Regulatory Uncertainty: It signals that future regulation may be arbitrary and politically motivated. Standing Up for Integrity in the Crypto Market Hoskinson revealed that his outspoken criticism likely cost him an invitation to a high-profile presidential dinner. However, he emphasized that protecting the industry’s integrity is more important than access. His stance highlights a crucial conflict in the crypto market : the tension between seeking legitimacy through political engagement and maintaining the core principles of decentralization and neutrality. For founders like Hoskinson, the long-term health of the ecosystem depends on resisting short-term political games. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Regulation? The current situation presents a clear challenge. The crypto market needs sensible, clear, and fair regulation to achieve mass adoption and protect users. However, when political figures intertwine their personal brand or agenda with the industry, it corrupts the process. The path forward requires a return to focus on the technology’s potential, its risks, and frameworks that foster innovation while ensuring security—free from the damaging influence of partisan spectacle. In conclusion, Charles Hoskinson’s critique serves as a crucial alarm bell. The politicization of cryptocurrency, exemplified by recent actions, poses a genuine threat to market stability and ethical development. The industry’s future growth depends on navigating these political waters without compromising its foundational values. For the crypto market to mature, it must be driven by technology and community, not political maneuvering. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly did Charles Hoskinson criticize about Trump’s crypto actions? Hoskinson criticized two main actions: the launch of a Trump memecoin, which he says turned crypto legislation into a partisan issue, and the proposal for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which he views as inappropriate government market manipulation. Why is a government Bitcoin reserve considered damaging to the crypto market? It is seen as “picking winners and losers,” which goes against cryptocurrency’s decentralized nature. It can distort prices, create unfair advantages, and set a precedent for politically-driven intervention rather than rules-based regulation. How does political partisanship hurt the cryptocurrency industry? It creates regulatory uncertainty, scares away institutional investment, and stalls important policy discussions. When crypto becomes a partisan tool, achieving balanced, effective legislation becomes much harder. Did Hoskinson’s comments have any personal consequence for him? He believes they led to him not being invited to a presidential dinner, but he stated that defending the industry’s integrity was more important than that access. What is the solution for better crypto market regulation? The solution involves developing clear, technology-neutral rules through transparent, bipartisan collaboration that focuses on consumer protection, innovation, and market stability, without political favoritism. Should crypto projects engage with politicians at all? Engagement is necessary for education and sensible lawmaking, but it must be done carefully to avoid co-option and to ensure the industry’s core principles of decentralization and fairness are not compromised.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) Shows Downside Signals Despite Fresh Inflows,https://bitcoinist.com/are-bears-still-control-bitcoin-btc-shows-downside/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price action has entered a conflicted phase, with renewed institutional inflows clashing against clear signs of market stress. After peaking above $126,000 earlier this year, the world’s largest crypto has retreated sharply and is now trading more than 30% below its all-time high. Related Reading: Bipartisan SAFE Crypto Act Unveiled: New Task Force To Combat Digital Asset Scams While some capital has returned through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), broader market signals suggest that selling pressure and weak participation continue to weigh on sentiment. Consequently, recent weeks have shown that Bitcoin’s recovery attempts remain fragile. Long-Term Holders Drive Persistent Supply Pressure A major source of downside pressure has been sustained selling by long-term holders. Data from K33 Research shows that roughly 1.6 million BTC that had been dormant for at least two years has been sold since early 2023. In 2025 alone, more than $300 billion worth of long-held Bitcoin has re-entered circulation. Analysts note that this type of distribution creates gradual, grinding declines rather than sharp capitulation events. With fewer active buyers in the market, the reactivated supply has proven difficult to absorb. Blockchain data indicates that the past month marked one of the heaviest long-term holder sell-offs in over five years, reinforcing the idea that structural selling remains unresolved. ETF Inflows Return, But Demand Remains Uneven Institutional demand has shown brief signs of recovery. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded roughly $457 million in net inflows on December 17, snapping a multi-day outflow streak. Fidelity’s Bitcoin fund accounted for the majority of the inflows, with BlackRock also posting gains. Despite this rebound, ETF activity has been inconsistent. December inflows remain modest compared with earlier in the year, following nearly $3.5 billion in ETF outflows in November. Market observers say these inflows, while supportive, have not yet been large or sustained enough to offset ongoing sell-side pressure from long-term holders and cautious retail participation. Technical Signals and Market Structure Favor Bears From a technical perspective, Bitcoin continues to flash bearish signals. The price has traded within a broad $82,000–$95,000 range for over a month, forming patterns such as an inverse cup and handle on the daily chart. Bitcoin has also slipped below key moving averages, while momentum indicators suggest sellers remain in control. Recent liquidation events have reinforced this weakness. Around $152 million in Bitcoin positions were liquidated in a single day, and derivatives open interest has declined since the October market crash tied to macroeconomic shocks and tariff-related concerns.

That sounds catastrophic if you’ve never watched XRPL governance do its thing. But the important nuance is right there in the name: amendment blocking is a safety feature, not a network failure mode. When new protocol rules activate, old software can’t reliably interpret ledgers anymore, so the network forces those servers into a non-participating state rather than letting them guess. Related Reading: XRP Price Falls To Critical Support Level, Is It Time To Panic? So does “almost half the servers” going amendment-blocked matter if activity spikes? “Not at all,” Krippenreiter replied to one user. “All dUNL validators are safe, so all ‘trusted’ validators will continue to validate as expected. (and behave under load)… For everything else there is ‘FeeEscalation’.” The point he’s making: consensus comes from a trusted validator set, and fee escalation is designed to push transaction costs higher as the ledger gets busy, throttling spam and overload attempts. Other XRPL watchers mostly treated it as routine maintenance, not an existential moment. “Is this unusual or dangerous? No. This happens almost every amendment cycle,” another user wrote, listing prior change windows and noting that lagging nodes typically upgrade later. The XRPL amendment process itself is built around a long lead time: an amendment needs sustained supermajority support from trusted validators for two weeks before it flips on. Related Reading: Best XRP Buy Zone? Analyst Breaks Down The Key Levels Still, the optics aren’t nothing. Having hundreds of public servers fall behind at once can be a real-world nuisance for wallets, explorers, and businesses that lean on third-party infrastructure. Even if consensus is fine, fewer up-to-date nodes can mean less redundancy at the edges — more brittle public endpoints, more support tickets, more “why is my transaction not going through?” posts. And there is a concrete upgrade path. XRPL.org’s release notes for rippled 2.6.2 describe a new fixDirectoryLimit amendment plus a critical bug fix — the kind of stuff you don’t want to procrastinate on if you run production infrastructure. The short version: no, XRPL isn’t “going down.” But if you’re still running old rippled in late 2025, the network is about to remind you that upgrades aren’t optional. At press time, XRP traded alongside the broader market wide sentiment, down -1.5% over the past 24 hours.
