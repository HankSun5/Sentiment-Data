In 2029, the coin could be worth between $36.06 and $42.44, an average price of $37.05 In 2031, RPL will range between $74.07 and $89.07. Unlike traditional staking services, Rocket Pool allows users to pool their Ethereum (ETH) to run validator nodes on the Ethereum network. Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of ‚ÄúrETH‚Äù tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users‚Äô stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? Can Rocket Pool‚Äôs price reach $50?

The stolen assets were swiftly sold on-chain and bridged over to Ethereum before some of it was laundered through Tornado Cash . On May 16, the victim‚Äôs Solana addresses were emptied of tokens, and the assets were then converted to Ethereum via a bridge before part of it was deposited to Tornado Cash . Blockchain researcher ZachXBT publicly flagged the exploit , drawing parallels with earlier Lazarus activity. Hackers bridged the stolen funds Blockchain sleuths first raised the alarm after observing large transfers from address ‚Äú C4WY‚Ä¶e525 ‚Äù on Solana. These transactions, linked to the notorious Lazarus Group, involved moving the stolen tokens through a bridge and converting them into Ethereum. ZachXBT flagged the attack by monitoring the bridge‚Äôs activity and tracing funds that ultimately ended up in a network of wallets on Ethereum. On June 25 and again on June 27, 400 ETH was sent to Tornado Cash in two separate deposits. Those 800 ETH transactions, totaling roughly $1.6 million, align with Lazarus Group‚Äôs well-documented laundering tactics. Following high-profile hacks like Bybit, where $1.5 billion was stolen in February 2025, and $100 million from Harmony‚Äôs Horizon bridge in 2022, among other notable hacks, Lazarus has repeatedly used Tornado Cash, along with decentralized exchanges and cross-chain bridges, to launder funds by obfuscating transaction trails. Approximately $1.25 million still resides in a wallet address identified as ‚Äú 0xa5‚Ä¶d528 ‚Äù on Ethereum, held in a combination of DAI and ETH. Analysts speculate that these funds may either be parked for future laundering or be held intentionally dormant to mitigate detection risk. Lazarus Group has been active since 2017 Lazarus Group has earned a reputation as the most prolific state-linked cybercrime organization, with North Korea sanctions designating them as an Advanced Persistent Threat tied to Pyongyang‚Äôs elite military intelligence units. Over the years, they have stolen billions in crypto since 2017. Their modus operandi often starts with phishing or malware-based infiltration of key personnel, exploiting smart contract flaws or wallet vulnerabilities. Once funds are obtained, they are rapidly converted into liquid assets, broken into multiple wallets, and laundered across chains using mixers like Tornado Cash and services providing instant swaps without Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. Tornado Cash remains central to Lazarus‚Äôs laundering strategy. Although U.S. sanctions were imposed in 2022, decentralized hosting and immutability have allowed the service to evade permanent shutdown. In January 2025, a U.S. appeals court reversed those sanctions, citing free speech considerations, despite mounting evidence linking Lazarus to continued mixer use. Regulators and exchanges may now take steps to mark the flagged addresses as suspicious. However, with the speed and complexity of Lazarus‚Äôs laundering pipeline, mixing services continue to prove sufficient in concealing the movement of their stolen funds.

Meanwhile, Avalanche (AVAX) is challenging resistance points that could dictate its next move. This article explores whether SUI can maintain its stance and if AVAX can break through, offering insights on which coins might be poised for growth. SUI Price Volatility Reflects Recent Corrections and Emerging Setups Last month SUI saw a significant drop of roughly 20%, while the six-month chart reveals a deeper churn with a decline of nearly 33%. A recent one-week gain of about 8.5% signals a brief recovery amid the longer-term downtrend. Price action has been marked by falling momentum and investor uncertainty as bears held sway longer term, making recovery efforts reliant on strong fundamentals. Trends have fluctuated, illustrating an asset struggling to sustain growth while technical indicators hint at a potential short-term bounce if critical levels are respected. Current trading levels show prices between $2.77 and $4.01. Immediate support appears near $2.29, while resistance lies at $4.77. Higher resistance is identified around $6.01, with deeper support at $1.05. Technical indicators, including a mildly negative momentum reading and an RSI at 44.59, suggest the market lacks a clear thrust. Bullish traders might buy at key support, targeting the nearest resistance, while bearish holders could monitor for drops beneath support to short the correction. A range-bound approach is advisable until the market decisively breaks in one direction. Avalanche Price Journey: Volatility and Key Trading Levels Over the last month, Avalanche declined nearly 20% while the half-year drop surpassed 50%, with a brief one-week gain of almost 6% hinting at short-term recovery. The coin‚Äôs past motion shows heavy selling pressure amid steep corrections, mixed with occasional rebounds that signal continued trader interest despite overall weakness. The price history reflects an erratic pattern where significant losses over longer spans contrast with minor rallies in shorter periods, creating an uneven performance picture that traders have navigated with caution and hesitation. Current market conditions for Avalanche reveal uncertainty mixed with tactical opportunities for active traders. Price currently oscillates between $17.67 and $25.40, with the nearest resistance level at $29.98 and support around $14.52. Bears maintain significant influence, as indicated by a negative Awesome Oscillator value of -1.942. The relative strength index near 42.65 reflects selling pressure, though some buyers are testing support levels. A clear trend remains elusive as the coin trades within defined ranges. Traders are advised to consider positions near support levels and employ tight stop-loss measures. Short-term strategies may include monitoring for support bounces while awaiting signals for bullish behavior. Conclusion SUI is trying to maintain its support, showing some promise of stability. On the other hand, AVAX faces resistance, posing challenges for upward movement. The ability of SUI to hold its ground could define its short-term outlook. AVAX's struggle with resistance may need further momentum for a breakout. Both coins are at critical points, indicating that their near future could see decisive moves. Observing these levels will be key to understanding their next steps. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Each asset is flashing potential breakout signals, drawing attention from both retail and institutional traders. But alongside these well-established names, a powerful early-stage contender is rapidly gaining momentum: MAGACOIN FINANCE. With its scarcity-driven structure and increasing interest from high-conviction investors, it‚Äôs positioning itself as one of the most closely tracked opportunities this cycle. Ethereum Forms Strong Base with Reversal Setup Ethereum has taken on a technical formation that many analysts recognize as potentially reversal. A triple bottom formation is established which indicates strong underlying support and could act as a launch pad for further upside. Traders keep a close eye on ecosystem upgrades and network activity, which remain high. Its pivotal role in DeFi, NFTs, and tokenization is making investors treat Ethereum like a structural anchor in crypto portfolios. Analysts are looking for confirmation signals to tag ETH in a new Bull phase. XRP Reignites Momentum on ETF Speculation XRP recently rebounded from a prolonged consolidation phase, regaining trader interest with a breakout above long-held technical resistance. The token‚Äôs movement has coincided with growing speculation about the approval of a spot XRP ETF ‚Äî a development that could inject substantial new liquidity into the asset. On-chain upgrades are also expanding the XRP Ledger‚Äôs functionality, supporting enterprise-level use cases across DeFi, token escrows, and payment channels. With a long-term triangle formation still intact, XRP remains one of the most closely monitored large-cap assets for potential mid-cycle breakout performance. Shiba Inu Surges on Whale Activity and Layer-2 Narrative Recently, 10 trillion Shiba tokens was purchased by whales indicating it saw the biggest daily accumulation over the past some months. This strong buying activity has sparked a sudden rise from recent drops and shown improved interest in finish development of SHIB. The Shibarium Layer-2 Solution Puzzle Continues to be Key Narrative Driver. Developers and investors are becoming interested in Shibarium due to lower transaction costs and greater scalability. Presently, there are long-term interests due to token burns that will lead to further speculation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Ground with Pro Traders While large-cap assets dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly attracting high-conviction capital from pro traders seeking strategic early entries. The project is backed by a scarcity-based structure and has been steadily gaining traction across key investment circles. Entry rounds have moved quickly, with accumulation activity pointing to increasing confidence in the token‚Äôs long-term setup. Analysts tracking presale behavior and position building are flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout with real momentum forming behind the scenes. Rather than relying on surface-level sentiment, the project‚Äôs appeal stems from structural traits ‚Äî limited supply, strong inflow trends, and positioning ahead of upcoming listings. With growing attention from seasoned market participants, it‚Äôs becoming clear that MAGACOIN FINANCE is not simply trending ‚Äî it‚Äôs gaining traction as a force in its own right. Final Thoughts: Trading Patterns Set the Stage, But Positioning Wins Ethereum, XRP, and Shiba Inu are each showcasing technical strength, building the foundation for what could be a strong market resurgence. Ethereum offers structural reliability, XRP brings speculative upside tied to regulatory shifts, and SHIB reflects the power of retail momentum and evolving infrastructure.

47055008,https://cryptonews.com/?p=376363,1751237103,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/47055008.jpeg,Quantum Black Swan: How a 2026 Quantum-Computing Breakthrough Could Upend Crypto (and Which Coins Might Survive),https://cryptonews.com/news/quantum-black-swan-how-a-2026-quantum-computing-breakthrough-could-upend-crypto-and-which-coins-might-survive/,"A simulated quantum stress test conducted using OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT o3 model has raised fresh concerns about the future of digital assets. The simulation explores a hypothetical breakthrough in quantum computing by 2026 that would render many of today‚Äôs cryptographic standards obsolete, potentially leading to widespread collapse across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once due to the principles of superposition and entanglement. This allows them to perform complex calculations at speeds far beyond what is possible with classical machines. According to o3, a sudden leap in quantum capability, such as the development of a 10,000-qubit fault-tolerant machine with sufficiently low error rates, could break the security systems underpinning major blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ChatGPT o3 Warns of ‚ÄòQ-Day‚Äô Extinction Risk for Blockchains o3 raised red flags across the crypto industry, warning that the rise of quantum computing‚Äîreferred to as ‚ÄúQ-Day‚Äù‚Äîcould pose an extinction-level threat to major blockchains. At the heart of blockchain security lies the asymmetric cryptography model: private keys generate public keys , but not the other way around. This one-way function is what secures digital wallets and signs transactions. Quantum computers might sound like another buzzword in the tech world, yet their threat to #cryptocurrency is very real and approaching fast. Scientists may differ on the timeline, but they all agree: ‚ÄúQ-day‚Äù is not a matter of if, but when. #Bitcoin https://t.co/SdH4NiTMoo ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2024 Quantum computing breaks this assumption. Using algorithms like Peter Shor‚Äôs , proven in theory to efficiently factor large numbers, quantum systems could reverse-engineer private keys from public data. ‚ÄúA chain is only as secure as its signatures,‚Äù the model warns. ‚ÄúOnce signatures break, the chain breaks.‚Äù The o3 model stress-tested major blockchain protocols under a Q-Day scenario in which quantum machines can break cryptographic standards like ECDSA and RSA. The findings are sobering. Bitcoin: Legacy Risk and No Governance Pathway Bitcoin, which still uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ( ECDSA ), was flagged as particularly vulnerable. As noted by o3, a significant portion of BTC remains locked in legacy wallets with no quantum-resistant protections. A 2020 Deloitte study further estimated that up to 25% of Bitcoin holdings could be compromised, especially coins stored in exposed or reused addresses. Data from Project Eleven reinforces this concern: over 6.2 million BTC, worth approximately $648 billion, are stored in addresses with exposed public keys. This translates to more than 10 million wallets that could be at risk once quantum computers achieve sufficient decryption power. @Tether_to CEO @paoloardoino has warned that quantum computing could eventually pose a threat to inactive Bitcoin wallets. #Bitcoin #Quantum https://t.co/u8DCYrTjYw ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 9, 2025 The problem is compounded by Bitcoin‚Äôs structural rigidity. What has long been praised as Bitcoin‚Äôs strength , its conservative dev culture and emphasis on protocol stability, now poses a liability. In a crisis, Bitcoin‚Äôs inability to adapt quickly could delay vital countermeasures. As OpenAI‚Äôs o3 model puts it, ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs survival isn‚Äôt cryptographic‚Äîit‚Äôs sociopolitical. Without preemptive upgrades, post-Q-Day drains will begin within days of the breakthrough.‚Äù While discussions around post-quantum signature schemes like XMSS or Dilithium have occurred within Bitcoin Core, no concrete implementation or accepted BIP exists. The introduction of lattice-based alternatives (e.g., Falcon) remains theoretical, with no set roadmap. According to o3, Bitcoin network survival would likely depend on one of two strategies: A politically contentious fork to a quantum-safe Bitcoin variant A preemptive key rotation or shielding mechanism that avoids exposed legacy keys Ethereum: More Adaptable, But Still At Risk While Ethereum shares Bitcoin‚Äôs cryptographic vulnerability, relying on the ECDSA, it ranks significantly higher in adaptability. The o3 model flagged Ethereum‚Äôs active developer community, rapid upgrade history, and flexible governance as key assets in navigating a post-quantum scenario. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has demonstrated the capacity to coordinate complex transitions. The DAO fork, Ethereum 2.0 Merge , and the Shapella upgrade all serve as precedent for community-driven protocol evolution. ‚ÄúEthereum can adapt,‚Äù o3 concluded, ‚Äúbut only if it moves quickly.‚Äù Still, the shift to post-quantum cryptography would require extensive infrastructure overhauls. These include wallet standards, signature validation rules in smart contracts, Layer-2 rollups, and developer tooling. Many of these components were built on cryptographic assumptions that would not hold after a quantum breakthrough. Account abstraction is only half-done The end goal is non-ECDSA accounts (multisigs, key changes, quantum-resistant, privacy protocols (!!)) being true first class citizens A lot of good work recently on aggressively simplifying 7701 to make this happen https://t.co/j66geDAoC8 ‚Äî vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 27, 2025 The o3 model simulation emphasized this point, saying, ‚ÄúEthereum is the only major L1 chain with a plausible fast-track governance protocol for quantum threats. But most dApps on Ethereum aren‚Äôt ready.‚Äù However, Ethereum‚Äôs programmability, a defining strength, also creates a unique risk surface. Millions of deployed smart contracts, including financial primitives on protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and MakerDAO, use static cryptographic calls vulnerable to quantum decryption. Many are immutable and cannot be patched after deployment. That said, proxy patterns and upgradeable architectures like OpenZeppelin‚Äôs implementation give some contracts a pathway for modification. But these only apply where foresight was used. Vast portions of Ethereum‚Äôs contract base may be impossible to rescue post-Q-Day without chain-wide intervention. For Ethereum to remain viable in a post-Q-Day world, o3 noted the following actions will be necessary: Roll out hybrid cryptographic wallets supporting post-quantum signature layers (e.g., Falcon, Dilithium). Incentivize or mandate critical dApps to adopt quantum-safe signature schemes in proxy contracts. Leverage Layer-2s for isolated asset migration and transaction validation under new cryptographic rules. Coordinate a network-wide ‚Äúkey rotation‚Äù event with community buy-in, governance clarity, and tooling support. Other Chains and DeFi: Varying Levels of Readiness Algorand: Purpose-Built for the Quantum Era Among all the Layer-1 chains o3 analyzed, Algorand emerged as one of the most quantum-resilient. Designed with future-proofing in mind, the protocol already incorporates cryptographic innovations such as Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs), and it has actively explored lattice-based encryption methods like NTRU, a class of cryptography believed to be quantum-resistant. ‚ÄúIf Q-Day hits in 2026,‚Äù the o3 model observed, ‚ÄúAlgorand is one of the only chains with a 12-month adaptation head start.‚Äù Algorand‚Äôs pipelined Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus rotates validator keys regularly, reducing the exposure window of any single cryptographic signature. More on Algorand's post-quantum technology: https://t.co/NIQEnbER0P ‚Äî Algorand Foundation (@AlgoFoundation) May 27, 2025 According to o3, its structured governance and fast finality also enhance its ability to implement protocol-level upgrades quickly in the face of emerging threats. Polkadot: Modular Agility Meets Cryptographic Risk Polkadot ranked just behind Algorand in terms of readiness. The network‚Äôs parachain architecture allows semi-independent blockchains to run in parallel, each potentially adopting its own quantum-resilient cryptography without waiting for a full network-wide consensus. According to o3, this modularity offers developers the freedom to implement post-quantum upgrades on a per-parachain basis. However, Polkadot currently relies on Schnorr-based BLS signatures , which are vulnerable to quantum attacks. Still, its OpenGov system and decentralized treasury could support rapid upgrade cycles when needed. Cardano: Academic Rigor, Operational Drag Cardano presents a paradox. It is one of the few blockchain platforms deeply invested in the academic exploration of post-quantum cryptographic techniques, including both lattice- and hash-based signature schemes. o3 noted that Cardano‚Äôs extended UTXO model also provides a more modular smart contract framework, which may ease the migration to new cryptographic primitives. Post-Quantum Cardano https://t.co/MpNWSo8KWm ‚Äî Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) February 20, 2025 However, Cardano still relies on Ed25519 signatures, which are quantum-susceptible, according to o3. And while its Voltaire governance phase is intended to support decentralized decision-making for protocol upgrades, it remains under development. As the o3 model put it, ‚ÄúIf crypto were judged on whitepapers alone, Cardano would thrive. But Q-Day doesn‚Äôt wait for peer review.‚Äù Privacy Coins: From Anonymity to Liability Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash face a uniquely grim outlook. Their core innovations of ring signatures, stealth addresses, and zero-knowledge proofs offer strong protections against classical decryption but may provide little defense against quantum attacks. o3 noted that quantum algorithms capable of breaking elliptic curve cryptography could dismantle the projects‚Äô anonymity features, exposing past transactions and rendering current privacy guarantees moot. Compounding the threat is the pseudonymous governance model, which makes coordinated upgrades or overhauls difficult. ‚ÄúQuantum computing doesn‚Äôt just de-anonymize Monero,‚Äù the o3 warned, ‚Äúit breaks its reason to exist. Privacy becomes exposure.‚Äù DeFi Protocols: Collateral Damage from Layer-1 Failures Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, particularly those built atop Ethereum such as Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO, face second-order vulnerabilities. While these protocols do not directly implement ECDSA at their core, they depend entirely on Ethereum‚Äôs base-layer security. If Ethereum‚Äôs signature scheme were compromised and Layer-1 wallets became exposed, the smart contracts securing billions in TVL (Total Value Locked) would be undermined; regardless of whether the dApps themselves were quantum-aware. o3 summarized the cascading risk simply: ‚ÄúIf the base layer fails, so does the application.‚Äù Compounding the issue is the immutability of many smart contracts. While some DeFi platforms use proxy architectures for upgrades, many early deployments do not, making them inflexible in crisis scenarios. Meme Coins and High-Beta Tokens: Virtually Defenseless At the other end of the spectrum lie meme coins and low-infrastructure tokens, which the o3 model described as ‚Äúnearly defenseless.‚Äù These tokens typically lack development teams, formal governance mechanisms, or upgrade paths, leaving them acutely vulnerable to any sudden shifts in cryptographic assumptions. In the event of Q-Day, such tokens would likely suffer immediate liquidity shocks, with whales offloading positions to avoid permanent loss. The community might attempt to fork the project onto a new chain, but without technical leadership, meaningful migration is unlikely. Who Is Ready for Q-Day? The o3 simulation‚Äôs sector-by-sector stress test does not predict which coins will succeed in market terms, but rather which systems have the structural capacity to survive a game-changing leap in computational power. Based on cryptographic architecture, governance agility, and ongoing research, the post-quantum readiness landscape looks like this: Best Positioned Today Apart from Algorand , Polkadot , Ethereum, and Cardano mentioned above, these other coins have been noted to be well positioned in the case of a Q-day. Cosmos Ecosystem (ATOM, Juno, Osmosis) Cosmos shares Polkadot‚Äôs modular philosophy. Independent zones (chains) communicate through IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), allowing sovereign upgrades. Projects like Juno and Osmosis have agile governance models and could implement PQC locally. Avalanche (AVAX) Employs a DAG-optimized consensus model (Snowball/Snowman), which increases redundancy and communication between subnets. Subnets (custom blockchains) can adopt PQC signatures independently. Governance is emerging, but the tech is flexible. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) A sharded blockchain with scalability and flexibility at its core. It already supports contract-based key rotation and multi-signature accounts, making future cryptographic migration plausible Tezos (XTZ) Tezos was one of the first blockchains to emphasize formal on-chain governance and self-amending protocols. It supports Michelson , a low-level functional language that allows for cryptographic primitives to be upgraded via governance proposals without forks. Radix (XRD) Radix uses a unique consensus model (Cerberus) and is focused on developer experience and modular architecture. While not currently post-quantum, its component-based DeFi engine and structured governance may allow for faster quantum-proof upgrades. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Built on hashgraph consensus (not a blockchain), Hedera offers high throughput and ABFT (asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance). Its enterprise focus includes forward-looking cryptographic considerations, and the council-led governance can act quickly. Most At Risk Monero , Shiba Inu and ERC-20 tokens, Dogecoin , Bitcoin was noted by o3 to have critical quantum-exposure risks , either due to obsolete cryptographic foundations, rigid governance, or a total dependency on vulnerable Layer-1 infrastructure. Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Dash (DASH): All forked from or closely related to Bitcoin, they inherit the same ECDSA vulnerabilities without demonstrating meaningful governance innovation or PQC research. Conclusion The takeaway is not to panic, but to prioritize strategic risk awareness . Quantum computing is not a hypothetical threat; it is an inevitable one . What remains uncertain is when it will become powerful enough to break widely used public-key cryptography. For blockchain projects, the prudent move isn‚Äôt to predict Q-Day‚Äôs exact date but to build architectures that can flex when it does arrive. That includes investing in research, improving governance, abstracting cryptography, and educating communities on quantum resilience.

Price action remained volatile, with BTC fluctuating between $107,194 and $108,489 during the 24-hour window, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. On June 29, 2025, President Donald Trump posted a pointed message on Truth Social addressing Republican lawmakers amid intense debate over his sweeping tax-and-spending package. ‚ÄúFor all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected. Don‚Äôt go too crazy! We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before,‚Äù he wrote. This statement underscores the deep divisions within the GOP as it wrestles with the ambitious legislation dubbed the ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill.‚Äù The bill, exceeding 900 pages, combines roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts with targeted spending reductions and increased funding for defense and border security. It seeks to make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump‚Äôs 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and certain auto loans. The child tax credit would rise to $2,200 under the Senate version, while deductions for seniors would increase temporarily. However, to offset these tax cuts, Republicans propose significant cuts to Medicaid and nutrition programs, sparking fierce debate within the party. Moderate Republicans from high-tax states are pushing for a higher cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT), while conservatives demand deeper spending cuts, particularly targeting Medicaid. These internal disagreements complicate efforts to secure the narrow Republican majorities needed in both chambers to pass the bill, which Democrats uniformly oppose as favoring the wealthy and worsening inequality. Trump‚Äôs social media message reflects an attempt to balance these competing pressures ‚Äî urging fiscal restraint to satisfy conservatives while emphasizing that robust economic growth will compensate for revenue losses and help reduce deficits over time. This supply-side economic approach projects that growth will ‚Äúmake it all up‚Äù despite near-term increases in the national debt, which nonpartisan analysts estimate could add trillions to the existing $36.2 trillion debt. Crypto analyst Will Clemente‚Äôs reaction on X (formerly Twitter) shortly after Trump‚Äôs post captures a common market sentiment: ‚ÄúHow can you read this and hold long term US treasuries at current yields lol... Also, how can you read this and not hold any Bitcoin or gold.‚Äù Clemente‚Äôs skepticism toward long-term U.S. Treasuries reflects concerns that the bill‚Äôs deficit-financed tax cuts and modest spending cuts signal a loose fiscal policy that could fuel inflation and currency debasement. In this context, traditional fixed-income assets like Treasuries may appear less attractive, as rising deficits and potential monetary accommodation threaten bond values. Conversely, hard assets such as gold and Bitcoin are increasingly viewed as stores of value and hedges against inflation and fiscal risk. The expectation of sustained deficits and political challenges to fiscal discipline bolster demand for these inflation-resistant assets. With the Senate racing to finalize the bill before the July 4 holiday, Trump‚Äôs call for unity and moderation highlights the high stakes and political challenges in passing one of the most consequential fiscal packages in recent U.S. history. The bill‚Äôs fate remains uncertain as lawmakers negotiate to balance tax relief, spending cuts, and political feasibility. Technical Analysis Highlights From June 28 15:00 to June 29 14:00 UTC, BTC traded from $107,194 to $108,489, a 1.21% intraday range. Support was established at $107,300, with multiple rebounds during the 02:00‚Äì03:00 window. Volume peaked at 7,538 BTC between 08:00 and 11:00 UTC on June 29, confirming upward momentum. During the final session hour (13:05‚Äì14:04 UTC), BTC fell from $108,219 to $108,059, forming a descending channel. A 130 BTC volume spike at 13:35 coincided with a sharp dip to $108,030, which was tested and held. Final intraday rally pushed price back toward $108K before fading slightly by 22:22 UTC to $107,937.

XRP, Avalanche, and Solana continue to dominate technical discussions. But while they each face their own challenges, a newer contender ‚Äî MAGACOIN FINANCE ‚Äî is pushing its way into the spotlight with bold analyst predictions and accelerating investor demand. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out isn‚Äôt just its political theme. It‚Äôs the numbers, the traction, and the strategy. With early buyers already anticipating up to 255x returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting up to potentially outpace some of the biggest names in the space. 1. XRP Price Forecast: Technical Strength Meets Delayed Fundamentals XRP price movements are closely mimicking Bitcoin‚Äôs pre-breakout trend ‚Äî a signal that has caught the attention of many technical analysts.When sentiment turns bullish in the market, this setup can result in a huge rally. The XRP price today continues to be suppressed by legal uncertainties and geopolitical disputes. But when it comes to longer term XRP price predictions, there are tens, if not more, of potential forecasts that point to high upside. The highest Q3 2025 estimates even go all the way up to $5.81. PHYSICAL DEMAND: Investor sentiment continues to be supported by buying interest and speculation regarding the potential for a XRP ETF. To those who ask: Will XRP price go up? analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Whatever the speed bumps in the short term, there is still a narrative for the asset over the next year if certain key regulatory hurdles are overcome. 2. Avalanche: Growth Potential with Measured Risk Avalanche has shown steady strength in recent weeks. Higher lows have formed a clear uptrend, yet resistance near the $18.50 range is proving to be a key battleground. A breakout with volume could open the door for sustained gains. But if that resistance holds, AVAX may retest lower levels. The AVAX price is also supported by Avalanche‚Äôs expanding real-world use cases. In New Jersey, property records are being digitized on Avalanche‚Äôs chain. Meanwhile, the Fan3 platform has launched to help brands engage fans globally using blockchain tools ‚Äî all powered by Avalanche. While short-term volatility remains, Avalanche price movement is being closely tracked. Analysts are paying attention to how the ecosystem‚Äôs adoption plays into long-term AVAX price strength. 3. Solana: Institutional Buzz Meets Meme Revenue Risks Solana continues to ride a wave of speculation. Hopes for a Solana ETF are growing, thanks to recent Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF successes. Institutional interest is strong, and developers are still flocking to the network. But a major concern has emerged. Roughly 75% of Solana‚Äôs recent chain revenue came from meme coin activity. That raises questions about the sustainability of its current revenue model. Solana news updates remain positive, but there‚Äôs a need for stronger fundamentals to back long-term gains. Still, analysts see a Q3 price target averaging $160.70, with highs potentially hitting $168.32. SOL price momentum is steady, but not without concerns. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Focus for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the most sought-after tokens of the year. Its capped supply of 170 billion tokens creates a scarcity dynamic that early buyers see as a key advantage. Combined with no VC unlocks and a HashEx audit, the structure is winning over both retail and institutional investors. Every stage of its presale has sold out fast. Investor interest is growing daily. MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs bold, political identity is resonating across markets ‚Äî and its clear utility and transparent roadmap are only fueling more interest. While XRP, Avalanche, and Solana are being watched for technical patterns and speculation, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something more direct ‚Äî upside. Analysts are now forecasting potential returns of up to 25x for early participants. The project‚Äôs momentum is strong, its smart contract is verified, and investor sentiment is climbing. As more eyes turn toward exchange listings, MAGACOIN FINANCE is expected to become one of the biggest breakout names of 2025. Final Word: MAGACOIN FINANCE Outpaces the Pack While XRP, Solana, and Avalanche continue to attract attention, none offer the same upside potential as MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP has legal delays. Avalanche faces resistance and market volatility. Solana is still trying to balance speculation with fundamentals. MAGACOIN FINANCE is moving faster, attracting high-volume buyers, and positioning itself for explosive growth. For investors looking for real returns ‚Äî and not just speculation ‚Äî MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the smarter move heading into 2025.

As the presale progresses, more retail buyers are noticing its potential. Measured Execution and Strategic Launch Countdown Unlike many projects that rush their launches, BlockDAG follows a precise, six-week countdown to the mainnet. Starting with the end of the presale, the transition to mainnet will be structured to ensure seamless execution. During this time, BlockDAG plans to roll out core infrastructure, launch community nodes, and release 40% of its airdrop. Additionally, it will also deploy DeFi components like decentralized exchanges (DEXs), oracles, and lending platforms. The plan culminates in the final marketing push and listing preparations. This transparency and attention to detail give potential users and supporters confidence that BlockDAG is ready to scale effectively. Strategic Growth and Path to Success In addition to the 100 million token airdrop, BlockDAG‚Äôs strategic partnerships, global expansion efforts, and developer incentives all point toward its future as one of the leading Layer 1 ecosystems. Its planned mainnet launch, combined with the growing number of active users and miners, gives BlockDAG a strong foundation to emerge as a top contender in the crypto space. BlockDAG is on track to be one of the most successful cryptocurrencies in 2025, thanks to its carefully crafted ecosystem, strategic development, and focus on community growth. If ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù in crypto means adoption, infrastructure, and execution, BlockDAG is already leading the way. BlockDAG‚Äôs Unique Hybrid Architecture and Adoption Potential BlockDAG is not attempting to mimic existing blockchain networks; instead, it combines the best features of multiple successful systems. Its hybrid architecture uses Proof-of-Work for security, DAG for scalability (enabling up to 15,000 transactions per second), and Ethereum‚Äôs smart contract compatibility for easy development and deployment of decentralized applications. With over 200,000 BDAG holders already, BlockDAG is demonstrating its adoption potential. The combination of a low presale price, early support from whales, a growing developer ecosystem, and active community engagement makes BlockDAG stand out as a unique project in the crypto space. Conclusion BlockDAG‚Äôs innovative hybrid architecture combines Proof-of-Work (PoW) security with Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scalability, allowing it to process thousands of transactions per second while ensuring decentralization. The project already has a live testnet with EVM compatibility, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) with lower fees and faster speeds than on Ethereum. Additionally, the strategic 100 million token airdrop and a U.S.-based sponsorship are further expanding BlockDAG‚Äôs ecosystem and preparing it for broader recognition. As the project moves forward, its unique approach to building infrastructure and growing its community sets it up for long-term success.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $36.8. By 2031, ICP‚Äôs price might reach a maximum of $113.32. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. The network leverages advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain‚Äôs future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let‚Äôs get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.90 Market Cap $2.61B Trading Volume $43.05M Circulating Supply 534.95M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $4.92 24-h Low $4.81 Internet Computer technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 7.65% 14-Day RSI 44.17 50-Day SMA $5.35 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 68 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $6.35 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP faces resistance at $5.056. MACD signals weak bearish momentum. ICP 1-day price analysis: ICP appears to be consolidating The 1-day chart for ICP on June 29 shows the price consolidating between $4.90 and $5.05. The recent price action has fluctuated within this narrow range, with multiple tests of the $4.90 support and attempts to break the $5.05 resistance. The MACD indicator shows weak bearish momentum as it hovers near the zero line, signaling indecisiveness in the market. ICP appears to be consolidating If ICP fails to break above $5.05 and establish momentum, it could remain trapped within the current consolidation range. A failure to maintain support at $4.64 would likely bring ICP back down to the next support at $4.31, which is critical for a potential rebound. ICP price analysis for 4-hour: ICP pulls back after testing key resistance level On the 4-hour chart, the coin has tested the upper Bollinger Band at $4.93 and is slightly pulling back, suggesting a possible overbought condition in the short term. The Balance of Power is negative at -0.38, showing a shift in momentum towards sellers. ICP pulls back after testing key resistance level The price is currently trading just below the upper resistance zone at $4.92, with a minor dip suggesting a small correction before potentially making another attempt to break resistance. If ICP fails to surpass $4.93, the price could drop to retest the lower support level at $4.65. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $4.77 BUY SMA 5 $4.96 SELL SMA 10 $4.96 SELL SMA 21 $5.34 SELL SMA 50 $5.35 SELL SMA 100 $5.30 SELL SMA 200 $6.35 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $5.12 SELL EMA 5 $5.15 SELL EMA 10 $5.15 SELL EMA 21 $5.25 SELL EMA 50 $5.80 SELL EMA 100 $6.80 SELL EMA 200 $7.86 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP seems to be in a state of indecision, hovering near critical support and resistance levels. If the price breaks above the $5.40 level, we could see a bullish continuation, but failure to maintain support above $4.64 could lead to further downward pressure. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies. Will Internet Computer reach $25? Yes, Internet Computer ICP might reach and surpass $25 as early as 2027. Will Internet Computer reach $50? Yes, Internet Computer is expected to reach $50. Will ICP reach $1000? Although its ATH sits at $750.73, attaining $1000 in the foreseeable future might be impossible. ICP is down 99% from its ATH and will require a massive turnaround in market fortunes to recapture previous highs. Does Internet Computer have a good long-term future? Yes, the Internet Computer coin shows a promising long-term future. Price predictions indicate steady growth, with a potential increase year-on-year, reflecting a positive trend and strong market potential.

The same survey found that current crypto owners say that tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) make up at least 14% of the total value of their financial assets. South Koreans: Crypto Trading on the Rise? The newspaper Cheonji Ilbo reported that the survey of 1,000 people nationwide was conducted in April this year by the Hana Financial Group‚Äôs Research Institute. South Korea called for a ‚Äúmutually beneficial‚Äù agreement on trade with the US during its new trade minister‚Äôs first trip to Washington this week. https://t.co/qeMmYlICCy ‚Äî Bloomberg (@business) June 28, 2025 The survey‚Äôs authors explained that 51% of the people they spoke to ‚Äúhad experience investing in crypto,‚Äù with 27% currently HODLing their coins. In this latter group, investors said they were holding onto an average of around 13 million won ($9,547) worth of coins. In the early stages of investment, the researchers found, traders tended to focus on Bitcoin. However, they also found that as traders gained experience, they tended to buy more altcoins, with a focus on stablecoins . Wallets on Multiple Exchanges The data also appears to indicate that many South Korean traders are prepared to shop around to find better prices. Over half of the respondents said they held crypto wallets on multiple domestic crypto exchanges . Seven out of 10 said they have traded on the market-leading trading platform Upbit. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past three months. (Source: CoinGecko) The majority of crypto-trading survey participants (60%) said they began investing in crypto in earnest during the 2020 Bitcoin bull run. Three-quarters of investors began investing with stakes worth less than 3 million won ($2,203). However, the value of their collective investments appears to have risen considerably. Over four in 10 of the crypto investors said they currently have coins worth more than 10 million won ($7,344) in their wallets. Majority of Traders Are Male Office Workers, Data Shows Most crypto investors were aged 40-49, with 67% of male respondents and just 33% of women saying they had bought coins. The majority of crypto investors (over half) said they were in white collar office jobs, with just 12% of physical laborers saying they had crypto holdings. The data also indicated that crypto investing-South Koreans tend to take more risks in the financial markets. The researchers noted that 38% of respondents showed signs of taking an ‚Äúactive‚Äù or ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù approach to investment tendency. This, they said, was twice the overall average of 20%.

XRP is holding steady‚Äîbut barely. And out of nowhere, a wildcard called MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting fire to the presale charts, flipping the political meme coin script for 2025. It started as a joke. Now, it‚Äôs a movement. With presale phases vanishing in hours and the token still priced under a penny, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn‚Äôt just gaining momentum‚Äîit‚Äôs charging full speed toward the kind of parabolic run that made early SHIBA and DOGE holders millionaires. Ethereum and XRP: Still Kings, But Slipping Let‚Äôs be clear‚ÄîEthereum isn‚Äôt going away. But right now, it‚Äôs stuck. A ‚Äúdeath cross‚Äù just formed on its two-week chart‚Äîsomething that preceded a 40% crash the last time it appeared in 2022. ETH is pinned near $2,460, facing weak demand and heavy resistance. Unless it clears $2,500 fast, analysts warn a drop to $2,100 could come next. XRP is faring better, thanks to its courtroom victory over the SEC. It‚Äôs trading around $2.20 and riding a wave of bullish speculation. But that $2.60 wall still hasn‚Äôt cracked. The hype is building, sure‚Äîbut the price isn‚Äôt moving fast enough to match it. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Already Moving This isn‚Äôt just another meme coin. MAGACOIN FINANCE is tapping into something raw and emotional‚Äîpolitics, culture, and identity‚Äîand it‚Äôs doing it with a war chest full of early investor capital. Millions raised. Thousands of wallets. Each presale phase sells out faster than the last. And yet, the price is still under $0.001. People aren‚Äôt buying it because of utility. They‚Äôre buying it because they feel it. Because it stands for something. Because it‚Äôs stirring the same kind of chaotic, high-voltage energy that gave rise to Trump, Dogecoin, and Reddit-fueled stock rallies. Analysts Say 25x to 35x Is Conservative‚ÄîSome Are Whispering 185x That‚Äôs not a typo. Conservative forecasts put MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs return potential between 25x and 35x for early buyers. But in this kind of narrative-driven market, where emotion often outpaces logic, there are louder whispers of 100x+. Some models even throw out 185x if momentum keeps climbing into listings. The fixed supply‚Äî170 billion tokens. The audit‚Äîcompleted. The price entry‚Äîstill dirt cheap. Everything about this setup screams breakout. Ethereum Builds Infrastructure. XRP Builds Payment Rails. MAGACOIN Builds Hype‚Äîand Hype Wins in Meme Markets. Don‚Äôt get it twisted. Ethereum and XRP will still be here in 2030. They‚Äôll have partnerships, upgrades, roadmaps. But MAGACOIN FINANCE might be the one that makes headlines this year. The one that people wish they‚Äôd bought when it was still under a penny. The one that rides into major listings with a wave of red caps, memes, and pure speculative fire. It won‚Äôt be the biggest by market cap. But in terms of raw returns? Cultural impact? 2025‚Äôs most talked-about political meme coin? MAGACOIN FINANCE might already be that. And if you‚Äôre still watching from the sidelines, you might be doing exactly what the early DOGE skeptics did‚Äîwaiting too long while others lock in generational wealth. Final Take Ethereum and XRP still dominate by scale. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is outpacing them where it matters most right now‚Äîmomentum, attention, and raw upside potential. It‚Äôs not trying to be the next smart contract king or cross-border solution. It‚Äôs trying to blow the roof off meme season before it even starts. And by the look of things, it just might pull it off.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins a new trading week, ETH is trading close to $2500, up 11% in the seven days, according to CoinDesk market data, outperforming BTC. Market observers have attributed ETH's outperformance versus bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies to a string of bullish headlines in the past few weeks. Stablecoins have regulatory clarity thanks to the GENIUS Act ‚Äì and Ethereum is home to the most stablecoin deposits; ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to see sizable flow. Technical analysis by CoinDesk's analyst Omkar Godbole indicates a potential bullish case is forming on-chain, with traders increasingly viewing $ 3,000 ETH as a possibility in the near future. But behind the scenes, something more fundamental is happening. Ethereum‚Äôs validator architecture, the backbone of its proof-of-stake security model, is undergoing a quiet transformation that could cement ETH‚Äôs role as Wall Street‚Äôs favorite programmable asset. At the center of that shift is distributed validator technology, or DVT, a system that allows Ethereum validators to be split across multiple operators and machines, making them far more resilient, secure, and decentralized. Obol Labs is one of the leading teams behind the technology. ‚ÄúEthereum is coming back in favor because it‚Äôs the most secure and battle-tested blockchain,‚Äù said Anthony Bertolino, head of ecosystem at Obol Labs. ‚ÄúAnd security comes from validators. The most advanced and secure ones now are distributed validators.‚Äù Obol‚Äôs technology eliminates a long-standing problem in Ethereum staking: single points of failure. Traditional validators rely on a single node to propose and attest to blocks. If that node goes offline or is misconfigured, the validator is penalized, or slashed in Ethereum parlance. Obol‚Äôs system uses threshold cryptography and an ‚Äúactive-active‚Äù architecture so that even if some nodes fail, the validator keeps running without interruption. This upgrade is not just a technical improvement. It is an institutional requirement. As Ethereum sees inflows from ETFs, funds, and structured finance products, staking infrastructure needs to meet the standards of traditional capital allocators. Blockdaemon, for instance, recently announced that it is integrating Obol's distributed validator technology into its staking infrastructure. Blockdaemon is a $100 billion name for institutional crypto. ‚ÄúHistorically, institutions had to choose between performance and security,‚Äù Bertolino said. ‚ÄúNow they get both.‚Äù Momentum is building fast. Lido, Ethereum‚Äôs largest staking protocol with $22 billion in total value locked , is preparing to approve distributed validator use across its ‚ÄúCurated Set‚Äù ‚Äî the collection of professional node operators who manage over 30 percent of all staked ETH. A new governance proposal would allow these operators to use either Obol or SSV in intra-operator setups, and eventually expand usage across thousands of validators. This move builds on the success of Lido‚Äôs Simple DVT Module, which has already deployed over 9,600 DVT-powered validators with a 97.5 percent effectiveness score, outperforming the network average. ‚ÄúThese clusters are already showing better uptime, higher effectiveness, and similar yields to conventional setups,‚Äù Bertolino said. ‚ÄúThis is the infrastructure shift that makes Ethereum staking enterprise-grade.‚Äù For Ethereum, the implications go beyond validator design. DVT mitigates one of the network‚Äôs core criticisms, that its staking layer is increasingly centralized, and helps fulfill the vision of Ethereum to be neutral, distributed infrastructure. ""Institutions are thinking about two things. How do I secure the assets, and how do I generate attractive yield? Historically, you had to choose one. DVT gives you both,‚Äù Bertolino said. And Wall Street continues to pay attention. News Recap: Short COIN, Long BTC as Coinbase Nears Overvaluation, Says 10x Research Coinbase shares have surged 84% in the past two months, far outpacing bitcoin‚Äôs 14% gain and raising red flags about overvaluation, according to 10x Research, covered late last week by CoinDesk . In a Friday note, Head of Research Markus Thielen recommended a short COIN/long BTC trade, arguing that Coinbase‚Äôs fundamentals‚Äîmainly trading volumes‚Äîdon‚Äôt justify the rally. ‚ÄúWhile Coinbase hasn‚Äôt quite breached the +30% overvaluation threshold, it‚Äôs approaching fast,‚Äù Thielen wrote, suggesting options strategies or pair trades to exploit the potential reversal. 10x‚Äôs model finds 75% of COIN‚Äôs price action is tied to bitcoin‚Äôs price and volumes, meaning recent gains likely reflect excessive speculation. The report notes other bullish catalysts, including Circle‚Äôs IPO and U.S. stablecoin legislation, are likely priced in, while Korean investor momentum is fading. ‚ÄúThis rare deviation suggests Coinbase‚Äôs valuation is extended and vulnerable to mean reversion,‚Äù Thielen said, warning that COIN could soon follow other overheated crypto stocks lower. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is trading above $108K as Asia opens its trading week, but analyst Micha√´l van de Poppe says it must break $109K resistance to sustain momentum, with the rally fueled more by leveraged futures than spot demand. ETH: Ethereum broke above $2,440 with strong volume support, signaling bullish momentum amid new U.S. stock market highs, improving global liquidity, and easing geopolitical tensions. Gold: Gold is trading at $3,248.26, down slightly, as Australia cuts its commodity export earnings forecast due to weak iron ore and gas prices despite surging gold. Nikkei 225: Nikkei 225 futures are trending higher with an expectation that the White House will reach trade deals with Japan and other export-heavy Asian economies.

According to a new report from CEX.IO, 45% of crypto card transactions fall under the 10-euro mark, reflecting a shift in consumer behaviour and highlighting crypto‚Äôs growing role in day-to-day payments. The report, shared with Cointelegraph, noted a 15% year-on-year increase in newly issued CEX.IO crypto cards across the continent in 2025. This trend indicates a broader acceptance of digital assets as a means for routine purchases and suggests that crypto cardholders are now mirroring traditional banking habits, especially when it comes to online spending. Online Spending Nearly Doubles Traditional Usage Rates While the European Central Bank (ECB) reports that 21% of card payments in the eurozone are made online, CEX.IO data shows that 40% of crypto card transactions occur via the internet. This figure nearly doubles the regional average, showcasing the comfort crypto users have with digital platforms. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing in Europe is that crypto card users aren‚Äôt just experimenting with new tech ‚Äî they‚Äôre showing us what everyday spending might look like in a truly cashless future,‚Äù said Alexandr Kerya, Vice President of Product Management at CEX.IO. He also revealed that average payment volumes have jumped 24% in the past month alone. Crypto Spending Patterns Mirror Traditional Banking The data further illustrates how crypto cardholders are incorporating digital currencies into their daily routines. Groceries represent 59% of crypto card purchases, which is close to the ECB‚Äôs 54% average for traditional bank cards. Spending at restaurants and bars accounts for 19% ‚Äî a higher figure than typical bank card usage in that category. The average crypto card transaction stands at ‚Ç¨23.70, lower than the ‚Ç¨33.60 average for traditional bank card payments, based on Mastercard‚Äôs Q1 2025 data. Stablecoins Lead Transactions as Other Cryptos Gain Ground Stablecoins play a dominant role in these transactions, powering 73% of all crypto card activity. Nevertheless, other leading digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Solana are also being used for essentials like groceries, dining, and transport. This mirrors broader usage trends across the crypto sector. For example, platforms like Oobit and Crypto.com are also reporting strong transaction volumes related to everyday spending and online shopping across their European user base. Institutional Pushbacks Continue Despite Adoption Gains However, not all financial institutions are welcoming this trend. Barclays has announced that it will block crypto purchases on its Barclaycard credit cards. The bank cited concerns over the volatility of digital assets and the lack of consumer protections available through traditional financial mechanisms. Barclays emphasized that crypto transactions are not covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, leaving users exposed in case of disputes or losses. Despite such institutional caution, the momentum behind crypto card usage continues to grow, reflecting an evolving financial landscape that is increasingly embracing digital innovation.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|LTC|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-29 23:43:55

However, while the figure surpassed the previous H1 record set in 2022, the numbers were considerably skewed by just one incident, a $1.5 billion attack on Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit. The Defining Breach The Bybit breach , which happened in February, was not just the largest crypto hack ever; it was a geopolitical act, with TRM Labs, alongside several other security firms, attributing it to North Korean state-sponsored actors. According to the report , the incident accounted for nearly 70% of all crypto thefts in the first half of 2025 and inflated the average hack size to $30 million, double that of H1 2024‚Äôs figure. In total, there were about 75 distinct attacks. January, April, and May saw significant cases, all exceeding $100 million, indicating a pervasive and persistent threat landscape beyond just the headline-grabbing mega hack. Overall, TRM‚Äôs insight estimated that groups linked to North Korea were responsible for at least $1.6 billion of the total losses so far this year. According to the analytics firm, proceeds from such operations were most likely used to not only evade sanctions placed on the Pyongyang regime, but also to help bankroll its strategic initiatives, including its nuclear program. Technically, the report noted that infrastructure intrusions targeting fundamental weaknesses like private key/seed phrase security or exchange front-ends were the dominant vector, accounting for over 80% of the stolen funds. These breaches, often amplified by social engineering or insider threats, exploit the core foundations of crypto security and usually result in incidents ten times larger, on average, than other methods. Additionally, protocol-level exploits, such as flash loan manipulations in DeFi, contributed another 12%, highlighting persistent smart contract vulnerabilities. A New Era of Cyber Warfare in Crypto H1 2025 also saw the emergence of a new front in how geopolitical conflicts are waged: the explicit use of crypto hacking as a tool of war. This was seen in the recent attack on Iran‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, Nobitex, by Gonjeshke Darande (Predatory Sparrow), a group reportedly linked to Israel, which stole more than $90 million from the platform. The group publicly stated their motivation, claiming they had targeted the exchange for its role in helping Iran circumvent sanctions and finance illicit activities. Interestingly, they transferred the stolen funds to vanity addresses lacking corresponding private keys, rendering them inaccessible, and strongly signaling that the operation was executed for symbolic or political retaliation, rather than financial gain.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $4.59 to $5.54. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW‚Äôs price movements. Given Flow coin‚Äôs strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.3287 Market Cap $523.59M Trading Volume $11.91M Circulating Supply 1.59B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.3032 24-hour High $0.3290 24-hour Low $0.3243 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.01% 50-Day SMA $0.3841 14-Day RSI 41.78 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 68 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.4503 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Flow coin is consolidating between $0.323 and $0.330. Support is at $0.290, and resistance is at $0.372. Flow coin 1-day price analysis: FLOW is hovering around the 0.236 Fibonacci level The 1-day price chart analysis for June 29 shows the price hovering around the 0.236 Fibonacci level, a crucial point in the recovery process. Immediate resistance lies at $0.372, while the next support could be near $0.290. The MACD on the chart is negative, indicating a bearish trend with potential for further downward movement. A reversal above $0.372 would confirm a momentum shift, but the market sentiment remains bearish. FLOW is hovering around the 0.236 Fibonacci level Flow coin 4-hour price analysis: FLOW shows moderate buying interest The 4-hour chart reflects a relatively stable price action within the range of $0.323 to $0.330, forming a consolidation pattern with a slight upward bias. A sharp move outside this range might indicate increased volatility. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) of 7.39M shows moderate buying interest, although it‚Äôs not strong enough to break above the resistance at $0.330. FLOW shows moderate buying interest FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3335 SELL SMA 5 $0.3425 SELL SMA 10 $0.3362 SELL SMA 21 $0.3534 SELL SMA 50 $0.3841 SELL SMA 100 $0.3874 SELL SMA 200 $0.4503 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3503 SELL EMA 5 $0.3610 SELL EMA 10 $0.3695 SELL EMA 21 $0.3798 SELL EMA 50 $0.4197 SELL EMA 100 $0.4910 SELL EMA 200 $0.5699 SELL What to expect from Flow? If FLOW breaks the support at $0.323, further downside towards $0.290 may occur, while a break above $0.330 could lead to a minor bullish move. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network‚Äôs unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

CNBC reports that Ric Edelman, who previously said that allocating as much as 1% to crypto was reasonable, is now saying that financial advisors should recommend allocating between 10% and 40% to digital assets. Says Edelman in an interview with CNBC‚Äôs Crypto World, ‚ÄúToday I am saying 40%, that‚Äôs astonishing. No one has ever said such a thing.‚Äù The founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals is now more bullish on crypto assets amid the massive changes in the industry. According to Edelman, Bitcoin and the broader crypto space faced numerous uncertainties four years ago ‚Äì from the possibility of government bans on BTC , to concerns about blockchain technology becoming obsolete, to questions about whether digital asset adoption would gain meaningful traction. ‚ÄúToday, all those questions have been resolved. It‚Äôs radically changed and is now a mainstream asset.‚Äù Edelman also says that Bitcoin and crypto should play a bigger role in long-term investment strategies as life expectancy in the US increases. According to the financial advisor, allocating 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds no longer works, given that Americans can live up to 85 today, or even much older with advances in tech and medicine. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a financial advisor and you had a 30-year-old client who was saving for their long-term future, you would tell them to put 100% of their money in stocks, because they have 50 years to go. Today‚Äôs 60-year-old is kind of like yesterday‚Äôs 30-year-old. You need to get better returns than you can get from bonds, and you need to hold equities longer than ever before.‚Äù Edelman notes that Bitcoin is a great portfolio diversifier as it doesn‚Äôt appear to be correlated with the performance of other asset classes. He also says that digital assets tend to outperform stocks, bonds, gold and others. ‚ÄúBitcoin prices don‚Äôt move in sync with stocks or bonds or gold or oil or commodities‚Ä¶ The crypto asset class offers the opportunity for higher returns than you‚Äôre likely to get in virtually any other asset class.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Ethereum (ETH) is testing a significant resistance level, and Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing renewed interest, with projections suggesting the potential for strong returns. While both continue to attract short-term attention, Unstaked is emerging as a long-term prospect with tangible utility and notable upside. At a current price of $0.012091 in Stage 22 and a launch goal of $0.1819, Unstaked unlocks a 28x return for early participants. With $10.6 million already raised and a platform centered on AI agents governed by users, Unstaked is establishing itself as a utility-driven contender. In a shifting market that increasingly favors substance over speculation, Unstaked is gaining recognition as a potential leading pick among next-generation crypto platforms. Ethereum (ETH) Consolidates Just Below Resistance Ethereum remains range-bound, currently trading just beneath the $2,540‚Äì$2,570 resistance level. This zone includes converging exponential moving averages and upper Bollinger Band limits. Despite several failed attempts to move past $2,600, buyers have maintained control near $2,510, with visible support emerging around $2,480. Indicators reflect a neutral market stance, with MACD showing minimal momentum and RSI hovering close to 49. A confirmed breakout above $2,570 could enable moves toward $2,660 and $2,710. However, failure to sustain upward momentum could open the door for a retest of support levels near $2,438. As volatility compresses and technical levels align, Ethereum (ETH) continues to approach a point where a breakout could signal broader altcoin movement. Dogecoin (DOGE) Repositions as Analysts Eye High Upside Potential Dogecoin has recovered modestly, trading near $0.1690 after briefly dipping below $0.174. The price remains within a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating that a larger directional move may be approaching. According to Ali Martinez, a breakout above $0.22 could trigger the beginning of a stronger rally. Meanwhile, Javon Marks forecasts an ambitious 600% increase, suggesting a long-term target of $1.25. While recent weakness was linked to declining open interest and overall market caution, structural indicators remain intact. A clean break above the $0.22 level may first target $0.65, representing a 260% gain. Within this landscape, Unstaked offers a contrasting opportunity. While Dogecoin rides technical momentum, Unstaked delivers real-world functionality with comparable upside potential. Unstaked: AI Utility, Transparent Governance, & High Growth Potential Unstaked‚Äôs rise is underpinned by its unique blend of AI integration and user-led governance. Priced at $0.012091 in its 22nd presale stage and aiming for a launch value of $0.1819, the project provides a potential 28x return. This pricing alone has drawn interest, but the platform‚Äôs operational focus has further strengthened investor interest. At its foundation, Unstaked empowers users to create and manage AI agents that perform various tasks, such as content management and data handling. After Unstaked‚Äôs public launch, these agents will function directly on-chain, offering verifiable transparency and ownership. Unlike many projects that promote AI as a vague concept, Unstaked ties its AI features to real governance structures, allowing participants to shape development and application. The team has also launched a $1,000,000 giveaway for early supporters, adding further appeal during the presale. Having already raised more than $10.6 million and sold over 1.2 billion tokens, Unstaked is gaining traction with serious capital. Compared to speculative bets, Unstaked represents a platform rooted in practical value with long-term growth potential. Crypto markets appear to be entering a new phase. Established names like Ethereum and Dogecoin are navigating familiar levels, waiting for signals to define their next moves. At the same time, Unstaked is capitalizing on early-stage enthusiasm by offering utility, community governance, and price potential that legacy tokens no longer provide. Looking Ahead Ethereum is consolidating and Dogecoin is recovering, but Unstaked is growing. Its use of AI, transparent mechanics, and planned token economics present a forward-thinking approach to crypto development. In a market slowly favoring platforms with real products and engaged communities, Unstaked‚Äôs early entry price and momentum may be difficult to overlook. As technical setups mature for ETH and DOGE, investors are increasingly evaluating emerging platforms. The broader trend suggests that future winners may not be the current leaders, but rather the projects laying groundwork today.

47059543,https://thecoinrise.com/web3-ais-0-000443-price-holds-strong-roi-potential-while-sol-link-show-signs-of-strong-breakouts/,1751241620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/47059543.jpeg,Web3 ai‚Äôs $0.000443 Price Holds Strong ROI Potential While SOL & LINK Show Signs of Strong Breakouts,https://thecoinrise.com/web3-ais-0-000443-price-holds-strong-roi-potential-while-sol-link-show-signs-of-strong-breakouts/,"Solana (SOL) is gaining traction within an ascending triangle, a technical setup often followed by sharp price moves. If this scenario plays out, SOL could surge 30% and reach $180. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) has gained momentum following its involvement in a central bank trial in Hong Kong. LINK rose 9% in a single day and continues drawing institutional interest. Unlike SOL and LINK, which rely on external triggers, Web3 ai ($WAI) builds internal value. WAI gives users access to a wide range of AI features and burns with each use, cutting total supply. Currently priced at $0.000443 in Stage 9, WAI is expected to list at $0.005242. Web3 ai has now raised over $8.5 million and is gaining steady traction. Solana: Breakout Pattern Could Lift Price Toward $180 Solana (SOL) continues to build within a bullish triangle, marked by resistance between $140 and $145 and higher support levels. This setup generally leads to a price spike. A break above $145 could open the way for SOL to approach $180. Rising volume and on-chain strength are backing the pattern. SOL has maintained key levels, and increased volume hints at stronger market confidence. Traders are keeping a close eye on a close above $145, with stop-losses likely placed just below the trendline. Should the move slow, the triangle may hold longer, offering another entry near $135. This setup gives a clear technical roadmap for short-term gains, making Solana a top crypto to buy now. Chainlink: Strong Price Move After CBDC Integration Chainlink (LINK) recently enabled a successful trial of digital asset transfers between a Hong Kong dollar and an Australian dollar stablecoin. This was achieved using its CCIP technology, linking public blockchains like Ethereum to private systems in real-time. Following the news, LINK jumped more than 9% in a single day, crossing $15 and outperforming major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Market indicators support the rise. Volatility dropped, and metrics like open interest and derivatives activity rose, showing solid market engagement. With support holding at $12.64 and a breakout in progress above $15, LINK could soon reach $16. Its involvement in national-level blockchain use cases continues to boost its position as one of the top cryptos to buy now. Web3 ai‚Äôs Price Under $0.001 Sets Up A 1747% Growth Potential Web3 ai is getting close to its main launch, and the current stage may be the last chance to enter at low prices. The team is rapidly working on software tools, a new user interface, and cross-chain functionality. All features are already under testing. With beta access scheduled for Q4, prices are projected to rise to $0.005242, a 1747% jump from the current $0.000443 in Stage 9. Over $8.5 million has been raised so far, covering development, audits, marketing, and liquidity planning. The platform will offer several AI-based features for daily crypto use, and every time a tool runs, WAI is burned. This shrinking supply increases demand. With a price still under a cent, Web3 ai is positioned as a strong option for those eyeing value-driven projects. As demand builds and features roll out, missing this entry may not be an option for long. The Bottom Line Both Solana and Chainlink show promise through strong setups and broader use. But they depend on outside news to sustain moves. Web3 ai‚Äôs WAI, on the other hand, is driven by built-in use and active scarcity. Priced at $0.000443, WAI could deliver a 1747% gain ahead of listing. Each feature burns supply, building long-term traction. While traders wait for SOL and LINK breakouts, WAI is already moving on clear fundamentals.

47059356,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=169928,1751241623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/47059356.jpeg,"Could XRP Still Hit a 20x ROI Target, or Will This Political Meme Crypto Achieve It First in 2025?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-xrp-still-hit-a-20x-roi-target-or-will-this-political-meme-crypto-achieve-it-first-in-2025/,"XRP has long been a symbol of crypto‚Äôs push for legitimacy ‚Äî backed by years of legal battles, institutional alignment, and infrastructure growth. But as 2025 unfolds, investors are asking a sharper question: Can XRP still deliver the type of exponential returns the altcoin market is known for? Or is the next big move already taking shape in a very different corner of the market ‚Äî one dominated not by financial institutions, but by political meme momentum? XRP‚Äôs Institutional Play: Maturity Meets Uncertainty Expectations of stronger institutional support have helped XRP weather market turbulence over the last few months. Technical analysis is still divided; some analysts point to hesitations close to important resistance zones, while others highlight strength in the setup as a whole. The token‚Äôs visibility has grown, particularly as U.S.-based financial entities inch closer to offering full-fledged crypto products tied to XRP. Major exchanges are getting ready for wider integration, and a number of futures-based instruments have already been approved. However, XRP‚Äôs long-term growth outlook is no longer just about infrastructure ‚Äî it‚Äôs now intertwined with regulatory rulings, Ripple‚Äôs evolving stablecoin strategy, and whether legacy use cases still resonate in a market increasingly driven by speed and sentiment. Ripple‚Äôs Stablecoin Focus May Blur XRP‚Äôs Role Ripple‚Äôs internal strategy has taken a decisive turn. Rather than positioning XRP as a backbone for international payments, the focus has shifted to a native stablecoin offering ‚Äî a move many in the industry see as a bet on reliability and integration over volatility. This change, while potentially strategic, has also introduced confusion around XRP‚Äôs long-term utility. With Ripple pushing a new financial product to meet the same use case, some investors are questioning whether XRP can continue to deliver growth at scale ‚Äî or whether it‚Äôs becoming more of a macro-aligned hedge than a vehicle for rapid gains. Meme Coin Mechanics: MAGACOIN FINANCE Grabs Attention While XRP‚Äôs future plays out through courtrooms and regulatory filings, another player is being discussed in analyst circles and trading groups: MAGACOIN FINANCE, a politically-charged meme token designed to tap into culture, momentum, and speculative capital. Unlike XRP, which is tied to legacy ambitions and enterprise partnerships, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built for market speed. Its structure is straightforward: viral branding, fast-moving narratives, and investor excitement around high-multiple return potential. According to several market observers, early-stage metrics and buying patterns suggest that this token may be positioning for a major upside move. Though speculative, internal forecasts in some reports are starting to model scenarios where 20x returns are not off the table. Two Very Different Roads to ROI The 2025 market is shaping up to reward both structure and sentiment ‚Äî but likely not in equal measure. XRP represents a long-term bet on institutional normalization, built on regulatory wins and financial integrations. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, operates on fast cycles, driven by participation waves and meme-based conviction. For ROI-focused traders, the decision comes down to timing and risk appetite. Do they wait for regulatory clarity and ETF momentum to potentially push XRP forward ‚Äî or do they act earlier on a high-volatility asset like MAGACOIN FINANCE that thrives on attention and rapid entry flows? MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Cross the Finish Line First While XRP‚Äôs journey is far from over, the altcoin market rarely rewards patience over momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its viral edge and growing presence among early adopters, may be first to hit a high-multiple return mark in this cycle. Analysts aren‚Äôt comparing the two in function ‚Äî but in outcome. And the outcome that matters most to investors right now? Return on entry. Whether or not XRP reaches its full potential this year, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly making the case that it could be the one to get there first.

Completely wrong. Six months into 2025, Trump‚Äôs presidency has bulldozed nearly every assumption Wall Street made about markets, inflation, and the strength of the US economy. What was supposed to be a year of American dominance, driven by Trump‚Äôs low-tax and high-tariff policies, turned into something else entirely. According to Bloomberg, those policies triggered fear, confusion, and some of the wildest price action seen in years. The fallout started fast. Massive moves in sovereign bonds kicked things off. Then the Japanese yen climbed nearly 9% against the dollar. Emerging markets began attracting attention again. But the real shock came from where traders least expected: the US dollar, stocks, and Trump‚Äôs own economic agenda. All of it got shredded, and the market‚Äôs golden trades are nowhere to be found. Trump‚Äôs policies weaken the dollar and blindside investors At the beginning of the year, the bet was simple: Trump‚Äôs economic plans would drive inflation higher, slow down any chance of Federal Reserve rate cuts, and push the dollar even higher. That‚Äôs not what happened. A Bloomberg index tracking the US currency posted its worst start to a year since 2005. The selloff was deep. The shock was global. Things escalated in April when Trump rolled out his ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs ‚Äî wide-reaching, aggressive penalties that rattled investor confidence. The impact was brutal. Worries over a possible US recession took hold, and traders started to believe Trump might be actively trying to weaken the dollar to help domestic industry. That‚Äôs a problem for the American government. It still depends on foreign investors to finance its massive debt pile. A weaker dollar means smaller returns for those investors. It also means less faith in US assets. JPMorgan strategist Meera Chandan said the dollar‚Äôs fading connection to interest rates and equities might reflect deeper cracks in its foundation. Her team expects another 2% drop in dollar strength by year-end. Banks like Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale, and JPMorgan had all expected the dollar to stay strong through the first half of the year. They were wrong. They thought it would lose value slowly, maybe late in the year. No one called this early collapse. US stocks crash, rebound, and leave traders confused Wall Street was all-in on American equities in January. Everyone had their chips on artificial intelligence and the strength of the US economy. The Nasdaq 100 was flying high. Then the crash came. Between February and April, almost $7 trillion in market cap vanished from the index. The optimism died quick. Part of the reason? China‚Äôs DeepSeek. The AI startup came out of nowhere and suddenly looked like a real threat to American tech dominance. That was the first crack. Then Trump‚Äôs tariff decisions added real fear that the US economy could stall. A March survey from Bank of America showed fund managers had pulled out of US stocks in record numbers. By April, bulls were gone. There was no upside, no appetite for risk, but then Trump did what nobody expected, pausing some of the harshest tariffs, which flipped everything. The S&P 500 exploded to new highs, the economy kept humming, and tech stocks got hot again, thanks to strong earnings and consistent growth. Large investors jumped back in by mid-April, and they haven‚Äôt backed off. The chaos showed how fast Trump‚Äôs policies can change market behavior. He introduced tariffs that helped drive stocks into a hole. Then he paused them and turned everything around. None of it was stable. Every trader caught off guard was forced to rethink their whole strategy. While the US dollar crumbled, the yen got stronger. At the start of the year, investors were already betting on Japan. The Bank of Japan was one of the few central banks expected to raise rates in 2025, while others were looking to cut. That alone made the yen look good. But then Trump added fuel to the fire. As markets reacted to Trump‚Äôs trade moves and the rising threat of recession, traders looked for safety. The yen, always seen as a haven in times of stress, was the obvious play. By June, it had gained nearly 9% against the dollar. It was one of the best performing currencies all year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

While traders react to the latest swings, savvy investors are using this moment to reposition. In the midst of these moves, one project is drawing increasing attention from analysts and early-stage investors alike: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum Faces Congestion and Innovation Pressures Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform, but its performance is being challenged by both internal and external factors. Ongoing concerns over network congestion and the complexity of scaling solutions have triggered fluctuating sentiment. While Ethereum‚Äôs roadmap toward full scalability is promising, short-term uncertainty is leading some traders to reduce exposure temporarily. This has created a rare opening for repositioning capital into emerging sectors of the crypto space. Cardano Struggles to Maintain Narrative Momentum Cardano, known for its research-driven approach and proof-of-stake model, has faced difficulties maintaining investor momentum. While its development team continues to roll out upgrades, the pace of real-world adoption has lagged behind expectations. This contrast between long-term potential and short-term indecision is sparking mixed reactions across technical and fundamental analysis circles. For investors seeking more immediate ROI catalysts, capital is starting to shift toward opportunities with stronger short-term positioning. XRP Enters Regulatory Clarity Phase Following major breakthroughs in the U.S. and Canadian regulatory landscape, XRP has entered a transitional phase. While analysts applaud developments such as the Canadian spot XRP ETF and mounting approval odds in the U.S., the asset‚Äôs near-term performance remains heavily influenced by institutional sentiment and ETF timelines. With XRP largely viewed as a longer-term play tied to legal and regulatory outcomes, some investors are reallocating to opportunities that carry more aggressive upside during this rotation window. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gaining Ground in Smart Capital Circles Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a token of interest among investors seeking asymmetric gains. Analysts highlight its scarcity-driven token model, external audit confirmation, and rising traction in investor research platforms. Previous stages sold out instantly, and the project continues to show strong momentum without relying on short-term hype cycles. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is its intrinsic design for structural growth ‚Äî a rare quality in a market filled with fleeting narratives. Positioned at the intersection of political themes and forward-looking infrastructure, the token is increasingly viewed as a strategic allocation for those preparing ahead of a potential market-wide surge in Q4 2025. Final Thoughts The current volatility in Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP isn‚Äôt a warning sign ‚Äî it‚Äôs a signal. For seasoned investors, these periods offer a chance to rebalance and realign. And in that realignment, high-upside, early-position tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are becoming part of the serious conversation. Whether you‚Äôre planning for the next rotation or preparing to capitalize on the next wave of retail momentum, the smartest moves often happen during moments of doubt. As institutional and retail dynamics continue to shift, the time to evaluate next-phase opportunities ‚Äî especially those with structural potential ‚Äî is now.

Hype coins are being pushed aside, and coins with real systems and working platforms are getting more attention. Among the names catching eyes are BlockDAG, Avalanche, Cosmos, and Cardano. These projects are making noise with their features and long-term promise. Each one brings a different angle to the table, but BlockDAG is moving quickly with its system upgrades and offers an attractive entry price. If you‚Äôre trying to find the top altcoins to buy today, this article will walk you through the latest info on these coins and explain why BlockDAG may be heading for a major rise. 1. BlockDAG: High-Speed Growth with 2,660% Return Already Seen BlockDAG is gaining traction fast, with strong presale figures and regular tech upgrades. So far, the project has raised $323.5 million and sold 23.3 billion coins, creating a solid path forward. It‚Äôs now in stage 29, priced at $0.0080 for a limited time. Those who bought in at stage 1 have already seen their holdings grow by 2,660%. With a projected listing value of $0.05, the current price point could lead to 16x gains. BlockDAG‚Äôs system includes its X1 app, which has drawn in over 2 million users already. The rollout of its mining devices, like the X30 and X100, is expected in July and August. After the recent GO LIVE reveal, the project confirmed listings on 20 exchanges, helping with easy market entry. With full audits from Halborn and CertiK, the project‚Äôs system is also backed by strong safety checks. If you‚Äôre reviewing the top altcoins to buy today, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as a top choice with both strong numbers and rapid platform growth. 2. Avalanche: Dealing with Dips but Showing Future Promise Avalanche (AVAX) has been bouncing between price zones, currently near $16.83 after dipping into the $15.72 to $17.13 range. Some expect a short-term slide below $15.50, but others remain hopeful for a rebound. Despite recent price swings, Avalanche remains active in DeFi use cases and keeps building its user base. It still deserves a spot on any list of top altcoins to buy today. With real apps and strong usage in decentralised systems, it shows that its network is still strong. While quick profits may be delayed, Avalanche could turn into a great option when market conditions improve. Keep it on your radar as it works on regaining its footing. 3. Cardano: Near Support, Ready for a Comeback Cardano (ADA) trades around $0.54, down from its past peak of $0.60. The price has fallen 6.5% lately, but the chart signals suggest it may be oversold. If ADA holds the $0.513 support line, a recovery could follow. Its base remains steady due to strong building activity. With over 2,000 projects underway and lots of large transfers happening, Cardano continues to push ahead. One key metric showing belief in ADA is the withdrawal of over $932 million from exchanges in 2024. Although it‚Äôs not the fastest mover, Cardano remains one of the top altcoins to buy today because of its steady platform upgrades and active user interest. 4. Cosmos: Focused Work Behind the Scenes Cosmos (ATOM) sits around $3.78, with support close to $3.60 and upper resistance between $3.87 and $4.00. The coin hasn‚Äôt shown major upward movement lately, but updates are coming regularly. The project has made solid steps with the IBC Eureka and Tokenomics 2.0 changes, strengthening its spot in cross-chain and DeFi tools. Links with Ethereum via IBC and its part in CBDC pilots show that Cosmos is slowly expanding its role. Even with sideways trading, Cosmos remains backed by its strong network and active dev team. For those hunting the top altcoins to buy today, Cosmos could reward patient holders as new upgrades are adopted. Final Say! Crypto continues to evolve, and different coins bring different strengths to the table. Cosmos offers cross-chain power, Cardano keeps growing its base, and Avalanche pushes forward in the DeFi space. But among these, BlockDAG shines with strong presale numbers and fast tech growth. With $323.5 million raised and a clear target of $0.05 on launch, BlockDAG‚Äôs $0.0080 price gives room for over 500% ROI. Plus, early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth since the first stage. With its large user base, upcoming mining tools, and 20 listings revealed during its GO LIVE announcement, BlockDAG is building fast. If you‚Äôre picking the top altcoins to buy today , all four projects deserve attention, but BlockDAG may offer the fastest path to returns.

They‚Äôve survived bear markets, attracted institutional backing, and delivered real-world utility. But in a market that rewards early positioning, many investors are now turning their attention to a new crop of undervalued tokens. At the top of that list is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project that‚Äôs gaining momentum fast‚Äîand could surprise even seasoned holders of XRP and Ethereum. Ethereum remains the smart contract standard, Avalanche offers fast execution and interoperability, and XRP is reclaiming relevance in global payments following regulatory clarity. Yet for all their strength, the upside on these large caps is starting to look capped‚Äîat least in the short term. That‚Äôs pushed many investors to scan the presale landscape for the kind of opportunities that don‚Äôt show up twice in a cycle. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Catching Serious Attention MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as more than just another presale. With a DeFi lending model, a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, it‚Äôs hitting all the right notes with early-stage investors. What‚Äôs driving the buzz isn‚Äôt just the low entry‚Äîit‚Äôs the speed of adoption. Wallet growth is climbing, and analysts are beginning to flag it as one of the few presales with both momentum and actual mechanics behind the hype. Unlike some of the smaller projects riding on promises, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rolling out with clear fundamentals and a roadmap that aligns with current DeFi trends. Its early appeal echoes the breakout stories of past cycles, where coins like Shiba Inu and Pepe caught fire‚Äîbut this time with a more structured financial use case. It‚Äôs also outpacing other new entrants like Mutuum Finance and Solaxy, which, while promising in their own right, haven‚Äôt matched the presale traction or community engagement that MAGACOIN FINANCE has managed to ignite. The difference? MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a coin that understands how to turn hype into movement‚Äîand possibly movement into serious returns. Not a Replacement‚ÄîBut a Strategic Addition Investors aren‚Äôt abandoning Ethereum or XRP. But they are recalibrating. There‚Äôs growing recognition that the next wave of wealth in crypto won‚Äôt just come from blue-chip assets. It‚Äôll come from spotting the winners before the rest of the market does. That‚Äôs where MAGACOIN FINANCE has found its lane‚Äîan early-stage coin with just enough heat to suggest it‚Äôs not a fluke, and just enough risk to keep the upside compelling. Of course, this isn‚Äôt without risk. Every presale project walks a tightrope between promise and execution. But for investors who understand that calculated bets are how generational gains are made in crypto, MAGACOIN FINANCE checks a lot of boxes. It‚Äôs early. It‚Äôs cheap. It‚Äôs growing. And it hasn‚Äôt hit an exchange yet. As the market heads into the second half of 2025, the split is becoming clearer: the coins that already made their run, and the ones that still have room to surprise. MAGACOIN FINANCE may not be a household name yet‚Äîbut neither was Dogecoin, until it was.

On X, his announcement was accompanied by a photo displaying an XRP logo tattoo on his arm, marking his belief in the project‚Äôs future for life. The tattoo quickly went viral after crypto influencer Digital Asset Investor shared it on his X feed. He noted that getting a tattoo, especially for someone over 50 with a Harvard M.B.A., wasn‚Äôt just a casual show of support. It signalled a deep, long-term belief. Garlinghouse replied with just two words: ‚Äú1,000%.‚Äù Ripple ends legal war with SEC The long battle between Ripple and the SEC is winding down. While the company had initially resisted the court‚Äôs conclusion that sales of institutional XRP were securities, it has since withdrawn its cross-appeal. This is a tactical retreat, and it‚Äôs evidence that Ripple is ready to proceed. Earlier this month, Judge Analisa Torres denied a coordinated plea from Ripple and the SEC for an indicative ruling. With the case stalled, Ripple decided not to push the litigation on the final prong regarding institutional sales. Instead, the firm will respect the court order and look for lawful opportunities to distribute XRP to institutions. Brad Garlinghouse announced the company‚Äôs new posture in a public statement that they had closed that chapter once and for all, and they can now focus on the most important place ‚Äì building the Internet of Value. Ripple has used the term ‚ÄúInternet of Value‚Äù for a while now to describe its larger goal‚Äîfrictionless cross-border asset transfer in worldwide payment systems. Now, with the shackles of litigation off its wrists, Ripple is increasingly zeroing in on realizing its vision. Ripple drives XRP ecosystem growth with renewed focus Ripple‚Äôs pivot towards development & expansion is already paying off. In June, the XRP Ledger witnessed a more than 7x spike in daily active addresses, indicating higher network usage. At the same time, transaction volume is increasing, indicating more use of XRP in real-world use and trading. Market sentiment has also shifted. The buzz around a US-approved XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) is building after Canada greenlit three XRP ETFs just days ago. Analysts think there‚Äôs a 95% chance XRP ETF will be here soon. This would make XRP available to institutional buyers and retirement accounts, driving liquidity and confidence in the market. Ripple has released version 2.5.0 of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This release includes substantial power enhancements and sets XRPL apart from its nearest competition with Ethereum and Solana. The improvements include faster and less expensive throughput and compatibility with smart contracts, fundamentals for developers who intend to build DApps on XRP. The update also improves the XRPL‚Äôs chain interoperability, a requirement in the future of finance. However, in the growing layer-1 blockchain space, the upgrade signals that Ripple wants to be a force once again, not just for a payments protocol but as a dApp development and execution platform, too.

S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures both rose by 0.1%, while Dow futures climbed 130 points, or 0.3%, according to data from CNBC. The market is now grinding toward the end of a strong month, even with global trade threats still lingering under Donald Trump‚Äôs second term. Traders are reacting fast to every development, but so far, the worst of Trump‚Äôs tariff moves haven‚Äôt hit, and that‚Äôs kept money flowing into stocks. The gains come after weeks of volatile headlines out of Washington and Beijing, with investors watching every trade comment. For now, the fear that tariff threats might become full-blown policies hasn‚Äôt played out. That relief helped the S&P 500 rally 4.4% in June. The Nasdaq, stacked with tech names, is up almost 6.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added around 3.7%. This rally has been fast and loud. Just two months ago in April, the S&P 500 was nearly 18% underwater for the year. Now it‚Äôs closing out the month with a fresh four-month high, finishing Friday‚Äôs session 0.5% higher at 6,173.07, overtaking the previous record of 6,147.43. Indexes break records while earnings chatter grows louder The Nasdaq Composite ended Friday at an all-time high too, rising 0.5% by the close. The Dow finished the week nearly 1% higher. The move wasn‚Äôt just driven by lower fear around trade. Company earnings are starting to guide the conversation again. John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet, said more S&P 500 companies are giving optimistic guidance than usual. Of the 110 companies that have issued EPS guidance so far for the second quarter, 51 issued upbeat projections. That‚Äôs better than the five-year average of 42 and the 10-year average of 39. Still, it‚Äôs not all sunshine. 59 companies gave negative EPS guidance. Even though some companies are hopeful, the actual growth rate for Q2 is expected to be slower. John said the estimated year-over-year earnings growth is around 5%, which would be the weakest since the final quarter of 2023. That contrast between good vibes and slowing numbers is exactly what‚Äôs keeping traders from going all-in. Everyone‚Äôs bullish, but no one wants to be caught holding the bag. Europe runs ahead of Wall Street while Asia follows cautiously Across the Atlantic, European markets outperformed their US peers in the first half of 2025. The Stoxx 600, covering broad European stocks, is up 7% year-to-date. Germany‚Äôs DAX has soared 20%, Italy‚Äôs FTSE MIB is up 16%, and Spain‚Äôs IBEX 35 has also climbed 20%. Even the UK‚Äôs FTSE 100, usually more sluggish, is up 7.7%. But the rally is making analysts nervous. Some are unsure if Europe can keep up the momentum, especially with the eurozone‚Äôs own political mess brewing. Asian markets opened higher Monday as investors worked through industrial production numbers from Japan and South Korea, plus manufacturing activity from China. Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 was up 1.13% in early trading. The Topix index also rose 0.77%. Over in Seoul, the Kospi added 0.63%, while the smaller-cap Kosdaq went flat. Australia‚Äôs ASX 200 opened 0.3% higher. In Hong Kong, futures for the Hang Seng Index pointed to a weak open, standing at 24,182. That‚Äôs below Friday‚Äôs close of 24,284.15. Away from stocks, gold stayed soft. It dropped after two straight weeks of losses, with risk appetite taking over. Investors are waiting for Trump‚Äôs administration to finalize multiple trade deals before the July 9 deadline. That risk-on mood is cutting into demand for safe-haven assets. Early Monday, bullion dropped as much as 0.8%, before recovering some of those losses. As of 8:24 a.m. local time, spot gold was down 0.2% to $3,269.16 per ounce. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was off 0.1%. Silver and palladium also fell, while platinum rose. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

But while DOGE builds slowly on familiar sentiment, a lesser-known coin is quietly outpacing expectations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.03 in the fifth phase of its presale, now over 40% sold out. Phase 5 buyers are set for a guaranteed profit of 100% ROI at launch. The project has already raised over $11.2 million, gaining serious momentum even as broader market sentiment leans cautious. For those wondering what crypto to invest in ahead of the next breakout cycle, the narrative is shifting, and Mutuum Finance may be writing its first chapter right now. Dogecoin Eyes $0.17 Milestone Amid Meme-Coin Rebound Dogecoin (DOGE) has recovered back to approximately find itself hovering at around 0.166 and is further supported by a 6-7 percent surge in price over the last 24 hours as it broke out of an important decline you star. This rebound marks the emerging interest in retail, and better technical energy, and on-chain metrics and whale amassing suggest further short-term momentum. Nevertheless, DOGE is held back by resistance on overheads at about $0.17-$0.18, an indication it is slowly rising but does not have a giant breakout. With the meme-coin market picking up the buzz once again, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging quietly as an alternative DeFi project. Mutuum Finance Hits $11.2 Million Funded Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on the move in popularity terms.

47064261,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=169938,1751247024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/47064261.jpeg,"XRP, Ethereum, and Solana Might Miss Next Crypto Wave ‚Äî Analysts Favor This Perfectly Timed Altcoin",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-ethereum-and-solana-might-miss-next-crypto-wave-analysts-favor-this-perfectly-timed-altcoin/,"XRP, Ethereum, and Solana have long been seen as the engines of the altcoin market. Their names are synonymous with resilience, utility, and institutional adoption. But with crypto markets entering a new rotation phase, some analysts now believe these established leaders may not lead the next wave of explosive growth. Instead, attention is shifting to earlier-stage altcoins‚Äîparticularly MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äîwhich some say could mirror the breakout patterns that propelled Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin in past cycles. This isn‚Äôt a dismissal of the major players. Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance, NFTs, and enterprise-level applications. Solana has achieved rare mainstream visibility, backed by powerful investor narratives and growing retail enthusiasm. XRP, after years of regulatory uncertainty, is regaining momentum on the back of possible ETF listings and settlement innovations. These coins aren‚Äôt going anywhere. But what they offer in stability, they may now lack in raw upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE Taps Into the Early-Mover Advantage A growing number of analysts argue the next generation of wealth-building in crypto will come from projects still in their early stages‚Äîthose with untapped narratives, viral community backing, and enough momentum to ride a full bull cycle from the ground up. That‚Äôs where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in. Unlike the blue-chip names that have already logged massive gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE is just getting started. Its presale phase has attracted a surge of attention, fueled by a low entry price and an emerging base of early supporters who view it as a high-risk, high-reward contender. What‚Äôs drawing comparisons to the early days of Dogecoin and Solana isn‚Äôt just the marketing. It‚Äôs the timing. MAGACOIN FINANCE is landing at a moment when retail and institutional traders alike are hungry for fresh narratives‚Äîtokens with room to move and communities eager to rally. The core of MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs appeal is its blend of meme coin virality and financial utility. It‚Äôs not just a token riding hype. It‚Äôs being built on a DeFi lending framework that positions it to participate in deeper, long-term conversations around value and use. This dual identity‚Äîas both a speculative play and a product with planned functionality‚Äîis what some analysts believe gives it a shot at outperforming more mature coins that may now struggle to recreate their historic gains. Market Rotation Is Fueling the Shift Toward Early-Stage Altcoins The trend behind this shift is called capital rotation. As coins like Ethereum and Solana consolidate after massive runs, liquidity begins to flow into smaller-cap projects with room for exponential growth. That rotation is already underway, and analysts say the conditions are now ideal for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to step into the spotlight. It has a story. It has a base. And critically, it hasn‚Äôt yet priced in the kind of parabolic move that defined the last cycle‚Äôs breakout winners. None of this makes MAGACOIN FINANCE a sure thing. It‚Äôs still early, untested, and entirely dependent on sustained traction. But that‚Äôs also why the upside is being taken seriously. The same could be said of Dogecoin when it was trading under a cent, or Solana when it was just another smart contract chain fighting for market share. Early-stage altcoins are where conviction meets risk‚Äîand sometimes, that mix delivers outsized rewards. XRP, Ethereum, and Solana will still move with the market. They will benefit from ETF momentum, institutional adoption, and long-term ecosystem growth. But according to a growing chorus of analysts, the next real breakout may come from outside the old guard. In 2021, that role belonged to Solana. In 2025, it might belong to MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Among them, TRON, Pi Network, and Sei Network are not just surviving but thriving, driven by unique market conditions and investor sentiment. This detailed exploration provides insights into why these digital assets are currently in the spotlight. Enhanced with insights from Outset PR , this analysis navigates the complexities of the crypto market, providing a clear view of how strategic public relations can elevate a project's visibility and traction. TRON (TRX): A Model of Resilience and Potential TRON's consistency in the market is noteworthy. Amidst the usual crypto volatility, TRX has maintained a stable trading range, positing itself as a robust component of any crypto portfolio. The current trading range of TRON is between $0.26 and $0.29, with an immediate resistance at $0.31. Should TRX breach this threshold, it could target the $0.33 mark, translating to a near 15% gain. Such movements underscore its potential for steady gains. Technical View: The alignment of its simple moving averages and moderate RSI and Stochastic readings suggest a balanced technical posture without strong bearish or bullish biases. Thus, TRX presents a stable asset for cautious investors looking for gradual growth. Source: TradingView Pi Network (PI): A Dark Horse Poised for Recovery Pi Network's recent trading activities show significant volatility with a downward trend last month. However, current indicators and market sentiment suggest a potential recovery. Should Pi Network overcome the immediate resistance near eighty cents, it could climb to a more robust price point, offering investors substantial returns. Data Source: CoinMarketCap Sei Network (SEI): Indicators of Upcoming Gains Sei Network, though experiencing a recent dip, shows signs of an impending surge. The altcoin's technical indicators demonstrate a preparation for a bullish reversal, potentially increasing its value by 30% if it surpasses the $0.23 mark. Market Position: With a support level believed to be around 15 cents and recent upticks in weekly gains, Sei Network could be gearing up for a notable ascent in its valuation.

XRP Investors Believe So,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoin-finance-be-the-most-talked-about-crypto-by-late-2025-xrp-investors-believe-so/,"The second half of 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal time in the digital asset market. As established names like XRP continue to push through key resistance zones, investors are simultaneously identifying a new name making quiet but significant waves: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts tracking macro sentiment shifts say it‚Äôs not just another speculative project. It‚Äôs increasingly being viewed as a high-upside play‚Äîparticularly by experienced holders of long-standing tokens like XRP. XRP Momentum and Market Shifts XRP has stuck to the headlines throughout much of 2025 despite the constant volatility. It recently bounced back from critical technical levels, supported by institutional inflows and movements from large wallets. On-chain metrics reveal whales moving hundreds of millions without selling‚Äîa rarity that usually indicates conviction. However, with XRP‚Äôs renewed momentum, some long-time investors are reshuffling their bags. The reason? They want to secure a potential large gain before it becomes popular. Enter MAGACOIN FINANCE. A New Crypto Contender Catching Fire MAGACOIN FINANCE is being talked about more frequently in private forums, research desk briefings, and early-stage investor groups. It‚Äôs drawing attention not just for its mechanics, but for its timing‚Äîemerging at a point when capital rotation into fresh narratives is accelerating. Among the many altcoins vying for attention, one presale stands out: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Backed by a scarcity-driven model and a fixed token structure, it‚Äôs already attracting capital from sophisticated investors rotating out of larger-cap assets. Analysts have ranked it as one of the top presale cryptocurrencies for 2025 ‚Äî and early buyers are already sitting on substantial returns. With a verified audit, no VC control, and rising demand, momentum is building fast. Analyst Projections Fuel the Conversation Research desks have begun flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout in long-term strategy reports. Unlike speculative plays based on hype, this project is gaining traction on fundamentals‚Äîscarcity design, market fit, and investor behavior patterns. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a project that insiders can‚Äôt stop talking about. The meme coin leader, say evermore crypto analysts. And not because it is hype-driven. However, design and branding, as well as early adoption behaviour, draw attention. As more people become aware of a product, it is not surprising to see a surge in sales. Buyers are making high-conviction moves, which are gaining momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE has shown the first signs of breakout-level traction, and analysts believe it may become one of the top-three cryptocurrencies on all major exchanges by H2 2025. Why XRP Investors Are Paying Close Attention XRP investors are known for their resilience, research orientation, and appetite for asymmetric bets. As a group, they‚Äôve historically been among the earliest adopters of emerging trends, from regulatory arbitrage to utility-based ecosystems. What‚Äôs driving it? It‚Äôs not just meme energy. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly turning into a narrative coin of the cycle‚Äîone that merges pop culture, politics, and early-stage investor hype in a way that‚Äôs creating massive network effects. Unlike most low-cap tokens that vanish after launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE is hitting all the right psychological and strategic triggers. It‚Äôs got a capped supply, rapid retail demand, and a wave of community-led content fueling viral growth. Final Thoughts: Momentum Meets Timing The digital asset space is still rewarding entry and narratives going into 2025. XRP appears strong and is beyond the ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù stage while the buzz around MAGACOIN FINANCE is hard to miss. It‚Äôs not about who has what; it‚Äôs about when momentum and timing collide with structural scarcity. Many members believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the name that rocks the crypto circle as the year closes out.

Older Layer 1 networks keep evolving, while utility-focused platforms are now gaining strong attention. Alongside, regulatory changes and global company interest are shaping the way success is measured in crypto. Projects showing traction before launch, worldwide partnerships, and strong scaling ability are taking leading positions. BlockDAG is one such project, seeing fast growth in its presale and user base. Solana and XRP are seeing stronger market confidence, while Avalanche is focusing on expanding its GameFi network. Here is a detailed look at four ecosystems defining success this year. BlockDAG: $324M Raised, 2 Million Users, Strong Pre-Launch Ecosystem BlockDAG has reached one of the largest presales, raising over $324 million with 23.3 billion coins sold. Its unique system combines DAG and Proof-of-Work to handle 2,000‚Äì15,000 transactions each second. The EVM support makes developer onboarding simple. Its X1 Miner App already has over 2 million users, and more than 18,000 ASIC miners have been bought. A 100 million coin airdrop has started, covering testnet, presale, social, and referrals to build its ecosystem firmly. Its US-based sponsorship and 20 revealed exchange listings add strong backing. Currently in Batch 29, BlockDAG (BDAG) Network‚Äôs price is $0.0080, with early buyers seeing a 2,660% growth in their funds since Batch 1. The roadmap shows a six-week final rollout before its Q4 2025 listing, giving an important window for early participants. Solana: ETF Filing and Global Deals Lift Price Solana rose from $127 to $146 this week as geopolitical risks eased and institutional interest returned. The fresh filing of a spot SOL ETF by Galaxy and Invesco indicates deeper Wall Street involvement. On the development side, Solana has launched tools to prevent sandwich attacks and is working with Kazakhstan for tokenization systems. Major firms are also exploring Solana. Payment leader Fiserv plans stablecoin use on Solana‚Äôs network. Despite market swings, Solana‚Äôs DeFi locked value and daily user count keep growing, cementing its place as one of the most supported networks. Ripple (XRP): Whale Buying, Rules Progress, and Ledger Boosts XRP climbed from $1.90 to $2.20 this week due to heavy whale buying and important upgrades. Its new XRP Ledger 2.5.0 brings batch payments, escrow functions, and DEX controls, making it better for large users. Ripple has also secured over 50 US money transmitter licenses, supporting its stablecoin RLUSD launch. At Apex 2025, Ripple shared expansion plans, pushing market optimism. Analysts now target $2.40 as the next price level, with whale activity and clear rules supporting XRP‚Äôs growth path. Avalanche (AVAX): Gaming Subnets Drive Activity Avalanche price remains around $17.70, but its ecosystem is seeing big moves. GameFi subnets are becoming popular, with Beam and GUNZ recording high transactions. Web3 games like Off The Grid and MapleStory N are seeing millions of NFT mints and user gains. Daily transactions have crossed one million after recent upgrades. Developer attraction remains high due to grants and hackathons. Though its price has yet to rise with on-chain growth, many believe AVAX will jump once broader conditions improve, as it maintains strong developer support and scalable design. Final Thoughts! What makes the best cryptos right now ? It‚Äôs about strong networks, user numbers, developer work, and real-world use. BlockDAG is fast becoming a major name with a record presale and solid systems. Solana‚Äôs ETF filing and business links keep it in focus. Ripple‚Äôs legal clarity and whale demand make it stronger for the future. Avalanche‚Äôs GameFi success shows niche power. Whether it is early players like BlockDAG or major coins like Solana and XRP, traction before excitement remains the key.

The move , approved by shareholders on June 29, signals a significant departure of the company from previous financial policies , pushing it to the vanguard of corporate adoption of Bitcoin in Spain. A new solution for Bitcoin adherents, the firm has so far purchased 54 BTC, worth around ‚Ç¨5.8 million at current prices, and is also eyeing wider expansions. In a recent filing with BME Growth ‚Äî Spain‚Äôs growth division for small- and medium-sized enterprises ‚Äî Vanadi hinted that they wished to become the largest business holder of Bitcoin in Spain. Vanadi‚Äôs stock price went parabolic following the company‚Äôs Bitcoin play, increasing more than threefold in June. The increase marks an apparent increase in investor appetite for companies leveraging digital assets as a treasury strategy . Vanadi had said in its translated announcement: ‚ÄúSimilar to companies such as Strategy or Metaplanet, Vanadi Coffee redefines its business model and will use Bitcoin as its main reserve asset and accumulate large amounts of Bitcoin as part of its treasury.‚Äù The company is looking to replicate the high-wager Bitcoin treasury models of Strategy, which holds over 200,000 BTC, and Metaplanet. The Japanese firm has recently tweaked its balance sheet policy to the pro-Bitcoin side. Vanadi struggles to recover with a Bitcoin bet Vanadi‚Äôs had been struggling financially and operationally; its 2024 financial statement lists that it was operating at a loss of ‚Ç¨3.3m, an increase of 15.8% from the previous period. Competition and operating costs have eaten away at profitability bit by bit as the cost of coffee has risen ever higher, dragging the firm further into financial strain. Meanwhile, Vanadi was looking for more money to build long-term. It received two large investment offers in May. One was from a tiny local software consultancy, a one-man outfit in Alicante, and he offered 50 million euros. The other was Alpha Blue Ocean, an international firm that announced it would back 15 companies in 15 countries with over ‚Ç¨1.5 billion in investment. Critics raise concerns over Vanadi‚Äôs ambitious Bitcoin move Vanadi‚Äôs daring foray into Bitcoin is not risk-free. The company has a handful of stores serving espresso and pastries, and it is now dipping a toe in the complex world of crypto treasury management. But analysts and sceptics have raised red flags. They also note that Vanadi‚Äôs small size, slim operating margins and inexperience in crypto could be left open to volatility and then to scrutiny by regulators. Unlike Strategy, whose tech-focused leadership team has many years of experience navigating capital markets, Vanadi‚Äôs management has a steep learning curve ahead. And the regulatory climate for digital assets in Spain is also conservative. It‚Äôs not part of an activist group, but it is dynamic, and screwing any of this up in compliance or implementation would be expensive. Vanadi is not alone, though. Companies worldwide are adding Bitcoin to their treasury, which is becoming a trend. US-based crypto firm Bakkt recently revealed its intentions to purchase as much as $1 billion of Bitcoin. Tesla and Coinbase are among the companies that have pursued comparable treasury strategies. What sets Vanadi apart, however, is the scale of its ambition relative to its core business. A ‚Ç¨1 billion Bitcoin bet on a caf√© chain with six locations and persistent losses is an aggressive bet by any measure. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This is one of the biggest shake-ups of investment advice for a decade. Millions of British savers will be granted access to ‚Äútargeted support‚Äù under wide-ranging new rules to aid people‚Äôs quest for better returns on their money. Barclays‚Äô analysis shows that around 13 million adults in the UK are keeping about ¬£430 billion in cash, based on the savers who currently have more than six months‚Äô income in savings, which could be invested. Meanwhile, companies such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Vanguard have already started offering these services. FCA unveils new changes to the UK‚Äôs financial advice market The FCA described ‚Äúa once-in-a-generation change‚Äù to the UK‚Äôs financial advice market. This change will allow companies to suggest to a group of people sitting on so much cash to consider investing some in shares to earn better returns over time. The move comes more than a decade after the FCA‚Äôs Retail Distribution Review, which was intended to increase the quality of financial advice but has also made it more expensive for the population. This left many people unable to afford such services, resulting in an ‚Äúadvice gap‚Äù. The FCA said the new regime is a remedy created to help more than half of British savers , who said in a recent survey that they needed further assistance investing their money. Based on the regulator‚Äôs argument, 7million British adults have more than ¬£10,000 in cash savings and no investments. Hence, people between 13.5 million and 30.6million might gain from this focused assistance. The regulator also said it would consult on developing rules for this new activity of targeted support by December, enabling companies to make generic offers to groups of consumers with similar characteristics. This would no longer be caught by the burdensome requirements to give customers a ‚Äúpersonal recommendation,‚Äù such as undertaking a fully detailed suitability assessment. Apart from these new changes, the FCA also plans to introduce a second, more focused, category called ‚Äúsimplified advice.‚Äù In this category, firms will be able to make a suggestion on a financial product to a customer, subject to a short document detailing their ‚Äúessential relevant facts‚Äù ‚Äì without having to conduct the full suitability assessment. Several prominent figures acknowledged the importance of the FCA‚Äôs proposal Several prominent figures have commented on FCA‚Äôs proposals. Dan Olley, chief executive of Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK‚Äôs largest ‚ÄúDIY‚Äù investment site, said the proposals will be genuinely transformational in cementing a healthy retail investment culture in the UK. According to Olley, it was obvious that there are important moments in life when several people find themselves in the advice gap. He further elaborated that in this situation, one cannot afford financial advice but needs more help than the rules permit. James Daley, a leader of the consumer group Fairer Finance, said the changes were moving in the right direction. However, he insists that these proposals must be put in place with strong consumer protections ‚Äì and that customers should have confidence that these options will not lead to their exploitation. Jon Cleborne, the leader of Vanguard in Europe, also commented on the topic of discussion. Cleborne highlighted that FCA‚Äôs proposals are important for helping more people enjoy the benefits of long-term investing and reach their financial goals. Lastly, Verona Kenny, the chief distribution officer at Aberdeen Adviser, reported that over 40% of individuals acknowledged that they have done little to prepare financially for retirement. Based on her argument, the new changes appear to be the best opportunity in a generation to address this issue. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Despite its early presence and significant impact during previous market cycles, XRP has not mirrored the broader growth seen across the crypto sector over the past decade. Analysts suggest that even a partial recovery of its past market dominance could trigger a significant price increase. XRP‚Äôs Lagging Growth Compared to the Market Over the last ten years, the global cryptocurrency market has surged from $4.28 billion to over $3.28 trillion, a staggering 76,528% increase. Bitcoin and several altcoins have grown in parallel with this expansion, recording gains that align with or exceed the market‚Äôs pace. XRP, however, has not followed this trend. A key factor limiting XRP‚Äôs growth has been ongoing regulatory challenges, most notably its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These issues led to temporary delistings from major exchanges, restricting access for U.S.-based investors and stalling momentum during critical growth periods. Historical Market Dominance: XRP vs. Bitcoin In May 2017, XRP reached its peak market dominance of 31.33%, supported by a market capitalization of $15.28 billion when the total crypto market was $48.78 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap stood at $29 billion, giving it a 59.45% share of the total market. Since then, Bitcoin has grown in line with the market. Its capitalization has risen to $2.132 trillion, a 7,251% increase from 2017. XRP, on the other hand, has climbed only 743% during the same period, reaching a market cap of $128.8 billion. Consequently, XRP‚Äôs market dominance has dropped from 31.33% to just 3.96%, while Bitcoin‚Äôs has increased to 65.75%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Price Projections Based on Reclaiming Market Share Given the current crypto market cap of $3.28 trillion, analysts have explored hypothetical scenarios in which XRP regains a portion of its former dominance. If XRP were to recover just half of its 2017 market dominance, 15.665%, its market capitalization would rise to approximately $513.8 billion. With the circulating supply of XRP estimated at 59 billion tokens, this would result in a price of roughly $8.70 per coin. Notably, this aligns with predictions made by industry figures such as George Tung, who has suggested that XRP could realistically reach $8 to $10 under favourable conditions by the end of the year. While some commentators see $8 as a significant target, others argue that it still undervalues XRP‚Äôs full potential, especially given its historical market standing. What If XRP Fully Recovers Its Past Dominance? In a more aggressive scenario, where XRP returns to its full 31.33% dominance, its market capitalization would exceed $1.027 trillion at the current overall market valuation. Based on the existing supply, this would drive the price of one XRP token to approximately $17.40 . Although achieving such a market share would require a significant shift in investor sentiment and regulatory clarity, the figures suggest that substantial upside remains possible, even if XRP only partially regains its historical position. XRP‚Äôs current valuation appears modest when measured against its historical performance and the broader market‚Äôs growth. A return to just half of its peak market dominance would more than quadruple its current price, while a full recovery could propel XRP to levels not previously reached. These scenarios, although hypothetical, provide a framework for evaluating XRP‚Äôs long-term potential in a maturing cryptocurrency market.

With Bitcoin consolidating and major altcoins facing mixed momentum, presales with strong fundamentals are taking center stage. Among the most talked-about candidates are MAGACOIN FINANCE, Qubetics, and Mutuum‚Äîthree projects gaining traction for their unique structures and explosive early momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Momentum Meets Market Narrative MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly emerged as one of the most dominant forces in the 2025 crypto cycle. Its presale has already raised significant amounts, with each stage selling out rapidly and early buyers seeing significant paper gains. The project operates with a fixed supply model and has passed a full audit by HashEx, signaling credibility in a market often lacking transparency. Backed by asymmetric upside potential and a politically infused narrative, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been labeled by analysts as a defining early-entry opportunity of the year. Its structure resists inflation, and with no venture capital unlocks in sight, institutional and retail investors alike are watching closely. Analysts have noted its consistent traction in presale rankings and speculative forecasts continue to rise. Qubetics (TICS): Aiming to Bridge Web3 Fragmentation With over $18M raised during the presale which has sold hundreds of millions of tokens, Qubetics is entering the final phase of the presale. Qubetics is a cross-chain Web3 aggregator that aims to fix blockchain fragmentation, one of the ecosystem‚Äôs biggest issues. It‚Äôs distinctive value proposition evolves from its QubeQode IDE, an integrated development environment aimed at using decentralized applications across chains. Qubetics reduced the supply of the total tokens by more than 60%. This will make the tokens more scarce. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): DeFi Utility With Scaling Ambitions Mutuum Finance has garnered attention as one of the few presale projects that deliver on both innovation and investor confidence. The platform combines decentralized lending, a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, and a Layer 2 scaling model ‚Äî all within a transparent, CertiK-audited ecosystem. Investor incentives and smart tokenomics have propelled the project to raise significant capital in a short time. Analysts are watching closely as each presale phase narrows the gap between entry and launch valuation. With forecasts projecting multi-fold returns, Mutuum Finance is becoming a serious contender for investors targeting the DeFi resurgence in 2025. Final Thoughts: Presale Season Heating Up As Q4 2025 draws closer, a presale-driven momentum is becoming theme in crypto investing. MAGACOIN FINANCE, Qubetics, and Mutuum offer a scarcity-based political narrative, infrastructure-grade tooling, and innovative DeFi design, respectively.

The idea, first introduced in 2022 by game developer and XRP proponent Chad Steingraber, is gaining renewed attention as market conditions evolve and institutional interest in blockchain utility increases. Although XRP is currently trading around $2 , Steingraber maintains that a combination of institutional adoption, strategic asset utility, and supply restrictions could drive the asset‚Äôs value to unprecedented levels. It consists of three components: 1 ‚Äì Assets built on the XRP Ledger (Stablecoins are the ‚Äúutility‚Äù) 2 ‚Äì XRP becomes a reserve asset to power the utility 3 ‚Äì XRP is removed from public supply by institutions This is how IT WILL. https://t.co/d7ysY5euXc ‚Äî Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) June 28, 2025 Foundation of the $20,000 Projection Chad Steingraber‚Äôs $20,000 price prediction is based on three main assumptions. He outlines a path where XRP transforms from a speculative asset into a core infrastructure component for global finance. According to him, this transformation hinges on three primary developments: Tokenized Asset Issuance on the XRP Ledger: Steingraber believes the adoption of the XRP Ledger by governments and institutions for issuing stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will generate new demand for XRP. As the native token of the ledger, XRP would facilitate settlements involving these tokenized assets, thus increasing its utility. Use as a Reserve Asset: In this scenario, XRP would no longer function primarily as a tradable token. Instead, it would be held by financial institutions as a reserve asset , akin to how central banks hold gold. These reserves would support internal liquidity, enable seamless value transfer, and serve as backing for institution-specific digital assets. Absorption of Public Supply by Institutions: Steingraber suggests that over time, financial institutions will accumulate large amounts of XRP and remove them from public markets by locking them into private ledgers. This would reduce the circulating supply available for retail investors and could cause a significant price increase due to heightened scarcity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Role of Public Markets and the Transition to Private Use Steingraber views the current retail-driven XRP market as temporary. He argues that major institutions are unlikely to rely on public trading platforms due to transparency and regulatory concerns. Instead, enterprise participants would shift to private networks and rely on specialized liquidity providers to settle large-scale transactions securely. This shift implies that public trading of XRP is a transitional phase, with a more utility-focused institutional use case on the horizon. Anticipated Supply Shock and Institutional Demand Surge Another critical element in Steingraber‚Äôs forecast is a potential supply crisis triggered by rapid institutional acquisition. He claims that only around 20 billion XRP tokens remain in circulation after accounting for lost, burned, or locked coins. He warns that once institutions begin acquiring XRP aggressively, the available supply could fall to under 100 million tokens. Such a sharp reduction in supply, if met with sudden institutional demand, could lead to rapid price acceleration. However, he asserts that this demand would be driven by utility and operational necessity, not speculation. Global Competition for XRP Steingraber broadens the outlook by suggesting that competition for XRP will not be limited to U.S.-based institutions. He anticipates demand from international banks, sovereign wealth funds, and private entities seeking to integrate XRP into their digital infrastructure. He envisions XRP becoming an essential component of the global financial system. While the theory presents a compelling vision for XRP‚Äôs future utility, it remains highly controversial. It does not fully address the competitive landscape, where other digital assets also offer institutional-grade utility. Furthermore, the proposed valuation depends on widespread adoption that has yet to materialize at scale. Nevertheless, the discussion continues to attract interest, especially among XRP supporters who see long-term potential in its unique ledger technology and use cases.

With all 15 presale stages already completed and the Bonus Round ongoing, the project is drawing the attention of investors due to its AI-driven architecture and price increase. Lightchain AI presents a virtual machine to carry out AI tasks and a model that rewards users according to their computational value‚Äìfeatures that builders and investors prefer. As the July 2025 mainnet launch approaches, Lightchain AI is showing that traders are noticing the project due to its real-world usage and hype. Ethereum Focuses on Core Development and Long-Term Upgrades Ethereum has been focusing on platform development and long-term upgrades that are expected to make the network scalable, efficient, and user-friendly. The newly launched Pectra upgrade, which was launched on May 7, 2025, fixed several issues and added new features like the staking limit increase and wallet usage. In addition, Ethereum Next‚Äôs roadmap will focus on the Fulu-Osaka upgrade, which is expected to launch by the end of 2025 or early 2026, developing Verkle trees to reduce storage requirements and increase network efficiency. With developments like the single-shot finality which is expected to reduce transaction confirmation times, Ethereum‚Äôs place in the blockchain world is secured. Lightchain AI Captures Immediate Interest From Active Traders Lightchain AI has been gaining attention from investors due to its structure, which focuses on real-world usage, and its presale. With Stage 15 already completed, the Bonus Round offers fixed token pricing and increased value, especially after the removal of the 5% Team Allocation. Those tokens will now be used to support the development of the protocol, developer grants, and builder rewards‚Äìshowing a move that puts the platform first. Lightchain AI‚Äôs tokenomics is expected to build investor confidence, with 40% of the supply allocated to presale, 28.5% to staking rewards, 15% to liquidity, 6.5 to treasury, and 5% to marketing and partnerships. The platform‚Äôs improved gas system allows users to pay for transactions based on how complex the AI tasks they are carrying out are, ensuring usage without issues. For traders looking for functionality over speculation, Lightchain AI offers a better structure. Traders Act Fast‚ÄîAnd All Eyes Are on Lightchain AI Traders in the crypto market always go for any investment opportunity they discover, and right now, they are moving towards Lightchain AI. With its Bonus Round price fixed at $0.007 and with over $20.9 million raised, the project is attracting attention. What makes it special? Decentralized validator nodes, AI-powered infrastructure, and a developer Grant pool that is pushing development on the platform. With the mainnet launch and public code release expected to happen in the coming weeks, Lightchain AI is shaping up to be the next move for traders looking for opportunities in the crypto industry.

Yet, even amid this institutional breakthrough, one emerging project is generating powerful early momentum among traders: MAGACOIN FINANCE. While XRP‚Äôs ETF milestone represents a step forward for mainstream adoption, many are pivoting toward early-phase assets that offer greater upside. XRP ETF News Marks Institutional Milestone Ripple has come a long way to gain credibility among institutions. Purpose Investments has launched the world‚Äôs first spot XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker XRPP, providing investors with direct exposure to XRP in CAD as well as USD. Canada is already recognized as a world leader in regulated access to cryptos for institutions. This development cements Canada‚Äôs position as a leader in this field and sets an important precedent for others. Bloomberg analysts now assign a 95% probability to a US recession. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot XRP ETF when there is enough regulatory clarity and Ripple‚Äôs legal case is settled. According to the odds on Polymarket, the majority of predictions indicate that it could be approved by the end of the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Attention With Strategic Timing While XRP‚Äôs institutional story dominates headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly becoming a breakout force in the early-stage investment space. Its presale phases have seen instant sellouts, and analyst coverage is intensifying around what many now see as one of the most structurally aligned new tokens of the year. The project‚Äôs appeal lies in its architectural scarcity, security verifications, and early-mover advantage. These features have made it a target for capital rotation among investors looking beyond legacy plays. With the broader market seeking asymmetric returns ahead of the next major bull cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized not for its comparisons ‚Äî but for its independent setup and compelling risk-reward ratio. Market Dynamics Favor Early Entries Institutional attention is building around regulatory milestones, but seasoned investors understand that much of the explosive growth in crypto emerges from earlier phases ‚Äî before large capital fully enters the space. While XRP is set to benefit from ETF listings and long-term adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as an opportunity for meaningful portfolio transformation during the pre-mainstream window. Pro traders and early adopters are already reallocating capital into strategic assets with credible foundations and timing advantages ‚Äî and MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to top that list. Final Thoughts Ripple‚Äôs ETF progress is a defining moment for the asset class, offering XRP a new gateway into institutional portfolios. Yet, even as major tokens gain regulatory validation, a new frontier is forming ‚Äî one where projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are setting the tone for early-stage, high-conviction investment strategies.

The Bank of Korea reportedly informed participating banks that it will temporarily halt discussions related to the second stage of its central bank digital currency pilot, which was originally slated to begin later this year. A BOK official confirmed the decision to Bloomberg , citing the need for reassessment amid shifting priorities. New President‚Äôs Stablecoin Push Prompts Central Bank Caution The delay comes as newly elected President Lee Jae-myung places growing emphasis on stablecoins. Just weeks into office, Lee has proposed expanding the field of issuers by allowing companies with as little as 500m won, or about $370,000, in equity to issue won-based stablecoins.

Crypto Holdings Now Key Part of Personal Wealth for Millions in South Korea Meanwhile, South Korea remains one of the world‚Äôs most active crypto markets. Over a third of the population, roughly 18m people, are involved in digital asset trading. On particularly busy days, local crypto exchange volumes have surpassed those of traditional equity markets such as the Kospi and Kosdaq. A recent industry survey found that more than half of South Koreans aged 20 to 59 have experience trading crypto . Moreover, one in four currently hold digital coins. For those invested, crypto now makes up at least 14% of their total financial portfolios. In addition, many maintain wallets across several domestic exchanges. Enthusiasm around digital assets has also spilled into the stock market. Shares of companies linked to the Bank of Korea‚Äôs CBDC initiative have rallied in recent weeks .

Solana (SOL), XRP, and Avalanche (AVAX) have all shown signs of strength, but analysts suggest their near-term upside may be limited. Technical resistance, legal overhangs, and slow-moving institutional adoption are slowing momentum across the board. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building massive traction as a new force in the market. Its capped supply, politically charged branding, and aggressive tokenomics are positioning it as a high-upside entry point heading into the next wave of altcoin rallies. Let‚Äôs break down where each coin stands‚Äîand why many investors are shifting attention toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. 1. Solana Price Outlook: ETF Hopes, But No Green Light Yet Solana has still been favored by retail traders and developers. Speculation and anticipation of a Solana ETF increased. But no Solana ETFs were filed or approved by the end of June 2025. Which has kept the SOL price between a range. SOL‚Äôs rise has been dramatic, but it‚Äôs partly driven by meme-coin action ‚Äî which raises questions of sustainability. It is ok not to agree with some Solana price predictions for Q3 2025, most of which ranges $150 ‚Äì $175. If momentum picks up, a rally to $180 or $183 is possible. The downside risk is real. Without a confirmed ETF or clearer institutional backing, Solana could slide back toward the $125‚Äì$135 range. SOL price chart XRP Price Prediction: ETF Buzz Meets Regulatory Uncertainty XRP‚Äôs chart is already showing initial signs of a potential breakout, as was the case with Bitcoin before its recent surge. Regulatory certainty is backing sentiment, and Ripple‚Äôs continued expansion around the world is still propelling long-term optimism. Forecasts for XRP in Q3 2025 are $2.20-$3.50. If Ripple ETF is approved and institutional adoption becomes more robust, XRP price could hit $5.81 or even $8. Court delays and sector-wide withdrawals might, however, see XRP back into the $1.78‚Äì$2.10 support zone. Speculators trading the price of XRP are optimistic but wary. A breakout over $3.40 would validate a breakout, but the direction to go will largely depend on regulatory news. XRP price chart Avalanche Price: Signs of Growth, But Resistance Ahead Avalanche continues to attract attention for its real-world use cases. From New Jersey digitizing real estate on-chain to the launch of the Fan3 engagement platform, AVAX is proving its utility. However, the AVAX price remains volatile. Technically, AVAX is forming higher lows but struggling to break past key resistance around $18.50. If it clears this mark with strong volume, a short-term push toward $30‚Äì$32 is possible. The $36‚Äì$44 range will be tough to crack without major momentum. Forecasts for Avalanche price in 2025 average around $40. In a highly bullish market, some analysts suggest it could reach $65, though that remains a stretch unless sentiment improves broadly. AVAX price chart Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Getting Analyst Attention MAGACOIN FINANCE is going to be this year‚Äôs hidden gem! While existing altcoins languish in technical quibbles and regulatory lags, MAGACOIN is booming with organic demand and vigorous fundamentals. With a project capped at 170 billion, there are no secrets or hidden inflation. That fixed supply model is fueling early accumulation as demand grows among investors. Earlier phases were quickly sold out, and new buyers are flocking before listing on the big exchanges. Security is another major factor. MAGACOIN FINANCE is audited by HashEx, which has helped draw both retail buyers and large crypto funds. Lack of VC control also makes confidence in the project‚Äôs inherent worth that much stronger. Some analysts predict potential returns of 20x, particularly for those who get in early. Its branding ‚Äî bold, political and polarizing ‚Äî is resonating with a significant portion of crypto investors in search of a sense of vibrancy and identity. The Smarter Move for ROI While XRP, Solana, and Avalanche all have long-term potential, they are moving at a slower pace. Each faces headwinds‚Äîwhether from legal delays, ETF speculation, or resistance zones. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a faster, more explosive opportunity. Analysts tracking early market behavior say the token‚Äôs design, capped supply, and community-driven rise could make it one of the biggest gainers of the year. For investors focused on maximum upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the clear favorite in 2025.

This persistent inability to break through has characterized the cryptocurrency‚Äôs performance in recent weeks, leaving analysts to speculate on its next moves. Analyst Predicts Major Upswing Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has outlined two potential scenarios for the Bitcoin price trajectory in the near term, offering insights into both immediate volatility and a long-term bullish outlook. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit emphasized the significance of the current market conditions, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach between $120,000 and $150,000 in the coming months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 According to Doctor Profit, the market is poised for a breakout. He noted, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre standing in front of a breakout, one that has the potential to send Bitcoin into the $120,000‚Äì$150,000 zone over the next few months.‚Äù This assertion is supported by data reflecting strong on-chain activity, favorable technical structures, liquidity flow, and macroeconomic factors. While the long-term outlook appears promising, he cautioned that short-term fluctuations will remain prevalent. Two Scenarios For The Bitcoin Price Doctor Profit outlined two primary outcomes that traders should consider. The first scenario involves a bullish breakout from a bull flag pattern, allowing Bitcoin to surge past the $113,000 resistance level and continue climbing without a pullback. However, the analyst views this scenario as overly simplistic, suggesting that market makers typically prefer not to allow such parabolic moves to occur without a preceding shakeout. The second scenario, which appears more likely, involves either a rejection at the bull flag breakout or a liquidity grab at the $113,000 mark. This would potentially lead Bitcoin to revisit the lower boundary of the current range, around $90,000 to $93,000. Doctor Profit noted that this region is attractive because it contains significant liquidity and a notable gap in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures market. He views a dip to these levels not as a bearish signal, but rather as an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin. In his analysis, he stated, ‚Äú$93K is not bearish. It‚Äôs clearly a gift!.‚Äù Doctor Profit believes that this potential dip would not only reset market leverage but also shake out weaker hands, creating a more robust foundation for a subsequent rally. Macroeconomic Trends Favor BTC Looking at the long-term prospects, Doctor Profit highlighted that larger wallets continue to accumulate Bitcoin, indicating that major investors are positioning themselves for a significant upward movement. He pointed to macroeconomic indicators, particularly the M2 money supply, which suggests that Bitcoin remains undervalued relative to broader economic trends. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Notably, the Bitcoin price has been trading within its current range for 226 days, which echoes patterns observed during previous accumulation phases before major price breakouts. As Doctor Profit concluded, the Bitcoin price trajectory remains optimistic, with expectations of reaching between $120,000 and $150,000 in the foreseeable future. He notes that while there are multiple paths to achieving this target, a dip into the $90,000 to $93,000 range would provide a crucial opportunity for accumulation and set the stage for a powerful upward move.

Over the past week, both assets have shown comparable price movements, reacting to broader market conditions and geopolitical events. However, a key question for SHIB investors is: what would the token‚Äôs price look like if it achieved the same market capitalization as XRP at its all-time high? To assess this, we compare the historical peak market cap of XRP with SHIB‚Äôs current valuation and circulating supply. This theoretical analysis helps illustrate the kind of price growth required for SHIB to reach a new high, though it is not intended as financial advice. Recent Price Movement Comparison Both XRP and SHIB experienced a price decline on June 22, following the intensification of the Iran-Israel conflict. XRP fell below $2 to approximately $1.90 but has since recovered significantly. As of now, XRP is trading around $2.19 , reflecting a 15.2% increase from its June 22 low. Similarly, Shiba Inu dropped to $0.00001010 on the same date. Since then, the token has rebounded and is currently priced at approximately $0.00001153 , representing a 12.87% rise. XRP‚Äôs Historical Market Cap High Although XRP reached a price peak of $3.84 in January 2018, its market capitalization at that time was around $128 billion. However, a new all-time high for market cap was achieved in January 2025, when XRP reached a market valuation of $190 billion. This was despite the price being slightly lower, at approximately $3.34, due to an increase in the circulating supply resulting from ongoing token releases by Ripple through its escrow program. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Calculating SHIB‚Äôs Potential Price at XRP‚Äôs ATH Market Cap As of its current price of $0.00001140, SHIB holds a market capitalization of roughly $6.71 billion. Assuming the circulating supply remains fixed at 589.25 trillion tokens, reaching XRP‚Äôs peak market cap of $190 billion would require a substantial increase. To match this valuation, SHIB‚Äôs market cap would need to grow by approximately 2,731%. At this level, the price per SHIB token would be around $0.0003224, representing a significant rise and establishing a new record high for the asset. Forecasts from Analysts and Models This price level is not entirely speculative. Several analysts and AI-based forecasting models have already projected similar targets for SHIB in the medium to long term. For instance, Himanshu Maradiya, affiliated with the CIFDAQ Blockchain Ecosystem, told Forbes that SHIB could trade between $0.0001 and $0.0003 by the end of the year, contingent on favourable market developments. Meanwhile, a panel of blockchain analysts featured by Finder expects SHIB to gradually appreciate, forecasting it may not reach the $0.0003 mark until between 2030 and 2035. Beyond that, they anticipate the token could eventually hit $0.0008543. In contrast, artificial intelligence models like Gemini and ChatGPT suggest a slightly earlier timeline. According to their projections, SHIB could trade around $0.0003 sometime between 2025 and 2026. This analysis illustrates the price that Shiba Inu could theoretically reach if it attains the same market capitalization that XRP attained at its highest point. While $0.0003224 may seem ambitious, it is grounded in a logical extrapolation of market cap data and supply dynamics. Nonetheless, such projections rely on a range of factors, including market adoption, utility development, and overall investor sentiment.

This level has proven difficult for XRP to break in recent days, with the token getting rejected each time it approaches this zone. A confirmed move above $2.20, with prices holding steadily, could open the door for a rally toward the next target around $2.25. The next resistance area sits between $2.30 and $2.35. Support Zones to Watch On the downside, XRP has strong support levels between $2.10 and $2.07. If prices drop, these levels are expected to attract buying interest and potentially stabilize the market. As of now, XRP seems to be trading sideways within this range, showing no clear breakout in either direction. A Market Moving with Bitcoin XRP‚Äôs next big move could depend heavily on what Bitcoin does next. If Bitcoin struggles to break through its own resistance levels, altcoins like XRP could follow a similar path, staying range-bound for a little longer. On the other hand, if Bitcoin makes a strong breakout, it might give XRP the momentum it needs to move higher. Long-Term Outlook Still Positive Looking at the bigger picture, XRP has been holding firm within a wider price channel for several months. While the short-term trend appears neutral, the long-term setup remains bullish as long as prices stay above key support levels. On the bullish side, XRP now has over 7.1 million wallets.. The price may be taking a short break, but another big move could be coming soon. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.19.

After the United States and Israel bombed three of Iran‚Äôs major nuclear sites ‚Äî Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan ‚Äî there‚Äôs growing concern that Tehran may have used the chaos to hide its most dangerous nuclear material. That fear isn‚Äôt just about war though, folks. It‚Äôs about inflation, too. Nuclear uncertainty hits markets hard, and when oil traders and policymakers don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming, prices go up. Supply chains panic. Governments hoard. The bombs may have landed in Iran, but the economic pressure is global. According to Reuters , US President Donald Trump confirmed that the strikes involved bunker-busting bombs, claiming the sites were ‚Äúobliterated.‚Äù But the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is in charge of monitoring Iran‚Äôs nuclear program, said the real damage is still unknown ‚Äî especially at Fordow, the underground facility responsible for producing most of Iran‚Äôs high-level enriched uranium. Rafael Grossi, the head of the agency, said on Monday that the centrifuges were likely badly damaged, but there‚Äôs no clear evidence yet that the actual stockpile ‚Äî nearly 9 tonnes in total, including the 400+ kg enriched close to weapons-grade ‚Äî was hit. Tehran may have moved uranium before the first bombs dropped Grossi also said Iran had notified him on June 13, just hours before Israel launched its first attacks, that it was ‚Äútaking measures to protect its nuclear equipment and materials.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt give details, but officials think that means the uranium was quietly relocated. One diplomat familiar with the situation said much of the enriched uranium from Fordow appeared to have been moved ‚Äúdays in advance,‚Äù almost like Tehran was warned. A satellite image showing trucks lined up near the facility before the strike backs up that claim. Trump dismissed that completely. In an interview with Fox News‚Äô Sunday Morning Futures, he insisted: ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt move anything. It‚Äôs very dangerous to do. It is very heavy ‚Äî very, very heavy. It‚Äôs a very hard thing to do.‚Äù Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also said he hadn‚Äôt seen any intelligence proving Iran relocated its uranium. The search for the material is now a long process. Olli Heinonen, who served as the IAEA‚Äôs top inspector between 2005 and 2010, told Reuters that verifying the stockpile‚Äôs status could take months. ‚ÄúThere could be materials which are inaccessible, distributed under the rubble or lost during the bombing,‚Äù he said. It‚Äôll involve forensics, environmental samples, and complex recovery operations. Iran says it‚Äôs done nothing wrong. But earlier this month, the IAEA‚Äôs 35-member Board of Governors passed a resolution accusing Iran of violating its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Tehran responded by voting in parliament to suspend cooperation with the IAEA. It also accused the watchdog of helping justify the airstrikes by providing diplomatic cover. The IAEA denies that claim. Grossi admitted his team can‚Äôt confirm if Iran‚Äôs nuclear work is entirely peaceful. But he said there‚Äôs also no solid evidence of a coordinated weapons program. Still, without knowing what happened to that 400 kg of enriched uranium, governments are forced to make their own risk calls. Heinonen said transparency from the agency will be key. ‚ÄúMember states can then make their own risk assessments,‚Äù he said. Still though, no matter which side is right, it wouldn‚Äôt end well for the world‚Äôs economy.

Some technical patterns are making traders nervous, and a recent network upgrade (Shapella) released about $30 billion worth of ETH, which could increase selling in the short term. Cardano (ADA): Investors are Buying, But Controversy Lingers Cardano is trading at around $0.56 after falling 6% this week, though it‚Äôs still up more than 55% for the year. Large investors (also known as ‚Äúwhales‚Äù) are buying up ADA, and there are rumors of a partnership with Litecoin that could help its future. However, the project has taken a hit due to allegations involving its founder, Charles Hoskinson, and how funds from its early days were handled. That has made some investors hesitant in the short term. XRP: Legal Issues Keep Buyers Cautious XRP is trading at around $2.19, but its price continues to swing up and down due to its ongoing legal case with the U.S. SEC. Ripple (the company behind XRP) recently filed a new motion for a settlement, but legal experts aren‚Äôt confident that the matter will be resolved anytime soon. Meanwhile, XRPL‚Äôs tech upgrades are solid, but the token remains suppressed below its May highs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Presale of 2025 While other major cryptos fight to maintain footing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is seizing the spotlight as one of the most talked-about presales of the year, drawing in both retail and institutional interest at an accelerating pace. MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs presale is advancing rapidly. The previous rounds sold out quickly‚Äîseeing a flood of demand as investors chase the kind of early-stage upside rarely seen in the current market. Some estimates place potential returns at 30x or more for early backers if launch price targets are hit. With a capped total supply (reported at 170 billion tokens) and decentralized, inflation-resistant tokenomics, MAGACOIN FINANCE is engineered to drive long-term value. The project‚Äôs smart contract has been fully audited by HashEx, giving investors added security and confidence. Presale participants are offered high APY staking incentives and analysts are turning increasingly bullish on MAGACOIN FINANCE, pointing to strong fundamentals, supply scarcity, and explosive presale traction. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being featured on leading crypto platforms and is frequently highlighted in Q3 2025‚Äôs top crypto picks. Final words: Why You Should Pay Attention Now With Ethereum flashing bearish signs, Cardano under scrutiny, and XRP locked in a legal gray zone, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few projects showing true breakout potential to outperform them all in 2025. If you‚Äôre looking for high-growth potential before exchange listings, now may be your best shot.

Insiders Offload $13.6M With No Buying On June 18, Phong Le disposed of 8,400 shares of Class A stock, though he still holds over 16,000 shares, plus 10,500 in preferred shares across two series.

Experts are asking if Bitcoin is the ‚Äúsuperior asset,‚Äù as Saylor claims, then why buy MicroStrategy stock at all.

However, MSTR is up 27% year-to-date, beating the broader market, and MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin stash is now nearing 600,000 BTC. Saylor Hints at Another Bitcoin Buy Recently, Saylor shared the company‚Äôs BTC tracker on X, showing that they are just 7,655 short of 600K. His posts usually come right before a new purchase.

The price is consolidating and might aim for a move above the $2.220 resistance. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.20 zone. The price is now trading above $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $2.190 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2.220 resistance zone. XRP Price Eyes Fresh Surge XRP price formed a base above the $2.080 level and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.120 and $2.150 resistance levels. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $2.190 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even cleared the $2.20 level. A high was formed at $2.2191 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $2.20 level, but it is still above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.070 swing low to the $2.2191 high. The price is now trading above $2.180 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.220 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.250 level. The next resistance is $2.320. A clear move above the $2.320 resistance might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance or even $2.450 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.50. Downside Correction? If XRP fails to clear the $2.220 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.180 level. The next major support is near the $2.1450 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.070 swing low to the $2.2191 high.

In a recent update, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the company is officially dropping its cross-appeal against the SEC. In a post on social media, Garlinghouse shared, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what‚Äôs most important ‚Äî building the Internet of Value. Lock in.‚Äù He also said that the SEC is expected to drop its appeal too, just as it had previously indicated. Now, speculations are rising about whether the SEC might formally drop its appeal during a closed-door meeting scheduled for July 3, 2025. Why July 3 Matters According to the SEC‚Äôs official notice, a private meeting will be held on July 3 at 2:00 p.m. ET. The meeting is closed to the public and will cover various topics, including settlements, administrative proceedings, and litigation matters, which many in the crypto community believe could involve the Ripple case. The meeting details were published under the Sunshine Act Notice, which lists the agenda as including the ‚Äúresolution of litigation claims.‚Äù This has fueled rumors that the SEC might use this opportunity to officially vote on withdrawing its appeal. What Legal Experts Say Former SEC attorney Marc Fagel weighed in on the situation, clarifying that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing further for Judge Torres to do. She already issued her final judgment a year ago, so once both parties have dismissed their appeals (which the SEC still needs to vote on), it will go into effect.‚Äù Fagel explained that the only step left is for the SEC to hold a vote to drop its appeal, something that could very well happen during the July 3 meeting. What‚Äôs Next for Ripple and XRP? If the SEC drops its appeal, it would mark the official end of one of crypto‚Äôs longest and most closely watched legal battles. Ripple would finally be free to move ahead without the legal cloud hanging over it, and the XRP community is already beaming with excitement about what this could mean for the token‚Äôs future.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-30 04:19:54

In a statement issued Sunday, the Tehran-based platform said that wallet access was being reactivated in phases, beginning with verified users and spot wallets. Other wallet types will follow, contingent on the completion of identity checks. Nobitex urged users to complete verification promptly and noted that wallet balances would become visible once all security and data accuracy checks were finalized. ‚ÄúWe are working to resume withdrawal, deposit, and trading services for verified users with minimal delay,‚Äù the company said.

Any transfers to the old addresses could result in permanent fund loss. Users relying on automated systems such as mining rigs or saved withdrawal configurations were told to update their details or wait for new personal addresses to be issued. The platform‚Äôs gradual reboot follows a highly disruptive breach earlier this month. The cyberattack prompted Iran‚Äôs central bank to intervene. Authorities React to Hack With Curbs on Operating Hours for Domestic Exchanges Authorities have since ordered all domestic crypto exchanges to limit operations between 10am and 8pm. This measure aims to strengthen security and reduce the risk of after-hours attacks. Meanwhile, the pro-Israel hacking group Predatory Sparrow, also known as Gonjeshke Darande, claimed responsibility for the breach. The incident marks yet another escalation in cyberwarfare involving state-linked actors in the region. Nobitex handles the bulk of Iran‚Äôs crypto trades. It plays a key role in the country‚Äôs expanding digital asset ecosystem. However, the recent breach has shaken user confidence. It has also raised concerns about the strength of Iran‚Äôs broader financial infrastructure, especially as cyber threats grow more sophisticated.

BNB Drops & NEAR Stalls",https://thecoinrise.com/with-18200-miners-sold-blockdag-ignites-a-new-mining-era-bnb-drops-near-stalls/,"This week has been hard for Binance, and the Binance Coin (BNB) price chart shows it clearly with a big fall. The chart is flashing warning signals after dropping sharply. At the same time, Near Protocol (NEAR) price momentum is slowing down, with traders focusing on support levels as bearish patterns remain firm. On a separate note, BlockDAG (BDAG) is seeing massive growth by making mining easy on phones. More than 2 million people now use its app for mining, and 18,200 hardware miners have been sold, making BlockDAG stand out among popular crypto coins for its easy mining setup. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Chart Hints at More Weakness Ahead Looking at the Binance Coin (BNB) price chart shows a clear fall in mood. Its price fell from $697.55 on May 27 to nearly $600 now. Even with an 8% rise in stablecoin transactions, which are now over $749 billion on BSC, BNB stays under selling pressure. Charts hint at a deeper fall as it broke main support and formed a head-and-shoulders pattern. On the Binance Coin (BNB) price chart, RSI and Stochastic Oscillator readings show sellers still lead. Support could hold near $500, but a longer-term recovery remains possible. Near Protocol (NEAR) Price Momentum Weakens More Near Protocol (NEAR) price momentum remains negative despite a sudden 90% rise in trading volumes. The token has dropped to $1.89, a 15% weekly decline, showing the bearish mood stays strong. All major EMAs are pointing down, hinting that weakness may continue. Resistance is mild near $2.15, while $1.98 support is closely watched as a possible breakdown mark. No strong triggers are seen, keeping Near Protocol (NEAR) price momentum firmly weak, although some traders bet on quick rebounds. Unless the overall market lifts, downside pressure may keep rising. BlockDAG Hits 18,200 Miners Sold & 2M Users as Mining Demand Skyrockets BlockDAG is changing mining by making it easy for everyone. Its X1 Miner App now has over two million users mining BDAG on their phones. Alongside, 18,200 X-Series miners have been sold, proving strong demand for both phone and hardware mining. The miner range offers options for all types of users. For those starting small, the X10 fits well, while the X30 and X100 are for higher daily BDAG returns. Whether one is testing it out or building a full setup, BlockDAG gives simple tools for every plan without adding confusion. The next shipments are set for July 7 for X30 and X100 , and August 15 for X10. These devices can mine up to 600 and 2,000 BDAG per day. They focus on performance while staying quiet and compact. Rising sales show users want easy ways to scale mining without problems. BlockDAG‚Äôs coin is gaining attention, too. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1, with prices rising from $0.001 to $0.0276. Currently, the coin is priced at $0.0080 as a limited-time offer, drawing interest from those hunting early gains. A total of 23.3 billion coins have been sold, with presale funding over $324 million toward the $600 million aim. As more miners join and devices ship out, BlockDAG is getting compared with other popular crypto coins, and talks of a $10 future price keep circulating, keeping its spotlight strong. Final Verdict! Recent weakness on the Binance Coin (BNB) price chart signals caution, with sellers still strong. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) price momentum remains downbeat, with no clear lift seen. Both may need strong triggers for recovery. On the other hand, BlockDAG moves ahead with over 2 million miners, 18,200 devices sold, and its coin at just $0.0080 as a limited-time offer. With more devices coming and growing use, BlockDAG is shaping up as more than just another name; it is among the top popular crypto coins to track before prices climb and the window closes.

This dramatic spike is raising eyebrows across the industry ‚Äî especially among analysts watching for signs of institutional involvement. Could this be the early tremor of a larger wave of investment interest? Let‚Äôs dive into what this surge might mean for XRP and the broader altcoin market. XRP Hovers with Cautious Optimism as Bulls Await Stronger Signals Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between a little over $2 and $2.30, indicating cautious trading sentiment. Bulls are finding it hard to push past the $2.45 resistance, suggesting bears have some control. However, support exists just below $2, offering a safety net. Over the past month, XRP has fallen by just over 10%, hinting at potential for a rebound. If momentum shifts, XRP could aim for the $2.70 mark, marking a 17% rise from the current upper range. The RSI hovers near 52, indicating a balanced market, while the MACD is slightly negative. Overall, XRP's short-term potential hinges on breaking resistance, offering promising growth if bulls gain strength. Conclusion The $3.95 billion surge in XRP futures is more than just a number ‚Äî it‚Äôs a signal. Whether it stems from institutional FOMO or renewed speculative interest, the momentum behind XRP is building at a critical technical juncture. If bulls can overcome the current resistance zones, the path toward $2.70 and beyond becomes increasingly realistic. For now, all eyes remain on XRP as it dances between caution and potential breakout. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Both are positioned for long-term relevance, but short-term headwinds and broader market shifts are pushing investors to seek new narratives. Among the rising contenders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most discussed tokens in institutional research circles. XRP Approaches Regulatory Clarity and ETF Speculation XRP continues to capture institutional interest, especially as legal uncertainty winds down. With regulatory breakthroughs in Canada and positive momentum toward a U.S. spot ETF approval, analysts view XRP as entering a maturing phase. However, this maturity also brings slower, more measured growth expectations. Much of the anticipated upside is now seen as tied to ETF developments and macro adoption curves. While XRP‚Äôs long-term fundamentals remain intact, short-term gains may be more constrained as capital seeks more agile, high-leverage opportunities. Cardano Aims to Reclaim Developer Momentum Cardano‚Äôs journey in 2025 has been shaped by network upgrades and renewed efforts to attract developers and dApp ecosystems. Despite its academic foundation and proven sustainability model, Cardano continues to face questions about real-world traction and user adoption rates. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic but note that Cardano‚Äôs price trajectory is increasingly linked to execution. In a fast-moving market, the slow-and-steady approach may offer resilience, but it doesn‚Äôt always deliver the explosive returns sought by early-phase investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rises as a High-Upside Play While XRP and Cardano lean on established infrastructures, MAGACOIN FINANCE is generating attention for its rare early-entry profile, scarcity-focused design, and rising traction across independent research platforms. Previous stages sold out instantly, and interest continues to grow among early-stage investors seeking asymmetric upside. What differentiates MAGACOIN FINANCE is its strategic positioning: analysts see it as a token designed for structural momentum, not just cyclical waves. As capital rotates across the crypto space, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being identified as a standalone force that benefits from emerging macro trends, narrative cycles, and scarcity dynamics. With a model that rewards timing and strategic entry, it has carved out a space in portfolios seeking high-range forecasts over the next market leg. Final Thoughts The 2025 landscape is filled with both proven altcoins and promising newcomers. XRP and Cardano maintain their foundational roles, but the next breakout opportunities are increasingly being found in lesser-known assets with high-leverage potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands at the intersection of strategic positioning, investor interest, and market narrative alignment. For those recalibrating their portfolios ahead of 2026, this emerging token offers a rare entry window that analysts say could deliver meaningful upside ‚Äî especially as traditional altcoins trend sideways or consolidate. In a market driven by timing and positioning, the smart money is already watching where the next wave is forming.

He admitted he was initially late to the game, buying his first Bitcoin at $6,000. At the time, it felt expensive. But looking back, he wishes he had purchased more. WHAT IS EXPENSIVE? I was late into Bitcoin. I waited too long‚Ä¶.which may have been a good thing. I waited because I did not understand today‚Äôs modern money. So I bought my first Bitcoin at $6000 a coin. It was expensive. Today I wish I had bought more at $6000. Today‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 30, 2025 He shared his regret about not buying more gold, silver, and Bitcoin earlier. He blames his hesitation on being too focused on fiat money, which he calls ‚Äúfake money.‚Äù He also reflected on how many people regret not chasing their dreams, especially later in life. Buying Bitcoin at $107K Now that Bitcoin trades around $107,000, Kiyosaki acknowledges the same feeling, thinking it‚Äôs too expensive. Yet, he‚Äôs still buying more. His reasoning is quite simple, as he explains that if Bitcoin hits $1 million, he knows he‚Äôll look back on today‚Äôs price and feel the same regret for not buying more. That‚Äôs why he urges people to stop obsessing over price tags and instead pay attention to how much of an asset they own. He believes poor people tend to focus too much on price, while the wealthy focus on accumulating quantity. Whether it‚Äôs gold, silver, or Bitcoin, Kiyosaki says he doesn‚Äôt worry about daily price swings. For him, the key is building up holdings over time, not trying to time the perfect entry. [post_titles_links postid=‚Äù476645‚Ä≥] Power on One Satoshi Kiyosaki encouraged even small investors to participate. Even if someone can only afford one Satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin, he believes they‚Äôll be grateful in five years. In his view, a Satoshi bought today could carry significant value in the future. Based on historical trends, if Bitcoin continues to double in price every 4‚Äì5 years, even a small investment could yield big returns. A 2023 MIT study found that adding crypto assets to a portfolio could reduce long-term risk by up to 15%. Although he doesn‚Äôt claim to know whether Bitcoin will reach $1 million, Kiyosaki made it clear that in hindsight, every previous price point feels like a bargain. He describes the $107,000 Bitcoin as ‚Äúpriceless,‚Äù emphasizing the long-term potential of the asset rather than its current cost.

Former President Donald Trump also weighed in by praising Bitcoin‚Äôs role in alleviating pressure on the US dollar and subtly referencing the Triffin Dilemma. This is a core flaw in the dollar‚Äôs global reserve status. Meanwhile, Human Rights Foundation‚Äôs Alex Gladstein pointed out Bitcoin‚Äôs use as a shield against authoritarian control due to its censorship-resistant qualities and historical utility in pro-democracy movements. With increasing distrust in fiat currencies, ballooning government debt, and weakening institutional credibility, all of these narratives come together to present Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a growing pillar in both economic realignment and individual empowerment. Younger Generations Turning to Bitcoin Market analyst Jordi Visser offered a provocative outlook on the future of Bitcoin, and suggested that the disillusionment of younger generations with the existing economic order could be a major force behind the cryptocurrency‚Äôs long-term price appreciation. On a recent episode of entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano‚Äôs podcast, Visser said that people aged 25 and younger are becoming increasingly skeptical of capitalism and are instead advocating for a new system rooted in greater public spending and expansive social benefits. This generational shift, he argues, is being fueled by economic uncertainty, the erosion of trust in traditional institutions, and the looming threat of widespread job displacement caused by artificial intelligence. According to Visser, the growing frustration and lack of faith in the current system are prompting governments to ramp up spending to try and placate the masses‚Äîan action that inevitably leads to more money printing. He believes that this ongoing reliance on fiat currency and debt-driven economics will only strengthen the case for Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. ‚ÄúThe more people are angry, the more money the government has to print,‚Äù Visser explained. This cycle of monetary expansion will drive Bitcoin‚Äôs price higher over time, regardless of public perception or institutional resistance. He predicts that Bitcoin will increasingly replace fiat assets as it becomes a more trusted financial instrument. AI protest Visser also issued a broader warning about the long-term viability of capitalism itself. He suggested that the rapid development of AI and robotic technologies‚Äîespecially humanoid robots and autonomous vehicles‚Äîcould make human labor obsolete, further concentrating wealth in the hands of a few and destabilizing the capitalist framework. He believes this technological shift is imminent, with commercial adoption of self-driving cars and robotic labor likely within five years. These kinds of advancements, he said, will act as a wake-up call for society. He beieleves it will force a reevaluation of existing economic models and accelerate interest in decentralized assets like Bitcoin. Trump Says Bitcoin Eases Pressure on the Dollar President Donald Trump also recently expressed his strong support for Bitcoin by praising its growing role in the US economy during a White House press conference on Friday. Trump described the cryptocurrency industry as ‚Äúamazing,‚Äù due to its job creation potential and increasing use as a means of payment. He suggested that Bitcoin helps relieve pressure on the US dollar, a statement that digital asset researcher Anders X believes alludes to the Triffin Dilemma. This is a long-standing economic conflict where the issuer of the world‚Äôs reserve currency must sacrifice domestic monetary stability to meet global demand for liquidity. As the issuer of the global reserve currency, the United States is required to maintain persistent trade deficits in order to supply enough dollars to the global market. While this practice supports international trade and provides a short-term solution to global liquidity needs, it undermines the long-term value of the dollar due to ongoing money creation. This systemic contradiction fuels concerns about currency debasement and inflation. Trump‚Äôs previous comments about potentially paying off national debt with Bitcoin means that there is a growing awareness of the contrast between the inflation-prone dollar and Bitcoin‚Äôs capped supply. Critics, however, point out that even if the US Treasury were to acquire the entire Bitcoin supply, it would fall far short of covering the nation‚Äôs ballooning $37 trillion debt . With deficits continuing to rise, many analysts believe this debt trajectory is unsustainable and could ultimately lead to a collapse in the dollar‚Äôs value. Macroeconomist Lyn Alden captured this sentiment with the now-famous phrase ‚Äúnothing stops this train.‚Äù This reflects the consensus that governments will continue printing money indefinitely. This pessimism is already playing out in financial markets. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar‚Äôs strength against a basket of other major currencies, recently fell to its lowest level in three years. At the same time, US government bond yields are still elevated, which signals weakening investor confidence in the government‚Äôs ability to manage its debt responsibly. Bitcoin Rescues People From Tyranny At the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington, D.C., Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein addressed a room of American political leaders, and talked about Bitcoin‚Äôs critical role in countering authoritarian regimes. Gladstein pointed out that Bitcoin continues to prove itself as a powerful financial tool for people living under oppressive governments by offering a decentralized alternative to state-controlled fiat systems. According to him, when used correctly‚Äîwithout tying personal identity to transactions‚ÄîBitcoin makes it a lot harder for governments to monitor, freeze, or seize individual assets. Gladstein stated that one of Bitcoin‚Äôs most valuable features is its resistance to manipulation by authoritarian leaders. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be inflated or weaponized to exert control over citizens, Bitcoin cannot be hyperinflated, and self-custodied wallets remain outside the reach of state interference. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre self-custoding your Bitcoin, governments can‚Äôt delete or freeze your stuff, and they certainly can‚Äôt hyperinflate you,‚Äù he said. He shared that the Human Rights Foundation first recognized Bitcoin‚Äôs potential during Ukraine‚Äôs 2013 pro-democracy protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych. Protesters at the time faced frozen bank accounts, yet Bitcoin provided a way to receive financial support when traditional banking systems failed. Despite initial skepticism‚ÄîBitcoin was valued at just $100 then‚Äîthe technology proved very effective when it came to delivering funds across borders and into the hands of those fighting for democratic freedoms. Gladstein concluded that Bitcoin already helped countless people escape the financial reach of authoritarian governments and continues to do so. Since joining the Human Rights Foundation in 2007, he saw firsthand how the technology empowers people in regions where human rights are regularly violated. According to him, Bitcoin is not just a technological innovation but a tool for resistance, making it, as he put it, ‚Äúbad for dictators.‚Äù",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-30 05:30:00

Analyst Explains the Real Reason",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-is-bitcoin-stuck-at-100000-and-not-rising-analyst-explains-the-real-reason/,"Charles Edwards, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis company Capriole Investments, made remarkable statements about the stagnation in the Bitcoin price and recent market dynamics. According to Edwards, the reason Bitcoin is stuck at $100,000 levels despite the interest (FOMO) from institutional investors is due to selling pressure from long-term investors. Edwards stated that since the spot ETF launch in January 2024, long-term Bitcoin holders (LTH) have been selling to Wall Street and liquidating their positions. Stating that this situation is reflected in the media in different ways, Edwards argued that the real reason is these sales. The CEO recalled a prediction he made in April, saying that companies holding Bitcoin treasury would create a ‚Äúflywheel‚Äù effect, triggering a massive buying wave in the market and pushing the ETF narrative to the background. Edwards said that this effect is now clearly visible and many new companies are joining this trend. Related News: Latest Report on Cryptocurrency Owners in South Korea Released - Major Changes Are Underway, Here Are the Trends Examining on-chain data, Edwards explained that there has been a huge increase in the number of investors holding BTC for more than 6 months in the last two months, and that the purchases made by this group more than covered all the BTC sold by LTHs in the last 1.5 years. He evaluated this situation as ‚Äúincredible.‚Äù Edwards also stated that such aggressive increases are usually followed by price squeezes, which is a short-term bullish sign. However, Edwards noted that there is still some weakness in the general on-chain data, and stated that recovery is possible if this buying momentum continues: ‚ÄúCan Treasury companies continue this rapid pace of buying? I think this cycle is just beginning. If aggressive buying by investors with a 6-month holding continues, the market could overcome this weakness.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

What started as a politically branded, community-first token has quickly become one of the most closely watched opportunities in the early-stage altcoin market. Now, traders from legacy ecosystems‚Äîespecially XRP, Ethereum, and Avalanche‚Äîare paying attention. Despite the long-term potential of those established chains, many holders are shifting focus toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, lured by its capped supply, rapid presale growth, and aggressive upside projections. For those seeking asymmetric gains before the next altcoin run kicks into full gear, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a serious contender. Why the Rotation From XRP, ETH, AVAX Is Happening Now The story begins with timing. XRP has made major strides this year, thanks in part to ETF speculation and a strengthened regulatory outlook. But after a strong rally, price action has cooled into a consolidation phase. Ethereum, despite rolling out long-awaited upgrades, has also seen sideways movement as staking yields normalize and institutional adoption stabilizes. Meanwhile, Avalanche is working through its own recovery after a price dip earlier this year, but momentum remains tepid In a market built on momentum and narrative, that lull is prompting traders to look elsewhere. And MAGACOIN FINANCE is delivering just the right combination of novelty and promise. Its presale is filling rapidly. Some analysts are forecasting 25x to 50x returns from current levels, placing it in the same conversation as early Shiba Inu or Solana‚Äîprojects that were once overlooked, then exploded. What Makes MAGACOIN FINANCE Different Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings structure. Its token supply is capped at 170 billion. Smart contracts have been audited. And perhaps most importantly, there‚Äôs no VC control‚Äîthe ownership model is entirely community-driven. This transparency is catching the eye of seasoned traders, particularly those weary of dilution, slow roadmaps, or centralized decision-making in older Layer-1 ecosystems. MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs setup mirrors some of the best traits from previous breakout tokens‚Äîcommunity energy, early access pricing, and a narrative that‚Äôs generating attention on crypto Twitter and beyond. Utility and Listings on the horizon While most meme-inspired tokens lack long-term strategy, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with plans for a referral-based incentive model and a clear roadmap aimed at encouraging long-term holding and participation. These features are already drawing interest from Ethereum and Avalanche traders who are used to earning yield through protocol engagement‚Äîand now see early-stage entry into MAGACOIN FINANCE as a more asymmetric bet with significantly higher upside. Community growth has also been exponential, fueled by politically charged branding and a meme-forward marketing strategy. But this isn‚Äôt a one-dimensional campaign‚Äîexchange listings are reportedly on the horizon. And that‚Äôs where traders are hoping to catch the next big move. Historically, some of the most explosive gains in crypto come just before or after a token‚Äôs first major exchange debut. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be sitting right at that inflection point. The Asymmetric Opportunity For XRP, ETH, and AVAX traders, the calculus is simple. These are powerful projects with massive potential‚Äîbut at their current valuations, they‚Äôre unlikely to deliver 30x returns in a single cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, still sits in the early innings. That‚Äôs what makes it attractive to experienced investors who understand risk but are ready to reposition for a bigger swing. This isn‚Äôt about abandoning blue chips‚Äîit‚Äôs about timing. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE has the story, structure, and speed to justify the attention it‚Äôs getting.

While altcoins brace for significant bounce-backs, BNB Chain will officially roll out the Maxwell hardfork today, June 30, 2025. The upgrade aims to enrich Binance‚Äôs chain through enhanced efficiency and speed. BNB Chain @BNBCHAIN ¬∑ Follow ‚ö†Ô∏è Maxwell Hardfork goes live in a few hours, here‚Äôs everything you need to know üßµ üëá 8:24 PM ¬∑ Jun 29, 2025 130 Reply Copy link Read 56 replies First and foremost, Maxwell will halve BSC‚Äôs block time to only 0.75 seconds from 1.5 seconds, making it a sub-second platform. It‚Äôs noteworthy that today‚Äôs fork builds on last year‚Äôs Lorentz upgrade momentum, reflecting the team‚Äôs continued dedication to scalability, speed, and enriched user experience. BSC‚Äôs journey to efficiency: from Loretz upgrade to Maxwell BNB Chain is among the blockchain projects that take speed as a foundational element for success in the sector. It rolled out the Lorentz fork in April 2025 to reduce block times from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds. The update brought noticeable enhancement across validator efficiency, dApp responsiveness, and DeFi performance. BNB Chain flourished after Lorentz. For instance, it delivered only a $0.04 transaction fee. Moreover, Dune‚Äôs data shows BSC outshined all decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in daily volume. Source ‚Äì Dune Analytics Meanwhile, the Maxwell upgrade will take these advancements to another level. Node operators, developers, and users can anticipate smooth app interactions and swift transaction confirmations. What to expect with Maxwell hardfork? The latest upgrade transforms BNB Smart Chain‚Äôs ecosystem with three main improvements. Firstly, it introduces BEP-524 to slash the block interval to 0.75 seconds. That means doubling BSC‚Äôs transaction throughput capability. Users will enjoy accelerated offerings from minting and token swaps to smart contract execution and GameFi activities. Secondly, Maxwell enhanced validator messaging by enhancing existing p2p communication models. That will reduce possible syncing lags, boosting network stability even during faster activities. Validators will experience fewer delays when proposing and voting on blocks. Finally, the BPE-564 standard introduces two messaging mechanisms, GetBlocksByRangeMsg and RangeBlocksMsg. These will enable nodes to synch massive block groups at once, enriching syncing speed and reliability across the BSC network. The Maxwell update isn‚Äôt about boosting speed alone. It represents a strategic step toward a more efficient and faster blockchain future. The upgrade reflects BSC‚Äôs dedication to dominating web3 adoption amid renewed demand for responsive performance in NFTs, DeFi, and online gaming. BNB price outlook The native token displayed bullishness as enthusiasts brace for network enhancements. BNB trades at $655 after rebounding from the support at $642. Chart by Coinamrketcap Its increasing daily trading volume suggests a possible upward continuation. Continued bullishness amid the Maxwell upgrade and broad market uptrends could fuel BNB‚Äôs price to the next resistance at $720. A breakout might propel the token to the crucial obstacle at $760, beyond which BNB will shift its trajectory to bullishness. However, sudden selling pressure might cause the token to plunge to the support barrier at $520-$540.

Crypto markets were a little slower to react, remaining mostly flat over the past week and into the weekend. The Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation gauge, core PCE, showed that price increases accelerated in May, raising inflation concerns. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that he expects to see a pickup in inflation this summer, but reiterated his ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù approach. On Sunday, President Trump commented on the July 9 deadline for the 90-day tariff pause, stating, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I need to extend it, but could.‚Äù Economic Events June 30 to July 4 June‚Äôs ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Manager‚Äôs Index (PMI) is due on Tuesday. This report shows business conditions in the manufacturing sector and serves as a significant leading indicator of overall economic conditions. There are also job openings data due on Tuesday, which could reflect conditions in the labor market. Wednesday and Thursday will see more labor market reports, with nonfarm payrolls and unemployment figures released. These reports represent the number of new jobs created during the previous month, along with the percentage of people actively seeking employment. They are significant economic indicators, as the shift in the number of jobs is strongly associated with overall economic health. June‚Äôs ISM Services PMI, due on Thursday, will reflect business conditions in the services sector and is another leading economic indicator. Traditional markets are closed on Friday for the July 4 celebrations as we enter the second half of the year. Crypto Market Outlook Digital asset markets remained flat over the weekend but gained during early Asian trading on Monday morning to reach $3.46 trillion in total capitalization. Bitcoin has reached a two-week high, tapping $108,750 in early trading on Monday, but it faced resistance there yet again and fell back to $108,500 at the time of writing. The assed has struggled at this level at least five times over the past week where it has been rejected. Ethereum is doing a little better, having reached its support-turned-resistance level of $2,500 on Monday morning after a 2.8% gain. The altcoins were mostly in the green with minor gains, but Hyperliquid (HYPE) was leading the pack, adding 7.5% on the day to top $40.

In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Cyclop expressed a bullish outlook, labeling the current market conditions as the best long setup for Ethereum he has seen in years. Analyst Sees $4,000 Target This Summer Cyclop highlighted that Ethereum short positions have reached all-time highs, a situation reminiscent of a previous spike that occurred just weeks ago. The analyst noted that liquidity has been swept on both sides, creating a scenario where market uncertainty may actually benefit Ethereum. ‚ÄúMost doubt ETH and altcoins right now‚ÄîI‚Äôm betting on $4,000 this summer,‚Äù he stated confidently. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Cyclop outlined several key factors driving his optimistic stance. First, he pointed to the recent Pectra update, which has reinvigorated interest in Ethereum by enhancing transaction capabilities, updating security features, and improving staking options. This update has reportedly led to increased demand, contributing to a potential price surge. Moreover, Cyclop emphasized the broader macroeconomic landscape, noting that cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating beyond Bitcoin (BTC), with Ethereum taking a prominent role. The analyst suggests that major corporations and banks are beginning to purchase and stake Ethereum, further boosting trust and interest in the digital asset which could ultimately result in more demand and more price uptrends. Ethereum Rallies May Trigger Altcoin Boom On-chain metrics also favor Ethereum, with the cryptocurrency ranking highly in various categories, according to Cyclop. It currently stands as the second-highest by fees, leads in bridged net flows, and ranks third in stablecoin supply changes, showcasing its robust market position. Another critical aspect of Cyclop‚Äôs analysis concerns altcoins and the upcoming altseason, traditionally characterized by a rush of investment into Ethereum before spilling over into smaller tokens. He pointed out that historical patterns indicate that Ethereum price rallies often trigger broader altcoin surges, and the current market sentiment suggests that many altcoins are at their lowest ebb. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 While Cyclop acknowledges that a majority of altcoins may face significant challenges, he argues that ETH remains undervalued, especially with Bitcoin trading near $100,000. He has made strategic moves, reallocating some of his Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum and promising strong altcoins. His initial target for Ethereum is $3,000, where he plans to take profits, followed by a series of sell orders between $4,000 and $6,000. As of press time, ETH trades at $2,500, a 12% price increase in the weekly time frame.

This decline has pushed its market cap below $4 billion, despite several big updates on Pi Day 2. Pi‚Äôs Price Drops Despite Major Updates The Pi Core Team announced new features, including an AI initiative, upgrades to the Pi App Studio, and a new Ecosystem Directory Staking system that lets users stake Pi to boost app visibility. Other highlights included integration with Onramper, a new Pi Wallet upgrade, and Node version 0.5.2 with improved security. The price still failed to rally as no exchange listing was announced, and concerns such as the upcoming token unlocks and the project‚Äôs centralized control have yet to be resolved. Token Unlocks Threaten to Add $215M in Sell Pressure Between late June and July 2025, approximately 276 million Pi tokens, representing about 3.7% of the circulating supply, are set to be unlocked. This will introduce over $215 million in sell pressure to the market. Historically, similar token unlocks have led to major price declines, ranging from 30% to 77%, and there is a strong possibility this pattern could repeat.

Big Move Expected In The Year-End The next big day is scheduled for December 28, 2025 (Pi Year-End Summary Day), which is still several months away. If no strong market catalyst emerges in the near term, then a strong rebound appears unlikely. According to CoinDCX, Pi Network is set for a bullish second half of 2025. It may start around $1.20 in July and reach up to $2.80 by December. It may see a small dip in September before picking up again. Pi Coin Short-Term Price Prediction Pi Network started the month around $0.70 and dropped steadily, hitting a low around $0.42 mid-month. Around June 24-26, the price surged near $0.66 before falling again. Currently, it is trading around $0.52, a level that has been tested multiple times and may act as short-term support.

At the Digital Bhutan panel, co-hosted by Binance, officials laid out a clear vision: bring crypto out of theory and into everyday life. ‚ÄúTourists complain they can‚Äôt use SWIFT or pay easily. Binance Pay fixes that,‚Äù said Damcho Rinzin, director of the department of tourism. Rinzin added that travelers are already using crypto to buy local goods ‚Äî in one case, even groceries to cook their own meals. Bhutan‚Äôs ambitions remain modest, just 300,000 visitors a year. But it wants them to stay longer and spend more ‚Äî with Binance Pay‚Äôs 40 million plus user base as a lever. Binance CEO Richard Teng framed it as a shift from speculation to infrastructure. ‚ÄúThis is the first national crypto payments system,‚Äù Teng said. ‚ÄúThe average crypto tourist spends $1,000 ‚Äî nearly three times a regular tourist ‚Äî and merchants receive instant settlements,‚Äù he added. With over 1,000 merchants onboarded, and zero fees on Binance Pay compared to steep charges from other providers, Bhutan hopes to build a community-driven, tech-savvy ecosystem that aligns with its values. DK Bank, which played a pioneering role in Bhutan‚Äôs early bitcoin mining efforts, is now spearheading crypto adoption on the ground. ‚ÄúMobile and QR payments are already high,‚Äù said the bank‚Äôs CEO, Ugyen Tenzin said. ‚ÄúCrypto just fits,"" he added. ""And this is just the start,"" said Hobeng Lim, managing director of finance at Gelephu Mindfulness City. Gelephu Mindfulness City is a planned city in the country which merges technology, like blockchain, with culture, and sustainability., Lim added that they are many more blockchain-native projects in the pipeline, with digital assets formally recognized as a future growth engine. ‚ÄúCrypto is not a side experiment, It‚Äôs a core industry,‚Äù Lim said.

On the geopolitical front, the ceasefire between Israel and Iran appears to be holding, easing global tensions and dampening safe-haven demand for the dollar. Gold rose to around $3,280 per ounce on Monday, helped by a weaker US dollar. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.88% to surpass 40,700, while the broader Topix Index rose 0.8% to 2,863 on Monday, with both benchmarks reaching their highest levels in nearly a year. The Japanese yen strengthened toward 144 per dollar on Monday, approaching two-week highs. Meanwhile, data showed Japan‚Äôs industrial production rose less than expected in May, as elevated US tariffs continued to dampen the outlook. However, trade friction between Japan and the US remains unresolved, as the 25% US tariff on Japanese car imports continues to be a sticking point in bilateral negotiations, with little sign of progress. Japan‚Äôs housing starts plunged 34.4% year-over-year in May 2025, sharply missing market expectations of a 14.8% drop and worsening from a 26.6% decline in the previous month. Looking ahead, investors are turning their attention to Tuesday‚Äôs Tankan survey for a clearer read on corporate sentiment and the broader economic environment. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.42% rose 0.2% to around 3,430 on Monday, snapping a two-day losing streak, as weak manufacturing data fueled expectations of additional stimulus, and the offshore yuan strengthened to around 7.16 per dollar on Monday, recouping losses from the previous week, as the latest PMI data reinforced expectations of further stimulus measures. Official data showed China‚Äôs manufacturing PMI edged up to 49.7 in June from 49.5 but remained in contraction for a third straight month. The non-manufacturing PMI also rose slightly to 50.5, indicating tepid growth in services and construction. Beijing confirmed Friday a new trade agreement with Washington. The deal stipulates China will review export applications under its control rules, in exchange for the U.S. rolling back several restrictive measures targeting Chinese entities. Markets now await Tuesday‚Äôs Caixin PMI data for further insight into private-sector momentum. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.26% to 24,183 in Monday morning trade, extending losses for a third straight session amid broad weakness in consumer and financial stocks. India¬†( SENSEX ) fell 0.34% to 83,797 in early trade on Monday, erasing solid gains from the prior session, as traders engaged in profit-taking after the BSE Sensex hit a record high on Friday. On the data front, India's external debt reached a record high of USD 736.3 billion in the March quarter, primarily driven by an increase in non-government debt. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.53% to 8,534 on Monday, extending last week‚Äôs gains as investor sentiment improved amid easing concerns over broad US tariffs. The Australian dollar edged higher to around $0.653 on Monday. Domestically, the Melbourne Institute‚Äôs Monthly Inflation Gauge showed a modest uptick in June, reversing the previous month's decline and marking the fourth increase this year. Australia's private sector credit edged lower to 0.5% month-over-month in May 2025, compared to market expectations and the prior month's 0.7%. Investors now await Australia‚Äôs June manufacturing PMI for insights into the health of the sector and the country's overall economic momentum. In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended higher amid optimism for trade deals and rate cut hopes, overshadowing Trump's Canada trade talk comments. On the economic front, investors are closely watching key US labor market indicators this week, including job openings data, the ADP employment report, and the non-farm payrolls report, which could provide further insights into the Federal Reserve's rate path. U.S. stock futures rose on Monday as Wall Street aimed to close out a strong June, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hitting new all-time highs: Dow +0.57% ; S&P 500 +0.39% ; Nasdaq +0.55% .

Whispers are flying that Ripple might have secretly acquired a popular crypto exchange , and the community isn‚Äôt staying quiet about it. What started as a casual comment on social media has snowballed into full-blown speculation, with people connecting dots, making predictions, and trying to figure out if there‚Äôs any truth to it. And one name that has popped up several times is Uphold. So, Where Did This All Start? It kicked off when Ripple‚Äôs CEO dropped a major update about the company‚Äôs long-running legal fight with the SEC. Ripple officially announced they‚Äôre dropping their cross appeal , and the case is finally being put to rest. Naturally, this big moment got the entire crypto community talking. But what really caught people‚Äôs attention was when one of the well-known crypto exchanges jumped into the conversation on social media. A simple two-word reply from their official account was enough to send crypto Twitter into overdrive, with people speculating whether Ripple was about to acquire them. Crypto Rumors Move Fast Soon, posts and threads claiming Ripple had bought out a crypto exchange started flooding X (formerly Twitter). Even other exchanges like Kraken got casually dragged into the gossip. But one name kept popping up more than the rest, Uphold. RUMORS: DID RIPPLE JUST ACQUIRE A TOP CRYPTO EXCHANGE? NO CONFIRMATION YET ‚Äî BUT THE INTERNET‚ÄôS ON FIRE. IF TRUE‚Ä¶ EVERYTHING CHANGES. #XRP #RIPPLE ‚Äî Pumpius (@pumpius) June 28, 2025 Coinpedia‚Äôs Two Cents: Why Would Ripple Even Consider Buying an Exchange? Well, there‚Äôs actually a reason this rumor felt believable. Not long ago, Ripple CEO revealed they‚Äôve got over $1 billion in cash reserves specifically set aside for expanding the company. And they‚Äôve made it clear they don‚Äôt just want to focus on payments and liquidity anymore. Ripple‚Äôs ambitions stretch into areas like custody, compliance, and tokenization, and having an exchange under their wing would make a lot of sense down the road. That‚Äôs probably why the internet latched onto the idea so quickly. Ripple aspires to be more than just liquidity & payments. Acquisitions in crypto-friendly markets (like UAE and Switzerland), for expansion. pic.twitter.com/yTRMEasngN ‚Äî Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) May 18, 2023 Is There Any Truth to It? As of now ‚Äî no. There‚Äôs no official confirmation from Ripple, Uphold, or anyone else involved. The exchange‚Äôs cheeky reply on social media seems to have been nothing more than good timing and playful interaction during a huge moment for Ripple. That said, considering Ripple‚Äôs billion-dollar war chest and their stated plans for expansion, it wouldn‚Äôt be shocking if something like this happened at some point in the future. Crypto loves a good rumor, and this one checked all the boxes, mystery, money, and a touch of drama. While it appears to be nothing more than speculation for now, it serves as a reminder that Ripple is sitting on serious resources and big ambitions. Conclusion Claim DID RIPPLE JUST ACQUIRE A TOP CRYPTO EXCHANGE? Verdict False Fact-Check by Coinpedia As per Coinpedia‚Äôs research and review of official sources, there is no credible or verifiable evidence linking Ripple to the acquisition of Kraken or Uphold exchanges.

In a N ews interview aired on Sunday, Trump said the trade relationship heavily favors Japan and that the United States is getting a bad deal . ‚ÄúSo we give Japan no cars. They won‚Äôt take our cars, right? And yet we take millions and millions of their cars into the United States. It‚Äôs not fair,‚Äù Trump said during the interview. The president emphasized that the United States and Japan recognize the trade imbalance . Trump said he had described the circumstances to Japanese officials, who accepted the problem and the fact that the United States has a large trade deficit with Japan. Trump hinted that Japan could fill the gap by increasing its purchases of American vehicles, oil and other goods. Source: Companies, MarkLines, China Automotive Technology and Research Center and Bloomberg Intelligence The US has complained for decades that Japan‚Äôs safety and emissions standards constitute so-called non-tariff barriers to American cars. Japanese automakers have flourished in the American market, but carmakers from the United States have long had difficulty penetrating the Japanese market. Tariff tensions mount as US-Japan talks race against July 9 deadline As time ticks toward the July 9 deadline, under that agreement, if the Doha talks made no progress, the US would be free to impose 25% tariffs on Japanese car imports ‚Äî under a ‚Äúreciprocal tariff‚Äù provision the Trump administration has championed ‚Äî if there was no trade deal by then. Japan‚Äôs chief negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, extended his stay in Washington DC, for follow-up talks with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to stave off a trade rupture. The two men have had a series of discussions over the past several months in an attempt to address long-running trade irritants. On Sunday, the Japanese government released a statement describing the recent talks as productive. Akazawa and Lutnick reportedly had a ‚Äúfruitful discussion‚Äù and agreed to ‚Äúcontinue seeking a deal that benefits both the US and Japan.‚Äù However, behind-the-scenes reports suggest the talks are stuck on core issues, including how to measure market access for American cars and how Japan could offset the deficit to satisfy US demands. Despite the positive tone of the joint statement, there‚Äôs still no sign of a formal agreement or even a reprieve from the tariffs. Analysts say a failure to reach a deal could spark retaliation and damage bilateral trade relations. Trump threatens 25% tariff on Japanese cars in bold unilateral trade move Trump‚Äôs comments also signal a growing willingness to act unilaterally. He warned that the US could impose tariffs without any further discussion or approval from Japan. On Sunday, Trump said he planned to send letters to trading partners, including Japan, informing them of new tariff measures. He said he could send a letter to Japan outlining that the country would be required to pay a 25% tariff on its car exports to the United States. The blunt statement went beyond mere rhetoric. It is a continuation of what Trump believes prayerfully will be ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù trade policies to slash the US trade deficits through the empowerment of aggressive tariff design.

47078808,https://coinpaper.com/9744/stablecoins-and-crypto-cards-gain-ground-in-europe-s-everyday-economy,1751263200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Stablecoins and Crypto Cards Gain Ground in Europe's Everyday Economy,https://coinpaper.com/9744/stablecoins-and-crypto-cards-gain-ground-in-europe-s-everyday-economy,"Stablecoins and crypto debit cards are gaining meaningful traction in Europe‚Äôs evolving financial ecosystem, with recent data showing significant growth in both internet-based settlements and everyday spending. While stablecoins now surpass traditional card networks like Visa and Mastercard in onchain volume, crypto cards are matching ‚Äî and in some areas outpacing ‚Äî banks when it comes to micro-payments and online purchases. Stablecoins Leapfrog Card Giants to Become the Internet‚Äôs Default Settlement Layer The race to own the internet‚Äôs checkout button is over‚Äîfor now. Data gathered by blockchain-infrastructure provider Alchemy shows that dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies have already pushed past Visa and Mastercard in on-chain transaction volume by roughly 7%, cementing stablecoins as the fastest-growing payment rail on the planet. Stablecoins have seen ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù adoption and are becoming the default settlement layer for the internet, Alchemy‚Äôs head of engineering Noam Hurwitz says. Behind the numbers is a simple value proposition: near-instant, borderless transfers that cost a fraction of a cent and clear 24/7‚Äîfeatures legacy card networks still struggle to match. The result, Hurwitz added, is a decisive shift in how money moves online. PayPal, Stripe and Visa have all embedded stablecoin rails to trim costs and speed up settlement, effectively hiding the blockchain complexity behind familiar user interfaces. By leaning on Alchemy‚Äôs APIs, these firms can decouple the user experience from the underlying technology while gaining real-time finality, Hurwitz explained. A Trillion-Dollar Liquidity Pool in Treasurys One knock-on effect of stablecoin growth is a massive new buyer of US debt. Market leader Tether (USDT) generated an estimated $13 billion in profit last year and now holds roughly $113 billion in US Treasurys‚Äîmore than the government of Germany. Those reserve-backed holdings anchor the broader tokenized-finance stack, Hurwitz noted, turning tokenized money into the bedrock of an emerging on-chain economy. Momentum accelerated on June 17 when the US Senate passed the bipartisan Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act). The bill creates a federal licensing regime for issuers and removes much of the legal gray area that has kept banks and payment giants on the sidelines. Industry lawyers say the legislation could be signed into law before year-end, providing a clear runway for further institutional adoption. Traditional finance isn‚Äôt standing still. J.P. Morgan‚Äôs blockchain unit Kinexys is piloting a permissioned USD deposit token‚ÄîJPMD‚Äîon Coinbase‚Äôs Layer-2 network Base. The project promises interest-bearing balances, real-time liquidity and 24-hour settlement for corporate treasuries, positioning bank-issued tokens as a ‚Äúsuperior alternative to stablecoins ‚Äù for some clients. Fragmented Chains and UX Hurdles Remain Despite eye-popping throughput, the stablecoin landscape is still fragmented across multiple blockchains. Enterprises must vet each network‚Äôs reliability, liquidity depth and counter-party risk‚Äîno trivial task for treasury teams used to a single clearing house. Hurwitz argues that the next wave of adoption will come from Layer-2 networks purpose-built for individual platforms, stitched together by seamless cross-chain bridges. However, not everyone is sold on the idea that privately issued tokens can serve as ‚Äúmoney.‚Äù In its 2025 Annual Economic Report, the Bank for International Settlements said stablecoins fail crucial tests of singleness, elasticity and integrity, likening them to 19th-century banknotes that sometimes traded at discounts. The BIS instead backs central-bank digital currencies and tokenized deposits as safer foundations for digital finance. Layer-2s and Interoperability Alchemy expects most financial-services firms to launch their own Layer-2 chains over the next five years, each monetizing niche ecosystems while relying on stablecoins for final settlement. If cross-chain interoperability matures as quickly as liquidity has, stablecoins could underpin a more connected, always-on financial web‚Äîone where swapping tokenized dollars for tokenized securities or real-world assets happens in a single click, anywhere on Earth. Crypto Cards Challenge Banks for the Checkout Crown in Europe In related news, data from CEX.IO and other payment providers show digital-asset cards closing the gap with ‚Äî and in key areas beating ‚Äî traditional banks at Europe‚Äôs point of sale. Europe‚Äôs long-running love affair with cash is fading fastest at the lower end of the purchase spectrum, and crypto cards are seizing the moment. According to a 2025 spend-pattern survey released by London-based exchange CEX.IO, 45 percent of all crypto-linked card transactions in the region are for less than ‚Ç¨10. That tiny-ticket share rivals the cozy hold cash once enjoyed at corner bakeries, newsstands and transit kiosks, and now outpaces the slice claimed by debit- and credit-card issuers backed by high-street banks. The report arrives as the number of newly issued CEX.IO cards jumped 15 percent year-to-date, hinting that Europeans are warming to the idea of spending stablecoins and mainstream crypto assets the same way they swipe or tap a bank card. Digital natives aren‚Äôt just tapping in caf√©s. They‚Äôre checking out online at a pace traditional cards have yet to match. While European Central Bank data show that 21 percent of all euro-area card payments are remote, CEX.IO‚Äôs customers conduct 40 percent of their transactions over the internet. The elevated e-commerce usage mirrors findings from rivals Oobit and Crypto.com, both of which have logged outsized crypto-card traffic at online retailers, airline sites and app stores. Where the Money Goes: Groceries, Dining and Daily Life Far from the crypto-luxury stereotype, most purchases are decidedly ordinary. The average crypto-card transaction clocks in at ‚Ç¨23.70, meaning users are reaching for digital assets to buy sandwiches and detergent more often than big-ticket electronics. By comparison, Mastercard pegs the average European bank-card purchase at ‚Ç¨33.60. Behind the scenes, stablecoins fund roughly 73 percent of purchases, confirming their rise as a low-volatility medium for everyday exchange. Yet holders still dip into more volatile assets: Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and Solana collectively account for a quarter of grocery, dining and transport payments in the dataset. The asset mix underscores consumers‚Äô willingness to spend, not just hoard, their crypto. Cryptocurrencies used for purchases (Source: CEX.IO) A Cashless Future, One Tap at a Time ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing in Europe is that crypto-card users aren‚Äôt just experimenting with new tech ‚Äî they‚Äôre forming the habits that will define a truly cashless future,‚Äù said Alexandr Kerya, vice-president of product management at CEX.IO. He noted that average monthly payment volume across the company‚Äôs cardholders rose 24 percent in May alone, even as price volatility remained muted. Crypto card spending distribution (Source: CEX.IO) Those habits are reinforced by a wave of new offerings. Kraken and Mastercard launched a co-branded debit card last year; meme-coin ecosystem Floki followed suit with a 13-asset card this spring. Fintechs have responded by deepening rewards programs and upping transaction limits, hoping to keep pace with a customer base that clearly values immediate settlement and blockchain transparency. Not everyone is cheering. UK banking giant Barclays announced it will block crypto purchases on Barclaycard credit lines starting next month, citing fears of unsustainable debt loads and the absence of investor protections. The lender warned customers that digital-asset transactions fall outside the safety net of the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The move signals a widening philosophical divide: fintechs lean on real-time blockchain settlement to reduce fraud and chargebacks, whereas legacy banks remain wary of an asset class still navigating regulatory scrutiny and sharp market swings. The Road to Parity ‚Äî and Beyond Three trends suggest crypto cards could soon match, or surpass, traditional bank cards across more spending categories: 1. Merchant Acceptance Large payment processors now route crypto authorization through the same EMV rails they use for fiat transactions, minimizing friction for shops and restaurants. 2. Regulatory Clarity The European Union‚Äôs Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework rolls out this year, creating a passportable license that card issuers can leverage continent-wide. 3. Stablecoin Maturity With tokenized euros and CBDC pilots advancing, volatility concerns around crypto payments may recede, opening the door for payroll deposits and utility billing. If those forces converge, crypto cards might not just rival bank plastics for micro-spending; they could become the default in a post-cash Europe‚Äîone tap, scan or click at a time.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-30 06:00:00

According to a Bloomberg report citing an unnamed Bank of Korea official, the central bank has suspended plans for the second phase of its CBDC pilot, which had been scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2025. Participating banks have reportedly been informed that discussions would be temporarily paused. Authorities are reevaluating the role of a CBDC as they are pivoting toward regulating private stablecoin issuers, the official noted. The Bank of Korea had been preparing to expand its CBDC testing under ‚ÄúProject Han River,‚Äù which began earlier this year with a consortium of seven banks. The second phase was expected to include features such as peer-to-peer transfers and merchant payments. However, banks reportedly raised concerns over high costs and the lack of a clear commercialization plan, prompting the central bank to reassess the project‚Äôs future. Instead, the central bank will continue to monitor progress on a legislative proposal that would establish a regulatory framework for Korean won-based stablecoins. The proposed legislation, introduced under the Digital Asset Basic Act , outlines licensing requirements for issuers and includes provisions for reserve management and user protection. You might also like: South Korean stocks ride crypto wave as new president backs won-based tokens The move aligns with President Lee Jae-myung‚Äôs broader agenda to accelerate stablecoin development . Since taking office earlier this month, Lee has prioritised the institutionalisation of KRW-backed digital tokens as a strategic financial initiative. His administration supports a licensing regime that would permit companies with as little as ‚Ç©500 million ($370,000) in equity capital to issue stablecoins, subject to regulatory approval. Democratic Party leaders have framed the rollout of won-denominated stablecoins as essential to preserving South Korea‚Äôs monetary sovereignty. Party lawmakers argue that local crypto markets are overly reliant on U.S. dollar-pegged assets like USDT and USDC, and warn that continued dominance by foreign stablecoins could undermine domestic financial policy. These stablecoins reportedly accounted for over ‚Ç©57 trillion ($42 billion) in trading volume during the first quarter of 2025. Min Byeong-deok, head of the Digital Asset Committee, has warned that without swift action, Korea may lag in the race for stablecoin leadership. He contends that the market for stablecoins could surpass even artificial intelligence or semiconductors and has called for regulatory measures to support issuance by compliant entities. Commercial banks have already responding to this policy shift. Eight of the country‚Äôs largest banks, including KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Woori, and Nonghyup, have launched a joint initiative to issue a KRW-pegged stablecoin.

Both have seen institutional interest, exchange integration, and community support over the years. But in 2025, they‚Äôre no longer delivering the sharp price movement they once did‚Äîand that‚Äôs shifting analyst attention elsewhere. One project catching that spotlight is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale altcoin that‚Äôs building traction while bigger names tread water. Solana and XRP Face Slower Roads Ahead For Solana, 2025 hasn‚Äôt brought the momentum many expected. Although the network remains fast and cost-effective, cracks are starting to show. DeFi activity is slipping, and user funds are flowing toward alternative Layer 1s offering newer incentives. While Solana still benefits from its speed and branding, the growth curve is flattening. Price projections have been scaled back, and new narratives around the token are scarce. XRP has managed to claw its way back into the conversation, thanks largely to regulatory progress and ETF speculation. But for all the optimism, its price remains constrained. XRP‚Äôs market cap now sits above $130 billion, and that sheer size makes explosive growth difficult. Analysts expect steady appreciation, not the kind of breakout rallies that defined its earlier years. The issue for both assets is simple: they‚Äôve matured. What once made them speculative rockets now makes them stable‚Äîbut less exciting‚Äîholds. In today‚Äôs market, where investors are actively rotating capital into faster-moving opportunities, being ‚Äúsafe‚Äù often translates to being overlooked. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Case for a Timely, High-Upside Bet That‚Äôs why analysts are now pointing toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. Still in its early stages, this project is drawing comparisons to coins like Solana and Dogecoin before their first major runs. Its presale has attracted thousands of participants, and the price is still below a cent‚Äîan entry point that gives retail investors room to move before major listings occur. The appeal is straightforward. MAGACOIN FINANCE has a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, a transparent smart contract audited by HashEx, and no vesting schedule or venture capital drag. That means early buyers won‚Äôt be undercut post-launch, a rare structure in today‚Äôs market. As listings approach, even modest demand could send the price sharply higher‚Äîa dynamic that just doesn‚Äôt exist anymore for top-tier coins. What‚Äôs especially important is timing. Crypto tends to reward projects that launch into the right market conditions. With capital moving away from large caps and toward smaller, narrative-driven plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned to benefit from that trend. Its growth has been fueled by a grassroots community‚Äînot institutional money‚Äîwhich gives it flexibility and viral potential. Of course, there‚Äôs risk. The project is new, and like all presales, it depends on execution. But for investors with an appetite for higher upside and early access, the structure and momentum behind MAGACOIN FINANCE have made it one of the most talked-about altcoin opportunities of the year. FINAL WORDS Solana and XRP may still deliver in the long run. They offer credibility and infrastructure. But when it comes to finding breakout returns in this cycle, more analysts are turning to projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äîwhere the window for exponential growth hasn‚Äôt closed yet.

Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis: ARB is currently changing hands at $0.3616, marking a notable u-turn from its 24-hour low of $0.3058 and brushing against an intraday high of $0.3891. On the 4-hour chart, the price has broken above the key resistance at $0.3332, now turned support, and is sustaining gains above the mid-Bollinger band at $0.3171. Bollinger Bands have expanded sharply, indicating rising volatility, while the price is currently hovering near the upper band. The RSI reading of 76.22 indicates overbought conditions, which may call for a minor pullback before another leg higher. However, the surge in volume suggests buyers are still firmly in control. Looking ahead, the immediate resistance lies at $0.420, followed by a stronger upper bar at $0.450, which aligns with a key supply zone visible on the chart. If bulls maintain momentum and breach these levels, ARB could confirm a short-term breakout trend. Conversely, a break below $0.3332 may expose the token to downside risk, making $0.325 a critical stop-loss level for traders. Holding some ARB, and curious about its long-term forecast? Read our Arbitrum (ARB) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Why is Arbitrum price surging today?

If that happens, his original $6,000 could become $300,000 to $400,000, and he‚Äôs already calling it his ‚Äúearly retirement play.‚Äù Mutuum‚Äôs upcoming beta platform launch, real DeFi lending model, and expected listings on top exchanges are fueling long-term confidence. If you‚Äôre seeing this at $0.03, you‚Äôre already late to Phase 1, 2, 3, and 4‚Äîand this price won‚Äôt return. Tokenomics built to reward long-term commitment Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is introducing one of the most dynamic systems in the DeFi lending market, where every function is designed to push value back to its ecosystem participants. At the heart of it lies the mtToken model‚Äîa mechanism that will turn idle deposits into yield-generating, multi-use instruments. When users contribute crypto assets into lending pools, they will receive mtTokens representing their position. These tokens will grow in value as borrowers tap into the liquidity, allowing holders to watch their interest compound without ever needing to claim it manually. Beyond interest accrual, mtTokens will also serve as collateral for new borrowing opportunities, creating active use cases for otherwise passive holdings. This flexibility will give users more options to generate returns and manage risk while maintaining full ownership of their assets. And for those looking to maximize value, staking mtTokens in designated contracts will unlock access to protocol revenue distribution. A portion of all fees earned by the protocol will be used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market and redistribute them to active mtToken stakers, creating a cycle of steady demand and consistent token redistribution. The token supply will be 4 billion units, limiting dilution and supporting long-term value preservation. No inflation, no arbitrary unlock schedules‚Äîjust a clean, utility-driven model backed by real DeFi mechanics. For investors looking to hold through the next cycle, this structure offers far more upside than overbought Top 20 assets already sitting near multi-billion-dollar valuations. A roadmap that scales with time, not speculation While many projects launch with nothing but vague intentions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has laid out a detailed roadmap that aligns development with real milestones. Phase 1 has already set the groundwork in major‚Äîinitiating presale, launching the $100,000 giveaway , building community infrastructure, and completing a CertiK audit that returned high marks with a 95 Token Score and 77 Skynet Score. In Phase 2, the team will go deep into development, focusing on the core smart contracts, frontend DApp, analytics systems, and internal risk management. Once Phase 3 begins, users will see the launch of the platform‚Äôs beta version on testnet‚Äîbringing lending mechanics into a live environment for multi-stage audits and final tuning. Regulatory alignment and documentation finalization will be handled in parallel, ensuring the protocol launches with compliance and clarity. Phase 4 will mark the unveiling of the complete platform, featuring live staking, token exchange access, and the introduction of institutional-level lending features. At that point, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will enter the same category as some of DeFi‚Äôs largest players‚Äîexcept early adopters will already have locked in at a $0.03 price point. The long-term architecture includes Layer-2 integration to support low-cost, high-speed transactions, making the platform usable at scale and competitive with centralized lenders. And with a decentralized stablecoin built directly into the system‚Äîminted when collateral is deposited and burned on repayment‚ÄîMutuum is preparing to offer a stable, overcollateralized alternative to existing lending-backed assets. Legacy altcoins have plateaued as their growth has slowed, their innovation cycles have ended, and their communities now rely on external catalysts to drive movement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its first act‚Äîwhere every new feature added increases the token‚Äôs relevance and expands its real use cases. Buying in now at $0.03 secures not just early positioning, but exponential room to grow over the next two years. For investors thinking ahead‚Äînot just to the next headline, but to the next market cycle‚ÄîMutuum Finance (MUTM) is the token to hold. While others fade into the background, this protocol is being built to thrive through 2026 and beyond.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in Phase 5 of its presale at just $0.03, is turning attention away from speculation and toward utility. With over $11.3 million raised and more than 12,600 holders already on board, smart investors are now using MUTM to earn yield directly on their Dogecoin (DOGE) holdings. While Dogecoin (DOGE) stabilizes at $0.17, seasoned investors are moving early into a faster, more lucrative opportunity: Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äîa DeFi lending token currently in Phase 5 at $0.03, with over 50% of tokens already sold. On-chain data shows that wallets from earlier phases‚Äîespecially Phase 1 and 2 entries‚Äîhave already gained 200%‚Äì300%, turning modest $1,000 investments into $3,000 or more, even before the token lists. But it‚Äôs not just early birds celebrating. Even whales entering today are expected to see 100X upside, with top analysts predicting $2.50‚Äì$3.00 targets once Mutuum‚Äôs beta lending platform goes live. That turns a $5,000 allocation now into $500,000+ within months. The protocol is CertiK-audited and backed by real DeFi utility, and the structured presale pricing means each new phase gets more expensive. The window to buy at $0.03 is shrinking fast‚ÄîPhase 6 is next, priced at $0.035, and every missed phase is missed profit. DOGE may move slow, but Mutuum is preparing for lift-off now, and missing this momentum could be your biggest regret of the year. mtTokens, Stablecoin, and Layer 2 make the experience seamless Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built to remove complexity while increasing flexibility. The peer-to-contract (P2C) side of the protocol will allow users to supply assets like ETH, USDT, or SOL into liquidity pools and receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens represent a user‚Äôs share in the pool and will automatically accumulate value through interest. Users will be able to withdraw their funds‚Äîplus earnings‚Äîanytime liquidity is available. mtTokens won‚Äôt just sit in wallets. They will also unlock a second source of earnings. When staked in designated contracts, they will qualify for passive MUTM dividend rewards, funded by protocol revenue. A portion of that revenue will go toward buying MUTM tokens from the market and redistributing them to mtToken stakers. This means every deposit becomes a dynamic earning tool‚Äîgenerating interest, unlocking staking rewards, and retaining full transparency on-chain. To support low-cost, high-frequency usage across lending, borrowing, and stablecoin interactions, the entire Mutuum ecosystem is being developed with Layer 2 integration. This will drastically reduce gas fees and latency, solving a core issue in decentralized finance and opening the door for everyday users and high-volume lenders alike. One of the most important features that sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its fully overcollateralized stablecoin system. This stablecoin will only be minted when a user borrows against assets like ETH, and it will be burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Its peg will be managed through protocol governance, with rates adjusting to keep the price near $1. Arbitrage incentives and liquidation backstops will ensure the system remains solvent at all times. The combination of mtTokens, P2C and P2P lending models, a programmatically managed stablecoin, and Layer 2 functionality forms a complete toolkit for earning across any market condition‚Äîincluding Dogecoin (DOGE)‚Äôs current sideways action. While the broader meme coin market watches and waits, MUTM holders will be building income streams and accessing capital efficiently. Dogecoin (DOGE) rests, MUTM builds‚Äîtime to shift into action Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn‚Äôt just another presale‚Äîit‚Äôs a live, developing protocol with a precise roadmap. Following the launch of beta lending functions in Phase 3, users will be able to lend cryptos including Dogecoin (DOGE) directly or earn passive returns by depositing major coins into shared liquidity pools. In Phase 4, token claims will go live, and the protocol will move into full operation. Security is not being left behind. The protocol has already been reviewed through a CertiK audit that included both static and manual code analysis. As of the latest revision, it holds a strong Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 77. This foundation is further strengthened by an active bug bounty program and a Layer 2 development stack that will enhance reliability and usability across all features. Backed by over 12,600 holders, a $100,000 giveaway campaign that built strong organic traction, and a capped supply of 4 billion tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be more than a lending platform‚Äîit‚Äôs becoming a complete ecosystem. With the price still at $0.03 and Phase 5 already nearing 55%, now is the moment for forward-looking investors to move in. Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a foundational asset in crypto culture‚Äîbut its volatility can now be leveraged into earnings via Mutuum Finance (MUTM). And while Dogecoin (DOGE) rests at $0.17, MUTM is accelerating, giving investors the chance to build yield before the market wakes up. When Dogecoin (DOGE) moves again, those in the MUTM ecosystem will already be earning. MUTM is now far more than a presale‚Äîit‚Äôs a functioning plan to transform passive holdings into active income. The token price won‚Äôt stay this low for long, and once it lists, the ground floor will be gone. The clock is ticking, the tools are ready, and the market is watching.

The latest acquisition has pushed its total holdings to 13,350 BTC, surpassing CleanSpark to become the fifth-largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin. Metaplanet Expands Bitcoin Stash In a statement, the company‚Äôs CEO, Simon Gerovich, disclosed it paid an average of around $107,601 per BTC in its latest purchase, with the total stash currently valued near $1.45 billion at current market rates. The acquisition aligns with Metaplanet‚Äôs accelerated Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which was revised earlier this year with ambitions to amass over 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. The exec also added, ‚ÄúJust 3 months ago, we announced live at our shareholder meeting that we hit 3,350 BTC ‚Äì and now we‚Äôve added 10,000 more to reach 13,350 BTC.‚Äù The firm‚Äôs Bitcoin purchase was financed in part through the issuance of ¬•30 billion ($208 million) in zero-coupon, non-interest-bearing bonds, which is scheduled to mature in December 2025, which aligns with its ongoing approach to using debt and equity channels to fund BTC buys while simultaneously conducting bond buybacks to optimize its capital structure. According to its disclosures, the company said that it aims to maintain a shareholder-aligned approach by tracking a proprietary BTC yield metric, measuring Bitcoin per fully diluted share, which has sharply increased following the latest purchase. The company has logged a quarter-to-date BTC yield of over 129%. Metaplanet‚Äôs shares responded positively to the development. It rose nearly 10% on the day of the announcement in Tokyo, and continued a rally that has seen its stock climb over 350% year-to-date. Climbing Corporate Bitcoin Leaderboard According to the leaderboard updated by BitcoinTreasuries, Metaplanet is currently trailing behind Strategy, Marathon Digital, Twenty One Capital, and Riot Platforms, which currently hold 592,345 BTC, 49,179 BTC, 37,229.7 BTC, and 19,225 BTC, respectively.

Among them, Cardano (ADA) continues to maintain its reputation as a stable and developer-focused blockchain project. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as one of the top summer tokens with strong breakout potential. Capital is currently pouring into the fresh DeFi project priced at $0.03. MUTM has quickly emerged as a top buy ahead of the next bull run. The project is in the 5th phase of its presale that is already sold out by more than 50%. Mutuum Finance has already received over $11.3 million and attracted over 12,600 holders. For those entering the market cautiously but strategically, Mutuum Finance stands out as a rare combination of low entry risk and serious growth potential. Cardano‚Äôs Current Market Cardano (ADA) is currently priced about 2% lower than its 24hrs previous trading at the range of calming off slightly above its lower support of around $0.56 after a slight rising push of the same lower support size earlier this week. The technical indicators are conflicting: there is a bias to hold on with the oscillators and a sell signal with the majority of the moving averages, which shows a consolidating market. On the bullish aspect there are the indications of a possible double-bottom formation revealed by some technical analysts and this is an indication that a breakout would be possible above $0.65, but the overall bearish markets mean that prices have been unable to break out. Moreover, the January Cardano hardfork, Plomin, has solidified its on-chain governance capacity and has allowed it to gain some structural strength even as its prices continue to report lows. $50K Bounty Launched as Mutuum Finance Invests in Secure Growth Mutuum Finance has recently announced a 50,000 USDT Bug Bounty with CertiK. The bounty is divided according to the four different levels of severity: critical, major, minor, and low, which makes it all-inclusive. It is also a testament to the project‚Äôs attention to security and transparency. Reinventing DeFi: Embracing a Proven Dual-Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to engineer a hybrid lending platform that will attend to the needs of both passive and active users of DeFi. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model is designed to meet the need of any investor who wants to earn a passive income by putting his USDT in smart contract pools which ensure stable passive income based on its interest rate which fluctuates up and down according to the market conditions. In addition, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model allows lenders and borrowers to remain fully involved in deciding the terms of a trade with no third-party involvement. This model is more common with users dealing with less stable assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance Achieves Strong Presale Milestone Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised more than $11.3 million and attracted over 12,600 investors to its presale. Such a momentum is indicative of the growing investor confidence in the short-term success and long-term vision of the project. Leaderboard Launch Accompanied by $100,000 Prize Pool In recognition of its rapid growth, Mutuum Finance is giving away an amount of up to $100,000 giveaway to early backers. There will be a total of 10 winners of the early bird signing-up rewards each being given $10,000 tokens of Mutuum Finance. This initiative is a significant appreciation towards the community and a good bet on the future of the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trending in the DeFi market with over $11.3 million raised and more than 12,600 holders onboard during its presale, now over 50% sold out in Phase 5.

While XRP and Cardano remain foundational plays for long-term growth, a new name is rapidly gaining traction among early movers: MAGACOIN FINANCE. With its presale generating strong demand and analysts citing significant upside potential, many XRP and ADA holders are adding this emerging asset to their 2025 watchlists. XRP‚Äôs Institutional Surge Fuels Portfolio Diversification XRP has seen a dramatic shift in investor sentiment following recent regulatory clarity and the launch of the first spot ETF in Canada. With U.S. approval odds rising and major legal hurdles behind it, XRP is positioning itself as a key bridge asset in the institutional blockchain economy. However, even as XRP climbs, many investors are looking to balance their positions with early-phase tokens offering more aggressive return profiles. The logic is simple: XRP‚Äôs structure supports long-term growth, but the exponential gains often come from assets at the beginning of their journey. That‚Äôs where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the conversation. Cardano Investors Turn Toward Strategic Presales The Cardano ecosystem will undergo upgrades in governance, stablecoins, and layer-two innovations. The roadmap remains solid and the long-term thesis of ADA is based on usefulness and decentralization. Yet, Cardano investors are exploring high-asymmetry presales to boost overall portfolio yield, displaying a penchant for fundamentals. Many long-term ADA holders have recently begun rotating some of their capital into early plays that provide exponential opportunities, according to analysts. One of those early plays attracting their attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Structural Appeal Meets Strategic Timing MAGACOIN FINANCE is not simply riding a trend‚Äîit is being built around a structural model designed to capture macro momentum and reward early conviction. Previous presale phases have sold out instantly, and the project is gaining attention for its scarcity mechanics, verified security infrastructure, and clearly defined economic thesis. The presale‚Äôs rapid progression and positive analyst sentiment have pushed it onto institutional radars as well. It is being framed not as a speculative side play but as a foundational move for those seeking early exposure to what could become a dominant theme in the 2025‚Äì2026 cycle. For XRP and ADA investors accustomed to structured, roadmap-driven growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a rare opportunity to get ahead of the curve without abandoning core portfolio principles. It offers strategic alignment, not speculation‚Äîand that distinction is drawing capital from across the market. Final Thoughts The smartest investors understand the power of positioning. As XRP gains regulatory tailwinds and Cardano expands its DeFi footprint, the need to supplement with early-entry projects has never been greater. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a high-conviction, early-phase opportunity with the structural appeal and market timing to potentially lead the next generation of ROI leaders. Whether you‚Äôre building on the strength of legacy holdings or looking to reshape your portfolio for exponential upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a name that increasingly cannot be ignored.

47083796,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=173326,1751268655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/47083796.jpeg,Authors Launch Crucial Battle Against AI in Publishing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/authors-ai-publishing-battle/,"BitcoinWorld Authors Launch Crucial Battle Against AI in Publishing In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, where artificial intelligence continues to reshape industries, a significant conflict is brewing in the literary world. For those deeply entrenched in the world of cryptocurrencies and decentralized technologies, the parallels might be striking: questions of ownership, fair compensation, and the impact of automation on human creativity are at the forefront. This time, it‚Äôs not about blockchain‚Äôs disruption but AI‚Äôs profound influence on content creation, particularly within AI in publishing , prompting a united front from renowned authors. What‚Äôs Fueling the Authors‚Äô Outcry Against AI in Publishing? A powerful collective of authors, including literary giants like Lauren Groff, Lev Grossman, R.F. Kuang, Dennis Lehane, and Geoffrey Maguire, has issued an urgent open letter to book publishers. Their primary demand is a clear commitment to limit the use of AI tools in the publishing process. This isn‚Äôt just a minor grievance; it‚Äôs a fundamental challenge to the growing integration of AI into creative industries, sparking a vital conversation about the ethics and economics of artificial intelligence. The letter, which initially garnered an impressive list of signatories, quickly gained momentum. Reports from NPR highlighted that an additional 1,100 signatures were added within just 24 hours of its initial publication, underscoring the widespread concern among the writing community. This swift and substantial support signals a deep-seated apprehension about AI‚Äôs trajectory in their field, emphasizing the collective desire to protect human artistry and livelihood. Protecting Author Rights in the Digital Age: Key Demands At the heart of the authors‚Äô appeal lies a strong stance on protecting author rights . They articulate several specific pledges they want publishers to make, aiming to draw a clear line in the sand regarding AI‚Äôs permissible role: Human Audiobook Narrators: A commitment to exclusively hire human narrators for audiobooks, preserving a crucial avenue of work for voice artists and ensuring the nuanced performance that only human interpretation can provide. No AI-Created Books: A pledge that publishers will never release books that have been entirely created by machine. This demand directly confronts the notion of AI as a primary creative force in literature, advocating for human authorship as the bedrock of publishing. Safeguarding Human Staff: A promise not to replace human staff with AI tools or degrade their positions into mere AI monitors. This addresses concerns about job displacement and the devaluing of human expertise within publishing houses. These demands reflect a broader concern about the preservation of human creativity and the integrity of the literary ecosystem. Authors fear a future where their contributions are marginalized or entirely replaced by algorithms, diminishing the value of their unique voice and effort. The Shadow of Generative AI: Is Work Being ‚ÄúStolen‚Äù? A core argument presented in the open letter revolves around the perceived ‚Äútheft‚Äù of authors‚Äô work by AI companies. The letter powerfully states: ‚ÄúRather than paying writers a small percentage of the money our work makes for them, someone else will be paid for a technology built on our unpaid labor.‚Äù This statement points directly to the controversial practice of training large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI systems on vast datasets of existing copyrighted material, often without explicit permission or compensation to the original creators. The issue here is not just about direct plagiarism but about the fundamental input that fuels AI‚Äôs capabilities. If AI models learn to generate text, stories, or even narrative styles by processing millions of human-authored books, authors argue that their creative output is being used as raw material for commercial gain without any form of acknowledgment or remuneration. This raises complex ethical questions about intellectual property in the age of advanced algorithms and the future of creative compensation. Navigating AI Copyright Battles: Legal Challenges and Setbacks Beyond open letters and public appeals, authors have also pursued legal avenues to address their concerns regarding AI. Numerous lawsuits have been filed against tech companies, alleging that their books were used without authorization to train AI models. These legal battles are crucial in defining the boundaries of AI copyright and intellectual property in the digital age. However, the path to legal victory has proven challenging. Earlier this week, federal judges dealt significant blows to some of these lawsuits, highlighting the complex and often ambiguous nature of existing copyright law when applied to AI training data. These setbacks underscore the urgent need for clearer legal frameworks and industry standards that can adequately address the novel challenges posed by AI‚Äôs rapid development. The outcomes of these cases will set precedents that could profoundly impact how creative works are protected and compensated in the future. Shaping the Future of Publishing: A Collaborative Path Forward? The debate sparked by authors‚Äô demands is not merely about resistance to new technology; it‚Äôs about shaping the future of publishing in a way that respects human creativity and ensures fair compensation. While AI offers potential efficiencies, the authors‚Äô letter emphasizes the irreplaceable value of human ingenuity, emotional depth, and lived experience that underpins compelling storytelling. This ongoing dialogue between authors, publishers, and tech companies is critical. It necessitates a collaborative approach to establish ethical guidelines, fair compensation models, and transparent practices for AI integration. Publishers face the challenge of leveraging technological advancements while upholding their commitment to creators. The authors‚Äô collective voice serves as a powerful reminder that the foundation of the publishing industry‚Äîand indeed, all creative industries‚Äîrests on the unique contributions of human talent. A Pivotal Moment for Creativity and Technology The authors‚Äô urgent call to action marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing conversation about artificial intelligence and its impact on creative fields. It highlights deep-seated concerns over compensation, intellectual property, and the very definition of authorship in an increasingly automated world. As AI continues to advance, the tension between technological innovation and the preservation of human creative value will only intensify. The outcome of these discussions and legal battles will not only shape the future of publishing but also set a precedent for how all creative industries navigate the profound shifts brought about by artificial intelligence.

Key Takeaways: Ric Edelman now recommends crypto allocations of up to 40%, a shift from his 1% guidance. He says Bitcoin‚Äôs mainstream adoption has resolved past uncertainties. Crypto‚Äôs uncorrelated performance can boost diversification. ‚ÄúToday I am saying 40%, that‚Äôs astonishing,‚Äù Edelman told CNBC‚Äôs Crypto World this week. ‚ÄúNo one has ever said such a thing.‚Äù In his 2021 book The Truth About Crypto , Edelman suggested allocations as low as 1% were appropriate, reflecting the uncertainties that clouded the market just a few years ago. Edelman: Crypto‚Äôs Rise Justifies 40% Allocation Edelman, who leads the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, said the dramatic change stems from what he described as the industry‚Äôs transformation. ‚ÄúFour years ago, we didn‚Äôt know if governments would ban Bitcoin, if the technology would fail, or if institutions would adopt it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúToday, all those questions have been resolved. It‚Äôs radically changed and is now a mainstream asset.‚Äù Signs of crypto‚Äôs mainstream arrival are evident in the surge of inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs, which have pulled in billions this year and are among the top-performing asset classes for new investments. The influx has put crypto firmly on the radar of advisors and institutional investors. Edelman also highlighted a broader trend reshaping investment strategy: the erosion of the traditional 60/40 portfolio split between stocks and bonds. Longer life expectancies, with projections suggesting people could live to 100 in coming decades, mean that retirees will need higher returns for longer periods. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs 60-year-old is kind of like yesterday‚Äôs 30-year-old,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou need to get better returns than you can get from bonds and you need to hold equities longer than ever before.‚Äù In this environment, Edelman argued, crypto‚Äôs role becomes indispensable. He pointed out that Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements are uncorrelated with traditional assets, making it a powerful diversification tool that can enhance portfolio risk-adjusted returns. ‚ÄúThe crypto asset class offers the opportunity for higher returns than you‚Äôre likely to get in virtually any other asset class,‚Äù he said. Edelman Calls Bitcoin Price Forecasts Conservative With some market watchers forecasting bitcoin prices could reach $150,000-$250,000 by year-end ‚Äî and even $500,000 by the end of the decade ‚Äî Edelman called these projections ‚Äúconservative‚Äù compared to other bullish estimates. As reported, Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, has projected that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends persist. Likewise, crypto analyst Scott Melker has said he believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 , driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure. Despite growing interest in Bitcoin, not everyone in traditional finance is convinced of its long-term staying power. As reported, Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific, has said that many hedge funds remain skeptical about Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term viability, believing it may lose momentum after the Trump administration.

The spotlight is now shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ‚Äîa DeFi lending protocol currently in Phase 5 of its presale at just $0.03, with over 50% already sold out. While ADA continues its slow recovery, crypto investors are reallocating capital into projects with higher risk-adjusted reward potential, and Mutuum is leading that charge. Top Analysts project that MUTM could reach $3.00 post-listing, driven by its real-world DeFi lending utility, a beta platform going live at launch, and its structured presale model. That puts a 100X return on the table‚Äîturning a $2,000 investment today into $200,000. Those who entered during Phase 1 at $0.01 would be looking at $600,000+ if that same target is hit. And with each phase, the price inches closer to that ceiling‚Äîrising to $0.035 in Phase 6, then $0.04, and eventually $0.06 by Phase 11. The math is clear: the later you enter, the more you‚Äôll pay‚Äîand the less you‚Äôll gain. Right now, at $0.03, Mutuum offers the kind of upside ADA can‚Äôt match at this stage in the cycle. Protocol design that rewards long-term positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being designed around two key lending structures: P2C (peer-to-contract) for established tokens like ETH or USDT, and P2P (peer-to-peer) for volatile assets such as DOGE or PEPE. These separate mechanisms serve different market profiles, but both are governed by overcollateralized loan requirements that secure lenders and borrowers alike. The dual structure ensures capital efficiency while reducing risk across pools. The moment lenders deposit into the system, they receive mtTokens‚Äîinterest-accruing digital receipts that also serve as collateral within the protocol. These mtTokens will play a critical role in the broader yield cycle. As users stake them in designated contracts, they will receive buyback rewards in MUTM funded by revenue generated through the lending platform. This incentivizes holding and builds liquidity without introducing inflationary pressure. In addition to smart yield mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will issue its own overcollateralized stablecoin, governed to stay as close to $1 as possible through automated minting and burning rules. The interest rate for borrowing this stablecoin will be adjusted through governance rather than market volatility, adding another layer of predictability for users who want to exit riskier assets during unstable periods. Layer-2 integration adds another dimension. While Ethereum-based platforms often struggle with congestion and high fees, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built to operate on Layer-2 infrastructure‚Äîensuring low-cost, high-speed transactions that are essential for real-time DeFi trading and staking. From CertiK audit to beta launch‚Äîthe roadmap that signals scale The early groundwork for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already made it a standout among newer DeFi entrants. A full audit by CertiK‚Äîcovering both static analysis and manual code review‚Äîhas yielded high marks, including a TokenScan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 77. Alongside that, an active bug bounty has been launched to ensure code hardening before full deployment. These steps reinforce the platform‚Äôs security-first approach, which is crucial for serious capital participation. According to the roadmap, Phase 3 will introduce the beta platform‚Äîcomplete with lending access and stablecoin utility‚Äîby the time the token official lists. This offers first-movers a direct advantage, as they‚Äôll enter the ecosystem before the broader public and centralized exchange users arrive. From that point forward, the platform is expected to transition into full utility in Phase 4, activating key functions including real-time borrowing, mtToken staking, and stablecoin deployment. The $100,000 giveaway ‚Äîsplit among ten early supporters‚Äîhas already sparked considerable traction, building a community that has grown beyond 10,000 followers across social platforms. This base will continue to expand as new users realize that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn‚Äôt promising a hypothetical use case‚Äîit‚Äôs preparing to launch with the infrastructure already planned and audited.

According to data from crypto.news, Arbitrum ( ARB ) surged nearly 46% to an intraday high of $0.38 before retracing slightly to $0.35 at press time. Its market capitalization climbed above $1.7 billion, overtaking tokens like Sky ( SKY ), Render ( RENDER ), and Sei ( SEI ) in the rankings. The rally occurred in a high-volume trading environment. CoinGecko data shows that ARB‚Äôs daily spot trading volume jumped over 450% in the past 24 hours, with $658 million worth of tokens changing hands. Derivatives activity also surged, up 42% from the previous day, while a long/short ratio above 1 across major exchanges suggests bullish positioning among leveraged traders. Much of the recent momentum has been driven by growing speculation that Robinhood may tap Arbitrum to develop a blockchain infrastructure enabling EU-based users to trade U.S. equities onchain. Earlier reports suggested that Robinhood was evaluating both Arbitrum and Solana as candidates, though final decisions were still pending.

Warner, CSO of Offchain Labs, the non-profit that stewards Arbitrum ecosystem governance, will join Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin for a fireside chat on Monday. The event, hosted by Robinhood Europe in Cannes, is being hyped as the stage for the company‚Äôs biggest crypto announcements of the year. The development comes shortly after Arbitrum was selected by crypto exchange Gemini as the settlement layer for its tokenized shares of Strategy‚Äôs MSTR stock, with plans to expand to additional assets and networks over time. Beyond fundamentals and headlines, on-chain indicators further support the bullish case. Data from Santiment shows a sharp uptick in daily active addresses on the Arbitrum network alongside a shift in social sentiment from negative to positive, both typically seen as precursors to sustained price rallies. Source: Santiment Arbitrum price analysis On the 1-day/USDT price chart, ARB is nearing the upper boundary of a large falling wedge pattern that has been developing since January of last year. A confirmed breakout above this resistance trendline would likely signal the end of its long-term downtrend and the beginning of a new bullish phase. ARB price, 50-day EMA chart ‚Äî June 30 | Source: crypto.news The token currently trades above its 50-day exponential moving average, indicating strengthening medium-term bullish momentum. Additionally, momentum indicators support this view, most notably, the MACD has flipped into positive territory, suggesting a shift in trend direction. ARB MACD and Aroon chart ‚Äî June 30 | Source: crypto.news The Aroon Up indicator stands at 92.86%, while the Aroon Down is at 42.86% which points to a strong uptrend with declining bearish pressure, typically seen in early stages of trend reversals. If the breakout from the wedge is confirmed, the next likely upside target for ARB lies at $0.75, which corresponds with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level drawn from the macro high to recent lows. A clean breakout from that level could set it up for a rally to $1, which would represent gains of 185% from the current levels.

According to Whale Alert, a leading blockchain tracking service, 320 million XRP, valued at approximately $703.5 million, was abruptly moved on June 30 between two unknown wallets. The scale of the transfer, and the fact that both the sender and recipient remain unidentified have stirred intense speculation among XRP holders and analysts. The transfer came at a pivotal time for XRP, which has recently been trading around $2.18 amid growing expectations of a breakout. With the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) winding down, following Ripple‚Äôs withdrawal of its counter-appeal and the SEC likely to follow suit , many believe this transfer is more than a routine transaction. 320,000,000 #XRP (703,517,724 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet https://t.co/EzDk6g8ZUw ‚Äî Whale Alert (@whale_alert) June 30, 2025 XRP Community Reacts to the Whale Movement Members of the XRP Army were quick to react across social media platforms, particularly on X, where theories and opinions flooded in. Crypto Head commented, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a serious bag. Wonder if it‚Äôs cold storage or someone gearing up for something big.‚Äù His post echoed a common theme‚Äîuncertainty over whether this was simply a custodial move or a strategic setup for a major event. Blue Hawk Legend, another known XRP commentator, rejected the idea of retail whales : ‚ÄúPeople think these are whales? This is an institution.‚Äù The notion that large financial entities are increasingly involved in XRP-related activity is gaining traction, especially given Ripple‚Äôs expanding presence in cross-border payments and tokenization. DanteGPU weighed in, stating, ‚ÄúWhoever moved that bag is playing in a different league,‚Äù a sentiment that captures the awe surrounding such a high-value transaction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Others responded with curiosity or irony. ‚ÄúWe have XRP movements?‚Äù asked Logic, alluding to XRP‚Äôs relatively quiet trading behavior in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Max ACS bluntly asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the whale doing?‚Äù, a question many in the community are still trying to answer. Institutional Moves or Strategic Repositioning? While on-chain whale activity is a common feature of the crypto market, the movement of over 300 million XRP in a single transaction raises eyebrows. Given XRP‚Äôs utility in enterprise-level payment solutions and its ongoing integration into Ripple‚Äôs liquidity infrastructure, this may represent internal wallet consolidation, preparation for institutional custody, or positioning ahead of regulatory clarity. The timing adds intrigue. With the Ripple vs. SEC case reaching a practical conclusion and optimism growing around XRP‚Äôs legal status, this large movement may signal readiness for a more liquid and accessible XRP market, particularly for institutional participants. The wallets involved haven‚Äôt been identified yet, and neither Ripple nor any major exchange has made a public comment. But one thing is certain: a $703 million shift doesn‚Äôt go unnoticed. Whether it‚Äôs a precursor to market action or just a routine transfer, the XRP community and the wider crypto world will be watching closely.

For anyone invested in the future of technology, including the burgeoning cryptocurrency space which heavily relies on AI advancements, the ongoing struggle between industry giants like OpenAI and Meta is a development of crucial importance. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI is taking drastic measures, ‚Äòrecalibrating‚Äô its compensation structures, in direct response to Meta‚Äôs aggressive recruitment of its senior researchers. This isn‚Äôt just about salaries; it‚Äôs a high-stakes tech talent war that will shape the very trajectory of AI innovation. OpenAI‚Äôs Urgent Response: Recalibrating Compensation The urgency of the situation at OpenAI became palpable with a leaked internal memo from Chief Research Officer Mark Chen. He conveyed a ‚Äúvisceral feeling‚Äù of invasion, stating, ‚Äúas if someone has broken into our home and stolen something.‚Äù This emotional response underscores the perceived threat from Meta‚Äôs poaching spree. In a swift counter-move, Chen assured team members that leadership, including CEO Sam Altman, has not been ‚Äústanding idly by.‚Äù The core of OpenAI ‚Äòs defensive strategy revolves around adjusting its compensation strategies . Chen confirmed that leaders have been working ‚Äúaround the clock to talk to those with offers,‚Äù indicating a direct, personalized effort to retain at-risk talent. The phrase ‚Äúrecalibrating comp‚Äù suggests a significant overhaul of their pay scales and incentive programs, likely involving enhanced base salaries, more lucrative equity packages, and potentially new performance bonuses designed to match or exceed rival offers. Beyond just monetary adjustments, OpenAI is also ‚Äúscoping out creative ways to recognize and reward top talent,‚Äù which could include greater autonomy, specialized research budgets, or enhanced career development opportunities. Meta‚Äôs Aggressive Play: The Hunt for Top AI Talent Over the past week, numerous reports have highlighted the exodus of at least eight key researchers from OpenAI to Meta . This aggressive recruitment drive by Meta signals its serious intent to ramp up its own AI capabilities, particularly in areas like generative AI and large language models, which are critical for its metaverse ambitions and broader product roadmap. The competition for specialized AI talent is fierce, driven by the scarcity of individuals with the unique blend of theoretical knowledge, practical experience, and research acumen required to push the boundaries of the field. The intensity of this tech talent war was further illuminated by Sam Altman‚Äôs public comments. He reportedly complained on a podcast that Meta was offering ‚Äú100 million dollar signing bonuses,‚Äù a staggering figure that, while Meta executives have internally pushed back against its accuracy, illustrates the extreme financial incentives being deployed. Such figures, even if exaggerated, highlight the extraordinary value placed on individuals who can unlock groundbreaking AI advancements. This kind of aggressive recruitment can create a ripple effect across the entire AI ecosystem, driving up costs and making it harder for smaller startups to compete. Why is AI Talent So Valuable in Today‚Äôs Market? The demand for specialized AI talent far outstrips supply, making these professionals arguably the most sought-after in the global job market. But what makes them so invaluable? It boils down to several critical factors: Scarcity of Expertise: Deep learning, neural networks, natural language processing, and computer vision require highly specialized knowledge and years of dedicated research. There are simply not enough experts to fill the burgeoning demand from tech giants, research labs, and startups alike. Transformative Impact: AI is not just another technology; it‚Äôs a foundational layer that is reshaping every industry, from healthcare and finance to entertainment and, notably, decentralized technologies like blockchain. Top AI talent can create products and services that redefine markets and generate immense value. Competitive Advantage: In a rapidly advancing field, being first to market with a breakthrough AI model or application can confer a significant competitive advantage. Companies are willing to pay a premium to secure the individuals who can deliver these innovations. Research and Development: Leading AI talent are not just engineers; they are often researchers capable of fundamental scientific breakthroughs. Their work contributes to patents, academic publications, and the overall intellectual property of a company. This high demand drives the escalating compensation strategies we are witnessing, as companies vie for a finite pool of exceptional individuals. The Broader Implications of the Tech Talent War The specific skirmish between OpenAI and Meta is a microcosm of a much larger tech talent war unfolding globally. This competition has profound implications beyond just the two companies involved: Impact on Startups: Smaller AI startups often struggle to compete with the vast resources of tech giants. They cannot match the multi-million dollar offers, making it difficult to attract and retain the very talent they need to innovate and grow. This could lead to a consolidation of AI power within a few large corporations. Wage Inflation: The aggressive bidding for AI talent drives up salaries across the board, affecting compensation benchmarks for AI professionals everywhere. While good for individual researchers, it can strain the budgets of even well-funded companies. Innovation Concentration: If top talent congregates in a few large companies, it could potentially limit the diversity of research directions and the pace of innovation outside these centralized hubs. However, large companies also have the resources to fund ambitious, long-term projects. Ethical Considerations: The intense focus on acquiring talent for competitive advantage might sometimes overshadow broader ethical considerations in AI development, as companies prioritize speed and market dominance. Understanding these broader implications is crucial for anyone monitoring the future of technology and its societal impact. Beyond Compensation: Retaining Top AI Talent While compensation strategies are a primary battleground in this tech talent war , leading companies like OpenAI know that money alone isn‚Äôt always enough to retain the best AI talent . Highly skilled researchers are often motivated by more than just salary. What else might be at play? Mission and Impact: Many top AI researchers are driven by the desire to work on projects that have a significant impact on the world, solve complex problems, or contribute to scientific advancement. A compelling mission can be a powerful draw. Research Freedom and Resources: The ability to pursue novel research directions, access cutting-edge computing resources, and collaborate with other world-class experts is invaluable. A restrictive environment, even with high pay, can be a deterrent. Culture and Collaboration: A supportive, intellectually stimulating, and collaborative work environment where ideas are freely exchanged and respected is highly valued. The opportunity to learn from and grow with peers is a major factor. Career Growth and Development: Clear pathways for advancement, opportunities to lead projects, and access to ongoing learning and development programs can encourage long-term commitment. Work-Life Balance: While intense periods are common in tech, a company‚Äôs approach to sustainable work practices and employee well-being can also influence retention, especially for seasoned professionals. OpenAI ‚Äòs commitment to ‚Äúscoping out creative ways to recognize and reward top talent‚Äù suggests they are looking beyond mere financial incentives to build a more robust retention strategy. Implications for the Future of AI Innovation The outcome of this intense competition for AI talent will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of AI innovation. If OpenAI successfully retains its core researchers through enhanced compensation strategies and other incentives, it can continue to drive its ambitious research agenda, potentially leading to further breakthroughs in areas like AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Conversely, if Meta ‚Äòs aggressive poaching continues unabated, it could significantly bolster its own AI capabilities, leading to increased competition in key AI application areas and potentially shifting the balance of power in the industry. This dynamic also highlights the growing importance of ethical considerations in AI development. As companies race to acquire talent and deploy powerful AI models, the need for responsible AI practices, safety protocols, and transparent development becomes even more critical. The tech talent war is not just about who builds the next big thing, but also about who builds it responsibly and for the benefit of society. Conclusion: A Defining Moment in AI‚Äôs Evolution The reported ‚Äòrecalibration‚Äô of compensation by OpenAI in response to Meta ‚Äòs aggressive hiring is a clear indicator of the intensity of the current AI talent war . This battle for the brightest minds in artificial intelligence is not merely an internal corporate affair; it‚Äôs a defining moment for the entire tech industry. The strategies employed by giants like OpenAI and Meta , particularly their compensation strategies , will set precedents for how highly skilled professionals are valued and how innovation is pursued in this crucial field. As AI continues to integrate into every facet of our lives, including the foundational technologies of the digital economy, the ability to attract and retain top AI talent will remain paramount for any organization aiming to lead the charge.

Backed by a massive 129% jump in 24-hour trading volume, this frog-themed meme coin has caught the attention of traders and whales alike. As market momentum builds, both technical and on-chain indicators offer clues about whether this rally has more room to run. Curious enough? Join me as I decode the Pepe price analysis for the short term. What Do the On-Chain Metrics Have to Say? As per Santiment , the recent on-chain activity reveals a notable spike in daily active addresses, indicating fresh wallet participation. However, exchange outflows have declined, signaling that fewer investors are moving PEPE into cold storage, which again is a typical bullish indicator. This could suggest short-term holders are looking to capitalize on the current price uptick rather than accumulate. Meanwhile, the supply held by whales has flattened, showing no strong accumulation trend despite the recent rally. This mixed picture implies that while retail interest is climbing, large investors remain cautious. It is worth noting that sustaining upward momentum will likely require renewed whale accumulation and a reversal in exchange flow trends. PEPE Price Analysis PEPE is currently changing hands at $0.00001001, while being up 5.55% on the day and +11.84% over the week. The meme coin broke past the key support level of $0.00000949, but is now testing resistance at $0.00001045. A rejection at this level triggered mild profit-taking, as seen in the latest red candle. The RSI is hovering near 55, suggesting neutral momentum, not yet overbought. Bollinger Bands are widening, hinting at increased volatility. For PEPE to confirm a bullish breakout, it must sustain above $0.00001045 and close near the next major resistance at $0.00001296. Contrarily, $0.00000949 acts as a strong support level.

According to a June 29 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk, Bitcoin‚Äôs ( BTC ) ‚Äúapparent demand‚Äù signal has turned negative, indicating that new buyer interest is no longer keeping pace with the supply entering the market from miners and long-term holders. Apparent demand is a metric that compares new buyer interest to the supply entering the market. Specifically, it looks at how much fresh demand is coming in relative to two main sources of supply; the newly mined Bitcoin and long-term holders moving their coins after a period of dormancy. Strong demand offsets this supply and helps push prices higher. A price imbalance may result when apparent demand turns negative, which indicates that new buyers are no longer consuming the available supply. In this case, selling by LTHs, who are often regarded as seasoned, strategic market participants, may suggest that the current price range is a local peak.

According to the report, the price of Ethereum has shown signs of recovery by holding on to the $2,130 level after falling to $2,130. ETH tested the key support area near $2,130 and rebounded strongly from this area. The retention of this level was welcomed by investors and the price saw a rally back above the $2,400 level. MakroVision noted that the overall market structure has not yet determined a clear direction, meaning that neither an upward breakout nor a structural breakdown has been observed. According to the analysis, Ethereum holding above $2,400 could allow the price to accelerate towards the $2,740‚Äì2,880 range.

Thus, the latest mint matches the planned tokenomics upgrade. However, the rollout comes amid bearish sentiments as enthusiasts brace for Binance delisting later this week. The absence of real-time updates from the team on the token allocation has intensified worries about the supply expansion. Some suggest that the partial deposit to Bybit could indicate an upcoming dump, especially with Binance ceasing support. However, proponents trust the move is part of liquidity redistribution as LeverFi explores other exchanges. Binance delisting fuels speculations Binance remains crucial for liquidity as it enhances visibility, accessibility, and volume. Therefore, removing support for LEVER means a significant blow.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool designed to give you a snapshot of prevailing emotions, helping you understand whether market participants are feeling overly optimistic or overly cautious. As of June 30, this crucial indicator, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a value of 66. While this is a slight dip from the previous day, it firmly keeps the market in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone, signaling a continued bullish sentiment despite recent fluctuations. But what does this number truly tell us about the future of Bitcoin price and the broader crypto landscape? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Mean? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it‚Äôs a barometer of the collective emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, it aims to quantify market sentiment, where: 0-24 (Extreme Fear): Indicates investors are highly worried, often leading to selling pressure and potential buying opportunities for brave investors. 25-49 (Fear): Still a cautious market, but less intense than extreme fear. 50-54 (Neutral): A balanced market where neither fear nor greed dominates. 55-74 (Greed): Suggests investors are becoming overly optimistic, potentially leading to overvaluation. 75-100 (Extreme Greed): A highly euphoric market, often a precursor to market corrections as assets become significantly overbought. Historically, moments of extreme fear have often coincided with market bottoms, presenting lucrative entry points for long-term investors. Conversely, periods of extreme greed have frequently preceded market tops, serving as a warning sign for potential pullbacks. How is Crypto Market Sentiment Measured? The brilliance of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach to gauging crypto market sentiment . It doesn‚Äôt rely on a single data point but aggregates information from six key factors, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive overview. Let‚Äôs break down these components: 1. Volatility (25%) This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially on the downside, typically indicates fear, while stable or upward volatility might suggest growing confidence. 2. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum of Bitcoin and compares it with average values. High buying volume in a rising market suggests greedy behavior, while low volume or high selling volume indicates fear. 3. Social Media (15%) The index scours various social media platforms, primarily Twitter (now X), for specific keywords and hashtags related to cryptocurrency. A high number of positive or trending posts often indicates a surge in interest and potentially greedy sentiment, whereas negative sentiment or a lack of engagement can signal fear. 4. Surveys (15%) ‚Äì Currently Paused Although currently paused, this component historically involved weekly polls where thousands of people shared their perceptions of the crypto market. Surveys offer a direct insight into investor psychology, providing a raw measure of fear or greed. The temporary pause means the index currently relies more heavily on the other five factors. 5. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance refers to its market capitalization share relative to the entire cryptocurrency market. An increasing Bitcoin dominance often suggests a flight to safety, indicating fear in the altcoin market as investors consolidate into Bitcoin. Conversely, a decreasing dominance might indicate greed, as investors venture into riskier altcoins for higher potential returns. 6. Google Trends (10%) This factor analyzes Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A sudden surge in searches for terms like ‚ÄòBitcoin price manipulation‚Äô or ‚ÄòBitcoin crash‚Äô indicates fear, while searches for ‚Äòhow to buy Bitcoin‚Äô or ‚ÄòBitcoin bullish‚Äô might suggest growing public interest and potential greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index offers a robust, albeit not infallible, indicator of overall market sentiment. What Does a ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô Zone Reading of 66 Imply for Bitcoin Price? The current reading of 66, firmly in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone, suggests that investors are generally optimistic about the market‚Äôs future. This level of greed, while not extreme, indicates that many participants are willing to take on more risk, potentially driving prices higher. However, the slight drop from the previous day (down two points) hints at a cooling off of this intense optimism, suggesting that while greed is still prevalent, it might be moderating. This subtle shift could be a healthy sign, preventing the market from becoming excessively overheated and prone to sharp corrections. For Bitcoin price , a ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô reading typically implies continued buying pressure. Historically, sustained periods in the greed zone have preceded significant price rallies. However, it‚Äôs also a reminder that prices cannot go up indefinitely. As the saying goes, ‚Äòbe fearful when others are greedy.‚Äô This moderate greed level might indicate a period of consolidation or minor pullbacks before the next leg up, offering opportunities for strategic entries rather than chasing pumps. Mastering Your Crypto Trading Strategy with the Fear & Greed Index Incorporating the Crypto Fear & Greed Index into your crypto trading strategy can significantly enhance your decision-making, but it‚Äôs crucial to use it wisely. It serves as an emotional compass, not a definitive buy/sell signal. Here‚Äôs how you can leverage it: Contrarian Investing: The most common application. When the index is in ‚ÄòExtreme Fear,‚Äô it might be an opportune time to consider buying, as assets are likely undervalued due to panic selling. Conversely, when it hits ‚ÄòExtreme Greed,‚Äô it might be time to take profits or reduce exposure, as the market could be overbought. Risk Management: During periods of ‚ÄòGreed,‚Äô especially ‚ÄòExtreme Greed,‚Äô consider tightening your stop-losses or reducing position sizes. High sentiment often precedes increased market volatility on the downside. Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm other technical or fundamental analysis. If your charts show a potential reversal and the index is showing ‚ÄòExtreme Fear,‚Äô it adds conviction to your bullish outlook. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: For long-term investors, extreme fear can be a signal to accumulate. For short-term traders, the index can help time entries and exits around sentiment-driven swings. Remember, the index is just one piece of the puzzle. Always combine its insights with thorough research, technical analysis, and an understanding of market fundamentals. Never make investment decisions based solely on a single indicator. Navigating Market Volatility: A Key Challenge in Crypto One of the defining characteristics of the cryptocurrency market is its inherent market volatility . Prices can swing wildly in short periods, influenced by a myriad of factors from regulatory news to whale movements, and of course, sentiment. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index helps contextualize this volatility by showing the underlying emotional drivers. When the index fluctuates rapidly between fear and greed, it often signals periods of heightened uncertainty and choppiness. Understanding this relationship can help investors brace for sudden movements and adjust their risk exposure accordingly. For instance, a sharp increase in the index from ‚ÄòFear‚Äô to ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô might precede a strong upward trend, but also indicates increased risk of a sudden correction as euphoria takes hold. Conversely, a sustained period in ‚ÄòFear‚Äô might present a ‚Äòbuy the dip‚Äô opportunity for those comfortable with high risk, anticipating a rebound once the panic subsides. It‚Äôs about recognizing the emotional cycle and not getting swept away by it. The Psychology Behind the Numbers: Why Sentiment Matters At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index taps into the powerful psychological forces that drive financial markets. Human emotions‚Äîfear and greed‚Äîare often the primary catalysts for irrational decisions, leading to market bubbles and crashes. Greed can lead to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), causing investors to buy at inflated prices, while fear can lead to panic selling, causing them to sell at a loss. The index provides a quantifiable measure of these emotions, allowing investors to potentially counter their own biases and make more rational choices. Recognizing when the collective market is overly emotional can give you an edge. It‚Äôs about stepping back, assessing the broader sentiment, and making decisions that go against the herd mentality when appropriate. This contrarian approach, famously advocated by legendary investors, is precisely what the index helps facilitate. Conclusion: A Compass, Not a Crystal Ball, for Your Crypto Journey The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains an invaluable tool for any cryptocurrency enthusiast or investor. While its current reading of 66 places the market firmly in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone, indicating continued optimism, the slight dip suggests a healthy moderation of this sentiment. It provides crucial insights into crypto market sentiment , helping you gauge the prevailing emotional winds that influence Bitcoin price and the broader digital asset space. By understanding its components and how to integrate it into your crypto trading strategy , you can better navigate the inherent market volatility and avoid emotionally driven mistakes. Remember, no single indicator guarantees success. The index is a compass, not a crystal ball. Use it as part of a comprehensive analytical framework, combining its insights with fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and sound risk management practices. Staying informed and disciplined is key to thriving in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

According to Nonzee, Polkadot‚Äôs initial launch was marked by significant enthusiasm and massive financial backing. In 2017, the project raised $144 million within minutes through its initial coin offering (ICO), followed by an additional $43 million in private investment rounds. By 2021, Polkadot (DOT) was widely regarded as an ‚ÄúEthereum killer,‚Äù with its parachain model offering a new approach to Web3 infrastructure. The project introduced its mainnet in 2020 and parachains in late 2021, featuring shared security and scalability that appeared highly promising on paper. Despite this strong start, Nonzee points out that the project struggled with adoption. While the network‚Äôs design was technologically advanced, it ultimately failed to achieve product-market fit. Nonzee emphasizes that Polkadot did not deliver a compelling use case or a widely adopted application that could attract and retain users. At its peak, Polkadot‚Äôs native token, DOT, reached $55 with a market cap of $50 billion. However, Nonzee asserts that this growth was driven more by speculative hype than by genuine network activity. Polkadot is dead. Raised $500M. Promised a revolution. Now? No users. No devs. No future. Here‚Äôs how one of crypto‚Äôs biggest bets faded into a ghost chain pic.twitter.com/XMHElzhOl0 ‚Äî Nonzee (@0xNonceSense) June 27, 2025 Technical Barriers and Developer Attrition A significant part of the issue, as outlined by Nonzee, was the difficulty developers faced when building on Polkadot . The network relies on Substrate and Rust, which he describes as not beginner-friendly compared to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. This technical complexity introduced friction, discouraging many developers from committing to the ecosystem. As a result, developers gradually shifted focus to other platforms that offered a more accessible development environment. Nonzee also highlights that Polkadot‚Äôs architecture created additional confusion. The existence of both Polkadot and Kusama networks, each with its token, left users uncertain about their distinct roles. This confusion, combined with an unintuitive user experience, deterred both users and developers. The parachain auction model, originally designed to foster network growth, is cited as another critical flaw. Locking DOT tokens for two years to secure parachain slots limited liquidity and hindered project momentum. This model, while innovative in concept, proved unsustainable over time. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Declining Usage and Governance Challenges Nonzee‚Äôs assessment underscores a steady decline in user activity and developer participation between 2021 and 2025. He notes that by 2025, the network had fewer than 5,000 daily active users across all parachains. Developer numbers also fell sharply from 2,400 monthly contributors in 2022 to nearly half that figure by 2024. Governance, once considered one of Polkadot‚Äôs most ambitious features, failed to sustain its intended impact. According to Nonzee, the system became dominated by whales, and treasury expenditures exceeded $129 million in 2024, with little to show in terms of return on investment. As a consequence, voter turnout decreased and community trust eroded significantly. A Technological Marvel Without Adoption Despite the rollout of Polkadot 2.0 in 2024, which introduced improvements, such as async backing, agile coretime, and the JAM protocol, Nonzee argues that these advancements arrived too late to revive the network. The broader market had shifted its attention elsewhere, and DOT‚Äôs value collapsed from $55 to under $5 without any meaningful recovery. In his conclusion, Nonzee remarks that while Polkadot remains a technological achievement featuring reliable components such as XCM and shared security, the absence of users and a compelling narrative renders the network functionally obsolete in its current form. He suggests that unless a real-world killer application emerges to drive adoption, Polkadot will continue to operate as a sophisticated but underutilized infrastructure within the blockchain ecosystem.

After the official announcement from the Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, that both sides have decided to drop their appeals, putting a full stop to one of crypto‚Äôs biggest legal battles for good. For XRP holders, this brings relief and fresh hope ‚Äî but also raises a big question: What‚Äôs next for XRP‚Äôs price? Let‚Äôs break it down. 2 Big Possibilities for XRP Now XRP Price Stays the Same The first possibility is that XRP‚Äôs price does not really move much from here. As of now, it is trading around $2.17 , reflecting a slight drop wth a market cap hitting $128.5 billion. Many traders believe the end of the lawsuit was already ‚Äúpriced in.‚Äù This means that investors had expected Ripple to win for a while, so the current price already reflects that hope. If no fresh news comes soon, XRP might just stay flat, moving only with the bigger crypto market for now. Ripple Goes All In With Big Moves The second possibility is far more exciting. With no lawsuit slowing them down, Ripple might go all out. Many in the XRP community believe Ripple could now announce big partnerships, sign new global deals, or roll out new services to boost adoption. This could give XRP a strong push up, as more companies and banks feel safe to use Ripple‚Äôs tech again. To make this happen, Ripple Labs has already partnered with Wormhole , a platform that helps different blockchains connect and work together. On the other hand, some supporters even think Ripple should run a strong marketing campaign, showing the world they‚Äôre not done yet. XRP To BE In U.S Crypto Reserve Apart from this, there is growing excitement around adding XRP as a strategic reserve, alongside Bitcoin. Now that Ripple‚Äôs legal fight with the SEC is over, nothing is stopping XRP from being included in this group.

Ondo Finance ( ONDO ) price is currently trading at $0.078, up 13% over the past week. The price recently rebounded from a yearly low of $0.62 on June 22, after briefly dipping below the lower trendline of the months-long descending channel on the 4-hour chart. As evident by the volume accompanying the rally from that low, strong buying pressure was present at that level, quickly pulling the price back within the channel‚Äôs range. On the recent candles, ONDO price has also climbed above both the 20 EMA and the 100 SMA, with a bullish crossover forming between the two averages. The price is now approaching the upper boundary of the descending channel, having established a slightly higher high compared to the peak of the initial rally from the yearly low. Source: TradingView You might also like: Ondo Finance forms Global Markets Alliance to establish tokenized securities standards Momentum indicators are also leaning bullish. The Relative Strength Index has climbed to around 59, signaling growing strength but still leaving room before entering overbought territory. The MACD has formed a bullish crossover, with the MACD line moving above the signal line and shifting into positive territory. Looking ahead, a breakout above the upper boundary of the descending channel, around $0.082 to $0.085, could pave the way toward the next targets near $0.090 and potentially $0.105, which correspond to the previous swing highs within the channel. On the downside, the immediate horizontal support lies at $0.072. A breakdown below this level would increase the likelihood that the price remains trapped within the channel in the near term. ONDO price rebound from the yearly low comes on the heels of a string of recent milestones on the fundamental front. Notably, Ondo Finance has recently brought its tokenized U.S. Treasuries to the XRP Ledger, completed a cross-chain settlement leveraging JPMorgan‚Äôs Kinexys and Chainlink, and introduced instant conversion functionality between its OUSG fund and PayPal‚Äôs PYUSD stablecoin. Additionally, the company recently announced the formation of the Global Markets Alliance , a new coalition aimed at establishing technical and compliance standards for tokenized public securities. The alliance brings together key players including the Solana Foundation, Fireblocks, BitGo, Trust Wallet, Bitget Wallet, Jupiter, and Newtoiwkr. The initiative sets the stage for the upcoming launch of Ondo Global Markets, a platform designed to enable applications and wallets to provide direct access to U.S. securities for non-U.S. traders.

Weeks after Europe‚Äôs Markets in Crypto Assets ( MiCA ) regime came into force last December, Malta awarded licenses to some of the largest crypto exchanges: OKX and Crypto.com . Securing a MiCA crypto asset service provider (CASP) license in one country enables firms to operate across the entire European Economic Area, which consists of 30 nations. Most recently, crypto exchange Gemini said it was looking to secure a MiCA license in Malta. Malta's rapid embrace of MiCA is drawing both interest and concern. While the CASP rules were created to set high and unified standards across Europe, member states have a degree of leeway when it comes to processing applications. Malta's approach has led some crypto industry stakeholders to question whether the island's light-touch attitude to its MiCA due diligence is too relaxed , and if it is processing applications quicker than it should. MiCA's Malta shortcut Malta introduced a local regulatory framework for crypto in 2018 ‚Äî the Virtual Financial Assets (VFA) Framework ‚Äî which can be leveraged to allow certain firms to make the transition to MiCA with relative ease. The island‚Äôs legacy regime ‚Äúhas been recognised as being quasi-equivalent to MiCAR,‚Äù according to the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). The framework is an important stepping stone for companies seeking to gain MiCA designation, because if a crypto firm held a local VFA license before Dec. 30, 2024 , Malta can offer a fast-track to MiCA and so-called ‚Äúpre-authorization‚Äù status. ‚ÄúWhile approval timelines can vary based on the completeness and quality of submissions, existing Virtual Financial Asset (VFA) Service Providers may experience expedited processing due to Malta‚Äôs established VFA regime,‚Äù an MFSA official said via email. Oversight concerns While Malta has shown it can adapt quickly to regulatory developments, and it is likely a welcoming development for firms that seek faster regulatory clarity, industry observers have raised questions regarding the substance and scale of its regulatory supervision. ‚ÄúSmaller jurisdictions can adapt faster to regulatory developments, and they do,‚Äù Liat Shetret, vice president of global policy and regulation at blockchain analytics company Elliptic said in an interview with CoinDesk. Shetret's main concern is whether these fast-tracked approvals are backed by enforcement muscle behind them. ‚ÄúWe have seen a lot of developments around 'bring the business here.' Licensing and registration is fast-tracked. And then the rest of it is almost disaggregated in terms of: How do we continue to supervise? What's the oversight that these entities have? Are our agencies fit for that purpose in terms of size and scale?‚Äù ‚ÄúI think we just need to move the conversation beyond licensing and registration in jurisdictions like Malta. Show me the enforcement team, show me a skilled crypto enforcement or up-skilled crypto law enforcement team that knows how to investigate,‚Äù Shetret said. But crypto industry players on the island say that Malta‚Äôs familiarity with digital assets regulation is what sets it apart from other places. ‚ÄúThese operators are actively seeking regulation by authorities who understand the crypto industry,‚Äù Ian Guaci, the managing partner at Malta-based law firm GTG, said in an interview. ‚ÄúThe concern is this: In countries that have never previously regulated crypto-assets, even if they now implement MiCA, who will ensure that the regulation is applied effectively, with the necessary expertise and consistency?‚Äù In simple terms, it's like ordering a quick takeout versus going to a Michelin-star restaurant after waiting for three months to get a reservation. This is the point Przemys≈Çaw Kral, the CEO of Zondacrypto, the largest crypto exchange in Poland, is making, regarding the decision to switch his firm‚Äôs MiCA focus from Malta to Estonia, despite the latter being more complicated and time-consuming. ‚ÄúEstonia is much more exclusive than the Maltese regulatory process,‚Äù said Kral, whose firm is a competitor to crypto exchanges on the continent, in an interview, adding that ‚Äúreceiving a MiCA license should not be like ordering food in McDonald's."" ""The process should be complicated and should be very strict. If I were a customer, I would choose a company that is applying for a MiCA license that's a bit more of a complicated procedure, and not with such a fast outcome ‚Äî because OKX received it in a few days, frankly speaking.‚Äù (OKX received a pre-authorization on Jan. 23, 2025 and a full license on Jan. 27, 2025 ‚Äî just four days later.) Crypto giants' bet on Malta Among some of the crypto firms that have received the expedited license in Malta is OKX, a top-five exchange known for sponsoring the likes of Manchester City soccer club and the McLaren Formula 1 Team. OKX claimed to be the first global player granted pre-authorization by the crypto-friendly island in January, having been in possession of a class 4 crypto service provider license in Malta. In a turn of events, about a month after OKX trumpeted its MiCA pre-authorization status, the firm paid half a billion dollars to settle charges with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), a penalty related to the firm‚Äôs alleged history of not holding the appropriate licenses to offer crypto services. It's not clear if Malta had knowledge of the pending settlement with the DoJ, given the sensitivity of the matter. However, in April, MFSA fined OKX $1.2 million for breaching the country's money laundering rules. When asked why the MFSA would grant MiCA pre-authorization to a firm that had a pending judgment and settlement with the DoJ, the Maltese watchdog said it takes a risk-based approach. ‚ÄúAuthorisations are granted once all information deemed necessary is collected, and on the basis of its careful analysis and cross checks conducted at that juncture. It is important to recognise the need for a balance between comprehensive assessments and processing expediency, essentially focusing on what really matters,‚Äù MFSA said via email. ‚ÄúMaintaining this balance is key to ensuring that any market entry framework functions effectively. Our approach to assessing risks has been thoughtfully developed over years of supervision and expertise in the various sectors, allowing us to implement measures that are both proportionate and effective,‚Äù MFSA added. OKX did not provide a comment by publication time. However, OKX Europe's CEO, Erald Ghoos, recently took to X to air his views on Malta. ""We chose Malta because they had made more advances in their licensed product offering as a whole,"" Ghoos said, noting that the firm explored France and Netherlands, before finally deciding on Malta. ""Did OKX receive any favorable terms from MFSA? The answer is no, and in fact, again the opposite,"" he added. Similar to OKX, another heavyweight, Crypto.com also announced in January that it had in-principle approval from Malta before being granted a CASP license under MiCA. Crypto.com, which also courts high profile sponsorships with FIFA World Cup, F1 and PGA golf tours and others, has secured licenses in competitive markets like Dubai, South Korea, Singapore, Australia and even the U.K . But Crypto.com also has a history of operating without the proper licenses in place. De Nederlandsche Bank, which seeks to sustain financial stability in the Netherlands, fined Crypto.com 2.85 million euros ($3.25 million) in 2023 for operating in the country without a license for almost two years. It registered with De Nederlandsche Bank as a provider of crypto services in 2023. A spokesperson for Crypto.com said the firm has a longstanding presence in and commitment to Malta. ‚ÄúWe have maintained a workforce in Malta since the early stages of our existence as a company, and Malta has been the base of our global operations business unit for more than five years,"" the spokesperson said via email. France fires back Sticking with the restaurant analogy, there are Michelin-star chefs and then there are French cuisine-trained Michelin-star chefs, coveted as one of the most technically challenging feats within the restaurant business. Similar dynamics seem to be playing out with the regulatory framework in the continent as well. In a speech earlier this year, Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani, the president of the financial markets authority in France (AMF), warned of products coming to market via a MiCA passport that were ‚Äúapproved by some of our peers with, let‚Äôs say, a rather quick pen.‚Äù The AMF president called for stronger coordination with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to maintain a level playing field. ‚ÄúWe want to avoid what's known as ‚Äòregulatory shopping,‚Äô that is, actors seeking approval in jurisdictions where it‚Äôs easiest to obtain,‚Äù Barbat-Layani said. MiCA authorization is hammered out through a series of private conversations between commercial firms and their respective regulators, making it difficult to compare and contrast the approaches of various jurisdictions. ESMA and the European Banking Authority (EBA) are supposed to drive convergence by setting up structures for peer review and exchange of information. In theory, all member states ought to be aware of how each other is doing this job, and do things in a broadly similar way. Daniel Arroche, a partner at French crypto and blockchain-focused law firm d&a partners, said that while MiCA seeks harmonization, in practice, standards vary widely. ‚ÄúRegulatory arbitrage‚Äù is happening within the EU, Arroche said, which could mislead firms into thinking all licenses are equally solid. France has taken the lead by anticipating MiCA with its PACTE law and by applying strict vetting, Arroche added. ‚ÄúFrance‚Äôs regulator, the AMF, has deep experience and is now processing MiCA applications in close alignment with ESMA‚Äôs evolving standards,‚Äù Arroche said in an email. ‚ÄúIn contrast, countries like Malta or Cyprus have issued licenses before all regulatory technical standards were published ‚Äî in some cases even granting ‚Äòpre-approvals‚Äô not foreseen by MiCA, raising serious concerns about regulatory shortcuts.‚Äù It‚Äôs perhaps not surprising to find some crypto regulation professionals in France calling out Malta‚Äôs fast-track approach. France has become known for the glacial pace of its MiCA license authorization; the nation has only awarded one Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) license. OKX, for one, was pursuing licenses in both Malta and France but gave up on France in July last year. In any case, close scrutiny of Malta is reportedly happening behind the scenes. Bloomberg reported in March that several EU regulators had urged ESMA to take action concerning OKX in the wake of the hack of crypto exchange Bybit, as well as to press Malta regarding the firm‚Äôs license. Additionally, Agence France-Presse (AFP), a French international news agency, recently reported that ESMA had launched a ""peer review"" of an unnamed regulator that is potentially too lax. An executive at a European CASP, who asked to remain anonymous, told CoinDesk that several sources had indicated to him an ESMA audit on Malta‚Äôs financial regulator is taking place. Both ESMA and the AMF declined to comment. Crypto's growing pains in the EU While France may not be in favor of how other countries are fast-tracking their regulatory framework, it does raise the question of the risk of centralization and how that spills beyond just crypto-related politics. Implementing MiCA at a national level throws a spotlight on how the EU functions as a centralized yet diverse band of trading countries, and raises fundamental questions about the importance of uniformity among Europe's member states, said Mark Foster, EU Policy Lead, Crypto Council for Innovation. ‚ÄúDo you want a federal Europe, essentially, where everything is decided at European level, where there is a certain centralization and a value to that in terms of economies of scale to compete with China or the U.S.?‚Äù Foster said in an interview. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, a more decentralized approach respects the diversity of each country, some of whom may have specialization in areas like asset management, for instance. That's obviously very important for those domestic countries and those jurisdictions, who would have a lot to lose if you then just centralize everything and put it all in Paris,‚Äù Foster said. This is likely creating growing pains within the crypto firms that are craving a clear regulatory framework in the region. Firms don‚Äôt want to talk openly about ways in which MiCA compliance might vary from one place to the next. But it‚Äôs possible to read between the lines in some cases. Crypto exchange Bitpanda, which holds MiCA licenses in Austria, Malta and Germany, and also competes against OKX and Crypto.com , hinted at how it views MiCA license equivalence when the firm was granted a license by the German regulator, BaFIN. ‚ÄúThis licence has immediate validity ‚Äî unlike in-principle licenses announced by other crypto platforms which are neither valid nor exist at all,‚Äù Bitpanda said of its German license when it was approved in January of this year. Bitpanda declined to comment. Cash for citizenship Aside from growing debate over centralization and decentralization, a high profile legal spat with the European Commission (EC) over the island‚Äôs right to offer Maltese citizenship to people who invest in the country, recently came to a head. Just over a month ago, Malta‚Äôs so-called ‚ÄúGolden Visa‚Äù or Malta Permanent Residence Programme (MPRP) scheme was deemed illegal by Europe‚Äôs highest court . The program allowed wealthy individuals to gain EU citizenship for a price tag of around $1 million. The EC has said these visas opened Europe‚Äôs door to money laundering, tax evasion and corruption. ‚ÄúThe same places that tend to implement golden passport programs also offer really accommodating offshore legislation for companies,‚Äù according to a former investigator from Tracfin, an anti-money laundering intelligence unit attached to the French Ministry of Finance. ‚ÄúThis is no coincidence,‚Äù said the person, who asked to remain nameless. ‚ÄúMost of these countries are tax havens and they do these kinds of activities because they don't have a lot of resources and are struggling to develop their economy.‚Äù While Malta didn't appeal the ruling, the country said it is reviewing what the court ruling means legally. Although the golden visa loophole bears no direct relation to crypto regulation, there could be a parallel in the way that Malta appears to be passporting both wealthy individuals and cash-laden crypto companies into the EU. OKX‚Äôs Chinese CEO and founder, Star Xu, availed himself of a Maltese passport in March of 2024, according to documents seen by CoinDesk. ‚ÄúThe risk for European regulators is that supervisory arbitrage appears to be possible in the region. It's possible to go to the jurisdiction that offers the biggest promise and the least hassle,‚Äù said one anonymous compliance professional who has worked with CASPs attached to multiple member states. ‚ÄúIf firms go to Malta to get a license because other jurisdictions are taking too long, I think we have failed to build a system for serious trading firms.‚Äù",News Analysis|MiCA|Malta|OKX|Feature,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-30 08:00:00

A fresh wave of altcoins is quietly positioning for major moves ‚Äî and savvy investors are already watching closely. From DeFi leaders to real-world asset pioneers, these five projects could not only rival Bitcoin‚Äôs performance but potentially leave it in the dust. Let‚Äôs break down which altcoins are flashing early signals of breakout potential. Worldcoin (WLD): A Deep Discount with Massive Upside Potential Source: tradingview Worldcoin may be trading between $0.87 and $1.15, but this consolidation could be the calm before a breakout. With key resistance levels at $1.32 and $1.60, a reversal could offer gains of over 85%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dipping below 40 suggests the asset is oversold, potentially setting the stage for a strong rebound. As the project continues pushing forward with global digital identity infrastructure, it holds the kind of long-term vision that often gets rediscovered during bullish cycles. If sentiment shifts even slightly, WLD could catch fire quickly. Hedera (HBAR): Ready to Rebound from Oversold Conditions Source: tradingview Despite recent pullbacks, Hedera‚Äôs current zone between $0.14 and $0.18 puts it at a strategic accumulation level. The RSI hovering near oversold levels hints that bearish momentum may be fading. If HBAR climbs past the $0.20‚Äì$0.23 range, it could quickly unlock upside potential. With an expanding ecosystem, carbon-negative network credentials, and enterprise use cases across banking, supply chain, and sustainability, Hedera remains one of the most undervalued Layer-1s. The next market rally may finally reward its steady and institutional-grade growth. Ondo (ONDO): Undervalued with Strong RWA Narrative Source: tradingview Ondo‚Äôs price action around $0.72‚Äì$0.89 reflects a market in wait mode, but technicals show a setup for reversal. Its RSI below 40 highlights undervaluation, and a move past $0.99 could unlock a clean run toward $1.16 or higher‚Äîa potential 30% gain. As a leader in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), Ondo‚Äôs strong fundamentals could drive renewed investor interest when market confidence returns. With increasing institutional attention toward on-chain treasuries and yield products, ONDO could be a strategic long play in a sector that‚Äôs just getting started. Uniswap (UNI): Set to Break Free with DeFi Momentum Source: tradingview Uniswap is holding steady between $6.03 and $8.49, with signs of building momentum after gaining 11% over the past month. Key support at $4.89 looks solid, and if bulls break the $9 mark, UNI could target $12‚Äîa potential 50% surge. As DeFi adoption accelerates, UNI remains one of the top platforms set to benefit from renewed market enthusiasm. Its dominance in decentralized exchange volume and the upcoming V4 upgrade could serve as major catalysts. With the right macro backdrop, Uniswap could once again lead the DeFi narrative. Ethena (ENA): A Comeback Story in the Making Source: tradingview Trading in the $0.26‚Äì$0.36 range, Ethena may seem quiet, but the chart paints a different picture. The $0.22 support is holding strong, and a breakout above $0.42 could lead to a rapid push toward $0.52‚Äîup to 44% higher. With interest in synthetic dollar solutions growing, ENA‚Äôs use case could make it a major gainer when the next wave of buyers enters the market. The project is still in its early growth phase, and volatility often comes before momentum in emerging narratives. Ethena may be one sharp breakout away from renewed attention. Conclusion In a market where Bitcoin often takes the spotlight, it's easy to overlook the hidden gems brewing just beneath the surface. But as history shows, bull markets are defined by unexpected winners. Whether it's the tokenization of real-world assets, decentralized finance innovation, or next-gen identity protocols ‚Äî these five altcoins are armed with strong narratives and favorable technicals. If the bull run kicks off soon, they may not just follow the trend ‚Äî they could lead it. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As of June 14, the total BTC and USDT holdings held in user wallets have plummeted significantly compared to the previous month‚Äôs report. On June 30, the crypto trading platform released its 32nd proof-of-reserves report containing the number of assets held within its reserves compared to the number of assets deposited by customers. So far, all of its reserves exceed the 100% ratio. This means that the platform‚Äôs reserves for major tokens like BTC ( BTC ), ETH ( ETH ), SOL ( SOL ) and USDT ( USDT ) has surpassed the number of assets held in customer wallets . The reserve rate for Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) holds the largest ratio, which stands at 107%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains the second largest asset by reserve to holding ratio, sitting at 105% as of June 14. However, the number of BTC held by customers has experienced a significant drop. Compared to the previous month‚Äôs report, specifically for May 10th, the number of currently held BTC in June has decreased by 4,360 BTC or around $470 million according to current market prices. Compared to May‚Äôs customer holdings for BTC, which stood at 125,164 BTC, the number fell by 3.48%. OKX released its 32nd proof-of-reserves report on June 30 | Source: OKX You might also like: OKX publishes proof of reserves with over 100% assets held for 22 cryptocurrencies Aside from BTC, USDT also fell by 1.44% in June compared to the previous month. This means that the amount of USDT held by OKX users decreased by $126.4 million. Although the decline is not as steep as the drop experienced by BTC, it is still worth noting due to the boom stablecoins in the wider market as of late. On the other hand, customer wallet holdings for Ethereum rose by nearly 6% in June. This signifies a rise of 110,153 ETH ($272.8 million) in the span of a nearly a month. The report shows that OKX users have been depositing more Ethereum into the exchange compared to Bitcoin. What could the drop in OKX user BTC holdings mean? The 3.48% drop in BTC holdings show that users may have chosen to withdrawn more Bitcoin from the exchange compared to the previous month. A possible reason behind this trend is the increasing number of traders keen on self-custody . This means that users might be moving more of their BTC to cold wallets, reflecting growing concerns over exchange security or a preference for holding during uncertain market conditions. Another possibility is that some traders may be trading away their BTC holdings in favor of other assets in the wake of recent price movements. BTC had recently recovered from its short-lived slump when Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, bouncing back to the $105,000 mark. However, the Fed rate decision and other geopolitical uncertainties have caused Bitcoin to flatline for the most part.

Yet, the reality is that major macroeconomic shifts and key economic events often ripple through the crypto market, dictating sentiment, liquidity, and even price action. This week is no exception, bringing a series of significant U.S. economic data releases and central bank communications that demand your attention. Understanding these events isn‚Äôt just about being informed; it‚Äôs about gaining a strategic edge in navigating potential volatility and identifying opportunities within your crypto portfolio. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned trader or a long-term hodler, the upcoming schedule offers critical insights into the health of the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy stance. These factors are pivotal in shaping overall investor sentiment, which, in turn, directly impacts risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Let‚Äôs dive into the specifics of what‚Äôs on the docket and how these developments could shape the week for digital assets. Understanding the Week Ahead: Key Economic Events Overview The financial calendar is packed with data that could move markets. Here‚Äôs a quick glance at the primary economic events scheduled for this week, all times listed are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC): Date Time (UTC) Country Event Monday, June 30 14:00 U.S. FOMC Member Bostic Speaks Tuesday, July 1 13:30 U.S. Fed Chair Powell Speaks Thursday, July 3 Holiday U.S. U.S. Independence Day (Early close at 17:00) Thursday, July 3 12:30 U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls (June) Thursday, July 3 12:30 U.S. Unemployment Rate (June) Thursday, July 3 14:00 U.S. ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Thursday, July 3 15:00 U.S. FOMC Member Bostic Speaks Friday, July 4 All Day U.S. U.S. Holiday (Independence Day) The Power of the Podium: How Fed Chair Powell‚Äôs Words Echo Through the Crypto Market One of the most anticipated events this week is the speech by Fed Chair Powell on Tuesday. As the head of the U.S. central bank, Jerome Powell‚Äôs statements are scrutinized by markets worldwide. His remarks often provide crucial insights into the Federal Reserve‚Äôs thinking on inflation, interest rates, and the overall economic outlook. Any hawkish (tighter monetary policy) or dovish (looser monetary policy) tilt in his language can trigger significant market reactions, directly influencing investor sentiment . Why it Matters: The Fed‚Äôs monetary policy, particularly interest rate decisions, directly impacts the attractiveness of risk assets. Higher interest rates typically make traditional, less volatile investments (like bonds) more appealing, potentially drawing capital away from speculative assets such as cryptocurrencies. Conversely, hints of rate cuts or a more accommodative stance can boost risk appetite, benefiting the crypto market impact . What to Watch For: Pay close attention to his tone regarding inflation persistence, the strength of the labor market, and any hints about the future path of interest rates. Even subtle shifts in wording can lead to significant market movements. Actionable Insight: Consider the potential for increased volatility around the time of his speech. Traders might look for opportunities to scalp short-term moves, while long-term investors should assess how his remarks align with their broader investment thesis for digital assets. Decoding FOMC Member Bostic Speaks: What Are Central Bankers Signaling? Adding to the central bank commentary, FOMC Member Bostic is scheduled to speak twice this week. Members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are key figures in setting U.S. monetary policy. While not as impactful as the Chair, their speeches offer a broader perspective on the committee‚Äôs consensus and dissenting views. Why it Matters: These speeches contribute to the overall narrative surrounding the Fed‚Äôs future actions. They can reinforce or contradict market expectations, providing a more complete picture of the central bank‚Äôs stance. For the crypto market impact , a unified hawkish tone from multiple FOMC members could signal sustained pressure on risk assets, while a more divided or dovish outlook might offer some relief. What to Watch For: Listen for discussions on economic data, inflation trends, and the ‚Äòdot plot‚Äô projections for interest rates. Any deviation from the perceived consensus can create ripples. Actionable Insight: Use these speeches to gauge the breadth of opinion within the Fed. Consistent hawkish remarks from various members might suggest a stronger commitment to higher-for-longer rates, impacting crypto‚Äôs short-to-medium term outlook. The Employment Pulse: How Nonfarm Payrolls and Unemployment Rate Shape Investor Sentiment Thursday brings a double dose of critical labor market data: the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report and the Unemployment Rate for June. These are arguably some of the most closely watched economic events , providing a comprehensive snapshot of the U.S. job market‚Äôs health. Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP): This report measures the number of new jobs created in the U.S. economy, excluding farm workers and certain government employees. A strong NFP number indicates a robust job market, which typically correlates with strong economic growth and potentially higher inflation. Unemployment Rate: This percentage indicates the proportion of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking work. A low unemployment rate, especially when combined with strong NFP, suggests a tight labor market, which can fuel wage growth and inflationary pressures. Why They Matter for Crypto: A strong labor market (high NFP, low unemployment) often empowers the Fed to maintain or even increase interest rates, as it suggests the economy can handle tighter monetary conditions. This scenario is generally negative for risk assets like crypto, as it increases the cost of capital and reduces speculative appetite. Conversely, weaker job numbers might signal economic softening, potentially leading the Fed to consider easing monetary policy, which could be bullish for crypto. The immediate crypto market impact can be swift and significant upon release of this data. Actionable Insight: Be prepared for significant volatility immediately following the 12:30 UTC release. Traders often try to anticipate the numbers, but the actual release can lead to sharp moves. Consider hedging strategies or reducing exposure if you‚Äôre uncertain about the outcome. Gauging Economic Health: The ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI‚Äôs Influence on Crypto Market Impact Also on Thursday, the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index) provides a vital look into the health of the U.S. services sector, which constitutes a large portion of the economy. This index is based on a survey of purchasing managers and reflects business conditions, including new orders, employment, and supplier deliveries. Why it Matters: A PMI reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, while a reading below 50 suggests contraction. A strong PMI report points to robust economic activity, which, similar to strong jobs data, can give the Fed more room to maintain a hawkish stance. A weaker-than-expected PMI might signal an economic slowdown, potentially leading to a more dovish Fed and a positive crypto market impact due to increased risk appetite. This report is a forward-looking indicator, offering clues about future economic trends and thus influencing broader investor sentiment . What to Watch For: The headline number is key, but also look at sub-indices like new orders and employment for deeper insights into business confidence and activity. Actionable Insight: This report can confirm or contradict narratives established by other data. A strong PMI alongside strong jobs data could reinforce a bearish outlook for crypto in the short term, while a weak PMI could offer a glimmer of hope for a more accommodative Fed. Navigating Holiday Trading: U.S. Independence Day and Market Liquidity The week also includes the U.S. Independence Day holiday, with an early market close on Thursday and a full closure on Friday. While not an economic data release, holidays have their own distinct crypto market impact . Why it Matters: Holiday periods typically lead to reduced trading volume and liquidity in traditional financial markets. This can sometimes translate to thinner order books in crypto markets as well, especially for pairs heavily traded against the U.S. dollar. Lower liquidity means that even smaller trades can have a disproportionately larger impact on price, potentially leading to exaggerated moves or flash crashes/pumps. What to Watch For: Be aware that sudden news or unexpected developments during holiday periods can lead to amplified price swings due to the lack of depth in the market. Actionable Insight: Exercise caution when trading during holidays. Consider reducing position sizes or avoiding highly leveraged trades if you are concerned about potential volatility spikes in illiquid markets. The Collective Ripple: Broader Implications for Your Crypto Portfolio Each of these economic events , from Fed Chair Powell ‚Äòs pivotal speech to the critical Nonfarm Payrolls report and the ongoing FOMC communications, contributes to a larger economic narrative. This narrative, in turn, heavily influences the macro environment for cryptocurrencies. Here‚Äôs how: Interest Rate Expectations: Strong economic data and hawkish Fed commentary reinforce expectations of higher interest rates, which generally weigh down risk assets. U.S. Dollar Strength: A robust U.S. economy and hawkish Fed can lead to a stronger U.S. dollar. A stronger dollar can make dollar-denominated assets, including crypto, less attractive to international investors or lead to selling pressure. Risk Appetite: When the economic outlook is uncertain or interest rates are high, investors tend to become more risk-averse, pulling funds from speculative assets like crypto and moving them into safer havens. Conversely, signs of economic stability or dovish central bank policy can fuel a ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô environment. Inflation Outlook: All these data points feed into the inflation debate. If inflation remains stubbornly high, the Fed is likely to remain restrictive, which is generally negative for crypto. If inflation shows signs of cooling, it could pave the way for a more accommodative Fed. Understanding these interconnected factors is paramount for any serious crypto investor. The crypto market impact is not isolated; it is deeply intertwined with global economic forces. Preparing for Volatility: Actionable Strategies for Crypto Investors Given the array of significant economic events this week, volatility is a strong possibility. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate the coming days: Stay Informed and Timely: Mark your calendars with the exact release times (UTC) for the key reports. Real-time access to the data is crucial, as markets react instantly. Practice Risk Management: Consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on your trades. If you‚Äôre holding long-term, be prepared for potential short-term price swings and avoid making emotional decisions. Avoid Excessive Leverage: Highly leveraged positions are extremely vulnerable to sudden price movements triggered by economic news. Reduce your leverage or avoid it altogether around major announcements. Observe Correlations: Pay attention to how Bitcoin reacts to the news, as it often sets the tone for the broader altcoin market. Look for historical patterns of correlation between macro data and crypto price action. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For long-term investors, periods of heightened volatility can present opportunities to DCA into positions at potentially lower prices, smoothing out your entry cost over time. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your current holdings. Are you overexposed to highly speculative assets that might be more sensitive to negative economic news? Diversification can be a powerful tool. Concluding Thoughts: Embracing Economic Literacy for Crypto Success The week ahead underscores a fundamental truth in the world of digital assets: while decentralized and innovative, cryptocurrencies do not exist in a vacuum. The global economy, driven by key economic events and central bank policies, exerts a powerful gravitational pull on even the most revolutionary technologies. By diligently tracking speeches from figures like Fed Chair Powell , analyzing reports like Nonfarm Payrolls , and understanding the broader implications of FOMC communications, you empower yourself to make more informed decisions. This proactive approach to economic literacy is not just about mitigating risks; it‚Äôs about unlocking opportunities. Volatility, driven by unexpected data or shifts in sentiment, can be a double-edged sword. For those who are prepared and understand the underlying forces, it can present moments to enter positions strategically or adjust portfolios to capitalize on emerging trends. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and remember that knowledge is your most powerful asset in the ever-evolving landscape of crypto.

However, while he is waving the flag for Cardano‚Äôs future , he‚Äôs also waving a warning. The founder believes Cardano has a real shot at becoming the backbone of Bitcoin DeFi, thanks to its powerful tech stack and growing ecosystem. But there‚Äôs one big problem, and there is no one leading the conversation. With projects like Minswap planning to tap into Bitcoin‚Äôs massive $2 trillion liquidity and tools like USDM and Lace Wallet gaining traction, Cardano is setting the stage for growth. But founder Hoskinson says without strong leadership to drive this narrative, the platform may struggle to fully capitalize on the opportunity. A Big Opportunity, But Poor Management Hoskinson thinks Bitcoin DeFi is Cardano‚Äôs golden opportunity, as it could boost liquidity and bring in new users. He points to projects like Minswap (Cardano‚Äôs top DEX), the Lace Wallet, and the USDM stablecoin, which are all gaining ground. Minswap is even preparing to integrate Bitcoin , aiming at a whopping $2 trillion liquidity pool. Combine that with tech innovations like Leios, Hydra, and the Midnight Glacier Drop, and Cardano has the tools. But without a strong executive presence or a compelling narrative, the crypto world isn‚Äôt catching on. In a candid post on X , Hoskinson said Cardano is missing an ‚Äúexecutive voice‚Äù and a capable foundation to drive its vision into the crypto mainstream. He‚Äôs been personally trying to fill that gap, but it‚Äôs come with challenges, including personal attacks and ADA theft accusations. He calls the effort ‚Äúbrutal and expensive.‚Äù Cardano‚Äôs Game Plan Moving Forward Input Output Global (IOG), Hoskinson‚Äôs company, is still pushing the story forward. But he believes the broader community and ecosystem need to step up. With the Rare Evo crypto conference on the horizon, Cardano has big plans to fix its internal structure, like updating its constitution, tackling governance issues, and even launching a sovereign wealth fund to fund its Bitcoin DeFi ambitions. However, they still need a strong voice to take it to the heights. [post_titles_links postid=‚Äù476691‚Ä≥] Cardano Current Market Snapshot Cardano (ADA) is down 35% this year but still up 56% over the past year. With 35.36 billion ADA already in circulation out of a 45 billion cap, there‚Äôs still a large supply that could pressure prices if demand doesn‚Äôt rise. Its 2% annual inflation rate, higher than Bitcoin‚Äôs 0.82%, adds to the challenge. To counter this, Cardano plans to convert 5‚Äì10% of its treasury (about 140 million ADA) into Bitcoin or stablecoins using a TWAP strategy, similar to what Michael Saylor does for BTC buys, to avoid market shocks. Hoskinson hopes future gains from BTC or stablecoins could fund ADA buybacks, potentially supporting its price long-term.

Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) refers to decentralized finance applications and protocols that leverage Bitcoin‚Äôs security and liquidity. It allows users to use their Bitcoin holdings for activities like lending, borrowing, trading, and yield generation, expanding Bitcoin‚Äôs utility beyond just a store of value. How can Cardano establish strong leadership to boost Bitcoin DeFi adoption? Charles Hoskinson suggests Cardano needs a dedicated ‚Äúexecutive voice‚Äù and a capable foundation to drive its vision into the mainstream. While IOG pushes the narrative, the community and ecosystem need to step up. Future plans include governance updates and a sovereign wealth fund to fund Bitcoin DeFi initiatives. Can Cardano realistically become the backbone of Bitcoin DeFi, and what milestones need to be achieved for this vision to materialize? Cardano has the technological tools (e.g., Minswap, Lace Wallet, USDM, Leios, Hydra). However, it needs a strong ‚Äúexecutive voice‚Äù to lead the narrative, fix internal governance, and effectively communicate its vision to the broader crypto world for this ambition to materialize.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-30 08:00:36

A sense of quiet anticipation hovers over the market. Ethereum and XRP, two of the most established altcoins, aren‚Äôt just waiting for another rally ‚Äî they‚Äôre preparing for it. The question is, can macro sentiment boost altcoins into late 2025? What are the Ethereum and XRP price outlooks for 2025? From regulatory shakeups to ETF breakthroughs and major global economic shifts, conditions are aligning in ways we haven‚Äôt seen since the last bull cycle. While Bitcoin leads with stability, Ethereum and XRP are quietly loading the slingshot and altcoin investors are watching for the moment the rubber band snaps forward. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Unseen Player in the Big Game While Ethereum and XRP lay the groundwork for a potential Q4 surge, a new token is rising quietly in the background ‚Äî MAGACOIN FINANCE . With an active presale and a fully audited contract by HashEx, the project is pulling early believers looking for asymmetric upside. As the macro wave lifts the majors, MAGACOIN FINANCE could ride the undercurrent straight into the spotlight If ETH breaks $3,000 and XRP hits $3.50, the market will chase new narratives. As a result, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be ready to answer that call. Ethereum Prepares for a Strong Breakout After weathering a tough 12 months, ETH is now coiled tightly, like a spring waiting for a spark. The Shapella upgrade has already unlocked over $30 billion in staked ETH, giving institutions and early stakers access to long-frozen funds. But instead of triggering sell pressure, the unlocks are forming a new layer of liquidity, one that could fuel fresh inflows when macro sentiment flips risk-on. And suddenly, Ethereum looks like a sleeping dragon. A reclaim of a major resistance line around the $2,500 to $2,800 zone, ETH price could fly straight toward $4,000 or more before the year ends. XRP‚Äôs Increased Developments Boost Price For years, XRP felt like a Ferrari stuck in legal traffic. That traffic has now cleared. With Ripple‚Äôs settlement with the SEC getting finalized, XRP is legally cleaner than ever. The XRP Ledger v2.5.0 upgrade only adds fuel to the narrative, bringing tools like TokenEscrow, Batch execution, and Permissioned DEX functionality to the table. But that‚Äôs not all. XRP‚Äôs macro position is improving too: Ceasefire in the Middle East calmed markets, leading to a 15%+ XRP price rebound Major partnerships including Ondo Finance‚Äôs US Treasury-backed tokens (OUSG) are now available on XRPL, with minting and redemption supported by Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, RLUSD. Additionally, Ripple announced a strategic partnership with Japan‚Äôs Web3 Salon to support blockchain startups, backed by JETRO and Ripple‚Äôs Japan & Korea Fund Technically, the altcoin has broken a long-term falling wedge, a classic reversal pattern. If it clears resistance at $2.5-$2.6, the next stop could be $3.5, with more upside if ETF approval hits. Sentiment Is Everything for a Market Boost Both Ethereum and XRP are well-positioned technically and fundamentally. But in 2025, macro sentiment is the real boss. The Federal Reserve has entered a ‚Äúwait-and-watch‚Äù phase on interest rates. Inflation is cooling. Traditional markets are stabilizing. Risk assets including crypto are back on the radar of hedge funds and institutions. Combine that with the growing appetite for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and the ETF momentum across altcoins, and a larger story is forming: Altcoins may be on the verge of regaining narrative dominance. Final Word Ethereum and XRP are waking up. Global sentiment is shifting and regulations are softening. Additionally, ETFs are unlocking fresh capital and the only question left is timing. But just as the giants prepare to roar back, a new voice is rising in the distance. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn‚Äôt here to follow the trend ‚Äî it‚Äôs here to rewrite it. Strong fundamentals, explosive branding, and rapid buyer activity make MAGACOIN FINANCE a top candidate for breakout growth in 2025. As global sentiment warms to crypto and ETFs flood mainstream headlines, the conditions are ripe for altcoins to reclaim center stage. The real winners? Likely those who positioned themselves before the breakout ‚Äî not after. So, while Ethereum and XRP stretch their wings for another flight, don‚Äôt overlook the one project that‚Äôs building momentum beneath the radar.

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a combined $2.22 billion in net inflows between June 23 and 27. This figure marks their strongest weekly performance since May 23 and the longest streak of consecutive inflows since January 2025. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT once again posted the highest inflows, pulling in $1.3 billion and outperforming the rest of the funds by a wide margin. Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC followed, recording approximately $504 million. Other funds, including Bitwise‚Äôs BITB, VanEck‚Äôs HODL, and Ark‚Äôs ARKB, saw more modest activity, while in contrast, Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC recorded outflows of approximately $5.7 million. Bitcoin ETFs weekly inflows chart | Source: SoSoValue The sustained inflows come as Bitcoin ( BTC ) holds steady in performance. Trading near $108,200 at the time of writing, the crypto market giant has posted a 7% gain over the past week.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, 57-year-old Dwayne Golden was sentenced on June 27 by U.S. District Judge William F. Kuntz II in Brooklyn federal court. Golden had pleaded guilty in September 2024 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. Golden, alongside co-defendants Gregory Aggesen, Marquis Egerton (also known as ‚ÄúMardy Eger‚Äù), and William White, operated three fraudulent digital asset firms‚ÄîEmpowerCoin, ECoinPlus, and Jet-Coin. Prosecutors said these companies promised guaranteed returns through overseas crypto trading but instead operated as Ponzi schemes, using new investor funds to pay earlier investors or to enrich themselves. The scheme was active between April and August 2017, and investors were left with substantial losses after the operators shut down the platforms and disappeared with the funds. Golden and his associates also attempted to obstruct federal investigations by destroying evidence and submitting false information to authorities.

Golden was also ordered to forfeit $2.46 million, with additional restitution to be decided later. Co-defendant William White has been sentenced to 30 months in prison, while Aggesen and Egerton are awaiting sentencing. Victims have been advised to submit restitution claims to the FBI as part of the ongoing recovery process. Golden‚Äôs sentencing adds to a string of recent crypto-related enforcement actions by the DOJ in June. Earlier this month, the agency moved to seize over $225 million in cryptocurrency linked to pig butchering scams. In a separate case, the DOJ filed a forfeiture action to seize over $7.7 million in crypto tied to North Korean operatives. Just days later, the agency also charged a Russian national and founder of a crypto payments firm for operating a $500 million money laundering scheme. U.S. officials have signaled that aggressive enforcement will continue as crypto-related financial crimes are on the rise . The FBI and DOJ say they are committed to dismantling fraudulent operations and recovering stolen assets for victims through continued international cooperation and advanced blockchain tracing techniques.

Imagine a future where sending money is as easy as sending a text, with stability akin to traditional currency. This vision is rapidly becoming a reality, and a major player in Korea‚Äôs fintech scene, Toss Bank, is making a bold move that could reshape the landscape of digital money. The recent news of Toss Bank‚Äôs extensive trademark filings for a Toss Bank stablecoin is a clear signal: the race for a robust, regulated digital currency ecosystem is heating up, and Korea is leading the charge. The Bold Move: Why is Toss Bank Eyeing the Stablecoin Arena? Toss Bank, a prominent South Korean neobank, isn‚Äôt just dipping its toes into the stablecoin waters; it‚Äôs diving in headfirst. Reports indicate that Toss Bank has filed a staggering 48 trademark applications specifically tied to Korean won-based stablecoins. This isn‚Äôt merely a speculative move; it‚Äôs a strategic positioning in anticipation of a rapidly evolving financial future. But why now, and why such an aggressive push? For a neobank like Toss Bank, which thrives on innovation and user-friendly digital services, embracing stablecoins offers several compelling advantages: Enhanced User Experience: Stablecoins can facilitate faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions, both domestically and internationally, compared to traditional banking rails. New Revenue Streams: Offering stablecoin services could open doors to new financial products, such as digital asset lending, borrowing, and even decentralized finance (DeFi) integration, all within a regulated framework. Competitive Edge: By being an early mover, Toss Bank can establish itself as a leader in the digital asset space, attracting a tech-savvy user base that values innovation and convenience. This initiative by Toss Bank is not isolated. It follows similar exploratory steps taken by other major South Korean financial institutions, including KB Kookmin Bank and KakaoBank, indicating a collective recognition among traditional and new-age financial players of the immense potential of stablecoins. The push for a Toss Bank stablecoin is a testament to the growing convergence of traditional finance and the crypto world. Understanding the Rise of Korean Won Stablecoins: What Does It Mean for You? So, what exactly is a Korean won stablecoin , and why is its emergence so significant? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the Korean Won, or to a commodity like gold. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to offer the benefits of blockchain technology ‚Äì speed, transparency, and low transaction costs ‚Äì without the price fluctuations. The development of a Korean Won-backed stablecoin could have profound implications for everyday transactions and the broader economy: Seamless Payments: Imagine paying for your groceries, sending remittances to family abroad, or settling online purchases using a digital won that is instantly transferable and holds a stable value. Reduced Costs: Cross-border transactions, often burdened by high fees and slow processing times, could become significantly cheaper and faster. Financial Inclusion: Stablecoins can provide access to digital financial services for individuals who may be underserved by traditional banking systems. The interest from major banks like Toss Bank, KB Kookmin, and KakaoBank lends significant credibility and trust to the concept of a Korean won stablecoin . Their existing customer bases and regulatory compliance infrastructure could accelerate mass adoption, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset economy. Navigating South Korea‚Äôs Digital Currency Regulation Landscape The enthusiasm for stablecoins in South Korea is matched by a pragmatic approach from financial authorities. Recognizing the transformative potential of these digital assets, but also the inherent risks, the government is actively working to establish a clear regulatory framework. This is crucial for fostering innovation while safeguarding financial stability and protecting consumers. The impending launch of a dedicated task force in the second half of the year to develop a comprehensive digital currency regulation framework for stablecoins is a pivotal development. This task force will likely address key areas such as: Issuance and Redemption: Rules governing how stablecoins are created and converted back into fiat currency. Reserve Requirements: Ensuring that stablecoins are fully backed by transparent, audited reserves to maintain their peg. Consumer Protection: Measures to protect users from fraud, hacking, and market manipulation. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Integrating stablecoins into existing financial crime prevention frameworks. The proactive stance of South Korea stablecoin regulators is commendable. By working closely with financial institutions like Toss Bank, they can create a robust environment that encourages responsible innovation. This balanced approach is vital for the long-term success and widespread adoption of digital currencies within the country‚Äôs financial ecosystem. The Impact on the Neobank Crypto Ecosystem: A New Era? Toss Bank‚Äôs foray into stablecoins is more than just a single company‚Äôs strategy; it signals a significant shift within the broader neobank crypto ecosystem. Neobanks, by their very nature, are agile, digitally native, and often more willing to embrace new technologies than their traditional counterparts. This move could set a precedent for other neobanks globally. Consider the potential ripple effects: Increased Competition: Other neobanks and fintech companies might feel compelled to explore stablecoin offerings to remain competitive. Innovation Hub: South Korea could solidify its position as a global leader in fintech innovation, particularly in the intersection of traditional banking and digital assets. Bridging the Gap: Neobanks can serve as a crucial bridge, introducing mainstream users to the benefits of cryptocurrencies in a familiar, user-friendly banking environment. New Partnerships: We might see more collaborations between neobanks, blockchain technology providers, and even central banks as digital currencies become more integrated. The integration of stablecoins by players like Toss Bank could accelerate the mainstream adoption of digital assets, moving them beyond speculative investments into practical tools for everyday financial activities. This is a game-changer for the neobank crypto space, promising a future where digital and traditional finance are seamlessly intertwined. Key Benefits and Challenges on the Horizon While the prospect of a widely adopted Toss Bank stablecoin and other Korean Won-backed digital assets is exciting, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge both the immense benefits and the inherent challenges that lie ahead. Benefits: Efficiency and Speed: Instantaneous transactions, 24/7, without the delays of traditional banking hours. Cost Reduction: Lower fees for transactions, especially cross-border payments. Financial Accessibility: Potentially easier access to financial services for the unbanked or underbanked. Programmable Money: The ability to embed conditions and logic into transactions, opening doors for innovative financial products. Challenges: Regulatory Clarity: The ongoing development of digital currency regulation is crucial; uncertainty can hinder adoption. Scalability: Ensuring the underlying blockchain infrastructure can handle millions of transactions per second. User Education: Overcoming public skepticism and educating users about the safety and benefits of stablecoins. Interoperability: Ensuring different stablecoins and digital financial systems can seamlessly interact. Security Risks: Protecting against cyber threats, hacking, and potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Addressing these challenges proactively will be key to unlocking the full potential of a Korean won stablecoin and ensuring its long-term success within the South Korea stablecoin market. Actionable Insights for the Digital Future What does Toss Bank‚Äôs move mean for you, whether you‚Äôre a consumer, an investor, or a fintech enthusiast? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on the developments in digital currency regulation in South Korea. The upcoming task force‚Äôs recommendations will be critical. Explore New Services: As Toss Bank and others roll out their stablecoin offerings, explore how they might benefit your personal finances or business operations. Understand the Technology: While you don‚Äôt need to be a blockchain expert, a basic understanding of how stablecoins work will empower you to make informed decisions. Watch for Innovation: The neobank crypto space is dynamic. Expect new products and services to emerge rapidly, driven by competition and technological advancements. A Pivotal Moment for Korea‚Äôs Digital Economy Toss Bank‚Äôs ambitious move to trademark 48 different Korean won-based stablecoins marks a truly pivotal moment for South Korea‚Äôs financial landscape. It underscores a growing confidence among major financial institutions in the transformative power of digital currencies, especially stablecoins. As regulatory frameworks solidify and adoption grows, we can expect a future where the Toss Bank stablecoin , along with offerings from competitors, plays a central role in everyday transactions, fostering greater efficiency, accessibility, and innovation. The journey towards a fully digitized financial system is complex, filled with both immense opportunities and significant challenges. However, with leading neobanks like Toss Bank stepping up and regulators actively shaping the environment, South Korea is undeniably charting an exciting course towards a truly modern, digital-first economy. This is not just about new payment methods; it‚Äôs about redefining the very nature of money and how we interact with it.

However, it faced back-to-back losses in February and March, falling by 36% and 15.7%. A rebound of 18.6% followed in April, with May adding another 6.11%. But June has been less favorable, with SOL dropping 3.73% to $150.72. Despite Solana‚Äôs decent recovery in April and May, XRP has clearly outpaced it in terms of year-to-date growth. That‚Äôs what led to Mumtaz‚Äôs remark‚Äîalthough many believe it was meant in jest, given his history of trolling. Market Cap and Momentum Shift Until December, Solana was holding the position of the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, XRP overtook it, pushing Solana down the ranks. As of now, XRP is the third-largest crypto with a market cap of $128.6 billion, while Solana has fallen to sixth with $80.4 billion. It now sits below BNB, which holds a $95.5 billion valuation. Over the past year, XRP has posted an explosive growth of 360.5%, outperforming not just Solana but even Bitcoin and Ethereum . In contrast, Solana has managed just 6.8% growth during the same period. Utility and Ecosystem Comparison XRP, primarily used for Ripple‚Äôs cross-border payment solutions, continues to expand its presence in institutional finance. Solana is widely known for its fast, cost-effective network, catering to both retail and institutional use cases. However, Mert Mumtaz recently suggested that Solana lacks the tech advantage to compete with XRP‚Äîa bold statement given his loyalty to the Solana ecosystem. XRP ETF vs Solana ETF: Where Are We Headed? The ETF race could prove to be a game-changer for both cryptocurrencies. With Ripple recently ending its cross-appeal in the SEC lawsuit, regulatory clarity has improved. As a result, several XRP spot ETF applications are now under SEC review , and analysts expect a possible approval by Q2 or Q4 2025, potentially in October. [post_titles_links postid=‚Äù476778‚Ä≥] Meanwhile, multiple Solana ETF applications are also in progress, including proposals that involve staking. Although none have received approval in the US yet, the SEC has acknowledged several filings. Notably, Canada has already approved Solana ETFs, giving the token a head start in North America. Interestingly, some analysts like Jason Yanowitz believe that a Solana spot ETF could go live even before XRP‚Äôs‚Äîdespite XRP‚Äôs stronger regulatory momentum. Final Thoughts While XRP‚Äôs performance has outshined Solana‚Äôs in 2025, it‚Äôs too early to declare the end for SOL. Both assets have different strengths and are chasing ETF approvals that could reshape their future. For now, XRP clearly holds the upper hand‚Äîbut in crypto, the race is never truly over.

The tweets focused on a humorous bet that resulted in Arrington shaving his head, followed by a reconciliation between the two tech big guns. His remarks also touched his position regarding XRP holdings, generating notable attention from the XRP community. In an earlier post , Arrington wrote, ‚ÄúI finally admitted defeat yesterday and shaved my head for good. Showed @bgarlinghouse and he laughed and said I look like Marc Andreessen. So anyway, we‚Äôre selling all of our XRP.‚Äù This statement was shared with a tone that appeared to reflect both self-deprecation and humor, indicating a playful dynamic between him and Garlinghouse . The mention of selling XRP in the tweet seemed to be part of the joke rather than an actual investment decision. Reconciliation and Decision to Keep XRP Shortly after the initial tweet, Arrington followed up with another post offering more clarity on the situation. In his latest update, he wrote, ‚ÄúReconciled with @bgarlinghouse, broke bread, and are moving on from his verbal attacks.

The Maxwell hard fork officially went live on June 30 at 2:30 am UTC, following weeks of preparation after its testnet launch on May 26. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just another upgrade‚Äîit‚Äôs a technical leap forward for faster blocks, better validator coordination, and smoother network performance,‚Äù the BNB Chain team stated , highlighting that the upgrade aims to boost scalability, improve validator synchronization, and enhance the user experience for decentralized applications (DApps) on the network. The upgrade has been designed to reduce latency for decentralized finance (DeFi) users, making transactions faster and enabling developers to build more responsive DApps without the friction of slower confirmation times. Key Proposals Target Messaging and Validator Sync The Maxwell hard fork integrates three proposals ‚Äî BEP-524, BEP-563, and BEP-564 ‚Äî to strengthen the chain‚Äôs core speed and reliability. BEP-563 focuses on improving peer-to-peer messaging between validators, allowing faster block proposal communication and minimizing the risk of missed votes or synchronization delays. ‚ÄúThis reduces the risk of missed votes or delayed proposals ‚Äî key for hitting that 0.75s target,‚Äù the BNB Chain team noted . BEP-564 adds two new message types to the protocol, GetBlocksByRangeMsg and RangeBlocksMsg, enabling validators to request and receive multiple blocks in a single call, which is expected to significantly improve synchronization speeds across the network. Meanwhile, BEP-524 directly reduces block times, building on the Lorentz upgrade in April that previously reduced block times from three seconds to 1.5 seconds. BNB Chain Developers and Validators Gear Up for Faster Blocks Ahead of the upgrade, the BNB Chain team urged developers to test their DApps under the new, faster block timing and adjust any time-based logic within their applications to align with the 0.8-second block intervals. ‚ÄúIf something breaks, it‚Äôs probably your code ‚Äî not the chain,‚Äù the team added, emphasizing the importance of preparation. Validators have also been advised to ensure their systems are equipped to handle faster message throughput and quicker consensus cycles. Meanwhile, the BNB token has shown strength ahead of the upgrade , rising 6.5% over the past week, trading around $655 while remaining 17% below its all-time high of $788.

Singapore just sent a clear message to crypto firms: if you‚Äôre serving overseas clients from here without a licence, your time‚Äôs up. As of June 30, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has enforced new rules that require all digital token service providers (DTSPs) ‚Äì even those working only with foreign clients ‚Äì to hold a licence or shut down. And there isn‚Äôt much room for negotiation. The central bank said it has ‚Äúset the bar high for licensing and will generally not issue a licence‚Äù for firms serving only non-Singapore clients. That‚Äôs because, according to MAS, these types of businesses come with higher money laundering risks, and the regulator can‚Äôt properly supervise them if their main activities happen outside the country. Cleaning Up After Crypto Collapses This clampdown follows a rough stretch for Singapore‚Äôs crypto scene. The country‚Äôs once-solid reputation took a hit after the collapse of Three Arrows Capital and Terraform Labs, both based in Singapore. 3AC went under in 2022 after the market crash, with its co-founder Su Zhu later arrested at Changi Airport and handed a four-month jail sentence. Terraform‚Äôs Do Kwon fled the country, only to be caught in Montenegro and extradited to the U.S. on fraud charges. The firm‚Äôs downfall wiped out about $40 billion in investor funds and triggered wider losses across the crypto market. With those disasters still fresh, MAS is clearly drawing a hard line to prevent history from repeating. Industry Reacts: Integrity First! The move has been welcomed by analysts who see it as a long-overdue fix. ‚ÄúWith the new DTSP regime, MAS is reinforcing that financial integrity is a red line,‚Äù said Chengyi Ong, head of Asia Pacific policy at Chainalysis. Law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher also pointed out the shift brings Singapore in line with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards, the global benchmark for anti-money laundering and terrorism financing rules. What It Means for Crypto Firms For crypto companies using Singapore as a base to serve clients abroad, this rule change is interesting but tough. They either need to get licensed or leave. More than a crackdown, this is Singapore trying to protect its position as a serious player in global finance. After two high-profile collapses, MAS is trying to rebuild trust.

Weighing in on BTC‚Äôs ( BTC ) performance, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards said the sideways action reflects a major rotation between long-term holders and new institutional buyers. According to Edwards, many long-term Bitcoin holders, the ‚ÄúOGs,‚Äù have been offloading their positions since the launch of spot exchange-traded funds ( ETFs) in January, dumping large portions of their holdings on Wall Street buyers. ‚ÄúPeople are wondering why Bitcoin has been stuck at $100K for so long,‚Äù Edwards wrote in a June 29 X post. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because Bitcoin OGs have been dumping on Wall Street since the ETF launch.‚Äù You might also like: Bitcoin demand hits record low as short-term holders dump Edwards noted that while ETF inflows have been strong , much of that liquidity was met with heavy selling from early holders exiting at high prices. This supply pressure, he said, has contributed to the current stagnation in price. However, the entry of a new class of buyers suggests a breakthrough may be brewing. Corporate Bitcoin bid to the rescue? While long-term holders have been exiting, Edwards pointed to a new class of buyers stepping in as corporate treasury allocators. Recent months have seen several institutions and governments around the globe turn to Bitcoin as a reserve asset, building strategic treasuries focused on long-term accumulation.¬†The shift in investors is now driving what the Capriole Investments founder describes as a ‚Äúflywheel‚Äù effect, a steady, conviction-driven buying that reinforces price support and attracts further institutional interest. You might also like: Belgravia Hartford secures $1M to grow Bitcoin treasury Supporting the trend, on-chain data shows that six-month-plus Bitcoin holders have risen sharply over the past two months. This group has been in a strong accumulation phase, absorbing more BTC than long-term holders sold over the past 18 months. The consistent pace of accumulation suggests growing conviction among newer market participants. Historically, similar spikes in long-term holding have preceded upward price moves and should the trend continue, it could mark a bullish shift for Bitcoin.

Such enormous transactions typically raise questions about market impact. They might represent over-the-counter trades with little immediate price effect or, if sent to an exchange, signal potential short-term selling pressure. This transfer also comes just one day before Ripple‚Äôs scheduled release of over 1 billion XRP for July, which could add to price volatility. These significant movements emerge as XRP and the broader Ripple ecosystem continue to draw attention, particularly in the context of the ongoing legal battle with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Ripple‚Äôs leadership, however, insists it remains committed to resolving the case. In a recent development, District Judge Analisa Torres denied a joint request from Ripple and the SEC to reduce a $125 million civil penalty and reverse an earlier finding that Ripple‚Äôs institutional XRP sales were unregistered securities offerings. While Judge Torres partly granted the SEC‚Äôs request for an injunction and penalty, she also raised concerns about Ripple‚Äôs compliance with previous court limits. Despite this, Ripple insists the ruling does not change XRP‚Äôs legal status. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.18, down about 0.5% over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset has surged by almost 8% over the past seven days. XRP seven-day price chart.

The BNB Smart Chain , a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, has just completed a monumental step in its evolution: the highly anticipated Maxwell upgrade. This isn‚Äôt just another technical update; it‚Äôs a game-changer designed to significantly enhance your experience on the network. What is the BNB Smart Chain Maxwell Upgrade? The Maxwell upgrade is a pivotal hard fork implemented by the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) network. Named after the renowned physicist James Clerk Maxwell, this upgrade is engineered to push the boundaries of blockchain efficiency and performance. At its core, the Maxwell upgrade has achieved a remarkable feat: it has successfully reduced the average block time from approximately 1.5 seconds to an astonishing 0.8 seconds. This near halving of block time is a testament to BSC‚Äôs commitment to continuous improvement and its dedication to providing a robust and responsive platform for its users and developers. For those new to blockchain, a ‚Äúhard fork‚Äù is a significant upgrade to a blockchain‚Äôs protocol that is not backward compatible. It requires all participants in the network (validators, node operators) to upgrade their software to the new version. The Maxwell upgrade was meticulously planned and executed, ensuring a smooth transition and minimal disruption to the active BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. The Crucial Role of Block Time: Why 0.8 Seconds Matters for BNB Smart Chain ? You might be wondering, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the big deal about block time?‚Äù In simple terms, block time is the average time it takes for a new block of transactions to be created and added to the blockchain. A shorter block time means faster transaction confirmations and a more responsive network. For the BNB Smart Chain , reducing this to 0.8 seconds has profound implications: Near-Instant Transactions: Imagine sending a transaction and seeing it confirmed almost immediately. This speed is crucial for decentralized applications (DApps) that require rapid interactions, such as gaming, high-frequency trading, and real-time financial services. Enhanced User Experience: No more waiting around for your transactions to clear. Whether you‚Äôre swapping tokens on a decentralized exchange (DEX), interacting with a DeFi protocol, or minting an NFT, the experience becomes significantly smoother and more fluid. This improved responsiveness is a key factor in attracting and retaining users on the BNB Smart Chain. Reduced Slippage: In fast-moving markets, even a few seconds can make a difference. Faster block times can help reduce slippage in trades on DEXs, ensuring that users get closer to their intended execution price. This dramatic reduction in block time directly translates into a more efficient and user-friendly environment, setting a new benchmark for speed in the blockchain space. Unlocking Enhanced Blockchain Scalability and Efficiency One of the perennial challenges facing any blockchain network is scalability ‚Äì the ability to handle a growing number of transactions and users without compromising performance. The Maxwell upgrade directly addresses this by significantly boosting blockchain scalability . By halving the block time, the network can process more transactions per second (TPS). While the exact TPS increase will depend on various factors, a faster block interval inherently allows for a higher throughput capacity. Consider the analogy of a highway: if cars can move through checkpoints faster, more cars can travel on the highway in the same amount of time. Similarly, with a 0.8-second block time, the BNB Smart Chain can process a greater volume of data and transactions, making it more robust and capable of supporting a larger ecosystem of DApps and users. This enhanced efficiency positions BSC strongly in the competitive landscape of Layer 1 blockchains, offering a compelling alternative for projects seeking high performance and low transaction costs. The focus on scalability isn‚Äôt just about raw speed; it‚Äôs about building a sustainable foundation for future growth. As more users enter the Web3 space and more complex applications emerge, a highly scalable infrastructure like that provided by the upgraded BNB Smart Chain will be essential. Boosting Network Performance and Validator Synchronization Beyond just transaction speed, the Maxwell upgrade has a profound impact on overall network performance and stability. The upgrade is specifically designed to improve validator synchronization, which is critical for the health and security of a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain like BNB Smart Chain. Validators are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks, and efficient synchronization among them ensures that the network operates smoothly and securely. Here‚Äôs how improved validator synchronization contributes to a better network: Reduced Orphaned Blocks: When validators are out of sync, it can lead to ‚Äúorphaned blocks‚Äù ‚Äì blocks that are created but not added to the main chain because another validator‚Äôs block was accepted first. Improved synchronization minimizes these occurrences, leading to a more consistent and stable blockchain history. Enhanced Network Consensus: A well-synchronized validator set can reach consensus on the state of the blockchain more quickly and reliably. This strengthens the network‚Äôs security and reduces the potential for forks or disruptions. Optimized Resource Utilization: Better synchronization means validators can operate more efficiently, utilizing their resources optimally and contributing to the overall cost-effectiveness of the network. The enhancements to network performance ensure that the BNB Smart Chain remains a reliable and robust platform for all its participants, from individual users to large-scale enterprises. Implications for Users and Developers: A Smoother Experience For you, the user, the Maxwell upgrade means a noticeably snappier and more enjoyable experience on the BNB Smart Chain . Whether you‚Äôre: Trading on PancakeSwap or other DEXs: Experience faster order execution and reduced latency. Engaging with DeFi protocols: Enjoy more responsive interactions with lending, borrowing, and staking platforms. Playing blockchain games: Witness real-time updates and seamless in-game transactions. Minting or trading NFTs: Quicker confirmation times for your digital collectibles. For developers, the implications are equally exciting. The enhanced performance and reliability open up new possibilities for building more sophisticated and real-time applications. Developers can now design DApps that demand higher throughput and lower latency, pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible on a decentralized network. This could lead to a new wave of innovation on the BNB Smart Chain, attracting even more talented builders to its ecosystem. The upgrade fosters an environment where innovation can thrive, encouraging the creation of next-generation decentralized applications that are faster, more efficient, and more user-friendly. The Future Ahead: What‚Äôs Next for the Maxwell Upgrade and BSC? The successful implementation of the Maxwell upgrade is a significant milestone, but it‚Äôs important to remember that blockchain development is an ongoing journey. This upgrade lays a strong foundation for future advancements on the BNB Smart Chain. While specific future plans post-Maxwell are always evolving, the general direction points towards: Continued Optimization: BSC will likely continue to explore further optimizations to enhance transaction processing and network stability. Ecosystem Growth: With improved performance, BSC aims to attract even more projects, developers, and users, further solidifying its position as a leading blockchain for DApps and DeFi. Cross-Chain Interoperability: Efforts to enhance seamless communication and asset transfer between BSC and other blockchain networks will likely continue to be a priority. The Maxwell upgrade underscores BNB Smart Chain‚Äôs commitment to maintaining its competitive edge and evolving to meet the demands of a rapidly expanding Web3 landscape. It‚Äôs a clear signal that the network is not resting on its laurels but is actively pursuing advancements to serve its community better. In conclusion, the BNB Smart Chain‚Äôs Maxwell upgrade is a monumental achievement that dramatically cuts block times, boosting blockchain scalability , improving validator synchronization, and optimizing overall network performance . This enhancement translates directly into a faster, smoother, and more efficient experience for every user and developer interacting with the network. As the crypto space continues to evolve, BSC‚Äôs proactive approach to innovation ensures it remains at the forefront, ready to power the next generation of decentralized applications. The future of decentralized finance on BNB Smart Chain looks brighter and faster than ever before.

Nobitex has begun restoring wallet access in phases, operators of the exchange said in a June 29 post on X. The process is being rolled out gradually, starting with verified users and prioritising spot wallet services. Access to other wallet types will follow as the system stabilises. According to the announcement, only users who complete identity verification will be allowed to access their wallets. Once user data is confirmed, wallet balances will be displayed in phases. In the meantime, Nobitex has alerted users that delays may occur due to additional security checks and technical conditions, urging users to be patient during the verification period. Users will be allowed to withdraw their holdings starting June 30, with other services such as trading and deposits expected to be restored gradually. However, a fixed timeline for the full return of operations was not disclosed. Nobitex also warned users against depositing assets to old wallet addresses due to a complete migration of its wallet system, noting that doing so may result in the permanent loss of funds. Nobitex hack saw $100 million drained and burned On June 18, Nobitex suffered a major breach when pro-Israel hacking group Gonjeshke Darande, also known as Predatory Sparrow, infiltrated its hot wallets and siphoned off $100 million in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Ripple, Solana, and Ton. According to the attackers, the hack was intended to disrupt the Iranian regime‚Äôs financial infrastructure. The hackers used vanity wallet addresses embedded with anti-government slogans and later announced that they had burned over $90 million worth of the stolen assets by transferring them to unrecoverable wallets. In a further escalation, the group leaked what it claimed was Nobitex‚Äôs full source code and internal infrastructure data. The eight-part leak included server configurations, privacy modules, and deployment systems, raising additional concerns about the platform‚Äôs security and the exposure of remaining user funds. Nobitex later confirmed that its cold storage reserves were untouched and subsequently pledged to fully compensate affected users using its insurance fund and internal reserves. Aftermath of the hack In response to the incident, Iranian authorities imposed operational restrictions on all domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, limiting their activity to between 10 am and 8 pm. The Central Bank of Iran implemented the curfew as a measure to reduce systemic risk and to tighten oversight in a sector it views as critical amid ongoing international sanctions. According to data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, Nobitex plays an outsized role in Iran‚Äôs crypto economy, having processed over $11 billion in inflows, more than all other Iranian exchanges combined. The exchange has also been linked to wallets associated with sanctioned entities, including IRGC-affiliated groups, Hamas-aligned media, and blacklisted Russian exchanges. Further scrutiny followed an investigation by blockchain intelligence firm Global Ledger, which uncovered patterns of suspicious fund movements predating the recent attack. These included the use of peelchains, one-use wallets, and systematic balance sweeps, techniques often associated with money laundering and transaction obfuscation. The probe also found that Nobitex‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúrescue wallet,‚Äù deployed after the breach, had been active for months prior, conducting gradual transfers of large sums. Investigators concluded that these methods indicated deliberate efforts to obscure fund flows, raising questions about the exchange‚Äôs operational transparency and potential links to illicit finance.

Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has lost 0.36 percent of its value today. Technical indicators still give bullish signals, but the price charts project a corrective market scenario for the day. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,190.17 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn‚Äôt be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found resistance and the price moved toward $653.46. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 0.36 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin‚Äôs price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,190.17 by 2031.

It is important to consider that the predictions are not investment advice. Professional consultation is suggested before investing in the volatile market. Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB‚Äôs price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB‚Äôs price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin‚Äôs price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May. Heading into June, BNB is trading approximately $666.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-30 09:45:00

The XRP price today is trading near a key resistance area, while a broader symmetrical triangle pattern suggests a high-probability breakout setup during July. XRP Price Prediction for July 2025 XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The current monthly structure for XRP price is defined by compression within a symmetrical triangle, with price nearing the apex. The key breakout level lies between $2.20 and $2.25, and a successful move above this range could initiate a fresh impulse targeting higher Fibonacci levels. Conversely, if the triangle support near $2.05 is breached, the price may revisit lower support zones around $1.94 or even $1.60 based on broader retracement levels. On the higher timeframe, XRP has been consolidating between the 0.382 and 0.618 Fibonacci zones ($2.28‚Äì$1.59), keeping price action relatively neutral. The confluence of these levels with compression from both the daily and 4-hour charts strengthens the likelihood of a breakout direction emerging in July.

The sentence was delivered by Judge William F. Kuntz II in a Brooklyn federal court. The 57 years old man had pleaded guilty in September 2024 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. According to the prosecutor, Golden and his co-conspirators, Gregory Aggesen, Marquis Demacking Egerton (also known as ‚ÄúMardy Eger‚Äù), and William White, created and operated fraudulent investment platforms. These include EmpowerCoin, ECoinPlus, and Jet-Coin, between April and August 2017. These websites promised investors fixed profits through overseas crypto trading. No Real Trading Took Place: DOJ Exposes Crypto Scam Network United States Attorney Nocella noted that the companies only lured investors with promises of guaranteed high returns from overseas cryptocurrency trading. However, prosecutors say none of the companies engaged in any real trading activity. Instead, the defendants used incoming investor funds to pay earlier investors or diverted the money for personal use, consistent with a Ponzi scheme. FBI Assistant Director Raia noted that the platforms raised more than $40 million in total. After the schemes collapsed, the defendants tried to hide their crimes by obstructing federal investigations. Between July 2017 and March 2022, Golden, Aggesen, and White attempted to hinder both a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) inquiry and a federal grand jury investigation. Authorities said they destroyed key evidence and gave false and misleading statements to investigators. Notably, William White was previously sentenced to 30 months in prison for his role. Meanwhile, Aggesen and Egerton have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing. As part of his sentence, Golden was also ordered to forfeit roughly $2.46 million in illegal gains. The court will decide on restitution to victims at a later date. Victims May Be Eligible for Restitution In a glimmer of hope, The U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office encouraged victims of EmpowerCoin.com, ECoinPlus.com, or Jet-Coin.com to submit restitution claims through the FBI. ‚ÄúThis office is committed to protecting investors and holding fraudsters accountable,‚Äù said U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella. ‚ÄúWe will continue to pursue justice for those harmed.‚Äù Earlier this month, five individuals admitted guilt in a separate case involving a $36.9 million cryptocurrency fraud scheme.

The positive sentiment on the crypto market is observed because Ethereum is trading above the key support and the trading volume increases. This momentum is an indicator of possible rally, which makes Ethereum one of the best cryptocurrencies to monitor in 2025. Alongside this, affordable altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are gaining traction, riding Ethereum‚Äôs upward wave. With increased wallet activity and DeFi innovation, the stage is set for a dynamic market shift. Investors are eyeing both Ethereum and emerging tokens for significant gains. Mutuum Finance presale accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing swiftly through Phase 5 of its 11-phase presale, currently priced at $0.03 per token. This phase is over 50% filled, meaning the window to secure tokens at this low price is narrowing fast. The project has raised $11,300,000 since the presale began, with over 575 million tokens sold to 12,600 holders. Starting at $0.01 in Phase 1, the price has tripled, reflecting strong demand. When Phase 6 opens, the price will rise 16.7% to $0.035, and at launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will list at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% return for current buyers. Moreover, analysts project a post-launch price of $2.50, offering substantial long-term potential. Innovative DeFi lending solutions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in the crypto market with its dual lending model.

Additionally, a $100,000 MUTM giveaway is generating excitement, with 10 winners each receiving $10,000 in tokens. Entry requires a $50 minimum presale investment and completing simple tasks like submitting a wallet address. Consequently, the project is fostering a vibrant community, further boosted by a leaderboard rewarding the top 50 holders with bonus tokens. Ethereum‚Äôs role in DeFi growth The comeback of the crypto market relies on the network of Ethereum, and the steadily growing activity is indicating that the confidence of the investors is rather strong. Remaining above the mark of the 2,600 dollars, the volume of the trading activity of Ethereum and the activity of wallets are growing, which creates the necessary preconditions to pass the mark of 2,900 dollars. It is kept relevant by its dominance in DeFi and Web3 applications, ranging through NFTs to smart contracts. This ecosystem helps Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which uses the infrastructure of Ethereum in its lending and stablecoin programs. Due to an increase in crypto investment, altcoins such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rely on the power of Ethereum. In addition, the rising crypto prices today highlight a returning risk appetite, positioning both as top cryptocurrencies for 2025. Future-focused DeFi vision Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building beyond lending with plans for a native stablecoin and Layer 2 scaling. The stablecoin will enhance liquidity, enabling seamless transactions and staking without price volatility. Layer 2 solutions will cut gas fees and boost transaction speeds, preparing the protocol for global adoption. The mtToken system allows users to earn interest on deposited assets like ETH or DAI, tradable within the ecosystem. Staking mtTokens ties into token buybacks, rewarding long-term holders. These features make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a standout in crypto investing, aligning with Ethereum‚Äôs breakout momentum. As Ethereum builds momentum for a breakout beyond $2,900, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a top cryptocurrency to watch. Its presale success, secure infrastructure, and innovative DeFi solutions position it for significant growth. With Ethereum driving the crypto market forward, affordable altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer compelling opportunities. Join the presale today to be part of this promising DeFi project.

If so, you‚Äôre likely aware of the constant shifts and turns in the Bitcoin price . Right now, the digital asset king, Bitcoin (BTC), finds itself in a fascinating position ‚Äì a neutral zone. This isn‚Äôt just a lull; it‚Äôs a strategic pause that, according to expert analysis, could be a precursor to significant movements. Understanding this current state and what‚Äôs driving it is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic crypto market analysis landscape. Decoding the Bitcoin Neutral Zone : What Does it Mean? When we talk about Bitcoin trading in a ‚Äòneutral zone,‚Äô it signifies a period where the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. In simpler terms, the market isn‚Äôt exhibiting extreme bullish euphoria that might suggest an imminent correction, nor is it showing deep bearish despair that would indicate a bottom. This balance is often a sign of consolidation, where the market digests previous moves and gathers strength for the next directional push. On-chain analyst @AxelAdlerJr on X recently highlighted this intriguing position. Unlike traditional technical analysis that relies solely on price charts, on-chain analysis delves into the underlying blockchain data. It examines the actual transactions, wallet movements, and network activity to provide a deeper, more fundamental understanding of market sentiment and potential future trends. For Bitcoin, being in a neutral zone based on on-chain data suggests a healthy market structure, poised for organic growth rather than speculative bubbles or crashes. The Power of On-Chain Metrics : Unpacking Realized Supply One of the most compelling pieces of evidence for Bitcoin‚Äôs promising outlook comes from a specific on-chain metric: the Bitcoin Distribution by Realized Supply. This sophisticated metric offers a unique perspective on the market‚Äôs valuation by comparing the current Bitcoin price to the total value of all coins based on the last time they were moved on the blockchain. Essentially, it tracks the ‚Äòcost basis‚Äô of the entire Bitcoin supply, giving us an aggregate view of what investors paid for their coins. Here‚Äôs why this metric is so powerful: True Cost Basis: Unlike market capitalization, which simply multiplies current price by circulating supply, Realized Supply provides a more accurate reflection of the actual capital invested in Bitcoin. Investor Behavior Insight: When the current price deviates significantly from the Realized Price, it can indicate periods of market overheating (price much higher than realized) or capitulation (price much lower than realized). Identifying Value Zones: Historically, when the market price hovers around or slightly above the Realized Price, it often represents a strong accumulation zone or a point from which significant rallies can launch. According to @AxelAdlerJr‚Äôs analysis, the ratio of the current Bitcoin price to its Realized Supply is now slightly above its annual average. This is a critical observation because it mirrors a specific historical precedent that led to substantial gains. Let‚Äôs look at a comparative example: Metric/Period November 2024 (Pre-Surge) Current (As per analysis) Bitcoin Price to Realized Supply Ratio Slightly above annual average Slightly above annual average BTC Price Point (Approx.) $74,000 Current neutral zone price Subsequent Price Action Surged to $107,000 Potential for significant upside The striking similarity to November 2024, a period immediately preceding Bitcoin‚Äôs surge from $74,000 to an impressive $107,000, cannot be overstated. This historical correlation provides a compelling argument for further BTC upside potential . It suggests that the market isn‚Äôt overextended and that there‚Äôs still considerable room for growth before reaching levels typically associated with extreme overvaluation. Exploring the Factors Driving BTC Upside Potential While on-chain metrics provide a fundamental backbone for bullish sentiment, several other factors contribute to the overall narrative of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential for further upside. A holistic crypto market analysis must consider these broader influences: Institutional Adoption: The increasing interest and investment from large financial institutions continue to be a major catalyst. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, for example, have opened doors for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset, bringing in significant capital inflows. Halving Event Impact: While the most recent Bitcoin halving has already occurred, its effects are typically not immediate. The supply shock, where the rate of new Bitcoin creation is cut in half, historically leads to price appreciation in the months following the event as demand gradually outstrips the reduced supply. Macroeconomic Environment: Global economic conditions, including inflation rates, interest rate policies by central banks, and geopolitical stability, all play a role. Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation or a safe haven asset, attracting investors during times of economic uncertainty. Technological Advancements: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements in scalability (e.g., Lightning Network) and new use cases, enhances its utility and appeal, potentially attracting more users and capital. Retail Investor Interest: A resurgence of interest from individual investors, often fueled by positive price action and mainstream media coverage, can create a powerful feedback loop, driving demand and contributing to upward price momentum. These interwoven factors, combined with the underlying strength signaled by on-chain data, paint a promising picture for Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. The current neutral zone could very well be the calm before a significant storm of positive price action. Actionable Insights and Navigating Challenges in the Current Market Given this optimistic outlook based on the Bitcoin price and its on-chain signals, what does this mean for investors and enthusiasts? While the signals are strong, it‚Äôs important to approach the market with a balanced perspective, considering both opportunities and potential pitfalls. Opportunities: Strategic Accumulation: The neutral zone might present an opportune moment for dollar-cost averaging (DCA) or strategic accumulation for long-term holders, especially if you believe in the long-term growth of Bitcoin. Diversification: While Bitcoin often leads the market, a strong BTC performance can also uplift altcoins. However, always conduct thorough research before diversifying into other digital assets. Staying Informed: Continuously monitor on-chain metrics, market news, and expert analysis. The crypto market is dynamic, and staying updated is key to making informed decisions. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility Remains: Despite the positive signals, Bitcoin is known for its volatility. Sharp price swings can occur, and investors should be prepared for potential drawdowns. External Shocks: Unforeseen macroeconomic events, regulatory crackdowns, or major security breaches could impact the market negatively, regardless of on-chain strength. Not Financial Advice: The analysis presented here is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Always conduct your own due diligence and consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions. The confluence of a healthy neutral zone and robust on-chain indicators like the Realized Supply metric suggests that Bitcoin is not merely treading water but potentially gearing up for its next significant ascent. The historical parallels provide a powerful testament to the predictive power of these deep-dive analyses, offering a compelling narrative for further BTC upside potential . While the journey in crypto is always fraught with its share of twists and turns, the current signals from the blockchain paint a remarkably positive picture for the king of cryptocurrencies.

This strategic decision underscores a deepening institutional commitment to the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency, signaling a robust belief in its long-term value proposition. What‚Äôs Driving This Latest Bitcoin Acquisition by The Blockchain Group? On a recent announcement via X, The Blockchain Group confirmed its purchase of an additional 60 BTC. This latest acquisition, valued at approximately ‚Ç¨5.5 million (nearly $6.44 million at the time of purchase), significantly bolsters their existing crypto portfolio. With this new addition, the firm‚Äôs total Bitcoin holdings now stand at an impressive 1,788 BTC. This isn‚Äôt just a random purchase; it‚Äôs a calculated step within their broader digital asset strategy . Consistent Strategy: The Blockchain Group has demonstrated a clear, consistent strategy of accumulating Bitcoin, indicating a long-term bullish outlook. Portfolio Diversification: For many companies, Bitcoin serves as a hedge against inflation and a way to diversify traditional asset portfolios. Belief in Blockchain Technology: As a blockchain company, their investment in Bitcoin aligns perfectly with their core business and belief in decentralized technologies. The Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: A Global Phenomenon The Blockchain Group‚Äôs latest move is not an isolated incident but rather a clear reflection of a burgeoning global trend: the increasing embrace of Bitcoin by institutions. From publicly traded companies to hedge funds and even sovereign wealth funds, more and more traditional financial players are allocating capital to Bitcoin. This shift is driven by several compelling factors: Historically, Bitcoin was viewed with skepticism by mainstream finance. However, over the past few years, its narrative has evolved from a speculative digital currency to a legitimate store of value, often dubbed ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô. This transformation has made it an attractive asset for corporate treasuries looking to protect their capital against inflationary pressures and economic uncertainties. Why Are Institutions Eyeing Bitcoin? The motivations behind institutional Bitcoin investments are multi-faceted: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin‚Äôs capped supply (21 million coins) makes it an appealing asset to preserve purchasing power. Digital Gold Narrative: Bitcoin shares characteristics with traditional safe-haven assets like gold, offering a decentralized, immutable, and globally accessible alternative. Future of Finance: Institutions recognize the transformative potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in shaping the future of financial systems. Investing in Bitcoin is seen as a way to gain exposure to this nascent, yet rapidly evolving, sector. Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin‚Äôs low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds offers diversification benefits, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns. Demand-Supply Dynamics: With a fixed supply and growing demand from both retail and institutional investors, the long-term price appreciation potential of Bitcoin remains a significant draw. Understanding The Blockchain Group ‚Äòs Strategic Vision The Blockchain Group , headquartered in France, has been a proactive player in the blockchain space, focusing on various aspects of distributed ledger technology. Their consistent accumulation of Bitcoin highlights a deep-seated conviction in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs role not just as a speculative asset, but as a fundamental component of future finance. Their current holding of 1,788 BTC places them among a growing list of companies with significant Bitcoin reserves, signaling a robust and forward-thinking crypto investment philosophy. This strategy is not without its considerations. While the potential for significant returns exists, so does the inherent volatility of the crypto market. However, by gradually accumulating over time, companies like The Blockchain Group are employing a dollar-cost averaging approach, mitigating some of the short-term price fluctuations and focusing on the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin. Key Aspects of Their Digital Asset Strategy : The Blockchain Group ‚Äòs approach to digital assets appears to be characterized by: Long-Term Horizon: Their continued accumulation suggests a focus on Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value rather than short-term trading gains. Strategic Accumulation: Rather than a single large purchase, their repeated buys indicate a planned, incremental accumulation strategy. Alignment with Core Business: As a blockchain company, their investment in Bitcoin reinforces their commitment to the underlying technology and its applications. Confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs Future: Holding a substantial amount of BTC signals strong confidence in its continued growth and adoption as a global reserve asset. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Investment Landscape? Every new institutional entry or increased holding, like that of The Blockchain Group , adds another layer of legitimacy and stability to the cryptocurrency market. It moves Bitcoin further away from being perceived solely as a niche, retail-driven asset and firmly establishes it as a viable and attractive option for sophisticated investors and corporate treasuries. The cumulative effect of such institutional purchases is significant. While a 60 BTC purchase might seem small compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs multi-trillion-dollar market cap, it contributes to the overall demand pressure on a finite supply. As more institutions adopt a similar digital asset strategy , the available supply of Bitcoin on exchanges diminishes, potentially leading to increased price appreciation over time. Actionable Insights for Individual Investors: For individual investors watching these institutional moves, several lessons can be drawn: Conviction is Key: Institutions are investing with a long-term vision. This highlights the importance of conviction in your investment thesis, rather than being swayed by short-term market noise. Dollar-Cost Averaging: The consistent accumulation by companies like The Blockchain Group demonstrates the effectiveness of dollar-cost averaging (investing a fixed amount regularly) to mitigate volatility. Research and Due Diligence: Understand why institutions are buying. This means delving into Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamentals, its scarcity, network effects, and its role in the evolving global financial system. Diversification: While Bitcoin can be a significant part of a portfolio, remember the importance of a diversified investment strategy. The Future of Digital Asset Strategy and Institutional Adoption The trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption shows no signs of slowing down. With increasing regulatory clarity in various jurisdictions, the launch of more accessible investment vehicles like spot Bitcoin ETFs, and a growing understanding of Bitcoin‚Äôs unique properties, we can expect more companies to integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets and overall digital asset strategy . Companies like The Blockchain Group are at the forefront of this shift, demonstrating foresight and a willingness to embrace innovation. This evolving landscape suggests a future where digital assets are not just an alternative investment but a mainstream component of diversified corporate and institutional portfolios. The journey of Bitcoin from a niche digital curiosity to a globally recognized strategic asset is being cemented by these consistent, confident moves by major players in the blockchain and finance sectors. Conclusion: A Confident Step Towards a Digital Future The Blockchain Group‚Äôs latest Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a transaction; it‚Äôs a powerful statement. It reflects a growing institutional belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs enduring value and its critical role in the future of finance. As a leading French blockchain company, their commitment to accumulating Bitcoin sets a precedent and provides further validation for the broader crypto investment community. This ongoing trend of companies building substantial Bitcoin reserves solidifies the cryptocurrency‚Äôs position as a vital strategic asset in an ever-evolving global economy. The consistent and deliberate moves by entities like The Blockchain Group paint a clear picture: Bitcoin is here to stay, and institutions are increasingly confident in its long-term potential.

Founder Says It Needs A Central Voice First,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/can-cardano-lead-in-bitcoin-defi-founder-says-it-needs-a-central-voice-first/,"Cardano is making moves to become a hub for Bitcoin DeFi. According to Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, the network has rolled out a string of upgrades, yet it still needs a strong message to win over users and investors. He argues that without a clear voice steering the story, those technical gains risk getting lost in the noise.

Based on reports, Minswap‚Äîthe largest decentralized exchange on Cardano‚Äîis preparing to support Bitcoin, with plans to tap into a $2‚ÄØtrillion liquidity pool.

We got Leios, Hydra, Midnight, and Bitcoin DeFi alongside governance, security and decentralization. Bitcoin DeFi is indeed the largest opportunity, but the single biggest issue is that we are missing a competent Foundation and executive authority to push these narratives into‚Ä¶ https://t.co/t3j4ULTTe8 ‚Äî Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 29, 2025 Hoskinson Points To Executive Gap Despite those wins, Hoskinson says Cardano is missing a ‚Äúcompetent Foundation and executive authority‚Äù to shape market views. He‚Äôs taken to X to share his concerns, but some in the community have pushed back hard. A few podcasters and thought leaders have labeled Cardano a ‚Äúdying chain.‚Äù Hoskinson admits that stepping into the narrative has drawn plenty of criticism‚Äîyet he feels it‚Äôs needed if Cardano is to claim its place in Bitcoin‚Äëbased finance. Input Output Global‚Äôs Role Input Output Global (IOG), Hoskinson‚Äôs company, will keep guiding Cardano as its core coordinator. He warns this work comes at a cost: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been brutal and expensive this year,‚Äù he said, referring to waves of negative comments and legal threats. He adds that it‚Äôs ‚Äúdehumanizing‚Äù to be blamed for every hiccup on the network while not getting credit for the wins. Related Reading: Crypto Bombshell: Developer Claims XRP Could Hit $20,000 Rare Evo Conference In Focus Looking ahead, Hoskinson is counting on Rare Evo, a crypto conference, to reset the conversation. He believes the community will use that event to settle governance questions and update Cardano‚Äôs constitution with delegated executive powers. There‚Äôs even talk of a sovereign wealth fund to back Bitcoin DeFi on the chain. Built on top of Bitcoin, Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) is a network of decentralized financial applications. Last year, Hoskinson pushed a plan to convert $100‚ÄØmillion worth of ADA into stablecoin liquidity. That idea sparked fierce debate. Now, he hopes Rare Evo will help turn bold ideas into solid support. Cardano‚Äôs path forward may hinge on blending strong tech work with a clear, unified story. As Bitcoin DeFi edges closer, the project that can tell the best story might win the most attention‚Äîand the most funds.

Whales are escaping PEPE and looking for new growth opportunities elsewhere. In the past week alone, the meme coin has dipped by over 11%. Amid a lack of growth for PEPE in the medium term, investors are looking into promising presale projects that are built for growth. One of the most promising projects that has captured the attention of the masses is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Unlike PEPE, Mutuum Finance is built on the firm foundation of utility. The design ensures that long after the tokens launch, it will continue to produce upward gains for MUTM tokens. Let us take a deep dive into the project to find out why analysts are confident of 25x gains for the tokens when they go live. The MUTM Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of the presale, where tokens are going for $0.03, which is a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. These increases are expected to continue until the final listing price of $0.06. Thus, the current price is a 50% discount on the final listing price, which presents an opportunity for you to make massive returns. So far, over $11.34 million worth of tokens have been sold in the ongoing presale to around 12,500 unique buyers. The presale has been a massive success, with 50% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 sold, less than a month after they launched. A major driver of the current pace of the presale is the planned beta version launch on day one of the token listing. The beta platform launch is expected to generate a massive amount of organic conversation on social media, raising demand for MUTM tokens. With a community of over 20k across all its social media platforms, it could help to make MUTM tokens one of the biggest gainers of 2025. Another reason for excitement around the MUTM token presale is that the project is CertiK-audited. The results of the audit have helped to boost interest in the presale, due to the implied security of the project. With a Token Scan Score of 95, the audit remains an important source of trust for presale participants. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Partners With CertiK A recent development that has been causing excitement in crypto circles is the recent announcement by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that they are partnering with CertiK. The partnership will be on a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program where security experts will receive part of the reward for creating accurate bug reports. The program will be split into four tiers, which are critical, major, minor, and low. They will use the bug bounty program to create lasting relationships with the global security community. That will ensure there are always eyes monitoring all aspects of the project, providing users with a safe and stable environment where they can earn passive income. Details Of The Protocol Design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. The lenders deposit their assets into the protocol‚Äôs liquidity pools for a chance to earn interest. Borrowers on the protocol deposit overcollateralized collateral into the protocol‚Äôs pool to access the liquidity. Interest rates for both lenders and borrowers are based on the pool‚Äôs utilization rate. As more borrowers take loans from the protocols, the interest rate rises. The rising interest rate pushes borrowers to repay their loans, while attracting new lenders to benefit from the rising APY. Consequently, the protocol design ensures that the ecosystem achieves optimal capital utilization. When the value of collateral used to back a loan falls below the safe levels of collateralization, a liquidation event is triggered. In that situation, liquidators step in and purchase the debt at a discount. The discount that liquidators receive is based on various factors, chief among them being the speed at which they purchase debt. To boost their speed, the protocol can increase the discount. Mutuum Finance also plans to use protocol profits to boost the price of MUTM tokens. They will purchase tokens on the open market and distribute them to stakers in the safety module. That will ensure upward price pressure, which will attract more users to the protocol. As users increase, it will increase protocol profits, leading to a positive cycle of gains. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built on the solid foundation of utility. That will ensure the native MUTM tokens will continue to grow steadily, while offering users of the protocol a source of passive income. Consequently, participating in the MUTM token presale could be one of your best investment decisions in the crypto sector this year.

The deal slashes export tariffs for Britain‚Äôs automotive and aerospace sectors, significantly benefiting UK manufacturers. Under the agreement, American levies on British car exports have been slashed from an off-putting 27.5% to a much-improved 10% quota rate, meaning multi-million pound annual savings for manufacturers. The aerospace sector also benefits, with 10% tariffs on key goods like aircraft engines and parts, helping companies like Rolls-Royce remain competitive globally. UK secures exclusive US tariff deal, safeguarding jobs and reviving export growth Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the deal as a ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù win, stating, ‚ÄúOur world-class automotive and aerospace industries will see tariffs slashed, safeguarding key industries that are vital to our economy. We will always act in the national interest ‚Äî backing British businesses and workers, delivering on our Plan for Change.‚Äù The UK is currently the only country to have secured such an arrangement with the US, with the deal seen as a major diplomatic and economic success . Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government prioritized protecting jobs and stimulating growth. He noted that British car manufacturers can now export to the US at a significantly reduced 10% tariff rate, and aerospace goods will see tariffs removed altogether, saving sectors hundreds of millions each year and safeguarding thousands of jobs. Industry leaders have welcomed the move. Kevin Craven, CEO of ADS, called the tariff removal a ‚Äúwelcome‚Äù development, emphasizing the aerospace sector‚Äôs contribution of over 100,000 highly skilled jobs across the UK. Mike Hawes, Chief Executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said the agreement is ‚Äúa huge relief for UK automotive companies‚Äù and ‚Äúa diplomatic coup,‚Äù crediting the simplified quota system for helping to revive stalled exports. UK pushes for zero tariffs on steel In addition to benefits for the auto and aerospace sectors, the UK remains exempt from the US‚Äôs 50% global tariffs on steel and aluminum . Unless a deal is reached, the sector could face elevated tariffs starting July 9 . Still, according to a British statement, the current developments further pave the way for future progress toward zero tariffs on core steel products. Today‚Äôs announcement is part of a broader UK trade strategy focused on agile, sector-specific deals that deliver immediate economic returns. The government also cited recent agreements with India and the EU, which are projected to add billions to the UK economy in the coming years. Parliament will be updated on implementing quotas on US beef and ethanol imports in the coming days, which are part of the UK‚Äôs reciprocal commitments under the deal.

It‚Äôs about finding the ones still flying under the radar, still priced in fractions of a cent, and still building like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. Among the hottest picks? LILPEPE, a Shiba Inu rival that‚Äôs shaking up the meme economy with actual utility. Alongside LILPEPE, tokens like DOGWIFHAT, OFFICIAL TRUMP, and Pudgy Penguins are gaining serious traction. These aren‚Äôt just memes anymore‚Äîthey‚Äôre movement-backed, whale-fed tokens ready to dominate the next bull run. LILPEPE: The Meme With Muscles, Built on Its Own Layer-2 Chain LILPEPE is not your average meme coin. It‚Äôs what happens when internet culture meets blockchain engineering. This frog-themed token is creating its own Layer-2 EVM chain‚Äîcalled Little Pepe Chain‚Äîthat‚Äôs optimized for low gas, lightning-fast transactions, and bot-resistant trading. Now in Stage 3 of its presale, LILPEPE is selling at $0.0012. And here‚Äôs the kicker: the listing price is locked at $0.003, which guarantees a 150% profit for anyone who gets in now. Over $2,020,859 has already been raised, with 1,829,882,230 tokens sold out of the 2.25 billion allocation. That means the presale is 81.33% filled, and the clock is ticking fast. Once the current round sells out, the price jumps to $0.0013, and that‚Äôs before it hits exchanges. Post-launch? Projections are as high as $1 by the end of 2025‚Äîa jaw-dropping 833x gain from the current price. Investors who jumped in at $0.0010 during Stage 2 (which lasted just two days) are already up 20%, and whales are circling. According to this report, deep-pocket investors are quietly buying massive chunks of LILPEPE, creating early-stage FOMO that‚Äôs driving the project‚Äôs momentum. And to supercharge the community, LILPEPE is giving away $770,000 in tokens to ten lucky winners‚Äî$77,000 each‚Äîthrough a viral promotion. You can enter the giveaway here with a minimum $100 buy-in and a few social tasks. Want in before the rocket takes off? Join the LILPEPE presale before Stage 3 closes. OFFICIAL TRUMP: A Political Meme Storm on Solana Next on the meme radar is OFFICIAL TRUMP‚Äîa token that‚Äôs tied directly to Donald Trump himself. Whether you love him or not, his name alone moves markets. This Solana-based meme coin briefly reached multi-billion-dollar valuations before pulling back, and it‚Äôs currently consolidating around $11. What makes this coin powerful? Brand recognition, pure and simple. It boasts an army of supporters, constant media coverage, and extensive exposure through Trump‚Äôs platforms. Technical patterns suggest a breakout is forming, and if the 2024 U.S. election narrative heats up, this token could double or triple in value by the end of 2025. DOGWIFHAT (WIF): Solana‚Äôs Next Doge With Attitude DOGWIFHAT, or WIF for short, is Solana‚Äôs native meme coin with a cheeky attitude‚Äîand a bucketload of momentum. Riding the coattails of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, WIF adds its twist, and the community has responded in kind. WIF recently surged over 20% in a single day, with trading volumes spiking across both centralized and decentralized exchanges. With Solana‚Äôs ecosystem booming, WIF benefits from spillover growth, and the upside is far from priced in. Still trading under $0.01, WIF is a no-brainer for meme lovers looking to ride the next wave, especially those priced out of DOGE and SHIB. Pudgy Penguins: From NFT Icons to Meme Tokens With Utility Once known for their NFT status, Pudgy Penguins have evolved into a broader player in the meme economy. Priced at just $0.0097, Pudgy‚Äôs token aims to blend the best of NFTs, Web3 merchandise, and token utility. Despite being down 67% from January, Pudgy Penguins are far from finished. Their branding power, viral presence, and growing partnerships (including Ledger and toy merchandising) make this token one to watch as meme coin culture expands beyond digital wallets into mainstream media and retail. If NFT-meme hybrids gain steam in 2025, Pudgy Penguins could deliver surprising returns‚Äîand at its current price, the upside is massive. Final Word: Why These Meme Coins Could Outrun Everything Solana is strong. Ethereum is safe. But if you‚Äôre looking for absolute ROI multipliers, these under-$0.01 meme coins could leave even top-tier altcoins behind. LILPEPE is your moonshot‚Äîarmed with a Layer-2 chain, hyperactive presale, deep-pocket interest, and a predicted 833x upside. Join the LILPEPE presale. Enter the $770K LILPEPE giveaway . Because in this next wave, the memes won‚Äôt just entertain‚Äîthey‚Äôll create millionaires.

With XRP‚Äôs price action already in the spotlight, a fresh $703 million transfer by Ripple-partner SBI VC Trade has raised eyebrows and triggered speculation. Massive XRP Transfer Sparks Curiosity According to Whale Alert , a whopping 320 million XRP, valued at over $703 million, was moved on June 30 between unidentified wallets. Upon closer inspection, the sender wallet (rNR‚Ä¶6jS) was linked to SBI VC Trade, a long-time Ripple ally. The tokens were split into two equal transactions of 160 million XRP, now sitting untouched in new addresses. Notably, this move happened just before Ripple‚Äôs scheduled release of 1 billion XRP from escrow, fueling theories that SBI VC Trade may be preparing for something big. ETF Talk and Japanese Crypto Reform Fuel Speculation The sudden token movement coincided with Japan‚Äôs growing regulatory shift. The Financial Services Agency recently proposed reclassifying cryptocurrencies as legal financial instruments. This opens the door for crypto ETFs and includes a major tax reform, slashing the current crypto tax rate from up to 55% to a flat 20%. With SBI‚Äôs deep ties to Ripple and Japan‚Äôs regulatory progress, some speculate the transfer could be linked to institutional positioning ahead of potential ETF approval or other major developments. XRP Market Snapshot Despite early gains, XRP price fell below $2.20, with a 24-hour range of $2.18 to $2.22. Trading volume is up 15%, suggesting increased trader activity around the token. However, XRP still struggles to break above key moving averages, the 50, 100, and 200 SMA lines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dipped to 50.68, signaling neutral momentum. However, XRP historically rallies above a key Exponential Moving Average (EMA), then pulls back for a retest before exploding in a final ‚Äúblowoff‚Äù phase. According to EGRAG CRYPTO , in past cycles, XRP surged 2,000% and 455% from these retest levels. If history repeats, the conservative 455% rise would put XRP around $9.5, while a repeat of the 2,000% rally would launch it to $37.5. EGRAG believes April 2025 marked the recent retest, setting the stage for the next major move.

Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is often viewed as ‚Äòdigital gold,‚Äô offering a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Balance Sheet Optimization: Holding a portion of treasury assets in Bitcoin can provide diversification away from cash and traditional fixed-income instruments, potentially offering higher growth opportunities. Long-Term Value Proposition: Many institutional investors and corporations believe in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term potential as a store of value and a foundational technology for the future of finance. Vaultz Capital‚Äôs initial foray into Bitcoin, followed by this substantial additional purchase, underscores a deliberate strategy to embrace digital assets as a core component of its financial planning. This isn‚Äôt merely a speculative play but rather a calculated decision by a publicly traded entity to adapt to the evolving global financial landscape. The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: A Growing Trend? Corporate Bitcoin adoption is no longer a niche phenomenon; it‚Äôs rapidly becoming a recognized strategy for companies worldwide. Vaultz Capital‚Äôs latest Bitcoin acquisition adds to a growing list of public and private entities that have allocated a portion of their treasuries to the cryptocurrency. This trend was notably pioneered by companies like MicroStrategy, which has amassed a significant Bitcoin treasury, demonstrating confidence in its long-term value. While the scale of Vaultz Capital‚Äôs holdings might be smaller compared to some of the industry giants, its significance lies in the fact that a publicly traded British company is making such a move. This contributes to the mainstream acceptance and legitimization of Bitcoin as a viable corporate asset. The ripple effect of such decisions can encourage other companies, particularly within Europe, to consider similar strategies, further accelerating the integration of digital assets into traditional finance. Is Institutional Bitcoin Adoption the Future of Finance? The increasing involvement of entities like Vaultz Capital signals a powerful shift towards institutional Bitcoin adoption. This trend is pivotal for the maturation of the cryptocurrency market, moving it beyond retail speculation towards a more stable, institutionally-backed ecosystem. When major corporations engage in BTC investment , it brings with it several implications: Increased Legitimacy: Corporate holdings lend credibility to Bitcoin, reassuring other traditional investors and regulators about its long-term viability. Market Stability: Large-scale institutional investments can contribute to greater market depth and potentially reduce volatility over time, as these entities tend to have longer investment horizons. Infrastructure Development: The demand from institutions often spurs the development of more robust and regulated infrastructure, including custodial solutions, trading platforms, and financial products tailored for corporate needs. The movement of significant capital from traditional corporate treasuries into Bitcoin is a strong indicator that digital assets are carving out a permanent place in the global financial architecture. It suggests a future where Bitcoin is not just an alternative investment but a fundamental component of diversified portfolios, both personal and corporate. Navigating the Waters of BTC Investment: Risks and Rewards While the rewards of BTC investment can be substantial, it‚Äôs crucial for companies like Vaultz Capital to also acknowledge and mitigate the inherent risks associated with Bitcoin . The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, which can lead to significant fluctuations in asset values. Regulatory uncertainty also remains a factor, with different jurisdictions adopting varying stances on digital assets. However, the potential long-term rewards, including capital appreciation and protection against inflation, often outweigh these risks for companies with a strategic outlook. For Vaultz Capital, this acquisition is likely part of a carefully considered risk-reward analysis, aiming to capitalize on Bitcoin‚Äôs growth trajectory while managing exposure. Companies embarking on similar paths must: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Understand the technology, market dynamics, and regulatory landscape. Develop a Clear Investment Policy: Define objectives, risk tolerance, and allocation limits for digital assets. Ensure Secure Custody: Implement robust security measures for storing digital assets, often utilizing third-party institutional-grade custodians. Vaultz Capital‚Äôs decision reflects a growing confidence among publicly traded companies in the potential for Bitcoin to serve as a valuable treasury asset, despite its unique market characteristics. Vaultz Capital‚Äôs latest acquisition of 40 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 50 BTC, is more than just a company news item; it‚Äôs a testament to the accelerating pace of corporate adoption within the cryptocurrency space. This move by a publicly traded British firm underscores the increasing recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate and strategic asset for balance sheet management and long-term value creation. As more companies follow suit, the landscape of traditional finance continues to converge with the innovative world of digital assets, shaping a new era of investment and treasury management.

Several key US economic reports are due in the coming days, and each could play a part in shaping where the crypto market heads next. Let‚Äôs break it down! July 1: US Job Openings (JOLTS) On July 1, investors will watch the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for clues about how strong the US job market really is. After falling to a low in March, job openings are now forecast to bounce back to around 7.5 million, up from 7.39 million in May. Many experts believe new tariffs introduced by President Trump have slowed down hiring in some sectors. If job openings keep dropping instead of rising, it might push the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates ‚Äî a move that could lift the Bitcoin price. July 2: ADP Employment Next up is the ADP Employment Report, due July 2. In May, private companies only added 37,000 jobs , far less than earlier this year. For June, economists expect that number to improve to about 105,000. A weaker-than-expected number could hint that businesses are still cautious, which could again push the Fed closer to rate cuts. July 3: Initial Jobless Claims The Initial Jobless Claims Report, coming out on July 3, will also be watched closely. Last week‚Äôs claims came in lower than expected, but this week they could rise slightly to 239,000. Higher jobless numbers often show a softer economy ‚Äî another factor that could weaken the dollar and boost crypto. July 3: Non-Farm Payrolls & Unemployment Rate Finally, July 3 also brings the Non-Farm Payrolls report and the latest unemployment rate. May month report showed 139,000 new jobs and a 4.2% unemployment rate. For June, economists expect fewer new jobs and a slight uptick in unemployment to 4.3%. If job growth keeps slowing down, many investors believe Bitcoin could benefit as people look for safe ways to protect their money from a weaker dollar. As July kicks off, crypto traders know that every data point matters.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|ALTCOIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-30 10:11:09

The primary cryptocurrency also attempted to break above this level during the weekend but failed to do so. Meanwhile, certain altcoins are charting notable gains, while the majority of the market is trading in the green. Bitcoin Price Testing $108K Bitcoin is seemingly attempting to break above the $108,000 level ‚Äì something that it‚Äôs been trying to do for quite a while now. Unfortunately, at least up until this moment, the cryptocurrency has been unsuccessful in doing so. Today, however, it almost reached $109,000 before the sellers took the stage. The most recent attempt comes amid news that the Japanese comapny MetaPlanet has made yet another Bitcoin buy worth some $108,000 and amid growing expectations that Michael‚Äôs Saylor‚Äôs Strategy will announce its own strategic purchase. At the time of this writing, BTC‚Äôs price retraced to around $107,700 and it‚Äôs interesting to see if it will finally be able to break above this relatively narrow range that it‚Äôs been trading within for the past week. Source: TradingView Altcoins Mixed, ARB Rallies Today‚Äôs heatmap is rather mixed with the majority of altcoins trading mostly flat. However, there‚Äôs an obvious exceeption to it all in the face of Arbitrum‚Äôs ARB token, that‚Äôs up 15% on the day. In fact, it soared by around 20% but has since retraced a little bit. As CryptoPotato reported , the primary reason behind Arbitrum‚Äôs surge today is that there are some rumors that the popular retail-oriented trading app Robinhood might use the network to build its own protocol. Hours ago, the fintech comapny revealed that it will be conducting a fireside chat with Ethereum‚Äôs founder Vitalik Buterin and the CSO of Arbitrum‚Äôs Onchain Labs ‚Äì A.J. Warner. Other than ARB, the majority of other altcoins are trading relatively flat with PENGU, OP, and HYPE up by 3.5% in the past 24 hours ‚Äì slightly ahead of the curve. KAIA, Pi Network (PI), and Mantle (MNT), on the other hand, are the worst performers, down 6.1%, 5.4%, and 5.7%, respectively.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/japan-based-technology-company-metaplanet-continues-bitcoin-purchases-will-it-achieve-its-target-here-are-the-details/,"Japan-based technology and investment firm Metaplanet has purchased an additional 1,005 Bitcoins worth approximately $108 million, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 13,350 BTC. Metaplanet Buys 1,005 More Bitcoins to Reach 13,350 BTC, Surpassing Galaxy Digital and CleanSpark With this move, the company became the world‚Äôs fifth-largest public Bitcoin holder, ahead of giants such as Galaxy Digital (12,830 BTC) and CleanSpark (12,502 BTC) in the institutional BTC investment rankings. The company's CEO Simon Gerovich said on Monday that the new Bitcoin purchase was made at an average price of $107,601, and the total portfolio is worth about $1.4 billion at current market value. ‚ÄúJust three months ago we announced that we had reached 3,350 BTC, now we are at 13,350 BTC with another 10,000 BTC added to that,‚Äù Gerovich said. 210,000 BTC Target Earlier this month, Metaplanet announced its goal of holding 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. The company‚Äôs aggressive strategy shows that institutional investors‚Äô interest in Bitcoin continues unabated. On the same day, Metaplanet announced that it had issued new non-interest-bearing bonds worth 30 billion yen (about $208 million). The bonds will mature on December 29, 2025. Some of the funds will be used to repurchase and cancel previously issued interest-bearing and secured bonds, while the rest will be used to purchase Bitcoin. Metaplanet shares were up 9.9% on Japanese markets Monday morning. The company's shares have gained 53.5% in the past month and 370.7% since the beginning of the year. In terms of institutional BTC holdings, MicroStrategy is still at the top of the list. The company continues to lead by holding a total of 592,345 BTC, including 245 BTC it purchased last week. Metaplanet's latest investment opens the door to a new era in institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and clearly demonstrates the company's long-term vision in this area. *This is not investment advice.

After spending weeks moving sideways and testing the patience of its holders, the popular meme coin is starting to show some bullish signs on the charts. Today, Shiba Inu‚Äôs price is slightly in the green, holding steady while the overall crypto market treads water. It‚Äôs not a huge jump yet, but the interesting part isn‚Äôt just the price and it‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening beneath the surface. On the hourly chart, SHIB just flashed a golden cross, a technical pattern where a short-term moving average crosses above a longer-term one. In this case, the 50-period moving average has climbed above the 200-period, which experts often take as an early sign of a possible rally ahead. Over the past couple of days, SHIB‚Äôs trading volume has picked up, showing that more people are jumping in or placing bets on where the price might head next. Meme coins like Shiba Inu often feed off excitement, and increased volume can be the spark that kicks off a larger move. A researcher also said that Shiba Inu is starting to show signs of recovery. Whales recently bought 10.4 trillion SHIB tokens worth about $110 million. This comes after Shiba Inu dropped to its lowest price in 16 months. #Shiba Inu currently shows recovery signs as whales buy 10.4T SHIB tokens worth $110M. Coming after a 16-month low.

Compared to the past few days of recovery from their recent lows, major meme coins have cooled off on buying today and are now trading with minor gains over the past few hours. This came as a result of recent Bitcoin‚Äôs price rejection under $109k. Some low-cap altcoins are following suit at the time of writing. Reactions to the slight drop have positioned most meme coins into an indecisive state, although some, especially assets on the Dex , are defying the odds as they continue to show strength, posting massive gains daily. What Triggered The Drop? As the market follows trends and patterns, prices are expected to react to key levels as they form structure across timeframes. Bitcoin seems to have tested a key resistance level on the daily scale and is now respecting it. Looking at Bitcoin‚Äôs corrective pattern since it printed a new all-time high (ATH) in May, it appears to have reached another crucial sell point after a week bounce. Creating a new high in the intraday trading, it may lose grip again. If this comes into play, meme coins may suffer another big loss. Can Meme Coins Sustain Recovery Amid Potential Market Drop? Of course, yes. But such a recovery may be limited to token trading on the centralised exchange due to low risk. Decentralised exchange assets, especially the new gems, are much more likely to see bigger gains even though market drops. Although there are some risks involved. Please do your research! Despite that, Doge and a few major meme coins are still up weekly. While Solana markets recorded the most gain so far, others follow suit. Aside from Pengu, which has been trending lately with major gains over the past week, WIF and Pepe are currently on the top-gainers sport with an average increase of 5% in the last 24 hours.

Crypto analyst Micha√´l van de Poppe sees early signs of life in the altcoin market. While a full-blown altseason isn‚Äôt here yet, he expects steady 10%+ weekly gains across altcoins, which could gradually shift the market sentiment. Here are the altcoins that could be discounted buys: XRP XRP, despite its long fight with the SEC, is finally on the finish line. XRP‚Äôs recent price boost was driven by two key catalysts: Robinhood‚Äôs launch of XRP micro futures and Ripple withdrawing its cross-appeal in the SEC case. On-chain activity is also picking up, and an XRP ETF could push the token toward new all-time highs. According to analyst Egrag Crypto , XRP could be gearing up for a big move. He has set two possible targets: $9.5 or $37.5, based on historical patterns where XRP surged 455% to 2000%. Solana Solana continues to lead among high-performance altcoins. Known for its fast, low-cost blockchain and strong DeFi and NFT ecosystems, it is currently trading around $151 after breaking a key downtrend and is showing bullish signals. A move above $160 could push it toward $184. In July, Solana is expected to trade between $152 and $161. By August, prices could climb to $161‚Äì$184, with a peak target of $173. Buying now could bring up to 23% gains, as bullish momentum builds. Cardano Cardano is also gaining attention due to its strong focus on scalability and growing real-world use cases. Recent upgrades, rising DeFi activity, and the possibility of ETF inclusion have boosted investor confidence. Founder Charles Hoskinson has also hinted towards a major push into Bitcoin DeFi, and a proposed $100 million ADA treasury conversion to boost stablecoins and liquidity. Analyst Javon Marks has shared that ADA has recently broke out and still looks ready for a big move. He is eyeing a surge of over 120%, with a clear target of over $2 ahead. Dogecoin Even meme coins are starting to perform well. In a strong bull market, DOGE could rise to $0.30‚Äì$0.40 by late 2025. If adoption grows or a major influencer jumps in, DOGE could even retest its all-time high near $0.70. According to analyst Ali Martinez, if Dogecoin climbs back above $0.17, a key buy signal on the 3-day chart could trigger a rally toward $0.21. Analyst Javon Marks predicts that if Dogecoin repeats its pattern from the last two bull cycles, it could surge over 120x from current levels, reaching $20.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,XRP|ALTCOIN|DOGE|ADA|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-30 11:42:22

The bank and its ex-CEO, Jes Staley, allegedly defrauded investors by lying or downplaying their relationship with Epstein as a way to protect Barclays‚Äô reputation and shore up its stock price, Reuters reports . The class action lawsuit ‚Äì led by pension funds in New York and St. Louis ‚Äì is on behalf of holders of Barclays‚Äô American Depositary Receipts (BCS), which are securities that allow investors in the US to gain exposure to the bank‚Äôs shares that natively trade on the London Stock Exchange. US District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong has ruled that holders of BCS, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), have plausibly alleged the defendants intended to mislead them about their relationship with Epstein. Plaintiffs allege that the fraud ran from July 22nd, 2019, to October 12th, 2023, even after Barclays knew about an email cache belonging to Staley that categorized Epstein as ‚Äúfamily.‚Äù Bloomberg recently reported that Staley, as an ambitious new executive of JPMorgan‚Äôs private banking branch, developed a professional and personal relationship with Epstein that lasted from 2005 to 2015, even after Epstein was jailed and placed on a sex offender registry. An email trove exposed in court showed that while working at JPMorgan, he and Epstein met regularly. Because of his ties to Epstein, Staley has since been banned from top financial jobs in the UK by Britain‚Äôs Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

According to a senior South Korean trade official, who asked to be kept anonymous for discussing internal matters, it is not feasible to expect negotiations to end before across-the-board tariffs are set to rise on July 9. The official believes a lot of countries may have to work out the details of their negotiations long after the initial deadline. However, they admitted that it is also not certain if South Korea will be able to secure an extension of the grace period due to a ‚Äúfluid situation‚Äù in the US. South Korea wants an extension South Korea‚Äôs newly appointed Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo is working hard on the matter and was in Washington up until Sunday after he held his first meeting with US counterparts. South Korea is considered a key US ally and major manufacturing hub for products like cars, semiconductors, and batteries, but its companies were not exempt from President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff campaign. Plus sectoral duties, South Korea has to pay a 10% tax on shipments to the US and that value will reportedly rise to 25% next week, barring a deal or an extension of the grace period. In the past, US officials had insisted that sectoral tariffs would not be a subject of their talks. However, the anonymous official said some have hinted during more recent negotiations that they could be willing to consider discussing that topic depending on what South Korea has to offer. Talk of the tariffs is happening at a critical time for South Korea as the new President Lee Jae-Myung seeks to revive an economy destabilized by tariff uncertainty. Already, the Asian country, which has an export-reliant economy, has already suffered from US levies, with its central bank having slashed its 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.8% from 1.5%. The Trump administration is fluid on extending deadlines Despite the efforts of South Korea‚Äôs trade minister, there is no certainty that the country will be awarded an extension. Trump himself has already indicated he has no intention to extend the deadline on talks with any trading partners. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll need to,‚Äù he said during an interview on Fox News from Friday before adding, ‚ÄúI could, no big deal.‚Äù The statement came after Trump said on Friday that the administration could do ‚Äúwhatever we want‚Äù with the deadline, but he seems to be leaning towards making it shorter according to what he told the press. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to make it shorter. I‚Äôd like to just send letters out to everybody, ‚ÄòCongratulations, you‚Äôre paying 25%,‚Äô‚Äù he said at a press briefing. His stance seemingly contradicts what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox Business, which is that countries are approaching the US with very good deals that might not have been concluded by the time Trump‚Äôs April 2 country-based tariffs kick back in. He noted Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick‚Äôs previous comments that the White House plans to reach agreements with 10 major trading partners. ‚ÄúIf we can ink 10 or 12 of the important 18 ‚Äî there are another important 20 relationships ‚Äî then I think we could have trade wrapped up by Labor Day,‚Äù Bessent said.

But in a market that‚Äôs shifting from technical patience to viral momentum, that may no longer cut it. The truth? While ADA still builds quietly in the background, the next boom will be headlined by coins that break the internet, not just whitepapers. Here are six tokens that are already sprinting while ADA stretches. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): the meme chain, not just a meme coin The presale tells the story better than any pitch. Over $1.82 million has already poured in, and more than 1.66 billion tokens have been claimed in Stage 3. That‚Äôs not a fluke demand. That‚Äôs early conviction‚Äîespecially when you consider the price is still just $0.0012, and the token is locked in to list at $0.003. For traders doing the math, that‚Äôs a 2.5 times head start built in. What‚Äôs fueling this surge is a mix of strong fundamentals and genuine community energy. LILPEPE is being backed by users who don‚Äôt just want the next SHIB‚Äîthey want a smarter launch, fundamental anti-bot protections, and a way to build viral projects without getting dumped on. That‚Äôs where it‚Äôs winning hearts. PEPE: still the king of hype PEPE made its name in 2023 by turning a joke into a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem. With a $5.4 billion market cap and massive daily volume, it remains one of the most liquid and closely watched meme coins in the world. PEPE is a trader‚Äôs dream: deflationary tokenomics, insane meme velocity, and a track record of pumping 10x in months. Its only downside? Volatility. But if the market heats up, only a few tokens are positioned to catch fire faster than PEPE. Milady (LADYS): high fashion meets full degeneracy With a supply gimmick of 888 trillion tokens and massive burns early on, LADYS had no roadmap, no dev team‚Äîjust vibes and virality. It‚Äôs now listed across major exchanges, meaning entry is easy when the memes get hot again. LADYS tends to spike when NFTs trend or when Pepe and other meme tokens rally. It‚Äôs volatile, it‚Äôs risky, and that‚Äôs exactly why meme traders love it. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): NFTs, IRL toys, and now DeFi PENGU is an extension of the globally recognized Pudgy Penguins NFT brand. With a capped supply of 88.88 billion tokens, airdrops to NFT holders, and listings on major exchanges, it‚Äôs a slow-burn meme coin with authentic branding. Unlike many meme tokens, PENGU is less about pump-and-dump and more about brand-driven growth. As the NFT world revives and cross-branding takes over in crypto merch, Pudgy Penguins will continue to push forward‚Äîand so will PENGU. aixbt (AIXBT): meme coin, meet oracle AI AIXBT launched in late 2024, leaning hard into the AI narrative. It‚Äôs the governance and rewards token of the ‚ÄúVirtuals Protocol,‚Äù a community-led AI oracle project‚Äîthink Chainlink meets ChatGPT, but with a meme-style twist. A memecoin with an actual AI use case. Early momentum has propelled it toward a $ 40 M+ market cap, with solid exchange listings and a tight supply distribution. If AI coins surge again‚Äîand they will‚ÄîAIXBT could run fast, especially with crypto Twitter poised to ride any AI-branded trend. DEGEN: the farcaster meme that refused to die DEGEN is the rawest meme on this list. It wasn‚Äôt launched‚Äîit was airdropped as a joke to users of a Farcaster channel called ‚Äú/degen.‚Äù With a tiny 100M supply and zero expectations, DEGEN experienced explosive growth in early 2025, delivering 10x or more gains in just weeks. Why include it here? Because DEGEN is pure, uncut meme culture, and culture drives this market. It thrives when attention peaks. If the memecoin mania hits full speed, DEGEN will rally just because everyone wants to say they hold ‚Äúthe Degen coin.‚Äù Final take: ADA will miss the moment The next bull run won‚Äôt reward slow builders as much as it will high-engagement tokens with viral energy and real-time community traction. LILPEPE is that movement. PEPE, LADYS, PENGU, AIXBT, and DEGEN are riding the wave. Don‚Äôt sit on the sidelines with ADA when the meme coins are running the show. Less than 30% LILPEPE remains in stage 3‚Äîand once it lists at $0.003, this frog‚Äôs already halfway to the moon.

In a tweet, Lord XRP expressed appreciation for Schwartz‚Äôs straightforward communication style, highlighting his ability to discuss XRP without emotional opinion and strictly based on facts. Lord XRP reinforced his belief that XRP is set to play a pivotal role in the emerging financial system. The tweet included a video clip from an interview featuring David Schwartz, where the Ripple CTO provided in-depth commentary on the value of XRP, particularly addressing questions related to its valuation within private ledgers compared to the public XRP Ledger. ALWAYS NICE TO LISTEN TO DAVID SCHWARTZ THE CTO OF #RIPPLE . HE SPEAKS VERY CLEAR WORDS BASED ON FACTS WITHOUT EMOTIONAL OPINION. #XRP WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN OUR NEW FINANCINAL SYSTEM pic.twitter.com/0qW37GZT87 ‚Äî Lord XRP (@Bitforcoinz) June 28, 2025 David Schwartz Explains XRP‚Äôs Consistent Value Proposition In the video, Schwartz was asked whether the value of XRP would be the same on private ledgers as it is on the public XRP Ledger. Schwartz responded affirmatively, making it clear that XRP‚Äôs value remains consistent regardless of the environment it is used in. He explained that the fundamental value proposition of XRP lies in its global liquidity pools, which are designed to function without artificial barriers or price discrepancies. He emphasized that it does not make sense for XRP to have different valuations in different environments because the mechanisms of arbitrage naturally eliminate such disparities. Schwartz drew a parallel to gold, explaining that there is no place where gold is worth twice as much as it is elsewhere. If such a situation were to arise, market participants would simply buy gold where it is cheaper and sell it where it is more expensive, balancing the price difference. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Arbitrage Mechanisms Prevent Price Disparities Schwartz elaborated that unless there is significant friction, such as regulatory barriers or capital controls, the value of an asset like XRP should remain uniform globally. He mentioned that if friction does exist, it often creates business opportunities for those who can eliminate it. In his view, any scenario where XRP holds a significantly different value in one environment compared to another indicates a malfunction or an unusual market condition. He referenced a real-world example known as the ‚Äúkimchi premium,‚Äù a situation where the price of XRP in certain Asian countries was temporarily higher due to capital controls. Schwartz clarified that such instances do not reflect a healthy market dynamic but rather indicate that something is not functioning correctly within that market. XRP‚Äôs Global Usability as the Core Value Schwartz further explained that the entire value proposition of XRP is its global usability and accessibility. Using another analogy, he stated that if someone were to sell gold that could only be used for a specific purpose, such as jewelry, it would significantly diminish its value. Likewise, if XRP were restricted to certain environments, it would undermine the core purpose it serves in the financial ecosystem. He concluded by affirming that XRP‚Äôs value is inherently tied to its borderless nature, which allows it to serve as a universal bridge asset without fragmentation. This characteristic is central to XRP‚Äôs role in the evolving financial system. Lord XRP Reinforces XRP‚Äôs Role in the Future In his tweet, Lord XRP reiterated his strong belief that XRP is poised to play an integral role in the new financial system. He commended Schwartz for delivering a message based purely on factual analysis and logical reasoning, free from speculation or emotional influence. According to Lord XRP, the clarity provided by Schwartz further strengthens the case for XRP‚Äôs significance as a core component in the next generation of financial infrastructure.

From whispered endorsements of Bitcoin to bold proclamations about digital dominance, the former president has ignited another wave of speculation across the crypto space. But while the headlines obsess over what Trump might or might not do with Bitcoin, a completely different class of investors is already locking in serious wealth, and they‚Äôre doing it through the explosive Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) presale. The Trump-Bitcoin Drama: Fun to Watch, Risky to Wait Let‚Äôs be honest. Trump‚Äôs unpredictable takes on cryptocurrency are always headline-worthy. One week, he‚Äôs skeptical, the next he‚Äôs all in on American crypto mining. Is it genuine? Strategic? Nobody really knows. And that‚Äôs exactly the problem. The political winds shift fast, and in the meantime, Bitcoin itself has stalled around familiar price levels. Sure, Bitcoin remains the grandfather of crypto, but it‚Äôs not exactly breaking new ground right now. It‚Äôs steady, it‚Äôs respected, but it‚Äôs also stuck waiting for policy clarity. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris is moving fast. Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Quietly Dominating 2025 Bitcoin Solaris isn‚Äôt just another altcoin with flashy branding. Bitcoin Solaris has a working product stack, real scalability, and a developer roadmap that‚Äôs already delivering results. Here‚Äôs why insiders are calling it the ‚Äúwealth engine‚Äù of this cycle: Dual-consensus architecture: Proof-of-Work for security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake for performance Up to 10,000 transactions per second with lightning-fast 2-second finality Smart contracts built in Rust, unlocking high-performance DeFi and NFTs Validator rotation with built-in slashing to enforce trust and uptime Cross-chain capabilities and seamless Solana integration The upcoming Solaris Nova App allows users to mine using smartphones and laptops, pushing mining accessibility to new heights. Through the exciting release, Bitcoin Solaris positions itself as the most inclusive mining ecosystem on the market. And if you‚Äôre curious about what your hardware can mine, check the official calculator to see how much you could be earning daily. Real Momentum, Real Confidence The development pace speaks volumes. The BTC-S testnet is already hitting 10,000 TPS, smart contracts are in late-stage testing, and the live Solaris Power Exchange is shaping up as the go-to market for mining rentals. Community tools, in-app features, and developer resources are rolling out at record speed. This kind of activity doesn‚Äôt go unnoticed. A growing wave of crypto influencers is paying close attention, and a sharp, detailed review by Crypto League breaks down why Bitcoin Solaris is earning its spotlight. Enthusiasts are talking, developers are building, and investors are entering before the masses catch on. Trust in the ecosystem is also reinforced by successful audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and the project‚Äôs KYC-compliant team adds even more credibility for cautious newcomers. A Blockchain Designed for You, Not Institutions Discover BTC-S BTC-S Tokenomics: Scarcity, Utility, and Fair Distribution Bitcoin Solaris follows a well-structured tokenomics model designed to reflect Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity while introducing modern, utility-driven distribution. With a fixed supply of 21 million BTC-S tokens, the allocation supports long-term sustainability, fair access, and community growth: 66.66% allocated for mining (distributed over 90 years) 20% reserved for the presale 5% for liquidity pools 2% for ecosystem development 2% for community rewards 2% for staking rewards 2% for marketing 0.33% allocated to the team and advisors This model ensures that BTC-S remains controlled by the network‚Äôs most active contributors. It‚Äôs not just fair, it‚Äôs strategic. Presale Frenzy: Millions Locked In, Weeks Remaining While social media is stuck debating politics, Bitcoin Solaris is closing in on the finish line of one of the shortest and most explosive presales the market has seen. We‚Äôre currently in Phase 10: Price: $10 Next Price: $11 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 6% for new buyers Potential ROI: 150% Over 12,800 users have already joined, helping raise more than $5.8 million. And with less than five weeks until launch, momentum is only growing stronger. Set up Trust Wallet or Metamask ahead of time to make sure you don‚Äôt miss your BTC-S token delivery. The referral program adds another layer of value. Investors can invite others and receive a 5% reward on purchases, while the new buyers also earn a 5% bonus. With so many people benefiting, the viral loop just keeps spinning. One of the best ways to lock in early wealth? Enter before the next price jump at the official Bitcoin Solaris website . More Than Just Tech, A Community on the Rise Behind every great crypto is a great community. Bitcoin Solaris has built a loyal and growing base of holders, developers, and advocates who are actively shaping the ecosystem. Telegram channels like Bitcoin Solaris Chat are thriving, and the official X account drops regular development updates, announcements, and community news. It‚Äôs not just about making a quick flip. BTC-S is building a foundation, one that looks ready to scale globally, one user at a time. Final Word: Ignore the Noise, Follow the Builders Trump may be making waves with his crypto stance, but investors chasing the next opportunity aren‚Äôt waiting on speeches. They‚Äôre moving capital into platforms with working tech, proven traction, and a clear vision. Bitcoin Solaris is where the builders are. Where the miners are. And where the early millions are quietly being locked in.

Based on this technical framework, Egrag outlined three potential price targets for XRP: Conservative Target: $15 Average Target: $22 Optimistic Target: $40 #XRP ‚Äì W Pattern Number 10 & Targets! Here‚Äôs a visual of the classic 'W' pattern and the targets to watch: Conservative: $15 Average: $22 Optimistic: $40 But please, I beg you, literally Begging you take your initial capital at lower targets, starting‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/TotTaGfefx ‚Äî EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 30, 2025 The analyst emphasizes that these levels are derived from historical symmetry, Fibonacci extensions, and previous market cycles. While the $40 projection has captured attention, it‚Äôs the cautionary message behind these predictions that‚Äôs generating serious reflection among investors. A Plea for Strategic Profit-Taking Rather than celebrate only the upper price bands, Egrag delivered a sobering appeal to his followers: ‚ÄúPlease, I beg you, literally begging you, take your initial capital at lower targets, starting around $6‚Äì$7, and secure profits along the way.‚Äù His tone conveys a sense of urgency, rooted in experience and a realistic understanding of market dynamics. Egrag‚Äôs advice is simple but powerful: ‚ÄúWhat if everyone, including me, is wrong?‚Äù In a volatile and often unpredictable market like crypto, he argues, even the most compelling chart patterns can fail. The key to survival and success, according to Egrag, is not predicting the perfect top or bottom but learning to navigate the range in between. The Game of Buying and Selling In one of his most insightful remarks, Egrag explains the essence of crypto investing: ‚ÄúIt is the game of selling between the bottom and top and at the same time the game of buying between top and the bottom.‚Äù This quote captures the duality of market strategy, knowing when to take profits during hype cycles and having the courage to re-enter during fear-driven selloffs. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In addition, Egrag said, ‚ÄúTrust me, I‚Äôve played these games before. You cannot catch the bottom, and you cannot sell the top.‚Äù This sentiment echoes a mantra shared by seasoned traders who understand that precision is a myth, and consistency comes from discipline. XRP Sentiment and Market Outlook XRP is currently trading around the $2.18 mark, having seen renewed interest amid ongoing legal clarity and market-wide bullish momentum. Egrag‚Äôs forecast aligns with broader optimism within the XRP community, yet it also brings a layer of grounded realism often missing in euphoric bull markets. With his blend of chart precision and psychological insight, Egrag Crypto continues to be a trusted voice among XRP investors. While the targets of $15, $22, and $40 are exciting milestones to watch, his message is ultimately one of caution: profit isn‚Äôt made at the peak, it‚Äôs secured along the way.

Even Ford‚Äôs CEO admits that their affordable prices and high-quality experience have disrupted the order of the industry and are slowly gaining recognition globally. Ford Motor Company‚Äôs CEO, Jim Farley, during a recent conversation with author Walter Isaacson at the Aspen Ideas Festival, offered a blunt assessment of the electric vehicle (EV) industry. When he was asked about the state of China‚Äôs EV market, Farley said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the most humbling thing I have ever seen.‚Äù Farley, who made six to seven trips to China in the past year, praised not just the scale but the quality and technological prowess of Chinese EV manufacturers. ‚ÄúSeventy percent of all EVs in the world are made in China,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúThey have far superior in-vehicle technology. Huawei and Xiaomi are in every car. You get in, and your whole digital life is mirrored. No pairing. It just works.‚Äù China is handing it to the West in EV tech Farley stated that the reluctance of U.S. tech giants like Apple and Google to fully enter the car business is preventing Ford from matching that seamless integration. ‚ÄúThey decided not to go in the car business,‚Äù he said simply. The CEO also mentioned the implications of the cost and quality of these Chinese EVs. ‚ÄúTheir cost, their quality of vehicles is far superior to what I see in the West,‚Äù Farley said. ‚ÄúWe are in a global competition with China, and it‚Äôs not just EVs. If we lose this, we do not have a future Ford.‚Äù Last year, Farley described Xiaomi as ‚Äúan industry juggernaut‚Äù during an episode of The Fully Charged Podcast. He revealed that he had been personally driving Xiaomi‚Äôs debut model, the SU7, for six months and didn‚Äôt want to give it up. Xiaomi has only improved since then. The company recently launched its second EV, the YU7, a luxury SUV priced at $35,000, which notably undercuts Tesla‚Äôs Model Y, which starts at $36,760. Within days of its debut, Xiaomi received 300,000 orders for the YU7. In August, Ford Motor Company‚Äôs CFO, John Lawler, announced that the company would shelve its plans for electric SUVs in favor of hybrid models. The switch will cost the automaker nearly $2B, but despite that, Ford shares are currently up more than 9% year to date. China‚Äôs EVs are disrupting the Australian market At the recent Melbourne International EV Autoshow, Chinese brands like BYD and Xpeng stole the spotlight. The BYD Shark 6, a hybrid pickup, is already in local showrooms, with other all-electric models, such as Deepal‚Äôs EO7, expected by the end of the year. According to Riz Akhtar, the founder of EV analytics firm Carloop, the Australian market is at a turning point. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre moving past the early-adopter phase to early-mainstream,‚Äù Akhtar said. ‚ÄúThe market is being turned on its head with these new brands entering.‚Äù Six of the top 10 best-selling EVs in Australia this year are from Chinese brands, including BYD‚Äôs Atto 3, Sealion 7, and Dolphin which is priced at just A$29,990 ($20,000). Other rising contenders for best-selling EVs include Geely‚Äôs EX5 and MG‚Äôs MG4 and ZS EV. According to BloombergNEF‚Äôs Electric Vehicle Outlook 2025, China will account for 67% of global EV sales this year, up from 65% in 2024. In Australia, nearly 50% of new passenger car sales are expected to be EVs by 2030, compared to just 7.8% at the end of 2024. ‚ÄúBrand perception is the hurdle,‚Äù Jason Clarke, the CEO of TrueEV, Xpeng‚Äôs local distributor, admitted. ‚ÄúPeople still think Chinese equals cheap. That‚Äôs why we need people in the cars ‚Äî experiencing them.‚Äù Clarke said the Xpeng G6, a mid-sized SUV priced at A$55,000, is gaining traction in Australia. Two larger models, the G9 SUV and X9 people-mover, are expected to enter the market later this year. Toyota and Ford currently dominate overall vehicle sales in Australia, with the Toyota Hilux, Ford Ranger, and Toyota RAV4 leading in May, but the influx of affordable Chinese EVs could erode their dominance over time. Ray Evans, the CEO of Future Drive AutoShows, believes the shift is already underway. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gone through the tipping point,‚Äù Evans said. He‚Äôs now organizing a Sydney EV show in August focused largely on electric and hybrid pickups.

On 25 June, the Spanish Guardia Civil, backed by Europol and law enforcement partners from Estonia, France, and the United States, executed coordinated raids that led to the arrests of five individuals behind one of Europe‚Äôs largest crypto fraud operations to date. Three arrests were carried out on the Canary Islands and two in Madrid. The group allegedly operated through a network of sales representatives worldwide who persuaded people to invest in fraudulent crypto schemes. They collected funds from victims through cash withdrawals, bank transfers, and crypto-transfers. According to investigators, the criminal network defrauded over 5,000 victims around the world, laundering an estimated ‚Ç¨460 million in illicit profits. Investigators believe the organization set up a complex corporate and banking network based in Hong Kong, using payment gateways and accounts opened under different names across various crypto exchanges. This system allowed them to receive, store, and move criminal proceeds while making it difficult for authorities to trace the money. The investigation is still ongoing.

The group operated fake trading platforms and used psychological tactics via bogus brokers to convince victims to invest increasing amounts, which were never actually traded. In Europol‚Äôs Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment released in March, online fraud has been identified as one of the main threats to the EU‚Äôs internal security. Furthermore, Europol anticipates that online fraud will soon surpass other forms of organized crime, driven by the growing use of AI.

No VC manipulation. No insider allocations. No centralized exchange backing. Just a viral idea, real product utility, and a stampede of early believers who know a 20x‚Äì50x play when they see it .If you‚Äôre still on the sidelines, let this be your wake-up call: the Degen Labs presale is live , and it‚Äôs gaining momentum by the hour. Degen Labs Isn‚Äôt Just Another Meme Coin‚ÄîIt‚Äôs an Entire Meme Ecosystem Let‚Äôs cut through the noise. Most ICOs these days are the same recycled narratives with new logos slapped on them. But Degen Labs is different . It‚Äôs not just a token‚Äîit‚Äôs an infrastructure layer for the meme economy. Built for creators, shillers, communities, and early-stage projects, Degen Labs combines the viral potential of meme culture with real-world tools and rewards systems . Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs fueling the hype: Meme Mining Shill-to-earn done right. Users get paid for going viral. Tweet, post, meme, and you mine $DEGEN by helping projects blow up. It‚Äôs a decentralized army of marketers‚Äîpowered by incentives and on-chain rewards. MemeBoost Projects can buy temporary virality. Boosted tokens rise to the top of trending lists, gain visibility inside the Degen ecosystem, and get prioritized in Meme Mining campaigns. No more relying on overpriced influencers or random moonboys. MemeVault Stake and earn. Token holders can lock up $DEGEN and partner tokens to earn APY and unlock ecosystem perks. Designed to reward loyalty and weed out weak hands. MemePools A fair launchpad for meme tokens, without insider games. Projects get real exposure, liquidity is locked, and the Degen community can discover and back the next wave of viral tokens. This Is the Presale Retail Has Been Waiting For The token is currently priced at just $0.0069 . Early buyers are loading up, speculating on a 20x to 50x upside ‚Äî before the listing price has even been announced . Compare that to meme tokens like $DOGE , $PEPE , or $WIF that reached over billion-dollar market caps with zero real utility. Degen Labs actually offers: Real features A useable platform On-chain utility Built-in virality mechanics A strong, growing community And now‚Äî a million dollars in grassroots conviction This isn‚Äôt hopium. This is real momentum. Don‚Äôt Be the One Who Reads This After the 10x Already Happened Timing is everything in crypto. Blink and the best opportunities are gone. Right now, you have a front-row seat to the most exciting presale of 2025 , and a chance to get in before centralized exchanges list $DEGEN , before the TikTok hype starts, and before Crypto Twitter loses its mind. Early investors are already positioning themselves. The next wave is coming‚Äîand you‚Äôre either riding it or watching it. There will be thousands of presales this year. But none of them have what Degen Labs has : A real community, viral architecture Reward systems Builder tools 100% crypto-native culture And most importantly‚Äî a retail army that just put over $1,000,000 into the presale in under 72 hours . This Is It. Don‚Äôt Watch. Act. If you missed $DOGE at launch‚Ä¶ If you ignored $PEPE when it was still a joke‚Ä¶ If you faded $WIF before it went vertical‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt make the same mistake with Degen Labs. This is your window. Your shot. Your chance to go from early to legendary.

While the crypto king leads the charge, analysts warn the altcoin market is not quite ready to follow‚Äîat least, not yet. The remainder of this bull cycle may hinge on one crucial signal: a breakdown in Bitcoin dominance, potentially triggering a powerful rotation into altcoins. Is Bitcoin Dominance the Key to Altseason? According to crypto analyst Kyledoops from Crypto Banter , Bitcoin‚Äôs current market cycle is around 75‚Äì80% complete, with the final 20% likely to bring explosive upside. On a recent podcast, he projected a strong Wave 3 move could send Bitcoin to $125K‚Äì$130K by September , backed by bullish indicators including Market Cipher B, rising money flow, and green dots on the weekly chart. With the S&P 500 and other major equities hitting all-time highs, Bitcoin appears poised to follow the upward momentum. However, for altcoins to truly rally, a breakdown in Bitcoin dominance‚Äîcurrently nearing the apex of a rising wedge between 66%‚Äì69%, is necessary. A rejection at these levels, analysts believe, could finally mark the beginning of a genuine altseason. Early Signs: Which Altcoins Are Moving? Although broad altcoin strength is still pending, select tokens are starting to show bullish setups: SUI has rebounded off the 0.618 Fibonacci level, currently sitting in profit with reduced risk. Solana (SOL) bounced from a fair value gap and may retest the $145 level soon , though a full reversal is yet to confirm. Fantom (FTM/S) has broken out of its downtrend and is targeting a move above $0.38 , which would be an early bullish sign. ONDO , while sitting at range lows, could see action if Bitcoin dominance begins to fall. Meme Coins Are Heating Up Nobody Sausage saw a 130% spike, maintaining a bullish posture pending trendline confirmation. FartCoin is hovering at the 50% retracement zone. Popcat is in a reaccumulation phase between $0.20‚Äì$0.24. PEPE must reclaim its 50% Fibonacci level to prevent further downside. [post_titles_links postid=‚Äù476858‚Ä≥] Other Notable Setups NEAR may be forming a double bottom , showing early bullish signs. GokuCoin continues its upward move on strong fundamentals. Chainlink remains indecisive, currently in ‚Äúno man‚Äôs land.‚Äù USELESS offered no notable market signals. Outlook: Patience May Pay Off Kyledoops emphasizes that most altcoins are still in accumulation, and a full-scale rally is unlikely until Bitcoin dominance breaks down and the SPX500 confirms continued momentum. While the market setup for altseason is gradually forming, analysts caution that timing is everything. The next few months could offer golden opportunities‚Äîbut only for those who stay patient and watch the key indicators closely.

As of today, June 30, 2025, the crypto market is showing a mixed performance. Bitcoin is trading around $107,500 with a slight dip, while Ethereum is showing some upward movement. The overall market capitalization is around $3.41 trillion, with some altcoins experiencing minor gains and others showing slight declines. What is altcoin season in the cryptocurrency market? Altcoin season, or altseason, is a period when cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (altcoins) significantly outperform Bitcoin in terms of price growth. It‚Äôs characterized by capital rotating from Bitcoin into altcoins, leading to rapid and substantial gains across a wide range of alternative cryptocurrencies. What typically happens when altcoin season occurs? When altcoin season occurs, several things typically happen: Bitcoin‚Äôs market dominance declines as capital shifts, a majority of altcoins experience rapid price appreciation, trading volumes for altcoins surge, and there‚Äôs often a general increase in market optimism and retail ‚ÄúFOMO‚Äù (fear of missing out). Will Bitcoin‚Äôs price fall during an altcoin season? Bitcoin‚Äôs price doesn‚Äôt necessarily fall during an altcoin season. Instead, it often consolidates, rises more slowly, or even continues to increase, but at a significantly lower rate than altcoins. The key characteristic is that altcoins outperform Bitcoin, meaning their percentage gains are much larger as money flows into them.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-30 12:09:22

According to a report by The Chosun Daily on Monday, the central bank informed participating banks that the next stage of its CBDC trials , initially scheduled for later this year, will be postponed. A senior official at one of the seven participating banks stated that the central bank is waiting to understand the government‚Äôs plans for stablecoins and how a CBDC would align with the proposed framework. Newly elected President Lee Jae-myung has voiced support for stablecoins as part of his crypto-forward agenda, which includes allowing tokens that track the Korean won. Earlier this month, his party proposed a bill enabling companies with a minimum equity capital of 500 million Korean won ($370,000) to issue such tokens. Banks Raise Concerns Over High CBDC Costs Reports indicate that banks participating in the trials have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the high costs associated with the CBDC project, with some stating the second phase of testing was ‚Äúon the verge of collapse.‚Äù Participating banks also expressed frustration over the lack of a clear commercialization plan for the CBDC from the Bank of Korea. In response, the central bank is reportedly considering shifting the second phase of the trials to the first half of next year and may limit the number of financial institutions involved. The initial stage of the CBDC pilot, which ran from April 1 to June 30, involved 100,000 participants testing payments using the digital currency. The planned second stage aimed to expand merchant participation and include remittance functions. However, several banks have shown a preference for focusing on their own stablecoin initiatives, which offer a clearer path to financial benefits compared to the CBDC trials. Stablecoin Initiatives Gain Traction in South Korea On Wednesday, it was reported that eight South Korean banks plan to launch a won-backed stablecoin by next year. Half of these banks, including KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Woori, and NongHyup, were participants in the first stage of the CBDC trials, indicating a potential shift in focus toward stablecoins. The suspension of the CBDC tests triggered mixed reactions in South Korea‚Äôs fintech market . Shares in KakaoPay Corp dropped 7%, while Hecto Financial saw a 5% decline on Monday. Meanwhile, KB Financial Group shares rose by 0.8%, and Shinhan gained 1.6%, reflecting the market‚Äôs cautious optimism toward stablecoin developments.

But now, with the open Mainnet live and millions of people holding Pi, many wonder what 1,000 Pi could really be worth by 2026?. Pi Network Growing Adoption Pi coin started as an experiment to make mining accessible to anyone with a smartphone. Since its 2019 launch, it‚Äôs grown into a global community of over 50 million users, with a mainnet launch and a growing ecosystem of apps and merchants. Meanwhile, the Pi ecosystem is growing slowly, with retailers in Asia already accepting Pi, a Pi Bridge that lets users swap Pi on Ethereum or BNB, and new apps like Pi Chain Mall and Fireside Forum adding use cases. Why Pi‚Äôs Supply Matters? One of the biggest factors in Pi‚Äôs price outlook is its supply. Although the Pi‚Äôs total supply is huge ‚Äî 100 billion tokens in total. But most of it is still locked away. The Pi Core Team releases new coins slowly, through mining rewards, developer funds, and planned unlocks every few month As of now, Pi Coin trades at around $0.507 , making 1,000 Pi worth about $507. But what about the future? What Could 1,000 Pi Be Worth? So, how much could your 1,000 Pi stack grow to? It depends on what Pi‚Äôs adoption looks like by 2026. If adoption stays low and the Pi community fails to expand real-world uses, the price could hover around $20‚Äì$30 per coin . That would make 1,000 Pi worth between $20,000 and $30,000. If Pi‚Äôs ecosystem sees steady growth with more apps, shops, and users spending Pi, the coin could reach $50‚Äì$75. That would push your 1,000 Pi up to $50,000‚Äì$75,000. The dream scenario is mass adoption. If Pi becomes a go-to digital currency for shopping, tipping, and apps, some believe it could hit $100+, making your 1,000 Pi worth $100,000 or more. Coinpedia‚Äôs Pi Coin Price Prediction for 2026 According to Coinpedia‚Äôs research, predictions for Pi Coin in 2026 are mixed. Looking at the last few months since the mainnet launch, Pi has struggled to stay above $1, often dropping close to $0.40. However, Coinpedia‚Äôs team says things could change if Pi gets listed on major exchanges. If that happens, they expect Pi‚Äôs price to average between $2.25 and $3.5 by 2026. That means 1,000 Pi could be worth around $2,250 to $3,500. If growth stays slow, it could still reach $700 to $1,250 by 2026.",News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MINING|ASIA|BNB|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-30 12:13:51

A significant shift is currently unfolding: the US Dollar is experiencing a notable retreat, primarily fueled by growing optimism surrounding potential Interest Rate Cuts by major central banks. This development has sent ripples across the global financial landscape, propelling the Euro Exchange Rate closer to multi-year highs and reshaping the dynamics within the broader Forex Market . But what does this mean for your crypto portfolio? Let‚Äôs dive deep into these pivotal currency shifts and their profound implications for the Global Economic Outlook . Unpacking the US Dollar Retreat ‚Äì What‚Äôs Driving This Crucial Shift? For months, the US Dollar has largely stood as a bastion of strength, often serving as a safe-haven asset amidst global uncertainties and benefiting from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs aggressive rate hike cycle. However, recent economic indicators and evolving market sentiment suggest a significant pivot. The narrative is now shifting from ‚Äúhigher for longer‚Äù interest rates to an expectation of impending cuts, a change that naturally weighs on the dollar‚Äôs value. What specific factors are contributing to this retreat? Cooling Inflation Data: While inflation remains a concern, recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports have shown signs of moderation. This provides the Federal Reserve with more flexibility to consider easing monetary policy without reigniting price pressures. Softening Economic Data: Alongside inflation, some economic indicators, such as manufacturing output and certain labor market statistics, have shown signs of cooling. This suggests that the Fed‚Äôs past rate hikes are having their intended effect of slowing down the economy, potentially preventing a hard landing. Market Expectations: Financial markets are forward-looking. Traders and investors are increasingly pricing in the likelihood of multiple Interest Rate Cuts in the coming year. This anticipation alone can weaken a currency, as lower rates typically reduce the attractiveness of holding that currency‚Äôs assets. Yield Differentials: As other central banks, particularly the European Central Bank (ECB), maintain a relatively hawkish stance or are perceived to be closer to their own rate-cutting cycle, the yield advantage previously held by U.S. bonds diminishes. This makes assets denominated in other currencies, like the Euro, more appealing. The retreat of the US Dollar is not merely a statistical anomaly; it represents a significant re-evaluation of global monetary policy trajectories and their impact on capital flows. For cryptocurrency investors, a weaker dollar can often be a positive catalyst, as it can reduce the relative cost of dollar-denominated crypto assets and encourage a shift towards riskier investments. The Ascent of the Euro Exchange Rate ‚Äì Is a Multi-Year High Truly in Sight? While the US Dollar has been on the defensive, the Euro Exchange Rate has been gaining considerable ground, pushing towards levels not seen in years against the greenback. This surge is a testament to a confluence of factors, ranging from improved economic sentiment within the Eurozone to the nuanced policy signals emanating from the European Central Bank (ECB). What‚Äôs fueling the Euro‚Äôs impressive climb? Resilient Eurozone Economy: Despite facing energy crises and geopolitical headwinds, the Eurozone economy has shown a surprising degree of resilience. Recent GDP figures and business sentiment surveys suggest that the region might avoid a deep recession, bolstering confidence in its economic outlook. ECB‚Äôs Hawkish Stance (Relative to Fed): While the Federal Reserve is increasingly signaling a dovish pivot, the European Central Bank has, until recently, maintained a more cautious stance regarding rate cuts. ECB officials have often emphasized the need for sustained evidence of inflation falling back to target before considering significant policy easing. This relative hawkishness makes Euro-denominated assets more attractive. Reduced Energy Price Volatility: Europe‚Äôs energy crisis, which significantly weighed on the Euro, has largely abated. Natural gas prices have stabilized at much lower levels, reducing inflationary pressures and improving the trade balance for many Eurozone nations. Global Diversification: As investors anticipate a weaker dollar, they naturally seek diversification. The Euro, as the world‚Äôs second-largest reserve currency, becomes a primary beneficiary of this portfolio reallocation, leading to increased demand. The push towards a multi-year high for the Euro Exchange Rate is a significant development, reflecting a broader recalibration of global currency valuations. For international trade and investment, a stronger Euro can make Eurozone exports more expensive but imports cheaper, impacting various sectors differently. From a crypto perspective, a strong Euro could encourage European investors to allocate more capital into digital assets, potentially leading to increased liquidity and trading volumes in Euro-denominated crypto pairs. Interest Rate Cuts : The Central Bank Conundrum and Global Impact The growing anticipation of Interest Rate Cuts by central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, is perhaps the most significant driver behind current currency movements. Central banks face a delicate balancing act: taming inflation without stifling economic growth. When inflation appears to be under control and economic activity shows signs of slowing, rate cuts become a viable tool to stimulate demand and avoid a recession. Why are central banks considering cuts now, and what are the broader implications? Balancing Inflation and Growth: The primary mandate of many central banks is price stability. Once inflation is perceived to be on a sustainable path towards the target (typically 2%), the focus shifts to supporting economic growth and employment. Rate cuts reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, encouraging investment and spending. Avoiding Economic Downturns: Prolonged periods of high interest rates can eventually lead to economic contractions. Central banks aim to engineer a ‚Äúsoft landing,‚Äù where inflation cools without triggering a severe recession. Rate cuts are a key instrument in achieving this. Global Coordination (or Lack Thereof): While the Fed is often the pace-setter, other major central banks, including the ECB, Bank of England (BoE), and Bank of Japan (BoJ), also assess their domestic conditions. Divergent policies can create significant currency volatility, while synchronized cuts could amplify global liquidity. Let‚Äôs consider a simplified view of the potential scenarios for Interest Rate Cuts : Central Bank Current Stance Market Expectations for 2024 Potential Impact on Currency Federal Reserve (Fed) Data-dependent, increasingly dovish Multiple cuts (e.g., 3-4 by year-end) Further weakening of US Dollar European Central Bank (ECB) Cautious, but acknowledging disinflation Fewer cuts than Fed (e.g., 2-3) Support for Euro Exchange Rate Bank of England (BoE) Still battling inflation, but growth concerns rising Potential cuts later in 2024 Mixed impact on GBP, dependent on timing The timing and magnitude of these Interest Rate Cuts will be pivotal in shaping the Forex Market and, by extension, the broader investment landscape. For crypto, lower interest rates globally can make traditional fixed-income investments less appealing, potentially pushing more capital into higher-risk, higher-reward assets like digital currencies. Navigating the Volatile Forex Market ‚Äì Opportunities and Risks for Investors The Forex Market , the largest financial market globally, is a dynamic arena where trillions of dollars are traded daily. The recent shifts in the US Dollar and Euro Exchange Rate , driven by evolving Interest Rate Cuts expectations, create both significant opportunities and inherent risks for various market participants, including cryptocurrency investors. How do these currency shifts play out in the Forex Market? Carry Trade Dynamics: A key strategy in Forex is the ‚Äúcarry trade,‚Äù where investors borrow in a low-interest-rate currency and invest in a high-interest-rate currency. As rate differentials narrow (e.g., U.S. rates come down, Eurozone rates remain relatively stable), the attractiveness of certain carry trades diminishes, leading to capital reallocation. Impact on Corporate Earnings: Multinational corporations are heavily exposed to currency fluctuations. A weaker US Dollar can boost the earnings of U.S. companies with significant overseas operations, as foreign revenues translate into more dollars. Conversely, a stronger Euro might make Eurozone exports less competitive. Commodity Prices: Many global commodities, including oil and gold, are priced in US Dollar s. A weaker dollar typically makes these commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies, potentially boosting demand and their dollar-denominated price. This often has a knock-on effect on inflation expectations. Investor Sentiment and Risk Appetite: A weakening dollar often correlates with increased global risk appetite. When the dollar retreats, investors tend to move out of safe-haven assets and into riskier ventures, including emerging market assets, equities, and, crucially, cryptocurrencies. This ‚Äúrisk-on‚Äù environment can be a significant tailwind for the crypto market. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Forex Market: Diversification: Do not put all your eggs in one currency basket. Consider diversifying your holdings across different major currencies if you have significant international exposure. Hedging Strategies: For businesses or individuals with large foreign currency exposures, consider hedging strategies using forward contracts or options to mitigate currency risk. Monitor Central Bank Communication: Stay attuned to statements from the Federal Reserve, ECB, and other central banks. Their forward guidance on monetary policy is the primary driver of currency movements. Assess Correlation with Crypto: Pay attention to the inverse correlation often seen between the US Dollar Index (DXY) and Bitcoin. A sustained dollar downtrend could signal a favorable environment for crypto. The volatility in the Forex Market presents both challenges in terms of managing risk and opportunities for those who can accurately anticipate or react to the shifting tides of global monetary policy. Understanding these dynamics is essential for any investor seeking to optimize their portfolio in the current environment. Broader Implications for the Global Economic Outlook ‚Äì What Lies Ahead? The retreat of the US Dollar and the ascent of the Euro Exchange Rate , driven by anticipated Interest Rate Cuts , are not isolated events; they are symptoms of a larger rebalancing within the Global Economic Outlook . These currency shifts have far-reaching implications, influencing everything from international trade balances to capital flows and geopolitical dynamics. How do these currency movements shape the global economy? Trade Balances: A weaker US Dollar generally makes U.S. exports more competitive on the global stage, potentially narrowing the trade deficit. Conversely, a stronger Euro could make Eurozone exports more expensive, potentially impacting their trade surplus. These shifts influence the profitability of multinational corporations and the economic health of trading nations. Capital Flows: As yield differentials shift and risk appetite changes, capital tends to flow from regions with less attractive returns to those offering better prospects. A weaker dollar environment might encourage capital to flow out of U.S. assets and into emerging markets or other developed economies perceived to offer higher growth potential or more attractive yields. This directly impacts foreign direct investment and portfolio investment. Inflationary Pressures: For countries that import a lot of goods priced in US Dollar s, a weaker dollar can alleviate imported inflation. This is a positive development for many economies, especially those heavily reliant on energy and raw material imports. However, for the U.S., a weaker dollar could eventually contribute to domestic inflationary pressures by making imports more expensive. Debt Servicing: Many developing nations hold dollar-denominated debt. A weaker US Dollar can ease the burden of servicing this debt, as it requires less local currency to make interest payments and principal repayments. This can free up resources for domestic investment and growth. Geopolitical Influence: Currency strength is often intertwined with a nation‚Äôs geopolitical influence. A sustained weakening of the dollar, while potentially beneficial for the U.S. economy in some ways, could also spark discussions about the dollar‚Äôs long-term role as the world‚Äôs primary reserve currency, though such a shift would be gradual and complex. The current environment signals a potential pivot point for the Global Economic Outlook . While the immediate focus is on central bank actions and their direct impact on currencies, the cascading effects will be felt across industries, investment portfolios, and national economies. For those in the crypto space, these macro shifts are particularly important, as they often dictate the broader liquidity environment and investor appetite for risk assets. A more stable, or even slightly inflationary, global environment due to easing monetary policy could provide fertile ground for the continued growth and adoption of digital assets. Conclusion: Navigating the New Era of Currency Dynamics The retreat of the US Dollar , driven by the palpable optimism surrounding future Interest Rate Cuts , and the corresponding surge in the Euro Exchange Rate mark a significant turning point in the global financial landscape. These movements within the Forex Market are not isolated events but rather interconnected threads that weave into the larger tapestry of the Global Economic Outlook . For investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these macro shifts is paramount. We‚Äôve explored how cooling inflation and softening economic data are nudging the Federal Reserve towards a dovish stance, weakening the dollar. Simultaneously, the Eurozone‚Äôs resilience and the ECB‚Äôs relatively cautious approach are bolstering the Euro. The anticipated Interest Rate Cuts represent a delicate balancing act for central banks, aiming to support growth without reigniting inflation. These dynamics create a volatile yet opportunity-rich environment in the Forex Market , impacting everything from corporate earnings to commodity prices and overall investor risk appetite. Ultimately, these currency dynamics underscore a potential shift towards a more accommodative global monetary policy environment. While challenges such as continued inflation vigilance and geopolitical uncertainties persist, the prevailing sentiment suggests a move away from aggressive tightening. For the cryptocurrency market, a weaker dollar and increased global liquidity often serve as a tailwind, potentially fostering greater adoption and price stability. Staying informed about these crucial currency shifts will be key to making strategic investment decisions in the evolving financial world.

This renewed investor appetite for gold comes as the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI) stagnates near levels last seen in early 2021. Notably, this divergence is raising concerns about crypto‚Äôs ability to reclaim its leadership in the risk-asset space, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone. In a June 30 post on X, McGlone shared data showing that as of June 27, 2025, gold ETF holdings had surpassed 104.7 metric tonnes, while the BGCI hovered at 859.95. This metric signals waning investor enthusiasm for major cryptocurrencies. The data indicated a steady rise in gold ETF inflows, contrasting with fading momentum in digital assets.

In this case, as the liquidity wave from the COVID-era stimulus recedes, the speculative frenzy that fueled crypto markets has cooled. Meanwhile, gold, long viewed as a hedge against monetary excess and deflationary risk, appears to be reclaiming its traditional safe-haven status. In 2025, the metal has seen renewed demand as investors seek shelter amid escalating economic uncertainty tied to trade tensions and geopolitical instability. Some analysts have even warned that gold could hit $5,000 if the global economy enters a severe downturn. McGlone cautioned that with current market dynamics, any stumble in U.S. equities could trigger a cascade of ‚Äúdeflationary dominoes‚Äù, tightening credit, weakening growth, and driving more investors toward hard assets like gold. In such an environment, digital assets may struggle to compete with the perceived stability and physical backing of bullion-based ETFs.

You could enjoy steady, passive income, without the worry of price fluctuations. In this article, I will explain everything you need to know about USDT staking, why Loopring‚Äôs AI-powered staking platform is a game-changer, and how you can start earning with it. What Is USDT Staking, and Why Should You Care? USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin that operates on a 1:1 ratio to the US dollar. It is much more stable than other cryptocurrencies, so while it floats around $1 in value, something like Bitcoin can swing wildly in price. Staking USDT is similar to depositing money in a high-yield savings account to earn rewards, but instead, you are locking up your USDT on a blockchain platform and earning a percentage of it as passive income over a certain time frame (weekly or monthly). Staking your USDT is a low-risk way to increase your crypto with limited concern of a price drop (and craziness). Staking is a great way to quickly earn passive income and is an excellent tool for crypto enthusiasts looking for a capped growth strategy. In addition, staking stablecoins like USDT requires no specification on your institutional risk tolerance. However, it is still important to choose a staking platform that will provide good rates. Always do your research on these platforms to verify their safety and security before instead. Meet Loopring: Your Smart Staking Platform Loopring is a platform that takes the hassle out of staking by using artificial intelligence to do the heavy lifting. Loopring is an automated staking smart contract designed to make your life easier while maximizing your earnings. Here‚Äôs why it stands out: Fixed Percentage Returns : No guesswork here!

Make sure you keep your private keys safe; think of them as the keys to your crypto house! Connect to Loopring: Visit the Loopring website (make sure it is the correct website so that no one scams you). Connect your wallet by pressing the ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù button.

Flexible lets you withdraw anytime, while fixed plans (e.g., 30 or 90 days) often give higher returns. Pick what suits your goals. Stake Your USDT : Enter the amount of USDT you want to stake, confirm the transaction, and pay a small gas fee (Loopring operates on Ethereum or compatible chains, so fees are low thanks to Layer 2 tech).

Tips to Maximize Your USDT Staking with Loopring Want to make the most of your staking journey? Here are some practical tips: Start Small : If you‚Äôre new, try staking a small amount of USDT to get comfy with the process. You can always add more later. Choose Fixed Plans for Higher Returns : Locking your USDT for 30, 60, or 90 days often means better APYs. Just make sure you‚Äôre okay with not touching those funds for a bit. Stay Safe : Only use Loopring‚Äôs official website and double-check URLs to avoid phishing scams. Keep your wallet‚Äôs private keys offline, maybe even in a hardware wallet like Ledger for extra security. Reinvest Your Rewards : Loopring‚Äôs compounding option lets you reinvest your earnings, growing your income over time. Be Mindful of Fees: While you can take advantage of Layer 2 to keep your gas fees down, be sure to check the Ethereum network fees before you stake so you‚Äôre not surprised later. Risks to Consider No investment is ever 100% risk-free, and staking USDT is no different. But don‚Äôt worry; Loopring was designed to limit those risks to the greatest extent possible. Keep in mind the following: Smart Contract Risks: The best smart contracts can still have bugs in them. Loopring staking platform utilizes an automated smart contract for staking, which is innovative, but it is still risky. Even audited contracts can have bugs or exploits, and if a hacker finds a bug and exploits that, they can drain the funds, including potentially any USDT you contributed. Platform Reliability : As a DeFi platform, Loopring has no central authority to lean on if anything goes wrong while you‚Äôre staking. You should only ever use platforms that have robust reviews and stay away from anything that feels ‚Äútoo good to be true.‚Äù Regulatory Changes: Stablecoins such as USDT have always come under regulatory scrutiny. Loopring operates decentralized (which is why you‚Äôre staking through Loopring), but just be mindful of news regarding the reserves that Tether is holding, or local news on regulations of cryptocurrencies in your area. If you stake with a trusted platform such as Loopring, and you utilize basic security (like a secure wallet), you can keep the main risks to a minimum. Why Loopring is a Better Option in 2025 There are tons of staking platforms out there‚ÄîBinance, Kraken, Aave, you name it. So why pick Loopring? It‚Äôs all about the AI-driven automation and user-first approach. Unlike centralized exchanges that might charge high fees or limit your control, Loopring‚Äôs smart contract puts you in the driver‚Äôs seat. The fixed returns give you clarity, and the AI ensures your USDT is always earning the best possible yield. Plus, with the crypto market heating up in 2025, Loopring‚Äôs focus on stablecoins makes it a safe bet for steady income. Ready to Start Earning with Loopring?

Europol Details Crypto Fraud Bust: Spain Raids Uncover Global Scam Network The suspects allegedly operated a worldwide network of sales representatives who promoted fraudulent cryptocurrency investment opportunities. These agents collected funds from unsuspecting victims through cash deposits, bank transfers, and crypto wallets. Investigators believe the group created a sophisticated financial structure based in Hong Kong. This network used various payment gateways and multiple crypto exchange accounts, often registered under false identities, to receive and move the stolen funds. Authorities confirmed that the criminal ring was able to move large sums of money across borders by exploiting weaknesses in cryptocurrency platforms and leveraging anonymity. Furthermore, the investigation remains active, with authorities now analyzing digital evidence and tracing the movement of funds across jurisdictions. Officials have not ruled out additional arrests as inquiries continue. Meanwhile, this investment scam is not isolated in Spain. In April, Spanish police arrested six people linked to a ‚Ç¨19 million ($21.5 million) cryptocurrency scam .

Interestingly, the alleged leader was caught while trying to flee to Dubai. Online Fraud Becomes A Growing Threat Meanwhile, Europol has identified online fraud as one of the fastest-growing threats to internal EU security. In its 2025 Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment (SOCTA), Europol warned that internet-based scams, especially those involving cryptocurrencies, are increasing in scale and complexity. The report also noted the growing use of artificial intelligence to enhance fraudulent schemes. These technologies are used to conduct social engineering attacks and gain unauthorized access to sensitive financial data. Earlier this month, Europol dismantled Archetyp Market , a major darknet platform linked to over ‚Ç¨250 million ($287 million) in illegal transactions, primarily involving drugs like fentanyl and MDMA.

Recently, a compelling signal has emerged from the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, catching the eye of seasoned analysts and everyday investors alike. Despite a period of broader market consolidation throughout June, a fascinating pattern is developing among a crucial segment of the Ethereum community: its long-term holders. What exactly are they doing, and why is it sparking such intrigue? What‚Äôs Driving This Ethereum (ETH) Accumulation Surge? The insights come from CryptoQuant analyst and contributor Crypto Sunmoon, who highlighted a significant divergence in typical market behavior. Instead of reacting to the prevailing sideways or downward pressures, Ethereum (ETH) long-term holders are demonstrating robust buying pressure. This isn‚Äôt just a casual purchase; it‚Äôs a strong, deliberate accumulation pattern, with accumulation volume showing a clear separation from what one might expect during a period of market uncertainty. Think of it like this: while many might be hesitant or even selling off their assets in a consolidating market, a specific group of investors is actively increasing their holdings. This indicates a profound conviction in Ethereum‚Äôs future potential. This behavior often precedes significant market shifts, suggesting that these experienced holders are either anticipating a major catalyst or are simply taking advantage of what they perceive as undervalued prices. Divergent Behavior: Unlike typical investor reactions to market consolidation, long-term ETH holders are buying, not selling. Strong Conviction: This persistent buying suggests deep belief in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term value proposition. Historical Precedent: Similar accumulation patterns have historically preceded upward price movements or significant market events. Are Long-Term Ethereum Holders Signaling a Major ETH Price Move? The actions of long-term Ethereum holders are often seen as a bellwether for future market sentiment. These are not the day traders looking for quick profits; they are individuals or entities with a multi-year outlook, often holding through volatile periods. When this cohort begins to accumulate aggressively, it sends a powerful message. It implies that those with the deepest understanding of Ethereum‚Äôs fundamentals and development roadmap are positioning themselves for what they believe is an inevitable upside. Consider the potential implications for the ETH price . If a significant portion of the circulating supply is being locked away by strong hands, it reduces the available supply on exchanges. Basic economics dictates that if demand remains constant or increases while supply diminishes, the price tends to rise. This isn‚Äôt a guarantee, of course, but it‚Äôs a strong indicator that smart money is preparing for a potential bull run or at least a significant appreciation in value. Past cycles have shown that periods of strong accumulation by long-term holders often precede major rallies. For example, before the significant bull runs of 2017 or 2021, there were often observable patterns of smart money quietly increasing their positions during quieter market phases. While history doesn‚Äôt repeat exactly, it often rhymes, and the current signals are certainly reminiscent of these prior accumulation phases. Decoding the Crypto Accumulation Pattern: Beyond the Surface Understanding crypto accumulation isn‚Äôt just about seeing more coins held; it‚Äôs about discerning the nuances of this behavior. Analysts use various on-chain metrics to identify and track these patterns. For Ethereum, key indicators include: Exchange Netflow: A negative netflow (more ETH leaving exchanges than entering) suggests accumulation, as investors move their coins to cold storage for long-term holding. Whale Wallets: Tracking the activity of large holders (whales) can reveal significant accumulation trends. When whales move ETH off exchanges, it‚Äôs a strong signal of intent to hold. Active Addresses vs. Accumulation Addresses: Distinguishing between addresses used for transactions and those primarily used for holding can provide deeper insights into market sentiment. The current pattern highlighted by Crypto Sunmoon suggests that the accumulation is not merely passive holding but an active, strategic buying effort. This is particularly compelling because it‚Äôs happening during a period when retail interest might be waning due to consolidation. This divergence points to a sophisticated understanding of market cycles by these holders, who are seemingly ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù or building positions before a widely anticipated event, such as a major network upgrade or broader market recovery. Navigating Current Market Trends : What Investors Need to Know The broader cryptocurrency market trends in June have been characterized by consolidation, a period where prices trade within a relatively narrow range, often following a significant move. This can be a frustrating time for short-term traders but often presents opportunities for long-term investors. Ethereum‚Äôs accumulation pattern stands out against this backdrop, offering a potential beacon of future direction. For investors, understanding these underlying currents is crucial. While the headlines might focus on daily price fluctuations, the long-term health of an asset often depends on the conviction of its core holders. The strong accumulation in Ethereum suggests that despite the current lull, the fundamental belief in its ecosystem remains robust. This could be influenced by several factors, including the ongoing development of Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Merge and subsequent upgrades), its pivotal role in DeFi and NFTs, and its potential as a deflationary asset. Actionable Insights for Investors: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on metrics like exchange netflow and whale activity for ETH to confirm ongoing accumulation. Consider Your Time Horizon: If you‚Äôre a long-term investor, periods of consolidation and accumulation by strong hands can present opportune entry points. Diversify and Manage Risk: While signals are strong, the crypto market remains volatile. Always ensure your portfolio is diversified and your risk management strategies are in place. Stay Informed: Follow reputable analysts and news sources to understand the broader market narrative and specific Ethereum developments. The emerging accumulation pattern among Ethereum (ETH) long-term holders is a powerful signal that warrants attention. It suggests a deep-seated confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs future, potentially hinting at significant movements for the ETH price down the line. While the broader market trends might currently be in a phase of consolidation, the strategic actions of these experienced investors, indicative of strong crypto accumulation , paint a picture of quiet confidence. For those looking to understand the pulse of the market, the message from long-term Ethereum holders is clear: something significant may indeed be on the horizon, and they are positioning themselves accordingly. This isn‚Äôt just about holding; it‚Äôs about a strategic and deliberate build-up of positions, anticipating a future where Ethereum continues to play a pivotal role in the digital economy.

This marks one of the most concrete efforts yet by a Central Asian country to give digital assets a formal place in state finance. The draft law on the crypto economy is yet to be adopted. Still, according to Timur Suleimenov, the head of the National Bank , the working group is already preparing a strategy for establishing and amending a crypto reserve. The idea is to establish the reserve in a new subsidiary of the National Bank, whose key activities would include non-traditional assets, including digital currencies and blockchain-based investments. ‚ÄúInternational practice shows that the sources for such a reserve may include confiscated crypto-assets, as well as cryptocurrencies mined by a crypto miner partially owned by the government,‚Äù Suleimenov wrote in an official response to a parliamentary query. But to create such a reserve, Suleimenov said amendments would be required to the financial legislation. These amendments would determine the legal status of the crypto reserve, set rules for depositing and managing it, and establish the grounds for how the government can use it. Government cracks down on crypto gray market With Kazakhstan‚Äôs crypto industry showing rapid growth, the government has been increasing measures to combat misuse and illegal transactions. A new bill is being prepared to control artificial intelligence (AI) use in digital asset trading. The legislation will likely impose administrative and criminal liability for cryptocurrency operations outside the state-prescribed formats. The aim is to limit the rise of gray markets that have become a concern for regulators. The new rules will complement current Kazakhstan laws that only allow crypto trading through licensed platforms operating within the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC), said National Bank Chair. The Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market (ARDFM) and the AIFC Committee compile and maintain a register of unauthorized cryptocurrency firms to implement this framework. This list is transmitted quarterly to banks to help them detect and stop suspicious or unlawful activity. In the first three months of 2025 alone, banks in Kazakhstan froze 15,800 unauthorized crypto transactions valued at about $3.07 million. Most of these were related to transactions to or from unauthorized platforms or peer-to-peer trades that did not meet legal requirements. Banks have been ordered to freeze any accounts believed to be involved in the gray market, watch over transaction limits of AIFC-approved exchanges, refuse transfers to unlicensed exchanges, and take ‚Äúinhuman care‚Äù examining every transaction worth more than $1,000 for any signs of illegality. Government officials warn of crypto risks As Kazakhstan prepares to enter the world of holding cryptocurrency, the country is being urged to tread lightly when it comes to letting the public invest in digital assets, with top financial officials warning them to be wary. In early June, Suleimenov issued a statement cautioning that cryptocurrencies are unsafe savings stores like bank deposits. He stressed that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and complicated and are better suited to experienced investors than ordinary public members. Suleimenov‚Äôs comments referred to a rising tide of crypto-related scams, false ads, and other shenanigans aimed at young people and those less educated about personal finance. In response, the National Bank and other state agencies are preparing a series of new legal protections to limit the marketing of digital assets. These measures limit false advertising and bring more openness to selling crypto products while protecting vulnerable groups like young people.

33767162,[object Object],1751291151,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy as Trump‚Äôs Beautiful Bill Makes Bitcoin More Bullish,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-makes-bitcoin-bullish-best-crypto-to-buy/,"Bitcoin is nearing the $108K mark following Donald Trump‚Äôs latest remarks on his ‚ÄòBig Beautiful Bill‚Äô ‚Äì a massive tax-and-spend plan that promises growth over fiscal restraint. His claim that deficits will be offset ‚Äòtimes 10‚Äô by economic expansion has reignited concerns about inflation. Consequently, Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal as a hedge against rising debt and currency risks has been enhanced, making it an opportune time to explore the best crypto to buy . Trump‚Äôs Fiscal Push Fuels Crypto Optimism Trump‚Äôs post on Truth Social urged Republicans to ease up on spending cuts. While the bill aims to boost the economy, it raises concerns about increased government borrowing, which could fuel inflation and erode confidence in the US dollar. As a result, more investors are leaning toward Bitcoin and gold as safer stores of value. Even former skeptics are becoming more bullish on crypto. Best-selling author Ric Edelman now urges financial advisors to allocate 10%‚Äì40% to crypto , a sharp increase from his earlier stance of 1%. As Trump‚Äôs bill continues to amplify Bitcoin‚Äôs rally, the next crypto to explode could be BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , and Tagger ($TAG). 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Win Free $BTC When the Crypto King Breaks ATH After ATH As Bitcoin continues attracting the wallets of investors, $BTCBULL opens the chance to capitalize on the OG coin‚Äôs hype for less than a cent. After buying $BTCBULL on presale for just $0.00258, you can anticipate $BTC airdrops when the crypto leader hits new milestones: $150K and $200K. You can also claim a share of a 2.1B $BTCBULL airdrop when $ BTC reaches $250K, of which 10% of the total token supply is earmarked. BITMEX‚Äôs Arthur Hayes believes $BTC is on track to hit $250K , so all of these rewards might be just around the corner. To be eligible for these airdrops, hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet , our #1 anonymous crypto wallet . You can also save on gas fees by purchasing $BEST , its native token. To top it off, $BTCBULL has planned deflationary token burns when $BTC reaches $125K, $175K, and $225K. Reducing its supply will create scarcity, which can increase demand and possibly drive up the token‚Äôs value when Bitcoin hits new highs. After $BTCBULL secures exchange listings, we predict it could reach $0.006467 , resulting in over 150% gains if you join the presale now. It‚Äôs no wonder that whale buyers have invested big bucks (including $31.9K , $20K , and $14.3K ) early on, positioning themselves for major returns before demand surges. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) ‚Äì Powers Bitcoin Layer 2 Built for Speed, Security & DeFi Utility $HYPER is the backbone of Bitcoin Hyper, a Layer 2 network launching in Q3 2025. It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs first Bitcoin Layer 2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , designed to make the network faster, cheaper, and DeFi-ready. Bitcoin‚Äôs base chain takes around 10 minutes per transaction and handles just seven per second. Bitcoin Hyper aims to reduce this to near-instant speeds and scale capacity to thousands per second, at a fraction of the cost. The Layer 2 leverages a canonical bridge . By doing so, you can wrap $BTC and interact with dApps across real-world assets, gaming, and lending without giving up control of your Bitcoin. For more information, read our guide . Transactions are processed by a dedicated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validator, ensuring high efficiency and sustainability. You can get involved by purchasing $HYPER on presale for just $0.012075. Then, for passive income, you can stake the coin at a whopping 442% APY. But act fast. Once Bitcoin Hyper officially goes live, $HYPER is predicted to reach $0.32 . That‚Äôs a potential gain of nearly 2,550%, making now a prime time to get in early. 3. Tagger ($TAG) ‚Äì Soars 100% in One Week Amid Creator Economy Hype $TAG is a cryptocurrency token built on the BNB blockchain, powering Tagger, a fully decentralized platform that aims to transform the creator economy. Since last week, it has spiked by nearly 100%, partly because it provides a transparent blockchain platform for content creation, community building, and monetization. In fact, many creators are turning to Web3 solutions to engage directly with their audiences without relying on intermediaries. Just look at SUUBD Token ($SUBBD) , for instance. It‚Äôs another decentralized creator platform and has raised over $710K on presale. Tagger leverages AI and blockchain to offer solutions, including a ‚ÄòDeCorp‚Äô system for decentralized data labeling and an ‚ÄòAI Copilot Model‚Äô for peer-to-peer data collaboration. Within the platform, $TAG facilitates transactions, incentivizes participation, and may grant access to exclusive features. Its core purpose is to provide creators with unambiguity, security, and complete control over their content and data. You can buy $TAG for roughly $0.00037 on some of the best crypto exchanges , including MEXC . The Best Crypto to Buy Amid Inflation Fears Trump‚Äôs Big Beautiful Bill is shaking up more than political headlines; it‚Äôs driving real movement in the crypto sector. As concerns over inflation and increased government debt resurface, investors are looking at digital assets like $BTC for protection. And as always, when $BTC spikes, other cryptos follow. As such, its rise signals a promising future for alternative tokens making waves, such as $BTCBULL , $HYPER , and $TAG. But remember: The crypto market is highly volatile. Yes, these tokens have high-profit potential, but they also carry risks. So always DYOR and never invest more than you can afford to lose.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-30 13:45:51

Recent developments regarding the unfortunate losses include a partial liquidation of 8,000 ETH ($20.11M) and 280 BTC ($30.4M). High-Risk, High-Reward, High-Loss The journey that this trader went through on Hyperliquid has sparked debate about whether or not he might be an insider, as the analysis firm noted earlier this March. His long BTC & ETH positions, with 50x leverage, netted a profit of around $6.8M in a single day, right before Trump signed one of his executive orders. Their investigation reveals continued high-risk, 50x leveraged positions in ETH, which, after accounting for profits, resulted in over 160,000 ETH being liquidated ‚Äî a burden that the liquidity provider, HLP, had to absorb. As a result, Hyperliquid has since capped the maximum leverage possible for ETH to x25 to avoid this from happening again. Seemingly unscathed, the risky bets continued, with the trader going short on Bitcoin. A dedicated ‚Äúteam‚Äù of people even tried to liquidate his positions, but the response to the margin call was quick. The user added $5M to support the trade, the prices fell further, resulting in a profit of $4.4M. Lookonchain summarized that this trader made over $10M in each of two separate wallets and another with over $9M in profits. After covering any prior losses, the winnings total $4.79M. But, as with everything, all good things come to an end. The traders‚Äô new wallet did not fare well this time around, with six liquidations in the last few days, resulting in a total loss of approximately $10 million. A Familiar Feeling If the above story reminds you of someone, it‚Äôs not by coincidence. Known for even higher-stakes, higher-leverage plays, James Wynn is another trader who‚Äôs been under Lookonchain‚Äôs radar and whose journey we‚Äôve also recapped . Perhaps the most notable endeavor was his $1.25 billion long BTC position with 40x leverage, which at one point resulted in over $87 million in unrealized profits, before the news that President Trump would be imposing tariffs on the European Union. His trading spree also ended in losses, but they were substantially exaggerated in that his unrealized PNL had reached almost nine figures before roundtripping it all. The analytics firm notes, ‚ÄúIt took him 70 days to go from 0 to $87M+ in profit, and only 5 days to lose almost all the $87M+ in profit.‚Äù The post This Trader Was Liquidated 8 Times in a Week, Losing Millions appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Ethereum (ETH) Price,EN,0,0,ZRX|ETH|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-30 13:47:17

For thousands of unsuspecting victims, that dark side just manifested in a devastating way. In a significant win for global law enforcement, Spanish authorities have recently dismantled a massive crypto scam ring, responsible for siphoning nearly $540 million from over 5,000 individuals worldwide. This isn‚Äôt just another headline; it‚Äôs a stark reminder of the ever-present dangers lurking in the unregulated corners of the cryptocurrency market. The Alarming Reality: Unpacking a Massive Crypto Scam Imagine losing your life savings, or a significant portion of your hard-earned money, to a sophisticated fraud scheme. For more than 5,000 people across the globe, this nightmare became a reality. Spanish police, leading an intricate international investigation with crucial support from Europol, recently announced the arrest of five individuals linked to a colossal crypto scam operation. This syndicate allegedly laundered a staggering $540 million, exploiting the allure of quick riches in the crypto space. The scale of this operation is truly breathtaking, highlighting the global reach and financial impact that these criminal enterprises can achieve. The victims, spanning multiple continents, were lured into what they believed were legitimate, high-yield crypto investment opportunities. Little did they know, they were falling prey to a meticulously orchestrated scheme designed solely to defraud them. Behind the Curtains: How the Crypto Investment Scam Operated So, how exactly do these sophisticated operations manage to deceive so many? The methods employed by this particular crypto investment scam were typical of many modern financial frauds, but with a distinct cryptocurrency twist. The criminals leveraged the pseudonymous nature of digital assets and the rapid pace of transactions to their advantage. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of their likely modus operandi: Deceptive Platforms: Victims were often directed to professional-looking websites or applications that mimicked legitimate investment platforms. These sites would display fabricated returns and ‚Äòsuccessful‚Äô trades, creating a false sense of security and profitability. Social Engineering: The scammers likely employed social engineering tactics, building trust with victims through various channels, including social media, dating apps, or even direct calls. They would pose as experienced financial advisors or successful traders, offering exclusive investment opportunities. Fake Accounts and Wallets: A key component of the laundering process involved the use of numerous fake accounts and crypto wallets. These were crucial for moving the illicit funds quickly across borders, making them incredibly difficult for law enforcement to trace. The funds would be fragmented and shuffled through multiple layers of transactions to obscure their origin. Pressure Tactics: Once a victim showed interest, they would be pressured into investing larger sums, often with promises of even higher returns. Any attempts to withdraw funds would be met with excuses, demands for additional fees, or simply ignored. The rapid evolution of technology, including the increasing sophistication of AI-powered deepfakes and convincing phishing campaigns, further fuels these types of schemes, making it harder for the average person to discern genuine opportunities from elaborate hoaxes. A Global Alliance: Spain‚Äôs Leadership in the Europol Investigation The success in dismantling this network underscores the critical importance of international cooperation in combating cybercrime. This particular investigation, while led by Spain, was a truly collaborative effort, benefiting significantly from the support and resources of Europol. Europol, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, plays a pivotal role in coordinating cross-border investigations, sharing intelligence, and providing operational support to member states. The complexity of tracking illicit funds across various blockchain networks and multiple jurisdictions presents a formidable challenge for individual national police forces. This is where a unified approach, like that spearheaded by Europol, becomes indispensable. The involvement of Europol meant that law enforcement agencies from different countries could pool their expertise, resources, and intelligence to unravel the intricate web of this Spain crypto fraud . It‚Äôs a testament to the growing global commitment to making the crypto space safer and holding criminals accountable, regardless of where they operate from. The Double-Edged Sword: Digital Anonymity and the Rise of Fraud The very features that make cryptocurrencies appealing ‚Äì decentralization, speed, and perceived digital anonymity ‚Äì are often exploited by criminals. While true anonymity on public blockchains is a myth (transactions are public, though identities behind wallets are not), the ease of creating new wallets and the lack of traditional financial intermediaries make it a fertile ground for illicit activities. Criminals leverage this perceived anonymity to hide their tracks, move large sums of money quickly, and avoid traditional financial oversight. Furthermore, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has added another layer of complexity. AI can be used to generate highly convincing phishing emails, create realistic deepfake videos for social engineering, and even automate parts of the scamming process, making these schemes more scalable and harder to detect. The combination of easy access to crypto, the promise of quick returns, and the sophisticated use of technology creates a potent environment for fraud. Authorities are constantly playing catch-up, developing new forensic tools and investigative techniques to pierce through the veil of digital anonymity that criminals seek to exploit. Protecting Your Digital Assets: Actionable Insights for Investors While law enforcement continues its vital work, individual vigilance remains your first line of defense against crypto scams. Here are some actionable insights to protect yourself and your digital assets: Do Your Due Diligence: Before investing in any crypto project or platform, conduct thorough research. Check reviews, look for legitimate whitepapers, and verify the team behind the project. If something seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Be Wary of Unsolicited Offers: Be highly skeptical of investment opportunities that come from unknown sources, especially via social media, email, or messaging apps. Legitimate investment firms rarely cold-call or message individuals with high-yield offers. Verify Identities: If you‚Äôre interacting with an individual claiming to be a financial advisor, verify their credentials and the company they claim to represent through official channels. Understand the Risks: Cryptocurrencies are volatile and speculative. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Be suspicious of guaranteed returns, as these are a major red flag for scams. Secure Your Wallets: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all your crypto accounts and exchanges, and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter a scam or suspicious activity, report it to the relevant authorities immediately. Your report can help prevent others from becoming victims. Conclusion: Vigilance in the Digital Frontier The bust of this $540 million crypto scam ring by Spanish police, with the critical assistance of Europol, is a significant victory in the ongoing battle against cybercrime. It sends a clear message that law enforcement agencies worldwide are enhancing their capabilities to track and apprehend those who exploit the crypto ecosystem for illicit gains. However, as long as the allure of quick wealth and the complexities of digital assets persist, fraudsters will continue to innovate their methods. The responsibility, therefore, falls on each one of us to remain educated, vigilant, and cautious.

Meanwhile, confidence across markets saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 200 points and the Nasdaq up 0.4%.

The U.S. has some form of trade agreements with China and the UK‚Äîbut the July 9 deadline for comprehensive deals or a resumption of reciprocal tariffs is fast approaching. Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Nicholas Burns, Harvard‚Äôs Belfer Center professor and former U.S. Ambassador to China, said the U.S. and China may not be close to a comprehensive deal yet. However, Burns noted the U.S. can leverage the current situation to extract more from China. He told ‚ÄòSquawk Box‚Äô in an interview : ‚ÄúWe need more leverage on our side of the table, and it‚Äôs there for the taking if we make China the centerpiece of this.‚Äù Meanwhile, there‚Äôs also the potential for fresh talks between Canada and the U.S. after Canadian authorities scrapped a retroactive digital services tax aimed at American tech companies.

BIS General Manager Agust√≠n Carstens declared the global economy has entered a ‚Äú new era of heightened uncertainty and unpredictability ‚Äù following dramatic US policy shifts that have rattled markets worldwide. Source: BIS Annual Report 2025 The dollar has plummeted 10% since the start of 2025, marking the largest first-half decline since free-floating exchange rates began in the early 1970s. U.S. Dollar Index (DXY/USDX) chart development from January 1973 to June 23, 2025. Source: Statista This extraordinary drop occurred alongside rising government bond yields, creating what Carstens described as ‚Äú an extraordinary, troubling combination ‚Äù that has sparked speculation about the dollar‚Äôs traditional status as a safe haven. Policy Chaos Triggers Market Upheaval Trade tensions and policy upheavals have fundamentally disrupted global economic stability. The announcement of broad-based US tariffs sent shockwaves through international markets, while accompanying policies, including questioning central bank independence and discussions about penalizing foreign holders of US securities, have fostered unprecedented uncertainty. The crisis reveals deep-seated structural vulnerabilities that have been developing for years. These include persistently weak productivity growth, unsustainable fiscal positions with historically high public debt, and the growing footprint of less-regulated non-bank financial institutions that pose systemic risks. Financial conditions are now transmitting more swiftly across economies due to structural shifts in the global economic system. The expansion of sovereign bond markets and the increased role of non-banks, such as investment and hedge funds, have created tighter links between financial markets worldwide. Rising protectionism and trade fragmentation present particular concerns as they exacerbate the decades-long decline in economic and productivity growth. Population aging, climate change, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain vulnerabilities are making the global economy less resilient to shocks. The post-pandemic inflation surge has left lasting scars on household expectations, potentially making them less firmly anchored. Global inflation rate from 2000 to 2024, with forecasts until 2030. Source: Statista High public debt levels near peacetime highs in many countries are increasing financial system vulnerability to interest rate rises while reducing governments‚Äô ability to respond to new shocks. Dollar‚Äôs Safe Haven Status Under Unprecedented Assault The US dollar‚Äôs dramatic decline has raised a fundamental question about America‚Äôs financial credibility on the global stage. The simultaneous depreciation of the dollar alongside rising government bond yields defies historical patterns where safe-haven demand typically strengthens the currency during uncertainty periods. Ten-year government bonds yields from Germany and the United States between January 2008 and May 2025. Source: Statista Market dynamics reveal extraordinary stress in the world‚Äôs most crucial currency relationship. Volatility has soared as investors grapple with policy announcements followed by adjustments and reversals, creating an atmosphere of perpetual unpredictability. Non-US investors holding Treasuries and other US assets have significantly increased hedging activities, making an ‚Äú important contribution ‚Äù to the dollar‚Äôs slide. This defensive positioning suggests eroding confidence in dollar-denominated assets despite their traditional safe-haven appeal. The repeated cycle of policy announcements and subsequent modifications has fundamentally altered the market perception of US policy stability. BIS economic adviser Hyun Song Shin acknowledged that while there‚Äôs no evidence of a ‚Äú great rotation ‚Äù away from US assets, the situation remains fluid. Sovereign funds and central banks move slowly, making it too early to determine if current trends represent temporary adjustments or structural shifts. The implications extend beyond currency markets as global financial conditions become increasingly sensitive to US policy decisions. Stablecoin Regulation Could Rescue Dollar Dominance Amid System Restructuring The crisis has exposed fundamental weaknesses in the global financial system, as stablecoins emerge as both a threat and a potential salvation for the dollar‚Äôs supremacy. Stablecoins were previously viewed as a competitor to traditional currency systems, but regulatory clarity through the advancing GENIUS Act could transform stablecoins into dollar-reinforcement mechanisms. Most stablecoins remain pegged to the US dollar, creating a potential for strengthened US dollar dominance as digital payment adoption accelerates worldwide. Senator Cynthia Lummis spoke with CNBC on Wednesday about the importance of passing crypto legislation before the year's end. #CynthiaLummis #CryptoLegislation https://t.co/dhmb7SKv6J ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 25, 2025 The Senate‚Äôs advancement of comprehensive stablecoin legislation toward final passage represents a critical juncture where proper regulation could channel growing digital asset usage back through dollar-denominated infrastructure. The BIS advocates structural reforms, including enhanced market flexibility, reduced trade barriers, and strengthened regulatory oversight, ensuring banking and non-banking activities face similar stringency. Central banks must maintain a focus on price stability while adapting through flexible tools, as tariff uncertainty complicates monetary policy amid stagflationary pressures. The success of the stablecoin regulatory framework could provide unexpected dollar support during this historic stress test.

Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Weighs in,https://cryptopotato.com/how-much-you-should-invest-in-bitcoin-btc-veteran-trader-peter-brandt-weighs-in/,"TL;DR The expert advises monthly investments in SPY and BTC for long-term success. The leading cryptocurrency is up 6% this week and trades near $108,000. Analysts are split ‚Äì some see a breakout to $130K ‚Äì $200K if key resistance levels are cleared, while others warn of a possible drop to $100K or even $95K if momentum fades. ‚ÄòTrading is the Wrong Path‚Äô Besides its fundamentals and ability to transform the global financial system, Bitcoin (BTC) has proven to be an excellent investment opportunity. At least, that was the case in the past few years: the asset went through multiple bear and bull markets to eventually cross the $100,000 mark. Currently, it trades at around $108,000 (according to CoinGecko‚Äôs data), representing a 75% increase on a yearly scale and a substantial 43,000% jump compared to its valuation a decade ago. But does the leading cryptocurrency remain a good investment after this major rally over the years, and how much should people allocate to it? That‚Äôs a question many people are trying to figure out. It seems that there isn‚Äôt a direct answer, and it all depends on the risk profile of the investors, as well as other important factors. However, one can turn to certain experts who are experienced enough to give guidance. An example is the veteran trader Peter Brandt, who recently suggested that approximately 95% of people fail when trading. Instead, he advised them to excel in their regular jobs, prioritize their families, and invest in homeownership. Last but not least, Brandt recommended making monthly investments, allocating 80% of the amount to SPY (the ETF that tracks the S&P 500 Index) and 20% to BTC.

The asset has increased in value by approximately 6% over the past week, with numerous analysts predicting a surge to a new all-time high if certain conditions are met . The X user Cipher X believes ‚Äúa strong weekly close‚Äù above $107,720 could open the door to a further rally to as high as $130,000-$135,000 in Q3 2025. ‚ÄúJust look at Q4 2024 chart and you‚Äôll see what happened when BTC had its biggest weekly close,‚Äù they added. Merlijn The Trader thinks the final pump for this bull run is coming, envisioning a fresh ATH of around $200,000 towards the end of the year. At the same time, he advised investors to take profits, anticipating a drastic pullback to $95,000 shortly after that. On the contrary, Ali Martinez argued that the cryptocurrency currently faces a key rejection while the stochastic RSI flashes a death cross on the daily chart. The analyst thinks a plunge to $100,000 is not out of the question unless ‚Äúwe get a sustained close‚Äù above $109,000. The post How Much You Should Invest in Bitcoin (BTC)?

He first urged investors to allocate part of their portfolios to bitcoin BTC in 2018. In his 2021 book ‚ÄúThe Truth About Crypto,‚Äù he described even a 1% crypto allocation as ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù for most people. Now, Edelman believes the case for crypto exposure is far stronger, pointing to what he called a ‚Äúmassive change‚Äù in the industry over the past four years. In particular, he highlighted growing political support for digital assets, especially following the election of U.S. President Donald Trump. ‚ÄúToday, all those questions have been resolved,‚Äù Edelman said, referring to regulatory uncertainty and institutional hesitation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs radically changed and is now a mainstream asset.‚Äù Edelman‚Äôs firm, Edelman Financial Engines, manages nearly $300 billion in assets. Though traditionally known for retirement planning and wealth management, the firm‚Äôs growing attention to digital assets mirrors a broader trend among financial institutions embracing crypto as a legitimate asset class. Even though Edelman described crypto as the ‚Äúbest investment opportunity of the decade,‚Äù he acknowledged that a 40% allocation may not suit everyone, suggesting a more conservative 10% for those with lower risk tolerance. Edelman‚Äôs recommendation marks one of the most aggressive calls from a mainstream financial figure to date. Most financial advisors in the U.S. are currently recommending well under 5% to their clients.

Investors are worried about the US getting involved in the conflict after President Trump warned Iran about not signing a deal. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged from an intraday high of $106,513 on Friday as markets turned bearish. It fell to a low of $102,446 before settling at $103,388, ultimately registering a drop of 1.19%. BTC is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $103,495. Semler Scientific Discloses Ambitious Bitcoin Strategy Healthcare technology firm Semler Scientific has announced an ambitious Bitcoin accumulation plan to expand its Bitcoin holdings aggressively. The company also announced the appointment of Joe Burnett as the Director of Bitcoin Strategy. Semler Scientific plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026, and 105,000 by the end of 2027.

Semler Scientific was optimistic about Burnett‚Äôs appointment as its Director of Bitcoin Strategy, stating, ‚ÄúWe are excited to have Joe join our Bitcoin strategy team and help drive our three-year plan to own 105,000 bitcoins. Joe is an analytical thought leader on Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies. His expertise will be instrumental as we pursue our bitcoin treasury strategy and aim to deliver long-term value to our stockholders.‚Äù Worries About A Post-Trump Bitcoin Eric Semler, the chairman of healthcare firm Semler Scientific Inc., has revealed that many hedge fund executives are skeptical and worried about Bitcoin‚Äôs prospects once President Trump leaves office. Semler stated in an interview with Natalie Brunell, ‚ÄúI think that they think it is a fly-by-night concept and that it is probably going to, after the Trump administration, go back down a lot.‚Äù Semler, also the founder of TCS Capital Management, made the comments amid growing skepticism within the crypto industry about how long the support for crypto will last once President Trump exits office. Some prominent figures, like Jan3 founder Samson Mow, are concerned that support for crypto could vanish under a future president. However, Semler has doubled down on Bitcoin , with Semler Scientific becoming the second publicly traded company in the US to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company has announced an aggressive Bitcoin acquisition plan to take its holdings to 105,000 BTC . ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre making a bet on something that the majority doesn‚Äôt believe in, and you‚Äôre right, you make so much more money. I think we got great opportunities to show people that basically they‚Äôre missing out on a great opportunity.‚Äù Hedge Funds Turning To Bitcoin A survey by the Alternative Investment Management Association and PwC in October 2024 revealed that 47% of hedge fund managers are exposed to crypto. This is up from 29% in 2023. Meanwhile, 37% of the respondents said they had no exposure to crypto in 2022. In 2021, Intertrust surveyed chief financial officers from 100 hedge funds about plans to purchase crypto assets, including Bitcoin. 98% of them responded that they expect hedge funds to invest at least 7% of their assets in crypto by 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered an alarming slump on Friday as market sentiment worsened thanks to escalating geopolitical tensions. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency dropped from an intraday high of $106,513 to $102,446 before reclaiming $103,000 and settling at $103,388. Markets have been under tremendous pressure thanks to macroeconomic factors and geopolitical uncertainty. This led to the crypto market falling nearly 1.50% on June 21, wiping out $240 billion in value. One of the biggest triggers for BTC and the crypto market‚Äôs decline is the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Investors and market watchers are worried about the US getting involved in the conflict after President Trump adopted a hardline stance and issued a veiled threat to Iran‚Äôs supreme leader. Trump has also warned Iran over not signing a deal when it had the opportunity. Bitcoin whales are also selling their holdings as they lock their profits, putting more pressure on the price. According to data from Glassnode, wallets that held BTC for 6-12 months sold over $900 million of the asset in recent weeks as they began cashing out. Long-term Bitcoin holders took home $1.2 billion in profits in early June. Liquidations have also put pressure on the price, as many traders using leverage were wiped out thanks to BTC‚Äôs recent price action. Over the past 24 hours, over $500 million in crypto positions were liquidated, affecting over 134,000 traders. BTC started the previous week in positive territory, surging over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,247. The price fell to an intraday low of $108,325 on Tuesday before recovering to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,258. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.43% to $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price plunged nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. BTC fell to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday as selling pressure persisted. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Source: TradingView Sellers regained control on Saturday as BTC fell 0.59% to $105,482 before registering a marginal increase on Sunday and settling at $105,561. BTC started the week on a bullish note, surging to an intraday high of $108,939 before settling at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of $106,808. Price action turned negative on Tuesday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,519. The flagship cryptocurrency faced volatility on Wednesday but registered a marginal increase and moved to $104,884. It was back in the red on Thursday, dropping 0.24% to $104,631. BTC raced to an intraday high of $106,513 but lost momentum after reaching this level, eventually falling below the 20-day SMA and settling at $103,388. The current session sees the price marginally up, trading around $103,781. Buyers will look to maintain control and push BTC beyond $105,000.

His message is simple yet powerful: ‚ÄúPrivate keys should never be accessible via the web.‚Äù This declaration, now widely circulating on social media, is prompting fresh scrutiny of how digital assets like XRP are stored and secured. Private Keys and Internet Exposure: A Dangerous Combination Vincent‚Äôs core message revolves around a fundamental truth in cryptographic security: if your private key is exposed to the internet, even momentarily, it is at risk. He warns that merely copying, storing, or transmitting a private key on a connected device can compromise its integrity. ‚ÄúIf your key is sent, copied, or stored, even on your PC, it is at risk,‚Äù he wrote in a recent post on X. This warning isn‚Äôt theoretical. In recent years, crypto users across various networks have suffered devastating losses due to key leaks, clipboard hijackers, browser vulnerabilities, and malware. Many believed their keys were safe simply because they used reputable wallet software or hardware devices. Repeat after me: PRIVATE KEYS SHOULD NEVER BE ACCESSIBLE VIA THE WEB. If your key is sent, copied or stored, even on your PC, it is at risk. Only air gapped devices are bulletproof and can only be hacked physically. Even Ledger, etc while they claim your private keys‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) June 30, 2025 Questioning Hardware Wallet Claims While hardware wallets like Ledger, Trezor, and others are commonly touted as the gold standard for crypto storage, Vincent challenges the blanket trust users place in them. He points out that while Ledger and similar companies claim that private keys never leave the device, users must take this on faith. ‚ÄúThere is no 100% proof that your private keys aren‚Äôt sent,‚Äù Vincent remarked, fueling ongoing debate about transparency and auditability in the hardware wallet industry. Although no verified breach of Ledger‚Äôs key storage has been made public, the absence of open-source firmware and third-party audits leaves room for doubt, especially among those prioritizing maximum security. The Air-Gapped Alternative In contrast, Vincent strongly advocates for air-gapped devices‚Äîsystems that are completely isolated from any internet or network connection. ‚ÄúOnly air-gapped devices are bulletproof and can only be hacked physically,‚Äù he asserted, highlighting them as the only truly secure method for private key management. Air-gapped wallets, often used by institutions or high-net-worth individuals, involve signing transactions offline and broadcasting them separately through QR codes or USB transfers. This ensures the private key never interacts with a connected system, dramatically reducing the attack surface.

Rethinking Convenience in Crypto Security Vincent‚Äôs warning comes at a critical time, as the use of mobile wallets, browser extensions, and web-based exchanges continues to grow. These platforms prioritize user convenience but often sacrifice key security in the process. His message strikes at the heart of a broader tension in the crypto world: control versus convenience. Self-custody requires discipline, technical awareness, and a willingness to adopt best practices that may feel cumbersome, but the alternative can be catastrophic. As Vincent Van Code‚Äôs comments continue to gain traction, they serve as a vital reminder that in crypto, security isn‚Äôt a setting‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifestyle. For XRP holders, this may be the wake-up call needed to re-evaluate where, how, and with what confidence their private keys are truly secured.

47105125,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=757772,1751292027,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47105125.jpeg,China‚Äôs factory activity slips below growth threshold for a third month in June,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-economy-remains-vulnerable/,"Official figures showed that China‚Äôs manufacturing activity shrank in June for a third month. Policymakers are now pressured to increase local demand amid a rather fragile trade deal with the US. The PMI index was at 49.7 in the month of June, up slightly from May‚Äôs figures (49.5), yet it still stayed lower than the 50 threshold that marks expansion, based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics. China‚Äôs manufacturing PMIs first slipped into negative territory in April, after an intensifying trade dispute with the United States resulted in tariffs on some goods to increase up to 145%. While the two sides agreed last week to roll back some of those levies, the 2nd-largest economy in the world still faces an unclear trade outlook, even as it works to bolster consumer spending amid a cooling property market and growing deflation risks. China‚Äôs economy extends slump Consumer price growth has eased for four straight months through May. ‚ÄúThe bigger reflection is domestic demand,‚Äù Dan Wang from the Eurasia Group said. Dan further added, ‚ÄúDeflation in China is deepening, the price war across sectors is intensifying.‚Äù Chinese exports to the United States in May tumbled by the greatest margin since the beginning of COVID-19, although overall exports had risen. The PMI‚Äôs export orders index stayed at 47.7 in the month of June, in contraction but well above April‚Äôs low, when it fell to its weakest point since the end of 2022. ‚ÄúExport orders are likely reflecting a rebound in US demand after the US-China trade truce,‚Äù said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics. A pause of 90 days on US tariffs covering a dozen other trading partners will be expiring next Wednesday. China‚Äôs retail sales also moved to the upside in May, NBS figures showed. However, worries over household spending persist, giving rise to talk of further stimulus. Officials cut interest rates over and over again, and took steps to shore up confidence in the housing market, where home prices continue to fall and recovery signs weakened. ‚ÄúPolicymakers [are likely to wait] and monitor the development of [the] trade war,‚Äù said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, pointing to some export improvements. ‚ÄúDeflationary pressure is persistent and the labor market is under stress.‚Äù Beyond factories, the non-manufacturing PMI in June‚Äîwhich covers services and construction‚Äîrose to 50.5 from 50.3 in May. The construction PMI climbed to 52.8 and composite PMI for both services and manufacturing was at 50.7. Rare earth export controls are impacting additional products Export limits and controls in China are now rippling beyond magnets and rare-earths , officially named by officials, threatening wider supply-chain snags and casting doubt on US assertions that the recent trade truce had cleared shipment backlogs. In April, Chinese authorities began asking for export licenses of 7 rare-earth metals along with magnet materials related to those metals in a tit-for-tat move responding to US tariffs. On June 10, the United States mentioned that it secured an agreement with China to speed up the shipments of rare earths, resulting in the revival of a 3-month trade deal reached in Geneva. Yet Chinese commerce, along with customs officials, are demanding extra inspections along with third-party testing of chemicals on products not listed originally in the controls list, according to managers at companies in China and the West. Another Chinese firm‚Äôs representatives mentioned that the company got ‚Äúheavily affected‚Äù and logistics companies have been ‚Äúrefusing to handle magnets.‚Äù That firm supplies customers in varied fields, including industrial filtration, food, electronic parts, magnetic separators, and apparel. Beijing has also widened controls on various strategic materials in the last 2 years, vital for chip production, in response to the US limits. These include germanium, graphite, tungsten, gallium, and antimony. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

47104973,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=173455,1751292032,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Lava Network Unleashes Powerful Blockchain Infrastructure for Fireblocks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lava-network-fireblocks-rpc/,"BitcoinWorld Lava Network Unleashes Powerful Blockchain Infrastructure for Fireblocks In the rapidly evolving world of Web3, seamless and secure access to blockchain data is not just a convenience, it‚Äôs a necessity. For institutions navigating this complex landscape, reliable infrastructure is the bedrock of success. This is precisely why the recent collaboration between Lava Network , a trailblazer in modular blockchain infrastructure, and Fireblocks, a leading crypto infrastructure firm, marks a significant milestone. This partnership is set to redefine how over 2,000 institutional clients interact with the decentralized web, promising an unprecedented level of efficiency and security. What is the Lava Network and its Smart Router? At its core, Lava Network is building the foundational layer for Web3, a decentralized network of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services. Think of RPC as the internet‚Äôs phone lines for blockchain data ‚Äì it‚Äôs how applications request and receive information from blockchains. Without robust RPC, decentralized applications (dApps), wallets, and institutional platforms simply cannot function effectively. Lava Network addresses this critical need by developing a modular blockchain infrastructure designed for high-performance and reliability. Their flagship offering, the Smart Router, is not just another RPC endpoint. It‚Äôs an intelligent gateway that provides secure, vendor-agnostic access to a vast array of blockchain networks. This means that instead of relying on a single RPC provider, which can be prone to bottlenecks or outages, institutions can now tap into a dynamic, optimized network of RPC services across more than 100 different blockchains. This level of flexibility and resilience is paramount for anyone operating at an institutional scale in the crypto space. Why is this Partnership a Game-Changer for Fireblocks ? Fireblocks has established itself as a cornerstone of crypto infrastructure, serving over 2,000 institutional customers, including exchanges, lending desks, hedge funds, and payment processors. These institutions demand the highest standards of security, reliability, and performance for their digital asset operations. The integration of Lava Network‚Äôs Smart Router directly into Fireblocks‚Äô existing infrastructure is a strategic move that significantly enhances their service offering. For Fireblocks‚Äô institutional clientele, this partnership translates into several immediate and profound benefits: Enhanced Reliability: By leveraging Lava‚Äôs multi-chain, multi-provider RPC network, Fireblocks can ensure more consistent and resilient access to blockchain data, minimizing downtime and improving operational continuity. Optimized Performance: The Smart Router intelligently routes requests to the fastest and most reliable RPC endpoints available, reducing latency and accelerating transaction processing and data retrieval. Expanded Blockchain Coverage: With access to over 100 blockchains, Fireblocks‚Äô clients gain broader interoperability and the ability to seamlessly interact with a wider range of decentralized applications and protocols. Vendor Agnosticism: This eliminates reliance on a single RPC provider, mitigating risks associated with vendor lock-in or service disruptions from a sole source. In essence, this collaboration empowers Fireblocks to provide its customers with an even more robust and future-proof platform for managing their digital assets and engaging with the decentralized economy. The Role of the Smart Router in Next-Gen RPC Access The Smart Router is the unsung hero of this integration. It‚Äôs not just about connecting to more blockchains; it‚Äôs about connecting smarter . Imagine a global positioning system (GPS) for blockchain data. Just as a GPS identifies the fastest route to your destination, the Smart Router identifies the optimal path for your RPC requests. Here‚Äôs how Lava‚Äôs Smart Router revolutionizes RPC access: Feature Traditional RPC Access Lava Network‚Äôs Smart Router Provider Reliance Typically reliant on a single or limited set of RPC providers. Vendor-agnostic access to a vast network of decentralized RPC providers. Performance Optimization Performance dependent on the chosen provider‚Äôs infrastructure. Intelligent routing to the fastest, most reliable endpoint in real-time. Blockchain Coverage Limited to the blockchains supported by the specific provider. Access to 100+ blockchains, expanding continuously. Reliability & Uptime Vulnerable to single points of failure; potential for downtime. High availability through automatic failover and load balancing across multiple providers. This intelligent routing mechanism is crucial for institutions that require uninterrupted, high-speed access to blockchain data for trading, portfolio management, compliance, and other critical operations. Elevating Blockchain Infrastructure : Benefits and Beyond The partnership between Lava Network and Fireblocks is more than just an integration; it‚Äôs a significant step forward in the evolution of core blockchain infrastructure . This collaboration sets a new standard for how institutional players can securely and efficiently interact with the decentralized world. The benefits extend far beyond just faster data access: Enhanced Security Posture: By diversifying RPC access, institutions reduce their attack surface and reliance on single points of failure, bolstering their overall security framework. Future-Proofing Operations: As the blockchain ecosystem continues to expand with new networks and protocols, Lava Network‚Äôs modular and extensible architecture ensures that Fireblocks‚Äô clients will always have access to the latest chains without significant re-engineering. Scalability for Growth: Institutional adoption of digital assets is accelerating. This robust infrastructure ensures that Fireblocks can scale its services to meet the growing demands of its expanding client base, handling higher volumes of data requests seamlessly. Cost Efficiency: While not immediately apparent, optimized RPC access can lead to long-term cost savings by reducing operational overhead associated with managing multiple RPC subscriptions or dealing with performance bottlenecks. This move solidifies Fireblocks‚Äô position as a leader in institutional crypto infrastructure, providing a competitive edge in a rapidly maturing market. Understanding RPC : The Backbone of Decentralized Applications For those less familiar with the technical underpinnings of Web3, understanding RPC is crucial. RPC, or Remote Procedure Call, is a protocol that allows a program on one computer to execute code on another computer without the programmer explicitly coding the remote interaction. In the context of blockchains, RPC nodes are the gateways through which applications communicate with the blockchain network. When your crypto wallet displays your balance, or a dApp processes a transaction, it‚Äôs making an RPC call to a node to fetch or submit information. The challenges with traditional RPC access include: Centralization Risks: Many dApps and services rely on a few large, centralized RPC providers, creating single points of failure and potential censorship risks. Performance Issues: Overloaded or geographically distant nodes can lead to high latency, slow transaction confirmations, and a poor user experience. Limited Coverage: Not all RPC providers support every blockchain, forcing developers to manage multiple subscriptions and integrations. Reliability Concerns: Individual nodes or providers can experience downtime, impacting the functionality of dependent applications. Lava Network‚Äôs decentralized network of RPC providers, orchestrated by its Smart Router, directly tackles these challenges, offering a more resilient, performant, and decentralized alternative that is essential for the continued growth and stability of the Web3 ecosystem. Challenges and Solutions in Blockchain Connectivity While the promise of Web3 is vast, the underlying infrastructure presents unique challenges. The sheer number of blockchains, the varying standards, and the need for constant, low-latency access create a complex environment. Institutions, in particular, cannot afford outages or slow data. They require enterprise-grade solutions that offer not just connectivity, but intelligent, resilient connectivity. Lava Network‚Äôs approach with the Smart Router provides a powerful solution to these challenges by: Abstracting Complexity: Developers and institutions no longer need to worry about managing individual RPC connections for dozens of chains. The Smart Router handles the routing and optimization automatically. Ensuring Redundancy: By tapping into a network of providers, if one node or provider goes down, the Smart Router seamlessly switches to another, ensuring continuous service. Promoting Decentralization: While serving institutional needs, Lava Network‚Äôs model fosters a more decentralized RPC layer, aligning with the core ethos of Web3. Actionable Insights for Institutions For financial institutions, exchanges, and enterprises already operating or looking to enter the digital asset space, this partnership offers a clear pathway to enhanced operational efficiency and security. Here are some actionable insights: Evaluate Your Current RPC Strategy: Assess your existing blockchain data access points. Are you overly reliant on a single provider? Are you experiencing latency issues or occasional outages? Prioritize Resilient Infrastructure: Understand that robust RPC is not a luxury but a necessity. Solutions like Lava Network‚Äôs Smart Router, integrated into platforms like Fireblocks, offer the resilience required for mission-critical operations. Embrace Multi-Chain Capabilities: The future of Web3 is multi-chain. Ensure your infrastructure can seamlessly interact with a wide array of networks to capitalize on emerging opportunities across different ecosystems. Focus on Security and Compliance: Leverage partners like Fireblocks, who are committed to integrating advanced infrastructure solutions that meet the stringent security and compliance requirements of institutional finance. Conclusion The collaboration between Lava Network and Fireblocks represents a significant leap forward in solidifying the foundational infrastructure of the decentralized economy. By integrating Lava‚Äôs cutting-edge Smart Router, Fireblocks is not just enhancing its existing services; it‚Äôs empowering its vast network of institutional clients with secure, high-performance, and vendor-agnostic access to the burgeoning world of blockchain data. This partnership underscores a critical trend: as Web3 matures, the demand for robust, scalable, and intelligent infrastructure solutions will only intensify.

While investors are eagerly waiting for a major rally to begin, especially for altcoins, CryptoQuant analyst said that investors are selling Ethereum (ETH) and buying Bitcoin (BTC). Investors Are Selling Ethereum and Buying Bitcoin! In his latest blog post discussing the behavior of retail investors, CyptoQuant analyst Amr Taha explained that the latest data shows that retail investors are actively buying Bitcoin, while the selling pressure on Ethereum continues. CryptoQuant analyst noted that Ethereum inflows to Binance have been continuing for five days, indicating that this is a signal of temporary selling pressure for ETH. In response to the selling pressure in ETH, active purchases are seen by retail investors in the Bitcoin market. Although purchases in BTC have increased, the analyst argued that these purchases are made by short-term investors, which could indicate a potential peak for BTC. ‚ÄúThe realized market value of short-term Bitcoin investors (STH) has increased from -$4.9 billion to over $5 billion. This change generally reflects aggressive Bitcoin accumulation by retail traders. Historically, aggressive buying by short-term investors is most prevalent near market tops, as retail investors tend to get caught up in FOMO during Bitcoin rallies, making them more likely to buy near potential market tops.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

The presale also included a live staking program with a 30 percent annual percentage yield (APY) that was appealing to the early holders to help the network grow and stabilize with a fixed total supply of 58 million tokens. Unrivaled Performance Fuels Kaanch‚Äôs Appeal Kaanch Network stands out because of its technical features in the industry, such as a 1.4 million transactions per second and a transaction finality time of 0.8 seconds. These attributes allow you to execute a trade and operate smart contracts instantly and efficiently. Moreover, the platform is very affordable to decentralized applications, micro-transactions, and payments due to near-zero gas fees. The network is composed of 3,600 decentralized nodes that are audited by SpyWolf and VerifyLab to make it more transparent and robust. Community Governance and Enterprise Integration In addition to technical expertise, Kaanch focuses on a community-based governance system that allows the token holders to participate in protocol governance through an open staking dashboard. The system architecture of the blockchain makes it easy to integrate with development and businesses to enable the tokenization of real-world assets and make transactions secure. This puts Kaanch as a scalable and enterprise-friendly platform that can be adopted by people in large numbers. Anticipating Market Impact Post-Listing The fixed listing price of around 30 on BitMart, LBank, and XT.com is also high as compared to the presale price, which implies that there is a chance of high price increase at its launch. This is similar to what occurred in the exchange listing pump of MATIC where access and good fundamentals came together to fuel market excitement. The presale investors, who joined the project at $0.64, will enjoy this bullish trend, which is backed by Kaanch strong infrastructure and expanding ecosystem.

This upside coincides with an optimistic upgrade to Ethereum‚Äôs validator architecture. This is aimed at enhancing both security and decentralization, and to address ETH-staking problems by an ‚Äúactive-active‚Äù architecture. A key player in this transformation is Obol Labs, the upgrade would allow Ethereum validators to function across multiple operators and machines. That said, in the short term, as bullish sentiment grows, many analysts are making optimistic predictions for ETH more than ever. Notably, one of the prominent crypto analysts, Crypto Patel, recently suggested a breakout could propel Ethereum above $6,000. However, amidst this renewed optimism, some whales are offloading their ETH on exchanges like HTX, ByBit, and OKX. Additionally, bears are increasing their positions against ETH, reaching all-time highs on the CME. This current landscape presents a potential opportunity for a short squeeze, especially if these short positions face significant liquidation. Why A Short Squeeze Could Pump Ethereum Price To $5K According to Lookonchain data, a significant whale has been offloading ETH recently. Wallets 0x14e4 and 0x26Bb, likely belonging to the same entity, have unstaked and withdrawn a staggering 95,920 ETH, valued at approximately $237 million. A massive whale has been dumping $ETH recently! Wallets 0x14e4 and 0x26Bb (probably belong to the same whale) unstaked and withdrew 95,920 $ETH ($237M).

This activity clearly indicates that bear do not want ETH price to pump. However, amidst this bearish trend, the sentiment has shifted from pessimism to opportunistic. As an analyst has pointed out a potential short-squeeze situation, suggesting that the current market dynamics could favor a price rebound. He noted that Ethereum shorts on the CME have reached an all-time high, with bears attempting to halt ETH‚Äôs upward momentum. It seems that the pressure on Ethereum is being artificially intensified. Yet, the recent positive price action suggests that the market may be ready to turn the tables on these short positions. Bears are stacking up positions AGAINST $ETH just now that it started holding up better. The hate on Ethereum is just forced As usual, the market likes to screw the majority over.

The Longer It Coils, the Longer The ETH Price WIll Breakout The daily chart reveals that Ethereum‚Äôs price is hovering at a crucial juncture, near key EMA bands, including the 200-day, 50-day, and 20-day EMAs. While the price action on the daily chart clearly indicates two months characterized by range-bound movement. However, the longer this consolidation persists, the greater the potential of a significant breakout to come in ETH crypto. While technical metrics remain neutral, the MACD has recently turned bullish, forming a golden cross. As a result, the chances are much higher that the price surge seen in Q2 will continue, supported by a continuation pattern in play.

This analysis delves into the contrasting performances of these two prominent cryptocurrencies. Discover the reasons behind Solana's success and Cardano's challenges. Uncover which coins show promise for future growth and what lies ahead in the ever-evolving crypto market. Solana Price Action and Key Levels in a Dynamic Market Solana exhibited a month change of -2.68% and over the last six months it dropped by -19.51%. In the past week, the coin gained 15.59%, reflecting mixed performance that highlights short-term strength amid longer-term challenges. Price movements over these periods reveal varying market sentiment and an oscillating trend, which has kept traders alert to the need for cautious positioning. Solana currently trades in a range between $136 and $182.20, with the nearest resistance level at approximately $207.90 and a higher barrier around $253.93. The nearest support is positioned near $115.84, while a secondary support exists at $69.81. Technical indicators show a mixed picture. The awesome oscillator reading at -3.738 suggests some short-term weakness, while the momentum indicator at 12.14 points to potential price surges. The relative strength index of 52.75 indicates a balanced condition, leaving the market without a dominating force. Current price action does not establish a clear trend, prompting traders to watch key levels for potential breakouts or reversals. Cardano Price Dynamics: Recent Gains Amid Prolonged Downturn Cardano experienced a modest 5.72% weekly gain while enduring a 16.96% drop over the past month and a 32.11% decline within the last six months. The coin's movement reveals a history of short rallies against sustained downward pressure. Price swings have been notable within its trading range, indicating that while temporary recoveries occur, broader bearish trends persist over longer periods. Current trading sees Cardano priced between $0.5966 and $0.8186, with key levels marking its progress. The nearest support sits at $0.51, offering potential for short-term buying. A more critical support around $0.29 may come into focus if prices break lower. Resistance is at $0.95, with a second level at $1.17 that could cap upward moves. Indicators suggest that bears currently hold the advantage. Trading within these levels may offer buying opportunities near support, although caution is advised if further weakness appears. Conclusion In Q2 2025, Solana (SOL) experienced significant growth, capturing market attention and driving up its value. In contrast, Cardano (ADA) saw minimal movement and struggled to keep investor interest. The comparative performance highlights Solana's ability to innovate and attract development, while Cardano faced challenges in sustaining momentum. The contrasting trajectories of these coins underscore the dynamic nature of the market and the varying factors influencing success and stagnation.

What's Fueling XRP‚Äôs Dominance in South Korea? Whale Accumulation & Reserve Shuffling Whale Alert reported a 30‚ÄØmillion‚ÄØXRP ($95.5‚ÄØM) transfer from Upbit to an unknown wallet ‚Äî potentially a large investor moving tokens off-exchange for long-term holding, or routine hot/cold wallet management by Upbit itself. Upbit Holds the Majority of XRP Reserves Upbit now holds approximately twice the XRP reserves of Binance and accounts for roughly 14‚Äì17% of global XRP volume. Recent spikes saw XRP/KRW trades making up nearly 18% of Upbit‚Äôs total volume. ‚ÄúKimchi Premium‚Äù and Local Demand South Korean crypto often trades at a premium due to capital controls and local demand shortages. This price gap ‚Äî the so‚Äëcalled ‚ÄúKimchi Premium‚Äù ‚Äî makes XRP attractive locally. Real-World Utility in Remittances South Korea‚Äôs domestic apps, such as Toss and KakaoPay, are efficient, but international transfers remain slow and costly. XRP & Ripple's cross-border solutions like Coinone‚Äôs Cross are filling this gap. A Unique Safe-Haven Asset Many Korean traders view XRP as an alternative to traditional finance, especially during political or banking stress. A recent analysis noted XRP‚Äôs trading volume surpassed Bitcoin by threefold during domestic turmoil. XRP Eyes a Breakout to $2.40 As XRP continues to call the shots in South Korea, the 4th-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization is gearing up for a bullish run to $2.40. Market analyst Lingrid pointed out , ‚ÄúXRP has rebounded off the support line after a sharp dip, reclaiming key territory above $2.10 and pressing against a descending trendline. Price action is tightening within a symmetrical triangle as bulls test breakout pressure. Sustained movement above $2.20 may confirm an upside breakout toward the $2.35‚Äì$2.40 region.‚Äù At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $2.18, illustrating that it‚Äôs just a stone‚Äôs throw away from the major resistance zone of $2.20. Therefore, time will tell how XRP shapes up in the short term. Why XRP's Adoption Is Skyrocketing with Over 7.1 Million Wallets Recorded XRP is witnessing a sharp surge in adoption, as evidenced by the growing number of wallets now surpassing 7.1 million. This milestone underscores increasing investor confidence, growing real-world utility, and a shift in institutional sentiment toward Ripple‚Äôs digital asset. A key driver behind this rapid adoption is XRP‚Äôs speed and cost-efficiency. With transaction times as low as 3-5 seconds and minimal fees, XRP has positioned itself as an ideal asset for cross-border payments. Financial institutions and remittance services globally are turning to RippleNet, Ripple‚Äôs payment network, which leverages XRP for on-demand liquidity (ODL). This infrastructure enables near-instant settlement without the need for pre-funded accounts, drastically reducing capital requirements for banks. Legal clarity in the United States has further accelerated XRP adoption. After a prolonged legal battle, a U.S. court ruled in 2023 that XRP is not a security when sold on exchanges This emerged as a landmark decision that unlocked new institutional partnerships and retail investor confidence. Exchanges that had previously delisted XRP began relisting it, fueling liquidity and market activity. Additionally, XRP‚Äôs integration into mainstream financial services and its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) have expanded its utility. Developers are actively building smart contracts and tokenized asset systems on the XRP Ledger using Hooks and sidechains. These innovations are attracting a new wave of builders and users to the ecosystem. The increase in XRP wallets also reflects broader global interest, particularly in regions like South Korea, where trading volume has spiked on platforms like Upbit. Retail interest is surging, with investors increasingly viewing XRP as a long-term digital asset rather than a speculative trade. Moreover, Ripple‚Äôs ongoing partnerships with central banks to explore CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) issuance using the XRP Ledger have helped legitimize its use case on a global scale. This blend of institutional use, technological advancement, and regulatory progress is creating a perfect storm for adoption. As the crypto landscape matures, XRP stands out for its utility-driven growth. The jump to over 7.1 million wallets is not just a number, it‚Äôs a reflection of a network gaining real traction across finance, remittances, and DeFi. With legal hurdles mostly behind it and global demand rising, such as swirling rumours of Amazon considering XRP payment s, XRP‚Äôs adoption curve may just be getting started. Conclusion The $95‚ÄØmillion daily volume is not just another large trade, it‚Äôs a symbol of XRP's deepening integration into South Korea‚Äôs financial and crypto infrastructure. Furthermore, XRP exploding wallets to the tune of more than 7.1 million show that the altcoin‚Äôs adoption rate continues to gain steam. These bullish on-chain metrics show that XRP might be gearing up for a 2.40 breakout.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|EXCHANGE|ASIA|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-30 14:10:15

Peersyst Technology has announced that the long-awaited XRPL EVM Sidechain is now live on mainnet, marking a major leap forward in functionality, interoperability, and developer potential. This achievement follows more than three years of collaborative development with RippleX and brings Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility directly to the XRPL ecosystem. A Seamless Bridge Between XRP and Ethereum The XRPL EVM Sidechain integrates full support for Ethereum-based smart contracts, allowing developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) using familiar tools like MetaMask, Remix, and Truffle. Unlike Ethereum‚Äôs often congested and expensive environment, the XRPL EVM Sidechain offers faster finality, under four seconds, and extremely low transaction fees, making it an efficient alternative for developers. Underpinned by Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus and built with the Cosmos SDK and evmOS, the sidechain brings XRPL‚Äôs speed and scalability to the broader Web3 space. It enables the use of native XRP (wrapped as eXRP) as the gas token, linking XRP directly to EVM-compatible applications for the first time. It's TIME! We are proud to announce that the XRPL EVM Sidechain is now live on Mainnet! After 3+ years of research and development with @Ripple , the network is live providing native #XRP with unlimited new capacities to flow across the entire web3, deploy and interact‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/ckoplQbnMK ‚Äî Peersyst Technology (@Peersyst) June 30, 2025 Interoperability Achieved: Axelar Bridge Goes Live Coinciding with the launch of the sidechain is the activation of the Axelar bridge, the exclusive connection between the XRPL mainnet and its EVM counterpart. This bridge unlocks seamless, one-to-one asset transfers across more than 55 supported blockchains. Axelar‚Äôs decentralized infrastructure, powered by a network of 75 validators and enhanced by automatic key rotation, ensures high security and reliability. The decision to use a unified bridge infrastructure, rather than the earlier dual-layered XLS‚Äë38 approach, simplifies the development process while improving user experience. Peersyst has praised Axelar‚Äôs readiness and robust performance as a critical factor in the success of this launch. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Thriving Developer Ecosystem Developer interest is already strong. During the testnet phase, the XRPL EVM Sidechain handled over 280,000 transactions per day, with participation from 87 different teams, including many building on XRP for the first time. Peersyst hailed the testnet activity as ‚Äúthe biggest onboarding in XRP history.‚Äù Now live, the sidechain invites developers to deploy their protocols, list XRP, and expand the XRP Ledger‚Äôs presence across DeFi, NFTs, and real-world asset (RWA) sectors. As Peersyst emphasized, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs TIME!‚Äù‚ÄîDay One marks the beginning of steady integration by wallets, infrastructure providers, and dApps. Looking Ahead This launch sets the stage for future enhancements to the XRP Ledger, including Smart Escrows and native Extensions, expected to enter devnet testing later in 2025. While the XLS-38 proposal remains under review, Ripple has signaled it will wait for clear developer demand before supporting mainnet integration. With EVM compatibility, fast execution, low fees, and secure cross-chain interoperability now live, the XRPL EVM Sidechain establishes XRP as a key player in the multi-chain future of Web3. As Peersyst and its partners have made clear, this is only the beginning. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

But the real story isn‚Äôt just the size of its hoard, it‚Äôs the Russell Top 200 Value Index inclusion, marking perhaps the clearest sign yet that Wall Street views Bitcoin as a legitimate value asset. On June 30, Strategy announced the acquisition of 4,980 new Bitcoin ( BTC ) for approximately $531.9 million, paying an average of $106,801 per BTC. The purchase, executed as Bitcoin traded near all-time highs, brings the company‚Äôs total holdings to 597,325 BTC. Strategy‚Äôs Bitcoin treasury is worth roughly $42.4 billion at an average cost basis of $70,982 per coin, or $64.2 billion at the current price of $107,732 per BTC, according to crypto.news data. The move extends Strategy‚Äôs unbroken streak of aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions since August 2020, reinforcing its thesis that BTC serves as a superior treasury reserve asset. Year-to-date, the company‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings have generated a 19.7% yield, outpacing traditional equity benchmarks. Strategy has acquired 4,980 BTC for ~$531.9 million at ~$106,801 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 19.7% YTD 2025.

The inclusion is a watershed moment for Bitcoin‚Äôs maturation as an institutional asset, placing a company holding 597,325 BTC alongside blue-chip value stocks like Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, and ExxonMobil. The juxtaposition is jarring but telling. While these companies generate cash flows from tangible assets or services, Strategy‚Äôs value proposition hinges on a digital asset with no earnings, suggesting that in an era of fiscal uncertainty, Bitcoin‚Äôs programmatic scarcity is being priced like a hard asset. The index‚Äôs methodology, which prioritizes low P/E ratios and book value, makes Strategy‚Äôs inclusion even more striking. The company‚Äôs 19.7% BTC yield in 2025 likely offset concerns about its lack of conventional value metrics, signaling that scarcity itself is becoming a measurable financial primitive. The inclusion is also a litmus test for how Wall Street now views crypto-native treasury models. For years, critics dismissed corporate BTC treasuries as gimmicks. Now, with a 19.7% YTD yield and a seat at the value investing table, the argument is shifting. The question is no longer whether Bitcoin belongs on a balance sheet‚Äîbut how many will follow Strategy‚Äôs lead.

This marks a significant jump from the $3.8 billion recorded at the start of the year. The surge in TVL is a sign that demand for Spark‚Äôs yield-bearing products is rising. Its savings TVL has crossed the $3 billion milestone, while the 30-day average savings rate has moved up to 4.5%. Demand for Spark‚Äôs lending solution is also rising, with total value locked nearing $3.5 billion. This mirrors the growth of other lending protocols like Aave and Maple Finance.

For example, Spark‚Äôs fully diluted valuation is still smaller than Pendle‚Äôs ( PENDLE ) $1 billion, despite Pendle having a smaller TVL of $5 billion. It is also smaller than JustLend‚Äôs $336 million valuation, even though Spark‚Äôs TVL is significantly higher at $3.6 billion. A potential reason for the recent SPK price plunge following its Ignition airdrop is the token‚Äôs supply dynamics. While its circulating supply stands at 894 million, the total supply is capped at 1 billion, suggesting substantial future unlocks that could lead to dilution. Spark price technical analysis SPK price chart | Source: crypto.news The hourly chart shows that SPK crashed and bottomed at $0.035 after its airdrop. It has since bounced back by over 25% and moved slightly above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. The token has also formed a bullish W pattern, with the neckline sitting at the 50% retracement level of $0.050. Additionally, it has moved above the 50-period moving average. Therefore, the Spark Protocol price will likely see a strong bullish breakout, with the initial target set at the 50% retracement point around $0.051.

47105568,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-coinbase-named-among-times-100-most-influential-companies,1751292864,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/47105568.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy Now as Coinbase Named Among TIME‚Äôs 100 Most Influential Companies,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-coinbase-named-among-times-100-most-influential-companies,"Crypto adoption has steadily been accelerating across the globe, but in recent months, the narrative as a whole has gained traction. Demand is no longer speculative. The most telling sign yet came this week, when Coinbase earned a spot on TIME Magazine‚Äôs list of the 100 Most Influential Companies in the world. For a platform that once symbolized crypto‚Äôs outsider status, this marks a sharp evolution. While Coinbase‚Äôs size and presence may have made this inclusion inevitable, what truly matters is that it is among the first blockchain firms to receive such mainstream validation. This moment is not just about one company. It is a signal that crypto itself is being recognized as a serious, consequential asset class. And that makes this a critical time to invest. Why This Recognition Is Big For Crypto Crypto‚Äôs journey from misunderstood internet money to mainstream relevance has been anything but subtle, but recent months have accelerated the transition faster than anyone expected. Demand has been rising globally, with adoption no longer confined to developers and traders. Financial institutions are adapting. Governments are debating frameworks instead of issuing warnings. And now, TIME Magazine has officially recognized Coinbase as one of the 100 Most Influential Companies in the world. This may sound like a logical acknowledgment for a company of Coinbase‚Äôs scale, but it is actually historic. It is the first time a crypto-native platform has entered TIME‚Äôs elite club, marking a wider shift in perception: crypto is not just here to stay, it is becoming foundational.

Its rise in stock price, buoyed by legislation like the GENIUS stablecoin bill, only added to the perception that this company, and by extension, the crypto industry, now has staying power. With a fresh MiCA license in Europe and the establishment of its EU headquarters in Luxembourg, Coinbase has positioned itself as a truly global platform. And it is not just staying within crypto. It is now moving toward tokenized equities and multi-asset offerings, which could turn it into a full-fledged brokerage for the digital age. When the gatekeepers start validating blockchain companies at this level, it signals that the crypto market is not only maturing but also asserting long-term relevance. This is the moment where future blue-chip crypto projects begin to separate from the noise. For investors paying attention, this might be one of the most opportune times to enter. As crypto moves further into the financial mainstream, the next generation of transformative tokens could already be taking shape. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Tokens That Could Be Listed on Coinbase Solaxy Solaxy is not a project that appeared out of nowhere. It has been gradually building momentum through a clear and well-executed plan, and now that the token is live, the market is beginning to respond. The main value of Solaxy lies in its dual-chain infrastructure. By allowing movement across both Ethereum and Solana, it eliminates the kind of compromise developers usually face when trying to build scalable applications with cross-chain access. Solaxy treats that limitation as unnecessary, and so far, the response has been strong. Its early listings on several decentralized exchanges have already pushed it into wider visibility. Unlike many tokens that struggle post-launch, SOLX has maintained strong activity levels. That consistency is helped by a growing number of smaller projects beginning to interact with Solaxy‚Äôs framework, particularly in areas like NFT mints and mid-size DeFi tools. With a market cap of around $72 million, it is currently gearing up for a string of listings across both centralized and decentralized platforms. If this demand holds and usage continues rising, the project may start appearing on larger exchange radars. There is already some discussion among market watchers about its positioning. At a time when the crypto market is being taken more seriously by regulators and institutions, platforms like Solaxy, ones that actually offer usable infrastructure, have a chance to become much more than just trading instruments. They could become the foundations upon which the next set of projects are built. SUBBD SUBBD functions differently from most of what the market has seen this year. It is not built around speculative loops or copy-paste tokenomics. It has been structured with a clear end user in mind: digital creators who want more control over their content, audience, and revenue. The entire system puts ownership first, which is why it is starting to attract attention in places far beyond just crypto circles. Where traditional platforms run on visibility algorithms, SUBBD pushes everything through a direct value mechanism. Whether it is exclusive content, fan engagement, or long-term membership perks, each part of the platform gives creators the tools to set their own terms. There is no need to rely on sponsorship deals or third-party monetization methods. That approach has helped the project stand out in a space where short-term hype often takes priority over actual design. The presale is ongoing, and interest continues to grow. What is notable is how strong the retention has been as users do not just visit and leave. They stay, explore, and contribute to the platform‚Äôs growing ecosystem. That kind of response matters more than numbers on a dashboard. The project has been dubbed a top potential initiative by several creators as well, including popular crypto education channel 99Bitcoins . As SUBBD grows, there is a possibility that it enters conversations around wider adoption. With a distinct use case and real-world relevance, it fits the kind of model that larger platforms sometimes look for. Best Wallet Token There has been no shortage of wallets launched over the past few years, but very few manage to hold attention for long. Best Wallet Token exists to tie an already functioning ecosystem together that is focused on clarity, practicality, and everyday usability. The wallet it powers is straightforward in the best way possible: multi-chain, swap-ready, and designed to work without friction. The token adds real function to that system. It is not just a reward tool. It provides access to discounted features, upgrades, and deeper participation across future expansions. Users are not just holding a coin; they are holding a pass that improves how they interact with the wallet. That kind of direct link between product and token is rare, and it is one of the reasons Best Wallet Token is starting to draw attention. What is also worth noting is how the wallet itself is positioned. It is being marketed as a foundational tool rather than a novelty, and that shows in its interface, documentation, and roadmap. With more people entering crypto through mobile-first and browser-based wallets, this project enters at the right time and with the right priorities. It is still early, but based on current demand, there is a clear possibility it attracts interest beyond just the presale community. As onboarding becomes the next big focus for mainstream platforms, projects that simplify access without compromising on features will likely be the ones that last, and this token is built exactly for that role. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is built on a simple premise: Bitcoin is strong, but it is not yet complete. Despite its unmatched security and value retention, Bitcoin still lacks the transactional flexibility that newer chains offer. That is the gap Bitcoin Hyper aims to close. As a Layer 2 protocol developed specifically for the Bitcoin network, it introduces a faster, lighter framework that enables cheaper transfers, smart contract capabilities, and more dynamic applications without compromising Bitcoin‚Äôs underlying integrity. Unlike Ethereum-based Layer 2s, Bitcoin Hyper is not built to compete with its base layer. It is built to complement it. By using advanced rollup mechanics and sidechain infrastructure, the protocol allows users to engage in everything from DeFi to NFT minting without ever leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem. This extension of utility could reshape how developers and users interact with Bitcoin, not just as a store of value, but as an active network. With over $1.6 million raised at the time of writing, the project‚Äôs set launch time is ideal as well. With major players like Coinbase gaining institutional recognition and expanding into broader crypto services, there is increasing interest in infrastructure-layer projects tied to Bitcoin. If Bitcoin Hyper continues building steadily and gains adoption from developers looking to operate within a Bitcoin-native environment, it could very well become one of the few Layer 2s that captures serious attention post-launch. Conclusion The inclusion of Coinbase in TIME‚Äôs 100 Most Influential Companies is not just a win for one exchange. It is a clear sign that the crypto industry is starting to cross the threshold from speculation to recognition. In times like these, the real opportunities tend to lie with projects that are not only building but building with purpose. Whether through infrastructure, utility, or long-term design, some of the most promising names in the space are already beginning to align with this changing narrative; some examples already featured above. These are the types of initiatives worth paying attention to, especially now, when the next phase of adoption may already be underway.
