In 2029, the coin could be worth between $36.06 and $42.44, an average price of $37.05 In 2031, RPL will range between $74.07 and $89.07. Unlike traditional staking services, Rocket Pool allows users to pool their Ethereum (ETH) to run validator nodes on the Ethereum network. Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of ‚ÄúrETH‚Äù tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users‚Äô stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? Can Rocket Pool‚Äôs price reach $50?

The stolen assets were swiftly sold on-chain and bridged over to Ethereum before some of it was laundered through Tornado Cash . On May 16, the victim‚Äôs Solana addresses were emptied of tokens, and the assets were then converted to Ethereum via a bridge before part of it was deposited to Tornado Cash . Blockchain researcher ZachXBT publicly flagged the exploit , drawing parallels with earlier Lazarus activity. Hackers bridged the stolen funds Blockchain sleuths first raised the alarm after observing large transfers from address ‚Äú C4WY‚Ä¶e525 ‚Äù on Solana. These transactions, linked to the notorious Lazarus Group, involved moving the stolen tokens through a bridge and converting them into Ethereum. ZachXBT flagged the attack by monitoring the bridge‚Äôs activity and tracing funds that ultimately ended up in a network of wallets on Ethereum. On June 25 and again on June 27, 400 ETH was sent to Tornado Cash in two separate deposits. Those 800 ETH transactions, totaling roughly $1.6 million, align with Lazarus Group‚Äôs well-documented laundering tactics. Following high-profile hacks like Bybit, where $1.5 billion was stolen in February 2025, and $100 million from Harmony‚Äôs Horizon bridge in 2022, among other notable hacks, Lazarus has repeatedly used Tornado Cash, along with decentralized exchanges and cross-chain bridges, to launder funds by obfuscating transaction trails. Approximately $1.25 million still resides in a wallet address identified as ‚Äú 0xa5‚Ä¶d528 ‚Äù on Ethereum, held in a combination of DAI and ETH. Analysts speculate that these funds may either be parked for future laundering or be held intentionally dormant to mitigate detection risk. Lazarus Group has been active since 2017 Lazarus Group has earned a reputation as the most prolific state-linked cybercrime organization, with North Korea sanctions designating them as an Advanced Persistent Threat tied to Pyongyang‚Äôs elite military intelligence units. Over the years, they have stolen billions in crypto since 2017. Their modus operandi often starts with phishing or malware-based infiltration of key personnel, exploiting smart contract flaws or wallet vulnerabilities. Once funds are obtained, they are rapidly converted into liquid assets, broken into multiple wallets, and laundered across chains using mixers like Tornado Cash and services providing instant swaps without Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. Tornado Cash remains central to Lazarus‚Äôs laundering strategy. Although U.S. sanctions were imposed in 2022, decentralized hosting and immutability have allowed the service to evade permanent shutdown. In January 2025, a U.S. appeals court reversed those sanctions, citing free speech considerations, despite mounting evidence linking Lazarus to continued mixer use. Regulators and exchanges may now take steps to mark the flagged addresses as suspicious. However, with the speed and complexity of Lazarus‚Äôs laundering pipeline, mixing services continue to prove sufficient in concealing the movement of their stolen funds.

Meanwhile, Avalanche (AVAX) is challenging resistance points that could dictate its next move. This article explores whether SUI can maintain its stance and if AVAX can break through, offering insights on which coins might be poised for growth. SUI Price Volatility Reflects Recent Corrections and Emerging Setups Last month SUI saw a significant drop of roughly 20%, while the six-month chart reveals a deeper churn with a decline of nearly 33%. A recent one-week gain of about 8.5% signals a brief recovery amid the longer-term downtrend. Price action has been marked by falling momentum and investor uncertainty as bears held sway longer term, making recovery efforts reliant on strong fundamentals. Trends have fluctuated, illustrating an asset struggling to sustain growth while technical indicators hint at a potential short-term bounce if critical levels are respected. Current trading levels show prices between $2.77 and $4.01. Immediate support appears near $2.29, while resistance lies at $4.77. Higher resistance is identified around $6.01, with deeper support at $1.05. Technical indicators, including a mildly negative momentum reading and an RSI at 44.59, suggest the market lacks a clear thrust. Bullish traders might buy at key support, targeting the nearest resistance, while bearish holders could monitor for drops beneath support to short the correction. A range-bound approach is advisable until the market decisively breaks in one direction. Avalanche Price Journey: Volatility and Key Trading Levels Over the last month, Avalanche declined nearly 20% while the half-year drop surpassed 50%, with a brief one-week gain of almost 6% hinting at short-term recovery. The coin‚Äôs past motion shows heavy selling pressure amid steep corrections, mixed with occasional rebounds that signal continued trader interest despite overall weakness. The price history reflects an erratic pattern where significant losses over longer spans contrast with minor rallies in shorter periods, creating an uneven performance picture that traders have navigated with caution and hesitation. Current market conditions for Avalanche reveal uncertainty mixed with tactical opportunities for active traders. Price currently oscillates between $17.67 and $25.40, with the nearest resistance level at $29.98 and support around $14.52. Bears maintain significant influence, as indicated by a negative Awesome Oscillator value of -1.942. The relative strength index near 42.65 reflects selling pressure, though some buyers are testing support levels. A clear trend remains elusive as the coin trades within defined ranges. Traders are advised to consider positions near support levels and employ tight stop-loss measures. Short-term strategies may include monitoring for support bounces while awaiting signals for bullish behavior. Conclusion SUI is trying to maintain its support, showing some promise of stability. On the other hand, AVAX faces resistance, posing challenges for upward movement. The ability of SUI to hold its ground could define its short-term outlook. AVAX's struggle with resistance may need further momentum for a breakout. Both coins are at critical points, indicating that their near future could see decisive moves. Observing these levels will be key to understanding their next steps. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Each asset is flashing potential breakout signals, drawing attention from both retail and institutional traders. But alongside these well-established names, a powerful early-stage contender is rapidly gaining momentum: MAGACOIN FINANCE. With its scarcity-driven structure and increasing interest from high-conviction investors, it‚Äôs positioning itself as one of the most closely tracked opportunities this cycle. Ethereum Forms Strong Base with Reversal Setup Ethereum has taken on a technical formation that many analysts recognize as potentially reversal. A triple bottom formation is established which indicates strong underlying support and could act as a launch pad for further upside. Traders keep a close eye on ecosystem upgrades and network activity, which remain high. Its pivotal role in DeFi, NFTs, and tokenization is making investors treat Ethereum like a structural anchor in crypto portfolios. Analysts are looking for confirmation signals to tag ETH in a new Bull phase. XRP Reignites Momentum on ETF Speculation XRP recently rebounded from a prolonged consolidation phase, regaining trader interest with a breakout above long-held technical resistance. The token‚Äôs movement has coincided with growing speculation about the approval of a spot XRP ETF ‚Äî a development that could inject substantial new liquidity into the asset. On-chain upgrades are also expanding the XRP Ledger‚Äôs functionality, supporting enterprise-level use cases across DeFi, token escrows, and payment channels. With a long-term triangle formation still intact, XRP remains one of the most closely monitored large-cap assets for potential mid-cycle breakout performance. Shiba Inu Surges on Whale Activity and Layer-2 Narrative Recently, 10 trillion Shiba tokens was purchased by whales indicating it saw the biggest daily accumulation over the past some months. This strong buying activity has sparked a sudden rise from recent drops and shown improved interest in finish development of SHIB. The Shibarium Layer-2 Solution Puzzle Continues to be Key Narrative Driver. Developers and investors are becoming interested in Shibarium due to lower transaction costs and greater scalability. Presently, there are long-term interests due to token burns that will lead to further speculation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Ground with Pro Traders While large-cap assets dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly attracting high-conviction capital from pro traders seeking strategic early entries. The project is backed by a scarcity-based structure and has been steadily gaining traction across key investment circles. Entry rounds have moved quickly, with accumulation activity pointing to increasing confidence in the token‚Äôs long-term setup. Analysts tracking presale behavior and position building are flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout with real momentum forming behind the scenes. Rather than relying on surface-level sentiment, the project‚Äôs appeal stems from structural traits ‚Äî limited supply, strong inflow trends, and positioning ahead of upcoming listings. With growing attention from seasoned market participants, it‚Äôs becoming clear that MAGACOIN FINANCE is not simply trending ‚Äî it‚Äôs gaining traction as a force in its own right. Final Thoughts: Trading Patterns Set the Stage, But Positioning Wins Ethereum, XRP, and Shiba Inu are each showcasing technical strength, building the foundation for what could be a strong market resurgence. Ethereum offers structural reliability, XRP brings speculative upside tied to regulatory shifts, and SHIB reflects the power of retail momentum and evolving infrastructure.

47055008,https://cryptonews.com/?p=376363,1751237103,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/47055008.jpeg,Quantum Black Swan: How a 2026 Quantum-Computing Breakthrough Could Upend Crypto (and Which Coins Might Survive),https://cryptonews.com/news/quantum-black-swan-how-a-2026-quantum-computing-breakthrough-could-upend-crypto-and-which-coins-might-survive/,"A simulated quantum stress test conducted using OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT o3 model has raised fresh concerns about the future of digital assets. The simulation explores a hypothetical breakthrough in quantum computing by 2026 that would render many of today‚Äôs cryptographic standards obsolete, potentially leading to widespread collapse across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once due to the principles of superposition and entanglement. This allows them to perform complex calculations at speeds far beyond what is possible with classical machines. According to o3, a sudden leap in quantum capability, such as the development of a 10,000-qubit fault-tolerant machine with sufficiently low error rates, could break the security systems underpinning major blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ChatGPT o3 Warns of ‚ÄòQ-Day‚Äô Extinction Risk for Blockchains o3 raised red flags across the crypto industry, warning that the rise of quantum computing‚Äîreferred to as ‚ÄúQ-Day‚Äù‚Äîcould pose an extinction-level threat to major blockchains. At the heart of blockchain security lies the asymmetric cryptography model: private keys generate public keys , but not the other way around. This one-way function is what secures digital wallets and signs transactions. Quantum computers might sound like another buzzword in the tech world, yet their threat to #cryptocurrency is very real and approaching fast. Scientists may differ on the timeline, but they all agree: ‚ÄúQ-day‚Äù is not a matter of if, but when. #Bitcoin https://t.co/SdH4NiTMoo ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2024 Quantum computing breaks this assumption. Using algorithms like Peter Shor‚Äôs , proven in theory to efficiently factor large numbers, quantum systems could reverse-engineer private keys from public data. ‚ÄúA chain is only as secure as its signatures,‚Äù the model warns. ‚ÄúOnce signatures break, the chain breaks.‚Äù The o3 model stress-tested major blockchain protocols under a Q-Day scenario in which quantum machines can break cryptographic standards like ECDSA and RSA. The findings are sobering. Bitcoin: Legacy Risk and No Governance Pathway Bitcoin, which still uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ( ECDSA ), was flagged as particularly vulnerable. As noted by o3, a significant portion of BTC remains locked in legacy wallets with no quantum-resistant protections. A 2020 Deloitte study further estimated that up to 25% of Bitcoin holdings could be compromised, especially coins stored in exposed or reused addresses. Data from Project Eleven reinforces this concern: over 6.2 million BTC, worth approximately $648 billion, are stored in addresses with exposed public keys. This translates to more than 10 million wallets that could be at risk once quantum computers achieve sufficient decryption power. @Tether_to CEO @paoloardoino has warned that quantum computing could eventually pose a threat to inactive Bitcoin wallets. #Bitcoin #Quantum https://t.co/u8DCYrTjYw ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 9, 2025 The problem is compounded by Bitcoin‚Äôs structural rigidity. What has long been praised as Bitcoin‚Äôs strength , its conservative dev culture and emphasis on protocol stability, now poses a liability. In a crisis, Bitcoin‚Äôs inability to adapt quickly could delay vital countermeasures. As OpenAI‚Äôs o3 model puts it, ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs survival isn‚Äôt cryptographic‚Äîit‚Äôs sociopolitical. Without preemptive upgrades, post-Q-Day drains will begin within days of the breakthrough.‚Äù While discussions around post-quantum signature schemes like XMSS or Dilithium have occurred within Bitcoin Core, no concrete implementation or accepted BIP exists. The introduction of lattice-based alternatives (e.g., Falcon) remains theoretical, with no set roadmap. According to o3, Bitcoin network survival would likely depend on one of two strategies: A politically contentious fork to a quantum-safe Bitcoin variant A preemptive key rotation or shielding mechanism that avoids exposed legacy keys Ethereum: More Adaptable, But Still At Risk While Ethereum shares Bitcoin‚Äôs cryptographic vulnerability, relying on the ECDSA, it ranks significantly higher in adaptability. The o3 model flagged Ethereum‚Äôs active developer community, rapid upgrade history, and flexible governance as key assets in navigating a post-quantum scenario. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has demonstrated the capacity to coordinate complex transitions. The DAO fork, Ethereum 2.0 Merge , and the Shapella upgrade all serve as precedent for community-driven protocol evolution. ‚ÄúEthereum can adapt,‚Äù o3 concluded, ‚Äúbut only if it moves quickly.‚Äù Still, the shift to post-quantum cryptography would require extensive infrastructure overhauls. These include wallet standards, signature validation rules in smart contracts, Layer-2 rollups, and developer tooling. Many of these components were built on cryptographic assumptions that would not hold after a quantum breakthrough. Account abstraction is only half-done The end goal is non-ECDSA accounts (multisigs, key changes, quantum-resistant, privacy protocols (!!)) being true first class citizens A lot of good work recently on aggressively simplifying 7701 to make this happen https://t.co/j66geDAoC8 ‚Äî vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 27, 2025 The o3 model simulation emphasized this point, saying, ‚ÄúEthereum is the only major L1 chain with a plausible fast-track governance protocol for quantum threats. But most dApps on Ethereum aren‚Äôt ready.‚Äù However, Ethereum‚Äôs programmability, a defining strength, also creates a unique risk surface. Millions of deployed smart contracts, including financial primitives on protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and MakerDAO, use static cryptographic calls vulnerable to quantum decryption. Many are immutable and cannot be patched after deployment. That said, proxy patterns and upgradeable architectures like OpenZeppelin‚Äôs implementation give some contracts a pathway for modification. But these only apply where foresight was used. Vast portions of Ethereum‚Äôs contract base may be impossible to rescue post-Q-Day without chain-wide intervention. For Ethereum to remain viable in a post-Q-Day world, o3 noted the following actions will be necessary: Roll out hybrid cryptographic wallets supporting post-quantum signature layers (e.g., Falcon, Dilithium). Incentivize or mandate critical dApps to adopt quantum-safe signature schemes in proxy contracts. Leverage Layer-2s for isolated asset migration and transaction validation under new cryptographic rules. Coordinate a network-wide ‚Äúkey rotation‚Äù event with community buy-in, governance clarity, and tooling support. Other Chains and DeFi: Varying Levels of Readiness Algorand: Purpose-Built for the Quantum Era Among all the Layer-1 chains o3 analyzed, Algorand emerged as one of the most quantum-resilient. Designed with future-proofing in mind, the protocol already incorporates cryptographic innovations such as Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs), and it has actively explored lattice-based encryption methods like NTRU, a class of cryptography believed to be quantum-resistant. ‚ÄúIf Q-Day hits in 2026,‚Äù the o3 model observed, ‚ÄúAlgorand is one of the only chains with a 12-month adaptation head start.‚Äù Algorand‚Äôs pipelined Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus rotates validator keys regularly, reducing the exposure window of any single cryptographic signature. More on Algorand's post-quantum technology: https://t.co/NIQEnbER0P ‚Äî Algorand Foundation (@AlgoFoundation) May 27, 2025 According to o3, its structured governance and fast finality also enhance its ability to implement protocol-level upgrades quickly in the face of emerging threats. Polkadot: Modular Agility Meets Cryptographic Risk Polkadot ranked just behind Algorand in terms of readiness. The network‚Äôs parachain architecture allows semi-independent blockchains to run in parallel, each potentially adopting its own quantum-resilient cryptography without waiting for a full network-wide consensus. According to o3, this modularity offers developers the freedom to implement post-quantum upgrades on a per-parachain basis. However, Polkadot currently relies on Schnorr-based BLS signatures , which are vulnerable to quantum attacks. Still, its OpenGov system and decentralized treasury could support rapid upgrade cycles when needed. Cardano: Academic Rigor, Operational Drag Cardano presents a paradox. It is one of the few blockchain platforms deeply invested in the academic exploration of post-quantum cryptographic techniques, including both lattice- and hash-based signature schemes. o3 noted that Cardano‚Äôs extended UTXO model also provides a more modular smart contract framework, which may ease the migration to new cryptographic primitives. Post-Quantum Cardano https://t.co/MpNWSo8KWm ‚Äî Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) February 20, 2025 However, Cardano still relies on Ed25519 signatures, which are quantum-susceptible, according to o3. And while its Voltaire governance phase is intended to support decentralized decision-making for protocol upgrades, it remains under development. As the o3 model put it, ‚ÄúIf crypto were judged on whitepapers alone, Cardano would thrive. But Q-Day doesn‚Äôt wait for peer review.‚Äù Privacy Coins: From Anonymity to Liability Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash face a uniquely grim outlook. Their core innovations of ring signatures, stealth addresses, and zero-knowledge proofs offer strong protections against classical decryption but may provide little defense against quantum attacks. o3 noted that quantum algorithms capable of breaking elliptic curve cryptography could dismantle the projects‚Äô anonymity features, exposing past transactions and rendering current privacy guarantees moot. Compounding the threat is the pseudonymous governance model, which makes coordinated upgrades or overhauls difficult. ‚ÄúQuantum computing doesn‚Äôt just de-anonymize Monero,‚Äù the o3 warned, ‚Äúit breaks its reason to exist. Privacy becomes exposure.‚Äù DeFi Protocols: Collateral Damage from Layer-1 Failures Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, particularly those built atop Ethereum such as Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO, face second-order vulnerabilities. While these protocols do not directly implement ECDSA at their core, they depend entirely on Ethereum‚Äôs base-layer security. If Ethereum‚Äôs signature scheme were compromised and Layer-1 wallets became exposed, the smart contracts securing billions in TVL (Total Value Locked) would be undermined; regardless of whether the dApps themselves were quantum-aware. o3 summarized the cascading risk simply: ‚ÄúIf the base layer fails, so does the application.‚Äù Compounding the issue is the immutability of many smart contracts. While some DeFi platforms use proxy architectures for upgrades, many early deployments do not, making them inflexible in crisis scenarios. Meme Coins and High-Beta Tokens: Virtually Defenseless At the other end of the spectrum lie meme coins and low-infrastructure tokens, which the o3 model described as ‚Äúnearly defenseless.‚Äù These tokens typically lack development teams, formal governance mechanisms, or upgrade paths, leaving them acutely vulnerable to any sudden shifts in cryptographic assumptions. In the event of Q-Day, such tokens would likely suffer immediate liquidity shocks, with whales offloading positions to avoid permanent loss. The community might attempt to fork the project onto a new chain, but without technical leadership, meaningful migration is unlikely. Who Is Ready for Q-Day? The o3 simulation‚Äôs sector-by-sector stress test does not predict which coins will succeed in market terms, but rather which systems have the structural capacity to survive a game-changing leap in computational power. Based on cryptographic architecture, governance agility, and ongoing research, the post-quantum readiness landscape looks like this: Best Positioned Today Apart from Algorand , Polkadot , Ethereum, and Cardano mentioned above, these other coins have been noted to be well positioned in the case of a Q-day. Cosmos Ecosystem (ATOM, Juno, Osmosis) Cosmos shares Polkadot‚Äôs modular philosophy. Independent zones (chains) communicate through IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), allowing sovereign upgrades. Projects like Juno and Osmosis have agile governance models and could implement PQC locally. Avalanche (AVAX) Employs a DAG-optimized consensus model (Snowball/Snowman), which increases redundancy and communication between subnets. Subnets (custom blockchains) can adopt PQC signatures independently. Governance is emerging, but the tech is flexible. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) A sharded blockchain with scalability and flexibility at its core. It already supports contract-based key rotation and multi-signature accounts, making future cryptographic migration plausible Tezos (XTZ) Tezos was one of the first blockchains to emphasize formal on-chain governance and self-amending protocols. It supports Michelson , a low-level functional language that allows for cryptographic primitives to be upgraded via governance proposals without forks. Radix (XRD) Radix uses a unique consensus model (Cerberus) and is focused on developer experience and modular architecture. While not currently post-quantum, its component-based DeFi engine and structured governance may allow for faster quantum-proof upgrades. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Built on hashgraph consensus (not a blockchain), Hedera offers high throughput and ABFT (asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance). Its enterprise focus includes forward-looking cryptographic considerations, and the council-led governance can act quickly. Most At Risk Monero , Shiba Inu and ERC-20 tokens, Dogecoin , Bitcoin was noted by o3 to have critical quantum-exposure risks , either due to obsolete cryptographic foundations, rigid governance, or a total dependency on vulnerable Layer-1 infrastructure. Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Dash (DASH): All forked from or closely related to Bitcoin, they inherit the same ECDSA vulnerabilities without demonstrating meaningful governance innovation or PQC research. Conclusion The takeaway is not to panic, but to prioritize strategic risk awareness . Quantum computing is not a hypothetical threat; it is an inevitable one . What remains uncertain is when it will become powerful enough to break widely used public-key cryptography. For blockchain projects, the prudent move isn‚Äôt to predict Q-Day‚Äôs exact date but to build architectures that can flex when it does arrive. That includes investing in research, improving governance, abstracting cryptography, and educating communities on quantum resilience.

Price action remained volatile, with BTC fluctuating between $107,194 and $108,489 during the 24-hour window, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. On June 29, 2025, President Donald Trump posted a pointed message on Truth Social addressing Republican lawmakers amid intense debate over his sweeping tax-and-spending package. ‚ÄúFor all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected. Don‚Äôt go too crazy! We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before,‚Äù he wrote. This statement underscores the deep divisions within the GOP as it wrestles with the ambitious legislation dubbed the ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill.‚Äù The bill, exceeding 900 pages, combines roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts with targeted spending reductions and increased funding for defense and border security. It seeks to make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump‚Äôs 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and certain auto loans. The child tax credit would rise to $2,200 under the Senate version, while deductions for seniors would increase temporarily. However, to offset these tax cuts, Republicans propose significant cuts to Medicaid and nutrition programs, sparking fierce debate within the party. Moderate Republicans from high-tax states are pushing for a higher cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT), while conservatives demand deeper spending cuts, particularly targeting Medicaid. These internal disagreements complicate efforts to secure the narrow Republican majorities needed in both chambers to pass the bill, which Democrats uniformly oppose as favoring the wealthy and worsening inequality. Trump‚Äôs social media message reflects an attempt to balance these competing pressures ‚Äî urging fiscal restraint to satisfy conservatives while emphasizing that robust economic growth will compensate for revenue losses and help reduce deficits over time. This supply-side economic approach projects that growth will ‚Äúmake it all up‚Äù despite near-term increases in the national debt, which nonpartisan analysts estimate could add trillions to the existing $36.2 trillion debt. Crypto analyst Will Clemente‚Äôs reaction on X (formerly Twitter) shortly after Trump‚Äôs post captures a common market sentiment: ‚ÄúHow can you read this and hold long term US treasuries at current yields lol... Also, how can you read this and not hold any Bitcoin or gold.‚Äù Clemente‚Äôs skepticism toward long-term U.S. Treasuries reflects concerns that the bill‚Äôs deficit-financed tax cuts and modest spending cuts signal a loose fiscal policy that could fuel inflation and currency debasement. In this context, traditional fixed-income assets like Treasuries may appear less attractive, as rising deficits and potential monetary accommodation threaten bond values. Conversely, hard assets such as gold and Bitcoin are increasingly viewed as stores of value and hedges against inflation and fiscal risk. The expectation of sustained deficits and political challenges to fiscal discipline bolster demand for these inflation-resistant assets. With the Senate racing to finalize the bill before the July 4 holiday, Trump‚Äôs call for unity and moderation highlights the high stakes and political challenges in passing one of the most consequential fiscal packages in recent U.S. history. The bill‚Äôs fate remains uncertain as lawmakers negotiate to balance tax relief, spending cuts, and political feasibility. Technical Analysis Highlights From June 28 15:00 to June 29 14:00 UTC, BTC traded from $107,194 to $108,489, a 1.21% intraday range. Support was established at $107,300, with multiple rebounds during the 02:00‚Äì03:00 window. Volume peaked at 7,538 BTC between 08:00 and 11:00 UTC on June 29, confirming upward momentum. During the final session hour (13:05‚Äì14:04 UTC), BTC fell from $108,219 to $108,059, forming a descending channel. A 130 BTC volume spike at 13:35 coincided with a sharp dip to $108,030, which was tested and held. Final intraday rally pushed price back toward $108K before fading slightly by 22:22 UTC to $107,937.

XRP, Avalanche, and Solana continue to dominate technical discussions. But while they each face their own challenges, a newer contender ‚Äî MAGACOIN FINANCE ‚Äî is pushing its way into the spotlight with bold analyst predictions and accelerating investor demand. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out isn‚Äôt just its political theme. It‚Äôs the numbers, the traction, and the strategy. With early buyers already anticipating up to 255x returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting up to potentially outpace some of the biggest names in the space. 1. XRP Price Forecast: Technical Strength Meets Delayed Fundamentals XRP price movements are closely mimicking Bitcoin‚Äôs pre-breakout trend ‚Äî a signal that has caught the attention of many technical analysts.When sentiment turns bullish in the market, this setup can result in a huge rally. The XRP price today continues to be suppressed by legal uncertainties and geopolitical disputes. But when it comes to longer term XRP price predictions, there are tens, if not more, of potential forecasts that point to high upside. The highest Q3 2025 estimates even go all the way up to $5.81. PHYSICAL DEMAND: Investor sentiment continues to be supported by buying interest and speculation regarding the potential for a XRP ETF. To those who ask: Will XRP price go up? analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Whatever the speed bumps in the short term, there is still a narrative for the asset over the next year if certain key regulatory hurdles are overcome. 2. Avalanche: Growth Potential with Measured Risk Avalanche has shown steady strength in recent weeks. Higher lows have formed a clear uptrend, yet resistance near the $18.50 range is proving to be a key battleground. A breakout with volume could open the door for sustained gains. But if that resistance holds, AVAX may retest lower levels. The AVAX price is also supported by Avalanche‚Äôs expanding real-world use cases. In New Jersey, property records are being digitized on Avalanche‚Äôs chain. Meanwhile, the Fan3 platform has launched to help brands engage fans globally using blockchain tools ‚Äî all powered by Avalanche. While short-term volatility remains, Avalanche price movement is being closely tracked. Analysts are paying attention to how the ecosystem‚Äôs adoption plays into long-term AVAX price strength. 3. Solana: Institutional Buzz Meets Meme Revenue Risks Solana continues to ride a wave of speculation. Hopes for a Solana ETF are growing, thanks to recent Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF successes. Institutional interest is strong, and developers are still flocking to the network. But a major concern has emerged. Roughly 75% of Solana‚Äôs recent chain revenue came from meme coin activity. That raises questions about the sustainability of its current revenue model. Solana news updates remain positive, but there‚Äôs a need for stronger fundamentals to back long-term gains. Still, analysts see a Q3 price target averaging $160.70, with highs potentially hitting $168.32. SOL price momentum is steady, but not without concerns. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Focus for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the most sought-after tokens of the year. Its capped supply of 170 billion tokens creates a scarcity dynamic that early buyers see as a key advantage. Combined with no VC unlocks and a HashEx audit, the structure is winning over both retail and institutional investors. Every stage of its presale has sold out fast. Investor interest is growing daily. MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs bold, political identity is resonating across markets ‚Äî and its clear utility and transparent roadmap are only fueling more interest. While XRP, Avalanche, and Solana are being watched for technical patterns and speculation, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something more direct ‚Äî upside. Analysts are now forecasting potential returns of up to 25x for early participants. The project‚Äôs momentum is strong, its smart contract is verified, and investor sentiment is climbing. As more eyes turn toward exchange listings, MAGACOIN FINANCE is expected to become one of the biggest breakout names of 2025. Final Word: MAGACOIN FINANCE Outpaces the Pack While XRP, Solana, and Avalanche continue to attract attention, none offer the same upside potential as MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP has legal delays. Avalanche faces resistance and market volatility. Solana is still trying to balance speculation with fundamentals. MAGACOIN FINANCE is moving faster, attracting high-volume buyers, and positioning itself for explosive growth. For investors looking for real returns ‚Äî and not just speculation ‚Äî MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the smarter move heading into 2025.

As the presale progresses, more retail buyers are noticing its potential. Measured Execution and Strategic Launch Countdown Unlike many projects that rush their launches, BlockDAG follows a precise, six-week countdown to the mainnet. Starting with the end of the presale, the transition to mainnet will be structured to ensure seamless execution. During this time, BlockDAG plans to roll out core infrastructure, launch community nodes, and release 40% of its airdrop. Additionally, it will also deploy DeFi components like decentralized exchanges (DEXs), oracles, and lending platforms. The plan culminates in the final marketing push and listing preparations. This transparency and attention to detail give potential users and supporters confidence that BlockDAG is ready to scale effectively. Strategic Growth and Path to Success In addition to the 100 million token airdrop, BlockDAG‚Äôs strategic partnerships, global expansion efforts, and developer incentives all point toward its future as one of the leading Layer 1 ecosystems. Its planned mainnet launch, combined with the growing number of active users and miners, gives BlockDAG a strong foundation to emerge as a top contender in the crypto space. BlockDAG is on track to be one of the most successful cryptocurrencies in 2025, thanks to its carefully crafted ecosystem, strategic development, and focus on community growth. If ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù in crypto means adoption, infrastructure, and execution, BlockDAG is already leading the way. BlockDAG‚Äôs Unique Hybrid Architecture and Adoption Potential BlockDAG is not attempting to mimic existing blockchain networks; instead, it combines the best features of multiple successful systems. Its hybrid architecture uses Proof-of-Work for security, DAG for scalability (enabling up to 15,000 transactions per second), and Ethereum‚Äôs smart contract compatibility for easy development and deployment of decentralized applications. With over 200,000 BDAG holders already, BlockDAG is demonstrating its adoption potential. The combination of a low presale price, early support from whales, a growing developer ecosystem, and active community engagement makes BlockDAG stand out as a unique project in the crypto space. Conclusion BlockDAG‚Äôs innovative hybrid architecture combines Proof-of-Work (PoW) security with Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scalability, allowing it to process thousands of transactions per second while ensuring decentralization. The project already has a live testnet with EVM compatibility, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) with lower fees and faster speeds than on Ethereum. Additionally, the strategic 100 million token airdrop and a U.S.-based sponsorship are further expanding BlockDAG‚Äôs ecosystem and preparing it for broader recognition. As the project moves forward, its unique approach to building infrastructure and growing its community sets it up for long-term success.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $36.8. By 2031, ICP‚Äôs price might reach a maximum of $113.32. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. The network leverages advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain‚Äôs future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let‚Äôs get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.90 Market Cap $2.61B Trading Volume $43.05M Circulating Supply 534.95M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $4.92 24-h Low $4.81 Internet Computer technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 7.65% 14-Day RSI 44.17 50-Day SMA $5.35 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 68 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $6.35 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP faces resistance at $5.056. MACD signals weak bearish momentum. ICP 1-day price analysis: ICP appears to be consolidating The 1-day chart for ICP on June 29 shows the price consolidating between $4.90 and $5.05. The recent price action has fluctuated within this narrow range, with multiple tests of the $4.90 support and attempts to break the $5.05 resistance. The MACD indicator shows weak bearish momentum as it hovers near the zero line, signaling indecisiveness in the market. ICP appears to be consolidating If ICP fails to break above $5.05 and establish momentum, it could remain trapped within the current consolidation range. A failure to maintain support at $4.64 would likely bring ICP back down to the next support at $4.31, which is critical for a potential rebound. ICP price analysis for 4-hour: ICP pulls back after testing key resistance level On the 4-hour chart, the coin has tested the upper Bollinger Band at $4.93 and is slightly pulling back, suggesting a possible overbought condition in the short term. The Balance of Power is negative at -0.38, showing a shift in momentum towards sellers. ICP pulls back after testing key resistance level The price is currently trading just below the upper resistance zone at $4.92, with a minor dip suggesting a small correction before potentially making another attempt to break resistance. If ICP fails to surpass $4.93, the price could drop to retest the lower support level at $4.65. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $4.77 BUY SMA 5 $4.96 SELL SMA 10 $4.96 SELL SMA 21 $5.34 SELL SMA 50 $5.35 SELL SMA 100 $5.30 SELL SMA 200 $6.35 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $5.12 SELL EMA 5 $5.15 SELL EMA 10 $5.15 SELL EMA 21 $5.25 SELL EMA 50 $5.80 SELL EMA 100 $6.80 SELL EMA 200 $7.86 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP seems to be in a state of indecision, hovering near critical support and resistance levels. If the price breaks above the $5.40 level, we could see a bullish continuation, but failure to maintain support above $4.64 could lead to further downward pressure. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies. Will Internet Computer reach $25? Yes, Internet Computer ICP might reach and surpass $25 as early as 2027. Will Internet Computer reach $50? Yes, Internet Computer is expected to reach $50. Will ICP reach $1000? Although its ATH sits at $750.73, attaining $1000 in the foreseeable future might be impossible. ICP is down 99% from its ATH and will require a massive turnaround in market fortunes to recapture previous highs. Does Internet Computer have a good long-term future? Yes, the Internet Computer coin shows a promising long-term future. Price predictions indicate steady growth, with a potential increase year-on-year, reflecting a positive trend and strong market potential.

The same survey found that current crypto owners say that tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) make up at least 14% of the total value of their financial assets. South Koreans: Crypto Trading on the Rise? The newspaper Cheonji Ilbo reported that the survey of 1,000 people nationwide was conducted in April this year by the Hana Financial Group‚Äôs Research Institute. South Korea called for a ‚Äúmutually beneficial‚Äù agreement on trade with the US during its new trade minister‚Äôs first trip to Washington this week. https://t.co/qeMmYlICCy ‚Äî Bloomberg (@business) June 28, 2025 The survey‚Äôs authors explained that 51% of the people they spoke to ‚Äúhad experience investing in crypto,‚Äù with 27% currently HODLing their coins. In this latter group, investors said they were holding onto an average of around 13 million won ($9,547) worth of coins. In the early stages of investment, the researchers found, traders tended to focus on Bitcoin. However, they also found that as traders gained experience, they tended to buy more altcoins, with a focus on stablecoins . Wallets on Multiple Exchanges The data also appears to indicate that many South Korean traders are prepared to shop around to find better prices. Over half of the respondents said they held crypto wallets on multiple domestic crypto exchanges . Seven out of 10 said they have traded on the market-leading trading platform Upbit. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past three months. (Source: CoinGecko) The majority of crypto-trading survey participants (60%) said they began investing in crypto in earnest during the 2020 Bitcoin bull run. Three-quarters of investors began investing with stakes worth less than 3 million won ($2,203). However, the value of their collective investments appears to have risen considerably. Over four in 10 of the crypto investors said they currently have coins worth more than 10 million won ($7,344) in their wallets. Majority of Traders Are Male Office Workers, Data Shows Most crypto investors were aged 40-49, with 67% of male respondents and just 33% of women saying they had bought coins. The majority of crypto investors (over half) said they were in white collar office jobs, with just 12% of physical laborers saying they had crypto holdings. The data also indicated that crypto investing-South Koreans tend to take more risks in the financial markets. The researchers noted that 38% of respondents showed signs of taking an ‚Äúactive‚Äù or ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù approach to investment tendency. This, they said, was twice the overall average of 20%.

XRP is holding steady‚Äîbut barely. And out of nowhere, a wildcard called MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting fire to the presale charts, flipping the political meme coin script for 2025. It started as a joke. Now, it‚Äôs a movement. With presale phases vanishing in hours and the token still priced under a penny, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn‚Äôt just gaining momentum‚Äîit‚Äôs charging full speed toward the kind of parabolic run that made early SHIBA and DOGE holders millionaires. Ethereum and XRP: Still Kings, But Slipping Let‚Äôs be clear‚ÄîEthereum isn‚Äôt going away. But right now, it‚Äôs stuck. A ‚Äúdeath cross‚Äù just formed on its two-week chart‚Äîsomething that preceded a 40% crash the last time it appeared in 2022. ETH is pinned near $2,460, facing weak demand and heavy resistance. Unless it clears $2,500 fast, analysts warn a drop to $2,100 could come next. XRP is faring better, thanks to its courtroom victory over the SEC. It‚Äôs trading around $2.20 and riding a wave of bullish speculation. But that $2.60 wall still hasn‚Äôt cracked. The hype is building, sure‚Äîbut the price isn‚Äôt moving fast enough to match it. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Already Moving This isn‚Äôt just another meme coin. MAGACOIN FINANCE is tapping into something raw and emotional‚Äîpolitics, culture, and identity‚Äîand it‚Äôs doing it with a war chest full of early investor capital. Millions raised. Thousands of wallets. Each presale phase sells out faster than the last. And yet, the price is still under $0.001. People aren‚Äôt buying it because of utility. They‚Äôre buying it because they feel it. Because it stands for something. Because it‚Äôs stirring the same kind of chaotic, high-voltage energy that gave rise to Trump, Dogecoin, and Reddit-fueled stock rallies. Analysts Say 25x to 35x Is Conservative‚ÄîSome Are Whispering 185x That‚Äôs not a typo. Conservative forecasts put MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs return potential between 25x and 35x for early buyers. But in this kind of narrative-driven market, where emotion often outpaces logic, there are louder whispers of 100x+. Some models even throw out 185x if momentum keeps climbing into listings. The fixed supply‚Äî170 billion tokens. The audit‚Äîcompleted. The price entry‚Äîstill dirt cheap. Everything about this setup screams breakout. Ethereum Builds Infrastructure. XRP Builds Payment Rails. MAGACOIN Builds Hype‚Äîand Hype Wins in Meme Markets. Don‚Äôt get it twisted. Ethereum and XRP will still be here in 2030. They‚Äôll have partnerships, upgrades, roadmaps. But MAGACOIN FINANCE might be the one that makes headlines this year. The one that people wish they‚Äôd bought when it was still under a penny. The one that rides into major listings with a wave of red caps, memes, and pure speculative fire. It won‚Äôt be the biggest by market cap. But in terms of raw returns? Cultural impact? 2025‚Äôs most talked-about political meme coin? MAGACOIN FINANCE might already be that. And if you‚Äôre still watching from the sidelines, you might be doing exactly what the early DOGE skeptics did‚Äîwaiting too long while others lock in generational wealth. Final Take Ethereum and XRP still dominate by scale. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is outpacing them where it matters most right now‚Äîmomentum, attention, and raw upside potential. It‚Äôs not trying to be the next smart contract king or cross-border solution. It‚Äôs trying to blow the roof off meme season before it even starts. And by the look of things, it just might pull it off.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins a new trading week, ETH is trading close to $2500, up 11% in the seven days, according to CoinDesk market data, outperforming BTC. Market observers have attributed ETH's outperformance versus bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies to a string of bullish headlines in the past few weeks. Stablecoins have regulatory clarity thanks to the GENIUS Act ‚Äì and Ethereum is home to the most stablecoin deposits; ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to see sizable flow. Technical analysis by CoinDesk's analyst Omkar Godbole indicates a potential bullish case is forming on-chain, with traders increasingly viewing $ 3,000 ETH as a possibility in the near future. But behind the scenes, something more fundamental is happening. Ethereum‚Äôs validator architecture, the backbone of its proof-of-stake security model, is undergoing a quiet transformation that could cement ETH‚Äôs role as Wall Street‚Äôs favorite programmable asset. At the center of that shift is distributed validator technology, or DVT, a system that allows Ethereum validators to be split across multiple operators and machines, making them far more resilient, secure, and decentralized. Obol Labs is one of the leading teams behind the technology. ‚ÄúEthereum is coming back in favor because it‚Äôs the most secure and battle-tested blockchain,‚Äù said Anthony Bertolino, head of ecosystem at Obol Labs. ‚ÄúAnd security comes from validators. The most advanced and secure ones now are distributed validators.‚Äù Obol‚Äôs technology eliminates a long-standing problem in Ethereum staking: single points of failure. Traditional validators rely on a single node to propose and attest to blocks. If that node goes offline or is misconfigured, the validator is penalized, or slashed in Ethereum parlance. Obol‚Äôs system uses threshold cryptography and an ‚Äúactive-active‚Äù architecture so that even if some nodes fail, the validator keeps running without interruption. This upgrade is not just a technical improvement. It is an institutional requirement. As Ethereum sees inflows from ETFs, funds, and structured finance products, staking infrastructure needs to meet the standards of traditional capital allocators. Blockdaemon, for instance, recently announced that it is integrating Obol's distributed validator technology into its staking infrastructure. Blockdaemon is a $100 billion name for institutional crypto. ‚ÄúHistorically, institutions had to choose between performance and security,‚Äù Bertolino said. ‚ÄúNow they get both.‚Äù Momentum is building fast. Lido, Ethereum‚Äôs largest staking protocol with $22 billion in total value locked , is preparing to approve distributed validator use across its ‚ÄúCurated Set‚Äù ‚Äî the collection of professional node operators who manage over 30 percent of all staked ETH. A new governance proposal would allow these operators to use either Obol or SSV in intra-operator setups, and eventually expand usage across thousands of validators. This move builds on the success of Lido‚Äôs Simple DVT Module, which has already deployed over 9,600 DVT-powered validators with a 97.5 percent effectiveness score, outperforming the network average. ‚ÄúThese clusters are already showing better uptime, higher effectiveness, and similar yields to conventional setups,‚Äù Bertolino said. ‚ÄúThis is the infrastructure shift that makes Ethereum staking enterprise-grade.‚Äù For Ethereum, the implications go beyond validator design. DVT mitigates one of the network‚Äôs core criticisms, that its staking layer is increasingly centralized, and helps fulfill the vision of Ethereum to be neutral, distributed infrastructure. ""Institutions are thinking about two things. How do I secure the assets, and how do I generate attractive yield? Historically, you had to choose one. DVT gives you both,‚Äù Bertolino said. And Wall Street continues to pay attention. News Recap: Short COIN, Long BTC as Coinbase Nears Overvaluation, Says 10x Research Coinbase shares have surged 84% in the past two months, far outpacing bitcoin‚Äôs 14% gain and raising red flags about overvaluation, according to 10x Research, covered late last week by CoinDesk . In a Friday note, Head of Research Markus Thielen recommended a short COIN/long BTC trade, arguing that Coinbase‚Äôs fundamentals‚Äîmainly trading volumes‚Äîdon‚Äôt justify the rally. ‚ÄúWhile Coinbase hasn‚Äôt quite breached the +30% overvaluation threshold, it‚Äôs approaching fast,‚Äù Thielen wrote, suggesting options strategies or pair trades to exploit the potential reversal. 10x‚Äôs model finds 75% of COIN‚Äôs price action is tied to bitcoin‚Äôs price and volumes, meaning recent gains likely reflect excessive speculation. The report notes other bullish catalysts, including Circle‚Äôs IPO and U.S. stablecoin legislation, are likely priced in, while Korean investor momentum is fading. ‚ÄúThis rare deviation suggests Coinbase‚Äôs valuation is extended and vulnerable to mean reversion,‚Äù Thielen said, warning that COIN could soon follow other overheated crypto stocks lower. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is trading above $108K as Asia opens its trading week, but analyst Micha√´l van de Poppe says it must break $109K resistance to sustain momentum, with the rally fueled more by leveraged futures than spot demand. ETH: Ethereum broke above $2,440 with strong volume support, signaling bullish momentum amid new U.S. stock market highs, improving global liquidity, and easing geopolitical tensions. Gold: Gold is trading at $3,248.26, down slightly, as Australia cuts its commodity export earnings forecast due to weak iron ore and gas prices despite surging gold. Nikkei 225: Nikkei 225 futures are trending higher with an expectation that the White House will reach trade deals with Japan and other export-heavy Asian economies.

According to a new report from CEX.IO, 45% of crypto card transactions fall under the 10-euro mark, reflecting a shift in consumer behaviour and highlighting crypto‚Äôs growing role in day-to-day payments. The report, shared with Cointelegraph, noted a 15% year-on-year increase in newly issued CEX.IO crypto cards across the continent in 2025. This trend indicates a broader acceptance of digital assets as a means for routine purchases and suggests that crypto cardholders are now mirroring traditional banking habits, especially when it comes to online spending. Online Spending Nearly Doubles Traditional Usage Rates While the European Central Bank (ECB) reports that 21% of card payments in the eurozone are made online, CEX.IO data shows that 40% of crypto card transactions occur via the internet. This figure nearly doubles the regional average, showcasing the comfort crypto users have with digital platforms. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing in Europe is that crypto card users aren‚Äôt just experimenting with new tech ‚Äî they‚Äôre showing us what everyday spending might look like in a truly cashless future,‚Äù said Alexandr Kerya, Vice President of Product Management at CEX.IO. He also revealed that average payment volumes have jumped 24% in the past month alone. Crypto Spending Patterns Mirror Traditional Banking The data further illustrates how crypto cardholders are incorporating digital currencies into their daily routines. Groceries represent 59% of crypto card purchases, which is close to the ECB‚Äôs 54% average for traditional bank cards. Spending at restaurants and bars accounts for 19% ‚Äî a higher figure than typical bank card usage in that category. The average crypto card transaction stands at ‚Ç¨23.70, lower than the ‚Ç¨33.60 average for traditional bank card payments, based on Mastercard‚Äôs Q1 2025 data. Stablecoins Lead Transactions as Other Cryptos Gain Ground Stablecoins play a dominant role in these transactions, powering 73% of all crypto card activity. Nevertheless, other leading digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Solana are also being used for essentials like groceries, dining, and transport. This mirrors broader usage trends across the crypto sector. For example, platforms like Oobit and Crypto.com are also reporting strong transaction volumes related to everyday spending and online shopping across their European user base. Institutional Pushbacks Continue Despite Adoption Gains However, not all financial institutions are welcoming this trend. Barclays has announced that it will block crypto purchases on its Barclaycard credit cards. The bank cited concerns over the volatility of digital assets and the lack of consumer protections available through traditional financial mechanisms. Barclays emphasized that crypto transactions are not covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, leaving users exposed in case of disputes or losses. Despite such institutional caution, the momentum behind crypto card usage continues to grow, reflecting an evolving financial landscape that is increasingly embracing digital innovation.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|LTC|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-29 23:43:55

However, while the figure surpassed the previous H1 record set in 2022, the numbers were considerably skewed by just one incident, a $1.5 billion attack on Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit. The Defining Breach The Bybit breach , which happened in February, was not just the largest crypto hack ever; it was a geopolitical act, with TRM Labs, alongside several other security firms, attributing it to North Korean state-sponsored actors. According to the report , the incident accounted for nearly 70% of all crypto thefts in the first half of 2025 and inflated the average hack size to $30 million, double that of H1 2024‚Äôs figure. In total, there were about 75 distinct attacks. January, April, and May saw significant cases, all exceeding $100 million, indicating a pervasive and persistent threat landscape beyond just the headline-grabbing mega hack. Overall, TRM‚Äôs insight estimated that groups linked to North Korea were responsible for at least $1.6 billion of the total losses so far this year. According to the analytics firm, proceeds from such operations were most likely used to not only evade sanctions placed on the Pyongyang regime, but also to help bankroll its strategic initiatives, including its nuclear program. Technically, the report noted that infrastructure intrusions targeting fundamental weaknesses like private key/seed phrase security or exchange front-ends were the dominant vector, accounting for over 80% of the stolen funds. These breaches, often amplified by social engineering or insider threats, exploit the core foundations of crypto security and usually result in incidents ten times larger, on average, than other methods. Additionally, protocol-level exploits, such as flash loan manipulations in DeFi, contributed another 12%, highlighting persistent smart contract vulnerabilities. A New Era of Cyber Warfare in Crypto H1 2025 also saw the emergence of a new front in how geopolitical conflicts are waged: the explicit use of crypto hacking as a tool of war. This was seen in the recent attack on Iran‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, Nobitex, by Gonjeshke Darande (Predatory Sparrow), a group reportedly linked to Israel, which stole more than $90 million from the platform. The group publicly stated their motivation, claiming they had targeted the exchange for its role in helping Iran circumvent sanctions and finance illicit activities. Interestingly, they transferred the stolen funds to vanity addresses lacking corresponding private keys, rendering them inaccessible, and strongly signaling that the operation was executed for symbolic or political retaliation, rather than financial gain.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $4.59 to $5.54. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW‚Äôs price movements. Given Flow coin‚Äôs strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.3287 Market Cap $523.59M Trading Volume $11.91M Circulating Supply 1.59B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.3032 24-hour High $0.3290 24-hour Low $0.3243 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.01% 50-Day SMA $0.3841 14-Day RSI 41.78 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 68 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.4503 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Flow coin is consolidating between $0.323 and $0.330. Support is at $0.290, and resistance is at $0.372. Flow coin 1-day price analysis: FLOW is hovering around the 0.236 Fibonacci level The 1-day price chart analysis for June 29 shows the price hovering around the 0.236 Fibonacci level, a crucial point in the recovery process. Immediate resistance lies at $0.372, while the next support could be near $0.290. The MACD on the chart is negative, indicating a bearish trend with potential for further downward movement. A reversal above $0.372 would confirm a momentum shift, but the market sentiment remains bearish. FLOW is hovering around the 0.236 Fibonacci level Flow coin 4-hour price analysis: FLOW shows moderate buying interest The 4-hour chart reflects a relatively stable price action within the range of $0.323 to $0.330, forming a consolidation pattern with a slight upward bias. A sharp move outside this range might indicate increased volatility. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) of 7.39M shows moderate buying interest, although it‚Äôs not strong enough to break above the resistance at $0.330. FLOW shows moderate buying interest FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3335 SELL SMA 5 $0.3425 SELL SMA 10 $0.3362 SELL SMA 21 $0.3534 SELL SMA 50 $0.3841 SELL SMA 100 $0.3874 SELL SMA 200 $0.4503 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3503 SELL EMA 5 $0.3610 SELL EMA 10 $0.3695 SELL EMA 21 $0.3798 SELL EMA 50 $0.4197 SELL EMA 100 $0.4910 SELL EMA 200 $0.5699 SELL What to expect from Flow? If FLOW breaks the support at $0.323, further downside towards $0.290 may occur, while a break above $0.330 could lead to a minor bullish move. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network‚Äôs unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

CNBC reports that Ric Edelman, who previously said that allocating as much as 1% to crypto was reasonable, is now saying that financial advisors should recommend allocating between 10% and 40% to digital assets. Says Edelman in an interview with CNBC‚Äôs Crypto World, ‚ÄúToday I am saying 40%, that‚Äôs astonishing. No one has ever said such a thing.‚Äù The founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals is now more bullish on crypto assets amid the massive changes in the industry. According to Edelman, Bitcoin and the broader crypto space faced numerous uncertainties four years ago ‚Äì from the possibility of government bans on BTC , to concerns about blockchain technology becoming obsolete, to questions about whether digital asset adoption would gain meaningful traction. ‚ÄúToday, all those questions have been resolved. It‚Äôs radically changed and is now a mainstream asset.‚Äù Edelman also says that Bitcoin and crypto should play a bigger role in long-term investment strategies as life expectancy in the US increases. According to the financial advisor, allocating 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds no longer works, given that Americans can live up to 85 today, or even much older with advances in tech and medicine. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a financial advisor and you had a 30-year-old client who was saving for their long-term future, you would tell them to put 100% of their money in stocks, because they have 50 years to go. Today‚Äôs 60-year-old is kind of like yesterday‚Äôs 30-year-old. You need to get better returns than you can get from bonds, and you need to hold equities longer than ever before.‚Äù Edelman notes that Bitcoin is a great portfolio diversifier as it doesn‚Äôt appear to be correlated with the performance of other asset classes. He also says that digital assets tend to outperform stocks, bonds, gold and others. ‚ÄúBitcoin prices don‚Äôt move in sync with stocks or bonds or gold or oil or commodities‚Ä¶ The crypto asset class offers the opportunity for higher returns than you‚Äôre likely to get in virtually any other asset class.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Ethereum (ETH) is testing a significant resistance level, and Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing renewed interest, with projections suggesting the potential for strong returns. While both continue to attract short-term attention, Unstaked is emerging as a long-term prospect with tangible utility and notable upside. At a current price of $0.012091 in Stage 22 and a launch goal of $0.1819, Unstaked unlocks a 28x return for early participants. With $10.6 million already raised and a platform centered on AI agents governed by users, Unstaked is establishing itself as a utility-driven contender. In a shifting market that increasingly favors substance over speculation, Unstaked is gaining recognition as a potential leading pick among next-generation crypto platforms. Ethereum (ETH) Consolidates Just Below Resistance Ethereum remains range-bound, currently trading just beneath the $2,540‚Äì$2,570 resistance level. This zone includes converging exponential moving averages and upper Bollinger Band limits. Despite several failed attempts to move past $2,600, buyers have maintained control near $2,510, with visible support emerging around $2,480. Indicators reflect a neutral market stance, with MACD showing minimal momentum and RSI hovering close to 49. A confirmed breakout above $2,570 could enable moves toward $2,660 and $2,710. However, failure to sustain upward momentum could open the door for a retest of support levels near $2,438. As volatility compresses and technical levels align, Ethereum (ETH) continues to approach a point where a breakout could signal broader altcoin movement. Dogecoin (DOGE) Repositions as Analysts Eye High Upside Potential Dogecoin has recovered modestly, trading near $0.1690 after briefly dipping below $0.174. The price remains within a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating that a larger directional move may be approaching. According to Ali Martinez, a breakout above $0.22 could trigger the beginning of a stronger rally. Meanwhile, Javon Marks forecasts an ambitious 600% increase, suggesting a long-term target of $1.25. While recent weakness was linked to declining open interest and overall market caution, structural indicators remain intact. A clean break above the $0.22 level may first target $0.65, representing a 260% gain. Within this landscape, Unstaked offers a contrasting opportunity. While Dogecoin rides technical momentum, Unstaked delivers real-world functionality with comparable upside potential. Unstaked: AI Utility, Transparent Governance, & High Growth Potential Unstaked‚Äôs rise is underpinned by its unique blend of AI integration and user-led governance. Priced at $0.012091 in its 22nd presale stage and aiming for a launch value of $0.1819, the project provides a potential 28x return. This pricing alone has drawn interest, but the platform‚Äôs operational focus has further strengthened investor interest. At its foundation, Unstaked empowers users to create and manage AI agents that perform various tasks, such as content management and data handling. After Unstaked‚Äôs public launch, these agents will function directly on-chain, offering verifiable transparency and ownership. Unlike many projects that promote AI as a vague concept, Unstaked ties its AI features to real governance structures, allowing participants to shape development and application. The team has also launched a $1,000,000 giveaway for early supporters, adding further appeal during the presale. Having already raised more than $10.6 million and sold over 1.2 billion tokens, Unstaked is gaining traction with serious capital. Compared to speculative bets, Unstaked represents a platform rooted in practical value with long-term growth potential. Crypto markets appear to be entering a new phase. Established names like Ethereum and Dogecoin are navigating familiar levels, waiting for signals to define their next moves. At the same time, Unstaked is capitalizing on early-stage enthusiasm by offering utility, community governance, and price potential that legacy tokens no longer provide. Looking Ahead Ethereum is consolidating and Dogecoin is recovering, but Unstaked is growing. Its use of AI, transparent mechanics, and planned token economics present a forward-thinking approach to crypto development. In a market slowly favoring platforms with real products and engaged communities, Unstaked‚Äôs early entry price and momentum may be difficult to overlook. As technical setups mature for ETH and DOGE, investors are increasingly evaluating emerging platforms. The broader trend suggests that future winners may not be the current leaders, but rather the projects laying groundwork today.

47059543,https://thecoinrise.com/web3-ais-0-000443-price-holds-strong-roi-potential-while-sol-link-show-signs-of-strong-breakouts/,1751241620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/47059543.jpeg,Web3 ai‚Äôs $0.000443 Price Holds Strong ROI Potential While SOL & LINK Show Signs of Strong Breakouts,https://thecoinrise.com/web3-ais-0-000443-price-holds-strong-roi-potential-while-sol-link-show-signs-of-strong-breakouts/,"Solana (SOL) is gaining traction within an ascending triangle, a technical setup often followed by sharp price moves. If this scenario plays out, SOL could surge 30% and reach $180. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) has gained momentum following its involvement in a central bank trial in Hong Kong. LINK rose 9% in a single day and continues drawing institutional interest. Unlike SOL and LINK, which rely on external triggers, Web3 ai ($WAI) builds internal value. WAI gives users access to a wide range of AI features and burns with each use, cutting total supply. Currently priced at $0.000443 in Stage 9, WAI is expected to list at $0.005242. Web3 ai has now raised over $8.5 million and is gaining steady traction. Solana: Breakout Pattern Could Lift Price Toward $180 Solana (SOL) continues to build within a bullish triangle, marked by resistance between $140 and $145 and higher support levels. This setup generally leads to a price spike. A break above $145 could open the way for SOL to approach $180. Rising volume and on-chain strength are backing the pattern. SOL has maintained key levels, and increased volume hints at stronger market confidence. Traders are keeping a close eye on a close above $145, with stop-losses likely placed just below the trendline. Should the move slow, the triangle may hold longer, offering another entry near $135. This setup gives a clear technical roadmap for short-term gains, making Solana a top crypto to buy now. Chainlink: Strong Price Move After CBDC Integration Chainlink (LINK) recently enabled a successful trial of digital asset transfers between a Hong Kong dollar and an Australian dollar stablecoin. This was achieved using its CCIP technology, linking public blockchains like Ethereum to private systems in real-time. Following the news, LINK jumped more than 9% in a single day, crossing $15 and outperforming major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Market indicators support the rise. Volatility dropped, and metrics like open interest and derivatives activity rose, showing solid market engagement. With support holding at $12.64 and a breakout in progress above $15, LINK could soon reach $16. Its involvement in national-level blockchain use cases continues to boost its position as one of the top cryptos to buy now. Web3 ai‚Äôs Price Under $0.001 Sets Up A 1747% Growth Potential Web3 ai is getting close to its main launch, and the current stage may be the last chance to enter at low prices. The team is rapidly working on software tools, a new user interface, and cross-chain functionality. All features are already under testing. With beta access scheduled for Q4, prices are projected to rise to $0.005242, a 1747% jump from the current $0.000443 in Stage 9. Over $8.5 million has been raised so far, covering development, audits, marketing, and liquidity planning. The platform will offer several AI-based features for daily crypto use, and every time a tool runs, WAI is burned. This shrinking supply increases demand. With a price still under a cent, Web3 ai is positioned as a strong option for those eyeing value-driven projects. As demand builds and features roll out, missing this entry may not be an option for long. The Bottom Line Both Solana and Chainlink show promise through strong setups and broader use. But they depend on outside news to sustain moves. Web3 ai‚Äôs WAI, on the other hand, is driven by built-in use and active scarcity. Priced at $0.000443, WAI could deliver a 1747% gain ahead of listing. Each feature burns supply, building long-term traction. While traders wait for SOL and LINK breakouts, WAI is already moving on clear fundamentals.

47059356,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=169928,1751241623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/47059356.jpeg,"Could XRP Still Hit a 20x ROI Target, or Will This Political Meme Crypto Achieve It First in 2025?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-xrp-still-hit-a-20x-roi-target-or-will-this-political-meme-crypto-achieve-it-first-in-2025/,"XRP has long been a symbol of crypto‚Äôs push for legitimacy ‚Äî backed by years of legal battles, institutional alignment, and infrastructure growth. But as 2025 unfolds, investors are asking a sharper question: Can XRP still deliver the type of exponential returns the altcoin market is known for? Or is the next big move already taking shape in a very different corner of the market ‚Äî one dominated not by financial institutions, but by political meme momentum? XRP‚Äôs Institutional Play: Maturity Meets Uncertainty Expectations of stronger institutional support have helped XRP weather market turbulence over the last few months. Technical analysis is still divided; some analysts point to hesitations close to important resistance zones, while others highlight strength in the setup as a whole. The token‚Äôs visibility has grown, particularly as U.S.-based financial entities inch closer to offering full-fledged crypto products tied to XRP. Major exchanges are getting ready for wider integration, and a number of futures-based instruments have already been approved. However, XRP‚Äôs long-term growth outlook is no longer just about infrastructure ‚Äî it‚Äôs now intertwined with regulatory rulings, Ripple‚Äôs evolving stablecoin strategy, and whether legacy use cases still resonate in a market increasingly driven by speed and sentiment. Ripple‚Äôs Stablecoin Focus May Blur XRP‚Äôs Role Ripple‚Äôs internal strategy has taken a decisive turn. Rather than positioning XRP as a backbone for international payments, the focus has shifted to a native stablecoin offering ‚Äî a move many in the industry see as a bet on reliability and integration over volatility. This change, while potentially strategic, has also introduced confusion around XRP‚Äôs long-term utility. With Ripple pushing a new financial product to meet the same use case, some investors are questioning whether XRP can continue to deliver growth at scale ‚Äî or whether it‚Äôs becoming more of a macro-aligned hedge than a vehicle for rapid gains. Meme Coin Mechanics: MAGACOIN FINANCE Grabs Attention While XRP‚Äôs future plays out through courtrooms and regulatory filings, another player is being discussed in analyst circles and trading groups: MAGACOIN FINANCE, a politically-charged meme token designed to tap into culture, momentum, and speculative capital. Unlike XRP, which is tied to legacy ambitions and enterprise partnerships, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built for market speed. Its structure is straightforward: viral branding, fast-moving narratives, and investor excitement around high-multiple return potential. According to several market observers, early-stage metrics and buying patterns suggest that this token may be positioning for a major upside move. Though speculative, internal forecasts in some reports are starting to model scenarios where 20x returns are not off the table. Two Very Different Roads to ROI The 2025 market is shaping up to reward both structure and sentiment ‚Äî but likely not in equal measure. XRP represents a long-term bet on institutional normalization, built on regulatory wins and financial integrations. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, operates on fast cycles, driven by participation waves and meme-based conviction. For ROI-focused traders, the decision comes down to timing and risk appetite. Do they wait for regulatory clarity and ETF momentum to potentially push XRP forward ‚Äî or do they act earlier on a high-volatility asset like MAGACOIN FINANCE that thrives on attention and rapid entry flows? MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Cross the Finish Line First While XRP‚Äôs journey is far from over, the altcoin market rarely rewards patience over momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its viral edge and growing presence among early adopters, may be first to hit a high-multiple return mark in this cycle. Analysts aren‚Äôt comparing the two in function ‚Äî but in outcome. And the outcome that matters most to investors right now? Return on entry. Whether or not XRP reaches its full potential this year, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly making the case that it could be the one to get there first.

Completely wrong. Six months into 2025, Trump‚Äôs presidency has bulldozed nearly every assumption Wall Street made about markets, inflation, and the strength of the US economy. What was supposed to be a year of American dominance, driven by Trump‚Äôs low-tax and high-tariff policies, turned into something else entirely. According to Bloomberg, those policies triggered fear, confusion, and some of the wildest price action seen in years. The fallout started fast. Massive moves in sovereign bonds kicked things off. Then the Japanese yen climbed nearly 9% against the dollar. Emerging markets began attracting attention again. But the real shock came from where traders least expected: the US dollar, stocks, and Trump‚Äôs own economic agenda. All of it got shredded, and the market‚Äôs golden trades are nowhere to be found. Trump‚Äôs policies weaken the dollar and blindside investors At the beginning of the year, the bet was simple: Trump‚Äôs economic plans would drive inflation higher, slow down any chance of Federal Reserve rate cuts, and push the dollar even higher. That‚Äôs not what happened. A Bloomberg index tracking the US currency posted its worst start to a year since 2005. The selloff was deep. The shock was global. Things escalated in April when Trump rolled out his ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs ‚Äî wide-reaching, aggressive penalties that rattled investor confidence. The impact was brutal. Worries over a possible US recession took hold, and traders started to believe Trump might be actively trying to weaken the dollar to help domestic industry. That‚Äôs a problem for the American government. It still depends on foreign investors to finance its massive debt pile. A weaker dollar means smaller returns for those investors. It also means less faith in US assets. JPMorgan strategist Meera Chandan said the dollar‚Äôs fading connection to interest rates and equities might reflect deeper cracks in its foundation. Her team expects another 2% drop in dollar strength by year-end. Banks like Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale, and JPMorgan had all expected the dollar to stay strong through the first half of the year. They were wrong. They thought it would lose value slowly, maybe late in the year. No one called this early collapse. US stocks crash, rebound, and leave traders confused Wall Street was all-in on American equities in January. Everyone had their chips on artificial intelligence and the strength of the US economy. The Nasdaq 100 was flying high. Then the crash came. Between February and April, almost $7 trillion in market cap vanished from the index. The optimism died quick. Part of the reason? China‚Äôs DeepSeek. The AI startup came out of nowhere and suddenly looked like a real threat to American tech dominance. That was the first crack. Then Trump‚Äôs tariff decisions added real fear that the US economy could stall. A March survey from Bank of America showed fund managers had pulled out of US stocks in record numbers. By April, bulls were gone. There was no upside, no appetite for risk, but then Trump did what nobody expected, pausing some of the harshest tariffs, which flipped everything. The S&P 500 exploded to new highs, the economy kept humming, and tech stocks got hot again, thanks to strong earnings and consistent growth. Large investors jumped back in by mid-April, and they haven‚Äôt backed off. The chaos showed how fast Trump‚Äôs policies can change market behavior. He introduced tariffs that helped drive stocks into a hole. Then he paused them and turned everything around. None of it was stable. Every trader caught off guard was forced to rethink their whole strategy. While the US dollar crumbled, the yen got stronger. At the start of the year, investors were already betting on Japan. The Bank of Japan was one of the few central banks expected to raise rates in 2025, while others were looking to cut. That alone made the yen look good. But then Trump added fuel to the fire. As markets reacted to Trump‚Äôs trade moves and the rising threat of recession, traders looked for safety. The yen, always seen as a haven in times of stress, was the obvious play. By June, it had gained nearly 9% against the dollar. It was one of the best performing currencies all year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

While traders react to the latest swings, savvy investors are using this moment to reposition. In the midst of these moves, one project is drawing increasing attention from analysts and early-stage investors alike: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum Faces Congestion and Innovation Pressures Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform, but its performance is being challenged by both internal and external factors. Ongoing concerns over network congestion and the complexity of scaling solutions have triggered fluctuating sentiment. While Ethereum‚Äôs roadmap toward full scalability is promising, short-term uncertainty is leading some traders to reduce exposure temporarily. This has created a rare opening for repositioning capital into emerging sectors of the crypto space. Cardano Struggles to Maintain Narrative Momentum Cardano, known for its research-driven approach and proof-of-stake model, has faced difficulties maintaining investor momentum. While its development team continues to roll out upgrades, the pace of real-world adoption has lagged behind expectations. This contrast between long-term potential and short-term indecision is sparking mixed reactions across technical and fundamental analysis circles. For investors seeking more immediate ROI catalysts, capital is starting to shift toward opportunities with stronger short-term positioning. XRP Enters Regulatory Clarity Phase Following major breakthroughs in the U.S. and Canadian regulatory landscape, XRP has entered a transitional phase. While analysts applaud developments such as the Canadian spot XRP ETF and mounting approval odds in the U.S., the asset‚Äôs near-term performance remains heavily influenced by institutional sentiment and ETF timelines. With XRP largely viewed as a longer-term play tied to legal and regulatory outcomes, some investors are reallocating to opportunities that carry more aggressive upside during this rotation window. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gaining Ground in Smart Capital Circles Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a token of interest among investors seeking asymmetric gains. Analysts highlight its scarcity-driven token model, external audit confirmation, and rising traction in investor research platforms. Previous stages sold out instantly, and the project continues to show strong momentum without relying on short-term hype cycles. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is its intrinsic design for structural growth ‚Äî a rare quality in a market filled with fleeting narratives. Positioned at the intersection of political themes and forward-looking infrastructure, the token is increasingly viewed as a strategic allocation for those preparing ahead of a potential market-wide surge in Q4 2025. Final Thoughts The current volatility in Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP isn‚Äôt a warning sign ‚Äî it‚Äôs a signal. For seasoned investors, these periods offer a chance to rebalance and realign. And in that realignment, high-upside, early-position tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are becoming part of the serious conversation. Whether you‚Äôre planning for the next rotation or preparing to capitalize on the next wave of retail momentum, the smartest moves often happen during moments of doubt. As institutional and retail dynamics continue to shift, the time to evaluate next-phase opportunities ‚Äî especially those with structural potential ‚Äî is now.

Hype coins are being pushed aside, and coins with real systems and working platforms are getting more attention. Among the names catching eyes are BlockDAG, Avalanche, Cosmos, and Cardano. These projects are making noise with their features and long-term promise. Each one brings a different angle to the table, but BlockDAG is moving quickly with its system upgrades and offers an attractive entry price. If you‚Äôre trying to find the top altcoins to buy today, this article will walk you through the latest info on these coins and explain why BlockDAG may be heading for a major rise. 1. BlockDAG: High-Speed Growth with 2,660% Return Already Seen BlockDAG is gaining traction fast, with strong presale figures and regular tech upgrades. So far, the project has raised $323.5 million and sold 23.3 billion coins, creating a solid path forward. It‚Äôs now in stage 29, priced at $0.0080 for a limited time. Those who bought in at stage 1 have already seen their holdings grow by 2,660%. With a projected listing value of $0.05, the current price point could lead to 16x gains. BlockDAG‚Äôs system includes its X1 app, which has drawn in over 2 million users already. The rollout of its mining devices, like the X30 and X100, is expected in July and August. After the recent GO LIVE reveal, the project confirmed listings on 20 exchanges, helping with easy market entry. With full audits from Halborn and CertiK, the project‚Äôs system is also backed by strong safety checks. If you‚Äôre reviewing the top altcoins to buy today, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as a top choice with both strong numbers and rapid platform growth. 2. Avalanche: Dealing with Dips but Showing Future Promise Avalanche (AVAX) has been bouncing between price zones, currently near $16.83 after dipping into the $15.72 to $17.13 range. Some expect a short-term slide below $15.50, but others remain hopeful for a rebound. Despite recent price swings, Avalanche remains active in DeFi use cases and keeps building its user base. It still deserves a spot on any list of top altcoins to buy today. With real apps and strong usage in decentralised systems, it shows that its network is still strong. While quick profits may be delayed, Avalanche could turn into a great option when market conditions improve. Keep it on your radar as it works on regaining its footing. 3. Cardano: Near Support, Ready for a Comeback Cardano (ADA) trades around $0.54, down from its past peak of $0.60. The price has fallen 6.5% lately, but the chart signals suggest it may be oversold. If ADA holds the $0.513 support line, a recovery could follow. Its base remains steady due to strong building activity. With over 2,000 projects underway and lots of large transfers happening, Cardano continues to push ahead. One key metric showing belief in ADA is the withdrawal of over $932 million from exchanges in 2024. Although it‚Äôs not the fastest mover, Cardano remains one of the top altcoins to buy today because of its steady platform upgrades and active user interest. 4. Cosmos: Focused Work Behind the Scenes Cosmos (ATOM) sits around $3.78, with support close to $3.60 and upper resistance between $3.87 and $4.00. The coin hasn‚Äôt shown major upward movement lately, but updates are coming regularly. The project has made solid steps with the IBC Eureka and Tokenomics 2.0 changes, strengthening its spot in cross-chain and DeFi tools. Links with Ethereum via IBC and its part in CBDC pilots show that Cosmos is slowly expanding its role. Even with sideways trading, Cosmos remains backed by its strong network and active dev team. For those hunting the top altcoins to buy today, Cosmos could reward patient holders as new upgrades are adopted. Final Say! Crypto continues to evolve, and different coins bring different strengths to the table. Cosmos offers cross-chain power, Cardano keeps growing its base, and Avalanche pushes forward in the DeFi space. But among these, BlockDAG shines with strong presale numbers and fast tech growth. With $323.5 million raised and a clear target of $0.05 on launch, BlockDAG‚Äôs $0.0080 price gives room for over 500% ROI. Plus, early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth since the first stage. With its large user base, upcoming mining tools, and 20 listings revealed during its GO LIVE announcement, BlockDAG is building fast. If you‚Äôre picking the top altcoins to buy today , all four projects deserve attention, but BlockDAG may offer the fastest path to returns.

They‚Äôve survived bear markets, attracted institutional backing, and delivered real-world utility. But in a market that rewards early positioning, many investors are now turning their attention to a new crop of undervalued tokens. At the top of that list is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project that‚Äôs gaining momentum fast‚Äîand could surprise even seasoned holders of XRP and Ethereum. Ethereum remains the smart contract standard, Avalanche offers fast execution and interoperability, and XRP is reclaiming relevance in global payments following regulatory clarity. Yet for all their strength, the upside on these large caps is starting to look capped‚Äîat least in the short term. That‚Äôs pushed many investors to scan the presale landscape for the kind of opportunities that don‚Äôt show up twice in a cycle. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Catching Serious Attention MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as more than just another presale. With a DeFi lending model, a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, it‚Äôs hitting all the right notes with early-stage investors. What‚Äôs driving the buzz isn‚Äôt just the low entry‚Äîit‚Äôs the speed of adoption. Wallet growth is climbing, and analysts are beginning to flag it as one of the few presales with both momentum and actual mechanics behind the hype. Unlike some of the smaller projects riding on promises, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rolling out with clear fundamentals and a roadmap that aligns with current DeFi trends. Its early appeal echoes the breakout stories of past cycles, where coins like Shiba Inu and Pepe caught fire‚Äîbut this time with a more structured financial use case. It‚Äôs also outpacing other new entrants like Mutuum Finance and Solaxy, which, while promising in their own right, haven‚Äôt matched the presale traction or community engagement that MAGACOIN FINANCE has managed to ignite. The difference? MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a coin that understands how to turn hype into movement‚Äîand possibly movement into serious returns. Not a Replacement‚ÄîBut a Strategic Addition Investors aren‚Äôt abandoning Ethereum or XRP. But they are recalibrating. There‚Äôs growing recognition that the next wave of wealth in crypto won‚Äôt just come from blue-chip assets. It‚Äôll come from spotting the winners before the rest of the market does. That‚Äôs where MAGACOIN FINANCE has found its lane‚Äîan early-stage coin with just enough heat to suggest it‚Äôs not a fluke, and just enough risk to keep the upside compelling. Of course, this isn‚Äôt without risk. Every presale project walks a tightrope between promise and execution. But for investors who understand that calculated bets are how generational gains are made in crypto, MAGACOIN FINANCE checks a lot of boxes. It‚Äôs early. It‚Äôs cheap. It‚Äôs growing. And it hasn‚Äôt hit an exchange yet. As the market heads into the second half of 2025, the split is becoming clearer: the coins that already made their run, and the ones that still have room to surprise. MAGACOIN FINANCE may not be a household name yet‚Äîbut neither was Dogecoin, until it was.

On X, his announcement was accompanied by a photo displaying an XRP logo tattoo on his arm, marking his belief in the project‚Äôs future for life. The tattoo quickly went viral after crypto influencer Digital Asset Investor shared it on his X feed. He noted that getting a tattoo, especially for someone over 50 with a Harvard M.B.A., wasn‚Äôt just a casual show of support. It signalled a deep, long-term belief. Garlinghouse replied with just two words: ‚Äú1,000%.‚Äù Ripple ends legal war with SEC The long battle between Ripple and the SEC is winding down. While the company had initially resisted the court‚Äôs conclusion that sales of institutional XRP were securities, it has since withdrawn its cross-appeal. This is a tactical retreat, and it‚Äôs evidence that Ripple is ready to proceed. Earlier this month, Judge Analisa Torres denied a coordinated plea from Ripple and the SEC for an indicative ruling. With the case stalled, Ripple decided not to push the litigation on the final prong regarding institutional sales. Instead, the firm will respect the court order and look for lawful opportunities to distribute XRP to institutions. Brad Garlinghouse announced the company‚Äôs new posture in a public statement that they had closed that chapter once and for all, and they can now focus on the most important place ‚Äì building the Internet of Value. Ripple has used the term ‚ÄúInternet of Value‚Äù for a while now to describe its larger goal‚Äîfrictionless cross-border asset transfer in worldwide payment systems. Now, with the shackles of litigation off its wrists, Ripple is increasingly zeroing in on realizing its vision. Ripple drives XRP ecosystem growth with renewed focus Ripple‚Äôs pivot towards development & expansion is already paying off. In June, the XRP Ledger witnessed a more than 7x spike in daily active addresses, indicating higher network usage. At the same time, transaction volume is increasing, indicating more use of XRP in real-world use and trading. Market sentiment has also shifted. The buzz around a US-approved XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) is building after Canada greenlit three XRP ETFs just days ago. Analysts think there‚Äôs a 95% chance XRP ETF will be here soon. This would make XRP available to institutional buyers and retirement accounts, driving liquidity and confidence in the market. Ripple has released version 2.5.0 of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This release includes substantial power enhancements and sets XRPL apart from its nearest competition with Ethereum and Solana. The improvements include faster and less expensive throughput and compatibility with smart contracts, fundamentals for developers who intend to build DApps on XRP. The update also improves the XRPL‚Äôs chain interoperability, a requirement in the future of finance. However, in the growing layer-1 blockchain space, the upgrade signals that Ripple wants to be a force once again, not just for a payments protocol but as a dApp development and execution platform, too.

S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures both rose by 0.1%, while Dow futures climbed 130 points, or 0.3%, according to data from CNBC. The market is now grinding toward the end of a strong month, even with global trade threats still lingering under Donald Trump‚Äôs second term. Traders are reacting fast to every development, but so far, the worst of Trump‚Äôs tariff moves haven‚Äôt hit, and that‚Äôs kept money flowing into stocks. The gains come after weeks of volatile headlines out of Washington and Beijing, with investors watching every trade comment. For now, the fear that tariff threats might become full-blown policies hasn‚Äôt played out. That relief helped the S&P 500 rally 4.4% in June. The Nasdaq, stacked with tech names, is up almost 6.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added around 3.7%. This rally has been fast and loud. Just two months ago in April, the S&P 500 was nearly 18% underwater for the year. Now it‚Äôs closing out the month with a fresh four-month high, finishing Friday‚Äôs session 0.5% higher at 6,173.07, overtaking the previous record of 6,147.43. Indexes break records while earnings chatter grows louder The Nasdaq Composite ended Friday at an all-time high too, rising 0.5% by the close. The Dow finished the week nearly 1% higher. The move wasn‚Äôt just driven by lower fear around trade. Company earnings are starting to guide the conversation again. John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet, said more S&P 500 companies are giving optimistic guidance than usual. Of the 110 companies that have issued EPS guidance so far for the second quarter, 51 issued upbeat projections. That‚Äôs better than the five-year average of 42 and the 10-year average of 39. Still, it‚Äôs not all sunshine. 59 companies gave negative EPS guidance. Even though some companies are hopeful, the actual growth rate for Q2 is expected to be slower. John said the estimated year-over-year earnings growth is around 5%, which would be the weakest since the final quarter of 2023. That contrast between good vibes and slowing numbers is exactly what‚Äôs keeping traders from going all-in. Everyone‚Äôs bullish, but no one wants to be caught holding the bag. Europe runs ahead of Wall Street while Asia follows cautiously Across the Atlantic, European markets outperformed their US peers in the first half of 2025. The Stoxx 600, covering broad European stocks, is up 7% year-to-date. Germany‚Äôs DAX has soared 20%, Italy‚Äôs FTSE MIB is up 16%, and Spain‚Äôs IBEX 35 has also climbed 20%. Even the UK‚Äôs FTSE 100, usually more sluggish, is up 7.7%. But the rally is making analysts nervous. Some are unsure if Europe can keep up the momentum, especially with the eurozone‚Äôs own political mess brewing. Asian markets opened higher Monday as investors worked through industrial production numbers from Japan and South Korea, plus manufacturing activity from China. Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 was up 1.13% in early trading. The Topix index also rose 0.77%. Over in Seoul, the Kospi added 0.63%, while the smaller-cap Kosdaq went flat. Australia‚Äôs ASX 200 opened 0.3% higher. In Hong Kong, futures for the Hang Seng Index pointed to a weak open, standing at 24,182. That‚Äôs below Friday‚Äôs close of 24,284.15. Away from stocks, gold stayed soft. It dropped after two straight weeks of losses, with risk appetite taking over. Investors are waiting for Trump‚Äôs administration to finalize multiple trade deals before the July 9 deadline. That risk-on mood is cutting into demand for safe-haven assets. Early Monday, bullion dropped as much as 0.8%, before recovering some of those losses. As of 8:24 a.m. local time, spot gold was down 0.2% to $3,269.16 per ounce. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was off 0.1%. Silver and palladium also fell, while platinum rose. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

But while DOGE builds slowly on familiar sentiment, a lesser-known coin is quietly outpacing expectations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.03 in the fifth phase of its presale, now over 40% sold out. Phase 5 buyers are set for a guaranteed profit of 100% ROI at launch. The project has already raised over $11.2 million, gaining serious momentum even as broader market sentiment leans cautious. For those wondering what crypto to invest in ahead of the next breakout cycle, the narrative is shifting, and Mutuum Finance may be writing its first chapter right now. Dogecoin Eyes $0.17 Milestone Amid Meme-Coin Rebound Dogecoin (DOGE) has recovered back to approximately find itself hovering at around 0.166 and is further supported by a 6-7 percent surge in price over the last 24 hours as it broke out of an important decline you star. This rebound marks the emerging interest in retail, and better technical energy, and on-chain metrics and whale amassing suggest further short-term momentum. Nevertheless, DOGE is held back by resistance on overheads at about $0.17-$0.18, an indication it is slowly rising but does not have a giant breakout. With the meme-coin market picking up the buzz once again, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging quietly as an alternative DeFi project. Mutuum Finance Hits $11.2 Million Funded Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on the move in popularity terms.

47064261,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=169938,1751247024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/47064261.jpeg,"XRP, Ethereum, and Solana Might Miss Next Crypto Wave ‚Äî Analysts Favor This Perfectly Timed Altcoin",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-ethereum-and-solana-might-miss-next-crypto-wave-analysts-favor-this-perfectly-timed-altcoin/,"XRP, Ethereum, and Solana have long been seen as the engines of the altcoin market. Their names are synonymous with resilience, utility, and institutional adoption. But with crypto markets entering a new rotation phase, some analysts now believe these established leaders may not lead the next wave of explosive growth. Instead, attention is shifting to earlier-stage altcoins‚Äîparticularly MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äîwhich some say could mirror the breakout patterns that propelled Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin in past cycles. This isn‚Äôt a dismissal of the major players. Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance, NFTs, and enterprise-level applications. Solana has achieved rare mainstream visibility, backed by powerful investor narratives and growing retail enthusiasm. XRP, after years of regulatory uncertainty, is regaining momentum on the back of possible ETF listings and settlement innovations. These coins aren‚Äôt going anywhere. But what they offer in stability, they may now lack in raw upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE Taps Into the Early-Mover Advantage A growing number of analysts argue the next generation of wealth-building in crypto will come from projects still in their early stages‚Äîthose with untapped narratives, viral community backing, and enough momentum to ride a full bull cycle from the ground up. That‚Äôs where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in. Unlike the blue-chip names that have already logged massive gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE is just getting started. Its presale phase has attracted a surge of attention, fueled by a low entry price and an emerging base of early supporters who view it as a high-risk, high-reward contender. What‚Äôs drawing comparisons to the early days of Dogecoin and Solana isn‚Äôt just the marketing. It‚Äôs the timing. MAGACOIN FINANCE is landing at a moment when retail and institutional traders alike are hungry for fresh narratives‚Äîtokens with room to move and communities eager to rally. The core of MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs appeal is its blend of meme coin virality and financial utility. It‚Äôs not just a token riding hype. It‚Äôs being built on a DeFi lending framework that positions it to participate in deeper, long-term conversations around value and use. This dual identity‚Äîas both a speculative play and a product with planned functionality‚Äîis what some analysts believe gives it a shot at outperforming more mature coins that may now struggle to recreate their historic gains. Market Rotation Is Fueling the Shift Toward Early-Stage Altcoins The trend behind this shift is called capital rotation. As coins like Ethereum and Solana consolidate after massive runs, liquidity begins to flow into smaller-cap projects with room for exponential growth. That rotation is already underway, and analysts say the conditions are now ideal for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to step into the spotlight. It has a story. It has a base. And critically, it hasn‚Äôt yet priced in the kind of parabolic move that defined the last cycle‚Äôs breakout winners. None of this makes MAGACOIN FINANCE a sure thing. It‚Äôs still early, untested, and entirely dependent on sustained traction. But that‚Äôs also why the upside is being taken seriously. The same could be said of Dogecoin when it was trading under a cent, or Solana when it was just another smart contract chain fighting for market share. Early-stage altcoins are where conviction meets risk‚Äîand sometimes, that mix delivers outsized rewards. XRP, Ethereum, and Solana will still move with the market. They will benefit from ETF momentum, institutional adoption, and long-term ecosystem growth. But according to a growing chorus of analysts, the next real breakout may come from outside the old guard. In 2021, that role belonged to Solana. In 2025, it might belong to MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Among them, TRON, Pi Network, and Sei Network are not just surviving but thriving, driven by unique market conditions and investor sentiment. This detailed exploration provides insights into why these digital assets are currently in the spotlight. Enhanced with insights from Outset PR , this analysis navigates the complexities of the crypto market, providing a clear view of how strategic public relations can elevate a project's visibility and traction. TRON (TRX): A Model of Resilience and Potential TRON's consistency in the market is noteworthy. Amidst the usual crypto volatility, TRX has maintained a stable trading range, positing itself as a robust component of any crypto portfolio. The current trading range of TRON is between $0.26 and $0.29, with an immediate resistance at $0.31. Should TRX breach this threshold, it could target the $0.33 mark, translating to a near 15% gain. Such movements underscore its potential for steady gains. Technical View: The alignment of its simple moving averages and moderate RSI and Stochastic readings suggest a balanced technical posture without strong bearish or bullish biases. Thus, TRX presents a stable asset for cautious investors looking for gradual growth. Source: TradingView Pi Network (PI): A Dark Horse Poised for Recovery Pi Network's recent trading activities show significant volatility with a downward trend last month. However, current indicators and market sentiment suggest a potential recovery. Should Pi Network overcome the immediate resistance near eighty cents, it could climb to a more robust price point, offering investors substantial returns. Data Source: CoinMarketCap Sei Network (SEI): Indicators of Upcoming Gains Sei Network, though experiencing a recent dip, shows signs of an impending surge. The altcoin's technical indicators demonstrate a preparation for a bullish reversal, potentially increasing its value by 30% if it surpasses the $0.23 mark. Market Position: With a support level believed to be around 15 cents and recent upticks in weekly gains, Sei Network could be gearing up for a notable ascent in its valuation.

XRP Investors Believe So,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoin-finance-be-the-most-talked-about-crypto-by-late-2025-xrp-investors-believe-so/,"The second half of 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal time in the digital asset market. As established names like XRP continue to push through key resistance zones, investors are simultaneously identifying a new name making quiet but significant waves: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts tracking macro sentiment shifts say it‚Äôs not just another speculative project. It‚Äôs increasingly being viewed as a high-upside play‚Äîparticularly by experienced holders of long-standing tokens like XRP. XRP Momentum and Market Shifts XRP has stuck to the headlines throughout much of 2025 despite the constant volatility. It recently bounced back from critical technical levels, supported by institutional inflows and movements from large wallets. On-chain metrics reveal whales moving hundreds of millions without selling‚Äîa rarity that usually indicates conviction. However, with XRP‚Äôs renewed momentum, some long-time investors are reshuffling their bags. The reason? They want to secure a potential large gain before it becomes popular. Enter MAGACOIN FINANCE. A New Crypto Contender Catching Fire MAGACOIN FINANCE is being talked about more frequently in private forums, research desk briefings, and early-stage investor groups. It‚Äôs drawing attention not just for its mechanics, but for its timing‚Äîemerging at a point when capital rotation into fresh narratives is accelerating. Among the many altcoins vying for attention, one presale stands out: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Backed by a scarcity-driven model and a fixed token structure, it‚Äôs already attracting capital from sophisticated investors rotating out of larger-cap assets. Analysts have ranked it as one of the top presale cryptocurrencies for 2025 ‚Äî and early buyers are already sitting on substantial returns. With a verified audit, no VC control, and rising demand, momentum is building fast. Analyst Projections Fuel the Conversation Research desks have begun flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout in long-term strategy reports. Unlike speculative plays based on hype, this project is gaining traction on fundamentals‚Äîscarcity design, market fit, and investor behavior patterns. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a project that insiders can‚Äôt stop talking about. The meme coin leader, say evermore crypto analysts. And not because it is hype-driven. However, design and branding, as well as early adoption behaviour, draw attention. As more people become aware of a product, it is not surprising to see a surge in sales. Buyers are making high-conviction moves, which are gaining momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE has shown the first signs of breakout-level traction, and analysts believe it may become one of the top-three cryptocurrencies on all major exchanges by H2 2025. Why XRP Investors Are Paying Close Attention XRP investors are known for their resilience, research orientation, and appetite for asymmetric bets. As a group, they‚Äôve historically been among the earliest adopters of emerging trends, from regulatory arbitrage to utility-based ecosystems. What‚Äôs driving it? It‚Äôs not just meme energy. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly turning into a narrative coin of the cycle‚Äîone that merges pop culture, politics, and early-stage investor hype in a way that‚Äôs creating massive network effects. Unlike most low-cap tokens that vanish after launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE is hitting all the right psychological and strategic triggers. It‚Äôs got a capped supply, rapid retail demand, and a wave of community-led content fueling viral growth. Final Thoughts: Momentum Meets Timing The digital asset space is still rewarding entry and narratives going into 2025. XRP appears strong and is beyond the ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù stage while the buzz around MAGACOIN FINANCE is hard to miss. It‚Äôs not about who has what; it‚Äôs about when momentum and timing collide with structural scarcity. Many members believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the name that rocks the crypto circle as the year closes out.

Older Layer 1 networks keep evolving, while utility-focused platforms are now gaining strong attention. Alongside, regulatory changes and global company interest are shaping the way success is measured in crypto. Projects showing traction before launch, worldwide partnerships, and strong scaling ability are taking leading positions. BlockDAG is one such project, seeing fast growth in its presale and user base. Solana and XRP are seeing stronger market confidence, while Avalanche is focusing on expanding its GameFi network. Here is a detailed look at four ecosystems defining success this year. BlockDAG: $324M Raised, 2 Million Users, Strong Pre-Launch Ecosystem BlockDAG has reached one of the largest presales, raising over $324 million with 23.3 billion coins sold. Its unique system combines DAG and Proof-of-Work to handle 2,000‚Äì15,000 transactions each second. The EVM support makes developer onboarding simple. Its X1 Miner App already has over 2 million users, and more than 18,000 ASIC miners have been bought. A 100 million coin airdrop has started, covering testnet, presale, social, and referrals to build its ecosystem firmly. Its US-based sponsorship and 20 revealed exchange listings add strong backing. Currently in Batch 29, BlockDAG (BDAG) Network‚Äôs price is $0.0080, with early buyers seeing a 2,660% growth in their funds since Batch 1. The roadmap shows a six-week final rollout before its Q4 2025 listing, giving an important window for early participants. Solana: ETF Filing and Global Deals Lift Price Solana rose from $127 to $146 this week as geopolitical risks eased and institutional interest returned. The fresh filing of a spot SOL ETF by Galaxy and Invesco indicates deeper Wall Street involvement. On the development side, Solana has launched tools to prevent sandwich attacks and is working with Kazakhstan for tokenization systems. Major firms are also exploring Solana. Payment leader Fiserv plans stablecoin use on Solana‚Äôs network. Despite market swings, Solana‚Äôs DeFi locked value and daily user count keep growing, cementing its place as one of the most supported networks. Ripple (XRP): Whale Buying, Rules Progress, and Ledger Boosts XRP climbed from $1.90 to $2.20 this week due to heavy whale buying and important upgrades. Its new XRP Ledger 2.5.0 brings batch payments, escrow functions, and DEX controls, making it better for large users. Ripple has also secured over 50 US money transmitter licenses, supporting its stablecoin RLUSD launch. At Apex 2025, Ripple shared expansion plans, pushing market optimism. Analysts now target $2.40 as the next price level, with whale activity and clear rules supporting XRP‚Äôs growth path. Avalanche (AVAX): Gaming Subnets Drive Activity Avalanche price remains around $17.70, but its ecosystem is seeing big moves. GameFi subnets are becoming popular, with Beam and GUNZ recording high transactions. Web3 games like Off The Grid and MapleStory N are seeing millions of NFT mints and user gains. Daily transactions have crossed one million after recent upgrades. Developer attraction remains high due to grants and hackathons. Though its price has yet to rise with on-chain growth, many believe AVAX will jump once broader conditions improve, as it maintains strong developer support and scalable design. Final Thoughts! What makes the best cryptos right now ? It‚Äôs about strong networks, user numbers, developer work, and real-world use. BlockDAG is fast becoming a major name with a record presale and solid systems. Solana‚Äôs ETF filing and business links keep it in focus. Ripple‚Äôs legal clarity and whale demand make it stronger for the future. Avalanche‚Äôs GameFi success shows niche power. Whether it is early players like BlockDAG or major coins like Solana and XRP, traction before excitement remains the key.

The move , approved by shareholders on June 29, signals a significant departure of the company from previous financial policies , pushing it to the vanguard of corporate adoption of Bitcoin in Spain. A new solution for Bitcoin adherents, the firm has so far purchased 54 BTC, worth around ‚Ç¨5.8 million at current prices, and is also eyeing wider expansions. In a recent filing with BME Growth ‚Äî Spain‚Äôs growth division for small- and medium-sized enterprises ‚Äî Vanadi hinted that they wished to become the largest business holder of Bitcoin in Spain. Vanadi‚Äôs stock price went parabolic following the company‚Äôs Bitcoin play, increasing more than threefold in June. The increase marks an apparent increase in investor appetite for companies leveraging digital assets as a treasury strategy . Vanadi had said in its translated announcement: ‚ÄúSimilar to companies such as Strategy or Metaplanet, Vanadi Coffee redefines its business model and will use Bitcoin as its main reserve asset and accumulate large amounts of Bitcoin as part of its treasury.‚Äù The company is looking to replicate the high-wager Bitcoin treasury models of Strategy, which holds over 200,000 BTC, and Metaplanet. The Japanese firm has recently tweaked its balance sheet policy to the pro-Bitcoin side. Vanadi struggles to recover with a Bitcoin bet Vanadi‚Äôs had been struggling financially and operationally; its 2024 financial statement lists that it was operating at a loss of ‚Ç¨3.3m, an increase of 15.8% from the previous period. Competition and operating costs have eaten away at profitability bit by bit as the cost of coffee has risen ever higher, dragging the firm further into financial strain. Meanwhile, Vanadi was looking for more money to build long-term. It received two large investment offers in May. One was from a tiny local software consultancy, a one-man outfit in Alicante, and he offered 50 million euros. The other was Alpha Blue Ocean, an international firm that announced it would back 15 companies in 15 countries with over ‚Ç¨1.5 billion in investment. Critics raise concerns over Vanadi‚Äôs ambitious Bitcoin move Vanadi‚Äôs daring foray into Bitcoin is not risk-free. The company has a handful of stores serving espresso and pastries, and it is now dipping a toe in the complex world of crypto treasury management. But analysts and sceptics have raised red flags. They also note that Vanadi‚Äôs small size, slim operating margins and inexperience in crypto could be left open to volatility and then to scrutiny by regulators. Unlike Strategy, whose tech-focused leadership team has many years of experience navigating capital markets, Vanadi‚Äôs management has a steep learning curve ahead. And the regulatory climate for digital assets in Spain is also conservative. It‚Äôs not part of an activist group, but it is dynamic, and screwing any of this up in compliance or implementation would be expensive. Vanadi is not alone, though. Companies worldwide are adding Bitcoin to their treasury, which is becoming a trend. US-based crypto firm Bakkt recently revealed its intentions to purchase as much as $1 billion of Bitcoin. Tesla and Coinbase are among the companies that have pursued comparable treasury strategies. What sets Vanadi apart, however, is the scale of its ambition relative to its core business. A ‚Ç¨1 billion Bitcoin bet on a caf√© chain with six locations and persistent losses is an aggressive bet by any measure. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This is one of the biggest shake-ups of investment advice for a decade. Millions of British savers will be granted access to ‚Äútargeted support‚Äù under wide-ranging new rules to aid people‚Äôs quest for better returns on their money. Barclays‚Äô analysis shows that around 13 million adults in the UK are keeping about ¬£430 billion in cash, based on the savers who currently have more than six months‚Äô income in savings, which could be invested. Meanwhile, companies such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Vanguard have already started offering these services. FCA unveils new changes to the UK‚Äôs financial advice market The FCA described ‚Äúa once-in-a-generation change‚Äù to the UK‚Äôs financial advice market. This change will allow companies to suggest to a group of people sitting on so much cash to consider investing some in shares to earn better returns over time. The move comes more than a decade after the FCA‚Äôs Retail Distribution Review, which was intended to increase the quality of financial advice but has also made it more expensive for the population. This left many people unable to afford such services, resulting in an ‚Äúadvice gap‚Äù. The FCA said the new regime is a remedy created to help more than half of British savers , who said in a recent survey that they needed further assistance investing their money. Based on the regulator‚Äôs argument, 7million British adults have more than ¬£10,000 in cash savings and no investments. Hence, people between 13.5 million and 30.6million might gain from this focused assistance. The regulator also said it would consult on developing rules for this new activity of targeted support by December, enabling companies to make generic offers to groups of consumers with similar characteristics. This would no longer be caught by the burdensome requirements to give customers a ‚Äúpersonal recommendation,‚Äù such as undertaking a fully detailed suitability assessment. Apart from these new changes, the FCA also plans to introduce a second, more focused, category called ‚Äúsimplified advice.‚Äù In this category, firms will be able to make a suggestion on a financial product to a customer, subject to a short document detailing their ‚Äúessential relevant facts‚Äù ‚Äì without having to conduct the full suitability assessment. Several prominent figures acknowledged the importance of the FCA‚Äôs proposal Several prominent figures have commented on FCA‚Äôs proposals. Dan Olley, chief executive of Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK‚Äôs largest ‚ÄúDIY‚Äù investment site, said the proposals will be genuinely transformational in cementing a healthy retail investment culture in the UK. According to Olley, it was obvious that there are important moments in life when several people find themselves in the advice gap. He further elaborated that in this situation, one cannot afford financial advice but needs more help than the rules permit. James Daley, a leader of the consumer group Fairer Finance, said the changes were moving in the right direction. However, he insists that these proposals must be put in place with strong consumer protections ‚Äì and that customers should have confidence that these options will not lead to their exploitation. Jon Cleborne, the leader of Vanguard in Europe, also commented on the topic of discussion. Cleborne highlighted that FCA‚Äôs proposals are important for helping more people enjoy the benefits of long-term investing and reach their financial goals. Lastly, Verona Kenny, the chief distribution officer at Aberdeen Adviser, reported that over 40% of individuals acknowledged that they have done little to prepare financially for retirement. Based on her argument, the new changes appear to be the best opportunity in a generation to address this issue. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Despite its early presence and significant impact during previous market cycles, XRP has not mirrored the broader growth seen across the crypto sector over the past decade. Analysts suggest that even a partial recovery of its past market dominance could trigger a significant price increase. XRP‚Äôs Lagging Growth Compared to the Market Over the last ten years, the global cryptocurrency market has surged from $4.28 billion to over $3.28 trillion, a staggering 76,528% increase. Bitcoin and several altcoins have grown in parallel with this expansion, recording gains that align with or exceed the market‚Äôs pace. XRP, however, has not followed this trend. A key factor limiting XRP‚Äôs growth has been ongoing regulatory challenges, most notably its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These issues led to temporary delistings from major exchanges, restricting access for U.S.-based investors and stalling momentum during critical growth periods. Historical Market Dominance: XRP vs. Bitcoin In May 2017, XRP reached its peak market dominance of 31.33%, supported by a market capitalization of $15.28 billion when the total crypto market was $48.78 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap stood at $29 billion, giving it a 59.45% share of the total market. Since then, Bitcoin has grown in line with the market. Its capitalization has risen to $2.132 trillion, a 7,251% increase from 2017. XRP, on the other hand, has climbed only 743% during the same period, reaching a market cap of $128.8 billion. Consequently, XRP‚Äôs market dominance has dropped from 31.33% to just 3.96%, while Bitcoin‚Äôs has increased to 65.75%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Price Projections Based on Reclaiming Market Share Given the current crypto market cap of $3.28 trillion, analysts have explored hypothetical scenarios in which XRP regains a portion of its former dominance. If XRP were to recover just half of its 2017 market dominance, 15.665%, its market capitalization would rise to approximately $513.8 billion. With the circulating supply of XRP estimated at 59 billion tokens, this would result in a price of roughly $8.70 per coin. Notably, this aligns with predictions made by industry figures such as George Tung, who has suggested that XRP could realistically reach $8 to $10 under favourable conditions by the end of the year. While some commentators see $8 as a significant target, others argue that it still undervalues XRP‚Äôs full potential, especially given its historical market standing. What If XRP Fully Recovers Its Past Dominance? In a more aggressive scenario, where XRP returns to its full 31.33% dominance, its market capitalization would exceed $1.027 trillion at the current overall market valuation. Based on the existing supply, this would drive the price of one XRP token to approximately $17.40 . Although achieving such a market share would require a significant shift in investor sentiment and regulatory clarity, the figures suggest that substantial upside remains possible, even if XRP only partially regains its historical position. XRP‚Äôs current valuation appears modest when measured against its historical performance and the broader market‚Äôs growth. A return to just half of its peak market dominance would more than quadruple its current price, while a full recovery could propel XRP to levels not previously reached. These scenarios, although hypothetical, provide a framework for evaluating XRP‚Äôs long-term potential in a maturing cryptocurrency market.

With Bitcoin consolidating and major altcoins facing mixed momentum, presales with strong fundamentals are taking center stage. Among the most talked-about candidates are MAGACOIN FINANCE, Qubetics, and Mutuum‚Äîthree projects gaining traction for their unique structures and explosive early momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Momentum Meets Market Narrative MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly emerged as one of the most dominant forces in the 2025 crypto cycle. Its presale has already raised significant amounts, with each stage selling out rapidly and early buyers seeing significant paper gains. The project operates with a fixed supply model and has passed a full audit by HashEx, signaling credibility in a market often lacking transparency. Backed by asymmetric upside potential and a politically infused narrative, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been labeled by analysts as a defining early-entry opportunity of the year. Its structure resists inflation, and with no venture capital unlocks in sight, institutional and retail investors alike are watching closely. Analysts have noted its consistent traction in presale rankings and speculative forecasts continue to rise. Qubetics (TICS): Aiming to Bridge Web3 Fragmentation With over $18M raised during the presale which has sold hundreds of millions of tokens, Qubetics is entering the final phase of the presale. Qubetics is a cross-chain Web3 aggregator that aims to fix blockchain fragmentation, one of the ecosystem‚Äôs biggest issues. It‚Äôs distinctive value proposition evolves from its QubeQode IDE, an integrated development environment aimed at using decentralized applications across chains. Qubetics reduced the supply of the total tokens by more than 60%. This will make the tokens more scarce. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): DeFi Utility With Scaling Ambitions Mutuum Finance has garnered attention as one of the few presale projects that deliver on both innovation and investor confidence. The platform combines decentralized lending, a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, and a Layer 2 scaling model ‚Äî all within a transparent, CertiK-audited ecosystem. Investor incentives and smart tokenomics have propelled the project to raise significant capital in a short time. Analysts are watching closely as each presale phase narrows the gap between entry and launch valuation. With forecasts projecting multi-fold returns, Mutuum Finance is becoming a serious contender for investors targeting the DeFi resurgence in 2025. Final Thoughts: Presale Season Heating Up As Q4 2025 draws closer, a presale-driven momentum is becoming theme in crypto investing. MAGACOIN FINANCE, Qubetics, and Mutuum offer a scarcity-based political narrative, infrastructure-grade tooling, and innovative DeFi design, respectively.

The idea, first introduced in 2022 by game developer and XRP proponent Chad Steingraber, is gaining renewed attention as market conditions evolve and institutional interest in blockchain utility increases. Although XRP is currently trading around $2 , Steingraber maintains that a combination of institutional adoption, strategic asset utility, and supply restrictions could drive the asset‚Äôs value to unprecedented levels. It consists of three components: 1 ‚Äì Assets built on the XRP Ledger (Stablecoins are the ‚Äúutility‚Äù) 2 ‚Äì XRP becomes a reserve asset to power the utility 3 ‚Äì XRP is removed from public supply by institutions This is how IT WILL. https://t.co/d7ysY5euXc ‚Äî Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) June 28, 2025 Foundation of the $20,000 Projection Chad Steingraber‚Äôs $20,000 price prediction is based on three main assumptions. He outlines a path where XRP transforms from a speculative asset into a core infrastructure component for global finance. According to him, this transformation hinges on three primary developments: Tokenized Asset Issuance on the XRP Ledger: Steingraber believes the adoption of the XRP Ledger by governments and institutions for issuing stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will generate new demand for XRP. As the native token of the ledger, XRP would facilitate settlements involving these tokenized assets, thus increasing its utility. Use as a Reserve Asset: In this scenario, XRP would no longer function primarily as a tradable token. Instead, it would be held by financial institutions as a reserve asset , akin to how central banks hold gold. These reserves would support internal liquidity, enable seamless value transfer, and serve as backing for institution-specific digital assets. Absorption of Public Supply by Institutions: Steingraber suggests that over time, financial institutions will accumulate large amounts of XRP and remove them from public markets by locking them into private ledgers. This would reduce the circulating supply available for retail investors and could cause a significant price increase due to heightened scarcity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Role of Public Markets and the Transition to Private Use Steingraber views the current retail-driven XRP market as temporary. He argues that major institutions are unlikely to rely on public trading platforms due to transparency and regulatory concerns. Instead, enterprise participants would shift to private networks and rely on specialized liquidity providers to settle large-scale transactions securely. This shift implies that public trading of XRP is a transitional phase, with a more utility-focused institutional use case on the horizon. Anticipated Supply Shock and Institutional Demand Surge Another critical element in Steingraber‚Äôs forecast is a potential supply crisis triggered by rapid institutional acquisition. He claims that only around 20 billion XRP tokens remain in circulation after accounting for lost, burned, or locked coins. He warns that once institutions begin acquiring XRP aggressively, the available supply could fall to under 100 million tokens. Such a sharp reduction in supply, if met with sudden institutional demand, could lead to rapid price acceleration. However, he asserts that this demand would be driven by utility and operational necessity, not speculation. Global Competition for XRP Steingraber broadens the outlook by suggesting that competition for XRP will not be limited to U.S.-based institutions. He anticipates demand from international banks, sovereign wealth funds, and private entities seeking to integrate XRP into their digital infrastructure. He envisions XRP becoming an essential component of the global financial system. While the theory presents a compelling vision for XRP‚Äôs future utility, it remains highly controversial. It does not fully address the competitive landscape, where other digital assets also offer institutional-grade utility. Furthermore, the proposed valuation depends on widespread adoption that has yet to materialize at scale. Nevertheless, the discussion continues to attract interest, especially among XRP supporters who see long-term potential in its unique ledger technology and use cases.

With all 15 presale stages already completed and the Bonus Round ongoing, the project is drawing the attention of investors due to its AI-driven architecture and price increase. Lightchain AI presents a virtual machine to carry out AI tasks and a model that rewards users according to their computational value‚Äìfeatures that builders and investors prefer. As the July 2025 mainnet launch approaches, Lightchain AI is showing that traders are noticing the project due to its real-world usage and hype. Ethereum Focuses on Core Development and Long-Term Upgrades Ethereum has been focusing on platform development and long-term upgrades that are expected to make the network scalable, efficient, and user-friendly. The newly launched Pectra upgrade, which was launched on May 7, 2025, fixed several issues and added new features like the staking limit increase and wallet usage. In addition, Ethereum Next‚Äôs roadmap will focus on the Fulu-Osaka upgrade, which is expected to launch by the end of 2025 or early 2026, developing Verkle trees to reduce storage requirements and increase network efficiency. With developments like the single-shot finality which is expected to reduce transaction confirmation times, Ethereum‚Äôs place in the blockchain world is secured. Lightchain AI Captures Immediate Interest From Active Traders Lightchain AI has been gaining attention from investors due to its structure, which focuses on real-world usage, and its presale. With Stage 15 already completed, the Bonus Round offers fixed token pricing and increased value, especially after the removal of the 5% Team Allocation. Those tokens will now be used to support the development of the protocol, developer grants, and builder rewards‚Äìshowing a move that puts the platform first. Lightchain AI‚Äôs tokenomics is expected to build investor confidence, with 40% of the supply allocated to presale, 28.5% to staking rewards, 15% to liquidity, 6.5 to treasury, and 5% to marketing and partnerships. The platform‚Äôs improved gas system allows users to pay for transactions based on how complex the AI tasks they are carrying out are, ensuring usage without issues. For traders looking for functionality over speculation, Lightchain AI offers a better structure. Traders Act Fast‚ÄîAnd All Eyes Are on Lightchain AI Traders in the crypto market always go for any investment opportunity they discover, and right now, they are moving towards Lightchain AI. With its Bonus Round price fixed at $0.007 and with over $20.9 million raised, the project is attracting attention. What makes it special? Decentralized validator nodes, AI-powered infrastructure, and a developer Grant pool that is pushing development on the platform. With the mainnet launch and public code release expected to happen in the coming weeks, Lightchain AI is shaping up to be the next move for traders looking for opportunities in the crypto industry.

Yet, even amid this institutional breakthrough, one emerging project is generating powerful early momentum among traders: MAGACOIN FINANCE. While XRP‚Äôs ETF milestone represents a step forward for mainstream adoption, many are pivoting toward early-phase assets that offer greater upside. XRP ETF News Marks Institutional Milestone Ripple has come a long way to gain credibility among institutions. Purpose Investments has launched the world‚Äôs first spot XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker XRPP, providing investors with direct exposure to XRP in CAD as well as USD. Canada is already recognized as a world leader in regulated access to cryptos for institutions. This development cements Canada‚Äôs position as a leader in this field and sets an important precedent for others. Bloomberg analysts now assign a 95% probability to a US recession. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot XRP ETF when there is enough regulatory clarity and Ripple‚Äôs legal case is settled. According to the odds on Polymarket, the majority of predictions indicate that it could be approved by the end of the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Attention With Strategic Timing While XRP‚Äôs institutional story dominates headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly becoming a breakout force in the early-stage investment space. Its presale phases have seen instant sellouts, and analyst coverage is intensifying around what many now see as one of the most structurally aligned new tokens of the year. The project‚Äôs appeal lies in its architectural scarcity, security verifications, and early-mover advantage. These features have made it a target for capital rotation among investors looking beyond legacy plays. With the broader market seeking asymmetric returns ahead of the next major bull cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized not for its comparisons ‚Äî but for its independent setup and compelling risk-reward ratio. Market Dynamics Favor Early Entries Institutional attention is building around regulatory milestones, but seasoned investors understand that much of the explosive growth in crypto emerges from earlier phases ‚Äî before large capital fully enters the space. While XRP is set to benefit from ETF listings and long-term adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as an opportunity for meaningful portfolio transformation during the pre-mainstream window. Pro traders and early adopters are already reallocating capital into strategic assets with credible foundations and timing advantages ‚Äî and MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to top that list. Final Thoughts Ripple‚Äôs ETF progress is a defining moment for the asset class, offering XRP a new gateway into institutional portfolios. Yet, even as major tokens gain regulatory validation, a new frontier is forming ‚Äî one where projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are setting the tone for early-stage, high-conviction investment strategies. The window for entry may not remain open for long.

He points to the January 2024 launch of US Bitcoin spot ETFs, which funneled in more than $10 billion in their opening months, as proof that digital assets are here to stay. Having watched governments and major firms embrace crypto, he now believes the risks that once held him back are largely behind us. Strong Growth In Bitcoin ETFs According to reports, the launch of US Bitcoin spot exchange‚Äëtraded funds in January 2024 opened the floodgates. These ETFs have drawn in billions of dollars and put digital currency at the front of many investors‚Äô minds. Sales figures show that ETFs poured in more than $10‚ÄØbillion in their first months on the market. Those numbers have convinced many that Bitcoin is no longer a niche play. Major Players Show Their Hand Based on interviews and filings, nation‚Äëstates like Pakistan and the UAE have started to add Bitcoin to their reserves. Public companies such as MicroStrategy (now Strategy ) and Metaplanet keep buying more coins, while big finance names‚ÄîBarclays Bank, Avenir, and Goldman Sachs‚Äîhave dipped their toes in through those same ETFs. This level of interest would have sounded impossible back in 2020 when Bitcoin was still seen as an experiment. Questioning The 60/40 Rule Edelman pointed out that the classic 60% stocks and 40% bonds formula isn‚Äôt cutting it anymore. With people living longer and bond yields at historic lows, retirement accounts are in need of a boost. He contends that Bitcoin‚Äôs gains over the past decade have outpaced every other major asset class. Based on charts, Bitcoin climbed over 1,400% between 2015 and 2025, while the S&P‚ÄØ500 posted around 250% in the same span. Bold Price Goals On The Table Analysts aren‚Äôt holding back when it comes to price targets. Some see Bitcoin hitting $500,000 or $1 million in this cycle. High‚Äëprofile backers go even further‚ÄîMichael Saylor has talked about $13 million per coin if certain on‚Äëchain signals line up. These figures sound wild. They also explain why a 40% allocation could feel tempting to aggressive investors. Balancing Risk And Reward Still, experts warn that Bitcoin‚Äôs swings remain sharp. Prices can rise or fall by 20% in a day. A 40% weighting means big gains when markets rally and big losses when they drop. Many advisors suggest a smaller 5‚Äì10% Bitcoin holding for those who want some upside without risking their entire nest egg. What This Means Based on reports from the Digital Asset Council of Financial Advisors, everyday investors might not need to go all‚Äëin just yet. A gradual approach can help you learn the market and adjust if volatility spikes. It‚Äôs a fast‚Äëmoving scene, so keeping an eye on ETF inflows, regulatory updates, and network health will be key.

The Bank of Korea reportedly informed participating banks that it will temporarily halt discussions related to the second stage of its central bank digital currency pilot, which was originally slated to begin later this year. A BOK official confirmed the decision to Bloomberg , citing the need for reassessment amid shifting priorities. New President‚Äôs Stablecoin Push Prompts Central Bank Caution The delay comes as newly elected President Lee Jae-myung places growing emphasis on stablecoins. Just weeks into office, Lee has proposed expanding the field of issuers by allowing companies with as little as 500m won, or about $370,000, in equity to issue won-based stablecoins.

Crypto Holdings Now Key Part of Personal Wealth for Millions in South Korea Meanwhile, South Korea remains one of the world‚Äôs most active crypto markets. Over a third of the population, roughly 18m people, are involved in digital asset trading. On particularly busy days, local crypto exchange volumes have surpassed those of traditional equity markets such as the Kospi and Kosdaq. A recent industry survey found that more than half of South Koreans aged 20 to 59 have experience trading crypto . Moreover, one in four currently hold digital coins. For those invested, crypto now makes up at least 14% of their total financial portfolios. In addition, many maintain wallets across several domestic exchanges. Enthusiasm around digital assets has also spilled into the stock market. Shares of companies linked to the Bank of Korea‚Äôs CBDC initiative have rallied in recent weeks .

ETH is now consolidating gains and might soon aim for a move above the $2,520 resistance. Ethereum started a fresh upward move above the $2,450 level. The price is trading above $2,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,440 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it remains stable above the $2,420 zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,420 support level, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to clear the $2,450 and $2,480 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The bulls even pushed the price above the $2,500 zone. However, the bulls were active above the $2,500 level. A high was formed at $2,523 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,394 swing low to the $2,523 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,440 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,520 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,580 level. A clear move above the $2,580 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance. An upside break above the $2,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,720 resistance zone or even $2,800 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,520 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,480 level. The first major support sits near the $2,460 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,394 swing low to the $2,523 high. A clear move below the $2,460 support might push the price toward the $2,440 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,400 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,350. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD ‚Äì The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI ‚Äì The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.
