In 2029, the coin could be worth between $36.06 and $42.44, an average price of $37.05 In 2031, RPL will range between $74.07 and $89.07. Unlike traditional staking services, Rocket Pool allows users to pool their Ethereum (ETH) to run validator nodes on the Ethereum network. Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of ‚ÄúrETH‚Äù tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users‚Äô stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? Can Rocket Pool‚Äôs price reach $50?

The stolen assets were swiftly sold on-chain and bridged over to Ethereum before some of it was laundered through Tornado Cash . On May 16, the victim‚Äôs Solana addresses were emptied of tokens, and the assets were then converted to Ethereum via a bridge before part of it was deposited to Tornado Cash . Blockchain researcher ZachXBT publicly flagged the exploit , drawing parallels with earlier Lazarus activity. Hackers bridged the stolen funds Blockchain sleuths first raised the alarm after observing large transfers from address ‚Äú C4WY‚Ä¶e525 ‚Äù on Solana. These transactions, linked to the notorious Lazarus Group, involved moving the stolen tokens through a bridge and converting them into Ethereum. ZachXBT flagged the attack by monitoring the bridge‚Äôs activity and tracing funds that ultimately ended up in a network of wallets on Ethereum. On June 25 and again on June 27, 400 ETH was sent to Tornado Cash in two separate deposits. Those 800 ETH transactions, totaling roughly $1.6 million, align with Lazarus Group‚Äôs well-documented laundering tactics. Following high-profile hacks like Bybit, where $1.5 billion was stolen in February 2025, and $100 million from Harmony‚Äôs Horizon bridge in 2022, among other notable hacks, Lazarus has repeatedly used Tornado Cash, along with decentralized exchanges and cross-chain bridges, to launder funds by obfuscating transaction trails. Approximately $1.25 million still resides in a wallet address identified as ‚Äú 0xa5‚Ä¶d528 ‚Äù on Ethereum, held in a combination of DAI and ETH. Analysts speculate that these funds may either be parked for future laundering or be held intentionally dormant to mitigate detection risk. Lazarus Group has been active since 2017 Lazarus Group has earned a reputation as the most prolific state-linked cybercrime organization, with North Korea sanctions designating them as an Advanced Persistent Threat tied to Pyongyang‚Äôs elite military intelligence units. Over the years, they have stolen billions in crypto since 2017. Their modus operandi often starts with phishing or malware-based infiltration of key personnel, exploiting smart contract flaws or wallet vulnerabilities. Once funds are obtained, they are rapidly converted into liquid assets, broken into multiple wallets, and laundered across chains using mixers like Tornado Cash and services providing instant swaps without Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. Tornado Cash remains central to Lazarus‚Äôs laundering strategy. Although U.S. sanctions were imposed in 2022, decentralized hosting and immutability have allowed the service to evade permanent shutdown. In January 2025, a U.S. appeals court reversed those sanctions, citing free speech considerations, despite mounting evidence linking Lazarus to continued mixer use. Regulators and exchanges may now take steps to mark the flagged addresses as suspicious. However, with the speed and complexity of Lazarus‚Äôs laundering pipeline, mixing services continue to prove sufficient in concealing the movement of their stolen funds.

Meanwhile, Avalanche (AVAX) is challenging resistance points that could dictate its next move. This article explores whether SUI can maintain its stance and if AVAX can break through, offering insights on which coins might be poised for growth. SUI Price Volatility Reflects Recent Corrections and Emerging Setups Last month SUI saw a significant drop of roughly 20%, while the six-month chart reveals a deeper churn with a decline of nearly 33%. A recent one-week gain of about 8.5% signals a brief recovery amid the longer-term downtrend. Price action has been marked by falling momentum and investor uncertainty as bears held sway longer term, making recovery efforts reliant on strong fundamentals. Trends have fluctuated, illustrating an asset struggling to sustain growth while technical indicators hint at a potential short-term bounce if critical levels are respected. Current trading levels show prices between $2.77 and $4.01. Immediate support appears near $2.29, while resistance lies at $4.77. Higher resistance is identified around $6.01, with deeper support at $1.05. Technical indicators, including a mildly negative momentum reading and an RSI at 44.59, suggest the market lacks a clear thrust. Bullish traders might buy at key support, targeting the nearest resistance, while bearish holders could monitor for drops beneath support to short the correction. A range-bound approach is advisable until the market decisively breaks in one direction. Avalanche Price Journey: Volatility and Key Trading Levels Over the last month, Avalanche declined nearly 20% while the half-year drop surpassed 50%, with a brief one-week gain of almost 6% hinting at short-term recovery. The coin‚Äôs past motion shows heavy selling pressure amid steep corrections, mixed with occasional rebounds that signal continued trader interest despite overall weakness. The price history reflects an erratic pattern where significant losses over longer spans contrast with minor rallies in shorter periods, creating an uneven performance picture that traders have navigated with caution and hesitation. Current market conditions for Avalanche reveal uncertainty mixed with tactical opportunities for active traders. Price currently oscillates between $17.67 and $25.40, with the nearest resistance level at $29.98 and support around $14.52. Bears maintain significant influence, as indicated by a negative Awesome Oscillator value of -1.942. The relative strength index near 42.65 reflects selling pressure, though some buyers are testing support levels. A clear trend remains elusive as the coin trades within defined ranges. Traders are advised to consider positions near support levels and employ tight stop-loss measures. Short-term strategies may include monitoring for support bounces while awaiting signals for bullish behavior. Conclusion SUI is trying to maintain its support, showing some promise of stability. On the other hand, AVAX faces resistance, posing challenges for upward movement. The ability of SUI to hold its ground could define its short-term outlook. AVAX's struggle with resistance may need further momentum for a breakout. Both coins are at critical points, indicating that their near future could see decisive moves. Observing these levels will be key to understanding their next steps. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Each asset is flashing potential breakout signals, drawing attention from both retail and institutional traders. But alongside these well-established names, a powerful early-stage contender is rapidly gaining momentum: MAGACOIN FINANCE. With its scarcity-driven structure and increasing interest from high-conviction investors, it‚Äôs positioning itself as one of the most closely tracked opportunities this cycle. Ethereum Forms Strong Base with Reversal Setup Ethereum has taken on a technical formation that many analysts recognize as potentially reversal. A triple bottom formation is established which indicates strong underlying support and could act as a launch pad for further upside. Traders keep a close eye on ecosystem upgrades and network activity, which remain high. Its pivotal role in DeFi, NFTs, and tokenization is making investors treat Ethereum like a structural anchor in crypto portfolios. Analysts are looking for confirmation signals to tag ETH in a new Bull phase. XRP Reignites Momentum on ETF Speculation XRP recently rebounded from a prolonged consolidation phase, regaining trader interest with a breakout above long-held technical resistance. The token‚Äôs movement has coincided with growing speculation about the approval of a spot XRP ETF ‚Äî a development that could inject substantial new liquidity into the asset. On-chain upgrades are also expanding the XRP Ledger‚Äôs functionality, supporting enterprise-level use cases across DeFi, token escrows, and payment channels. With a long-term triangle formation still intact, XRP remains one of the most closely monitored large-cap assets for potential mid-cycle breakout performance. Shiba Inu Surges on Whale Activity and Layer-2 Narrative Recently, 10 trillion Shiba tokens was purchased by whales indicating it saw the biggest daily accumulation over the past some months. This strong buying activity has sparked a sudden rise from recent drops and shown improved interest in finish development of SHIB. The Shibarium Layer-2 Solution Puzzle Continues to be Key Narrative Driver. Developers and investors are becoming interested in Shibarium due to lower transaction costs and greater scalability. Presently, there are long-term interests due to token burns that will lead to further speculation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Ground with Pro Traders While large-cap assets dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly attracting high-conviction capital from pro traders seeking strategic early entries. The project is backed by a scarcity-based structure and has been steadily gaining traction across key investment circles. Entry rounds have moved quickly, with accumulation activity pointing to increasing confidence in the token‚Äôs long-term setup. Analysts tracking presale behavior and position building are flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout with real momentum forming behind the scenes. Rather than relying on surface-level sentiment, the project‚Äôs appeal stems from structural traits ‚Äî limited supply, strong inflow trends, and positioning ahead of upcoming listings. With growing attention from seasoned market participants, it‚Äôs becoming clear that MAGACOIN FINANCE is not simply trending ‚Äî it‚Äôs gaining traction as a force in its own right. Final Thoughts: Trading Patterns Set the Stage, But Positioning Wins Ethereum, XRP, and Shiba Inu are each showcasing technical strength, building the foundation for what could be a strong market resurgence. Ethereum offers structural reliability, XRP brings speculative upside tied to regulatory shifts, and SHIB reflects the power of retail momentum and evolving infrastructure.

47055008,https://cryptonews.com/?p=376363,1751237103,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/47055008.jpeg,Quantum Black Swan: How a 2026 Quantum-Computing Breakthrough Could Upend Crypto (and Which Coins Might Survive),https://cryptonews.com/news/quantum-black-swan-how-a-2026-quantum-computing-breakthrough-could-upend-crypto-and-which-coins-might-survive/,"A simulated quantum stress test conducted using OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT o3 model has raised fresh concerns about the future of digital assets. The simulation explores a hypothetical breakthrough in quantum computing by 2026 that would render many of today‚Äôs cryptographic standards obsolete, potentially leading to widespread collapse across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once due to the principles of superposition and entanglement. This allows them to perform complex calculations at speeds far beyond what is possible with classical machines. According to o3, a sudden leap in quantum capability, such as the development of a 10,000-qubit fault-tolerant machine with sufficiently low error rates, could break the security systems underpinning major blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ChatGPT o3 Warns of ‚ÄòQ-Day‚Äô Extinction Risk for Blockchains o3 raised red flags across the crypto industry, warning that the rise of quantum computing‚Äîreferred to as ‚ÄúQ-Day‚Äù‚Äîcould pose an extinction-level threat to major blockchains. At the heart of blockchain security lies the asymmetric cryptography model: private keys generate public keys , but not the other way around. This one-way function is what secures digital wallets and signs transactions. Quantum computers might sound like another buzzword in the tech world, yet their threat to #cryptocurrency is very real and approaching fast. Scientists may differ on the timeline, but they all agree: ‚ÄúQ-day‚Äù is not a matter of if, but when. #Bitcoin https://t.co/SdH4NiTMoo ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2024 Quantum computing breaks this assumption. Using algorithms like Peter Shor‚Äôs , proven in theory to efficiently factor large numbers, quantum systems could reverse-engineer private keys from public data. ‚ÄúA chain is only as secure as its signatures,‚Äù the model warns. ‚ÄúOnce signatures break, the chain breaks.‚Äù The o3 model stress-tested major blockchain protocols under a Q-Day scenario in which quantum machines can break cryptographic standards like ECDSA and RSA. The findings are sobering. Bitcoin: Legacy Risk and No Governance Pathway Bitcoin, which still uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ( ECDSA ), was flagged as particularly vulnerable. As noted by o3, a significant portion of BTC remains locked in legacy wallets with no quantum-resistant protections. A 2020 Deloitte study further estimated that up to 25% of Bitcoin holdings could be compromised, especially coins stored in exposed or reused addresses. Data from Project Eleven reinforces this concern: over 6.2 million BTC, worth approximately $648 billion, are stored in addresses with exposed public keys. This translates to more than 10 million wallets that could be at risk once quantum computers achieve sufficient decryption power. @Tether_to CEO @paoloardoino has warned that quantum computing could eventually pose a threat to inactive Bitcoin wallets. #Bitcoin #Quantum https://t.co/u8DCYrTjYw ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 9, 2025 The problem is compounded by Bitcoin‚Äôs structural rigidity. What has long been praised as Bitcoin‚Äôs strength , its conservative dev culture and emphasis on protocol stability, now poses a liability. In a crisis, Bitcoin‚Äôs inability to adapt quickly could delay vital countermeasures. As OpenAI‚Äôs o3 model puts it, ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs survival isn‚Äôt cryptographic‚Äîit‚Äôs sociopolitical. Without preemptive upgrades, post-Q-Day drains will begin within days of the breakthrough.‚Äù While discussions around post-quantum signature schemes like XMSS or Dilithium have occurred within Bitcoin Core, no concrete implementation or accepted BIP exists. The introduction of lattice-based alternatives (e.g., Falcon) remains theoretical, with no set roadmap. According to o3, Bitcoin network survival would likely depend on one of two strategies: A politically contentious fork to a quantum-safe Bitcoin variant A preemptive key rotation or shielding mechanism that avoids exposed legacy keys Ethereum: More Adaptable, But Still At Risk While Ethereum shares Bitcoin‚Äôs cryptographic vulnerability, relying on the ECDSA, it ranks significantly higher in adaptability. The o3 model flagged Ethereum‚Äôs active developer community, rapid upgrade history, and flexible governance as key assets in navigating a post-quantum scenario. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has demonstrated the capacity to coordinate complex transitions. The DAO fork, Ethereum 2.0 Merge , and the Shapella upgrade all serve as precedent for community-driven protocol evolution. ‚ÄúEthereum can adapt,‚Äù o3 concluded, ‚Äúbut only if it moves quickly.‚Äù Still, the shift to post-quantum cryptography would require extensive infrastructure overhauls. These include wallet standards, signature validation rules in smart contracts, Layer-2 rollups, and developer tooling. Many of these components were built on cryptographic assumptions that would not hold after a quantum breakthrough. Account abstraction is only half-done The end goal is non-ECDSA accounts (multisigs, key changes, quantum-resistant, privacy protocols (!!)) being true first class citizens A lot of good work recently on aggressively simplifying 7701 to make this happen https://t.co/j66geDAoC8 ‚Äî vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 27, 2025 The o3 model simulation emphasized this point, saying, ‚ÄúEthereum is the only major L1 chain with a plausible fast-track governance protocol for quantum threats. But most dApps on Ethereum aren‚Äôt ready.‚Äù However, Ethereum‚Äôs programmability, a defining strength, also creates a unique risk surface. Millions of deployed smart contracts, including financial primitives on protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and MakerDAO, use static cryptographic calls vulnerable to quantum decryption. Many are immutable and cannot be patched after deployment. That said, proxy patterns and upgradeable architectures like OpenZeppelin‚Äôs implementation give some contracts a pathway for modification. But these only apply where foresight was used. Vast portions of Ethereum‚Äôs contract base may be impossible to rescue post-Q-Day without chain-wide intervention. For Ethereum to remain viable in a post-Q-Day world, o3 noted the following actions will be necessary: Roll out hybrid cryptographic wallets supporting post-quantum signature layers (e.g., Falcon, Dilithium). Incentivize or mandate critical dApps to adopt quantum-safe signature schemes in proxy contracts. Leverage Layer-2s for isolated asset migration and transaction validation under new cryptographic rules. Coordinate a network-wide ‚Äúkey rotation‚Äù event with community buy-in, governance clarity, and tooling support. Other Chains and DeFi: Varying Levels of Readiness Algorand: Purpose-Built for the Quantum Era Among all the Layer-1 chains o3 analyzed, Algorand emerged as one of the most quantum-resilient. Designed with future-proofing in mind, the protocol already incorporates cryptographic innovations such as Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs), and it has actively explored lattice-based encryption methods like NTRU, a class of cryptography believed to be quantum-resistant. ‚ÄúIf Q-Day hits in 2026,‚Äù the o3 model observed, ‚ÄúAlgorand is one of the only chains with a 12-month adaptation head start.‚Äù Algorand‚Äôs pipelined Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus rotates validator keys regularly, reducing the exposure window of any single cryptographic signature. More on Algorand's post-quantum technology: https://t.co/NIQEnbER0P ‚Äî Algorand Foundation (@AlgoFoundation) May 27, 2025 According to o3, its structured governance and fast finality also enhance its ability to implement protocol-level upgrades quickly in the face of emerging threats. Polkadot: Modular Agility Meets Cryptographic Risk Polkadot ranked just behind Algorand in terms of readiness. The network‚Äôs parachain architecture allows semi-independent blockchains to run in parallel, each potentially adopting its own quantum-resilient cryptography without waiting for a full network-wide consensus. According to o3, this modularity offers developers the freedom to implement post-quantum upgrades on a per-parachain basis. However, Polkadot currently relies on Schnorr-based BLS signatures , which are vulnerable to quantum attacks. Still, its OpenGov system and decentralized treasury could support rapid upgrade cycles when needed. Cardano: Academic Rigor, Operational Drag Cardano presents a paradox. It is one of the few blockchain platforms deeply invested in the academic exploration of post-quantum cryptographic techniques, including both lattice- and hash-based signature schemes. o3 noted that Cardano‚Äôs extended UTXO model also provides a more modular smart contract framework, which may ease the migration to new cryptographic primitives. Post-Quantum Cardano https://t.co/MpNWSo8KWm ‚Äî Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) February 20, 2025 However, Cardano still relies on Ed25519 signatures, which are quantum-susceptible, according to o3. And while its Voltaire governance phase is intended to support decentralized decision-making for protocol upgrades, it remains under development. As the o3 model put it, ‚ÄúIf crypto were judged on whitepapers alone, Cardano would thrive. But Q-Day doesn‚Äôt wait for peer review.‚Äù Privacy Coins: From Anonymity to Liability Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash face a uniquely grim outlook. Their core innovations of ring signatures, stealth addresses, and zero-knowledge proofs offer strong protections against classical decryption but may provide little defense against quantum attacks. o3 noted that quantum algorithms capable of breaking elliptic curve cryptography could dismantle the projects‚Äô anonymity features, exposing past transactions and rendering current privacy guarantees moot. Compounding the threat is the pseudonymous governance model, which makes coordinated upgrades or overhauls difficult. ‚ÄúQuantum computing doesn‚Äôt just de-anonymize Monero,‚Äù the o3 warned, ‚Äúit breaks its reason to exist. Privacy becomes exposure.‚Äù DeFi Protocols: Collateral Damage from Layer-1 Failures Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, particularly those built atop Ethereum such as Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO, face second-order vulnerabilities. While these protocols do not directly implement ECDSA at their core, they depend entirely on Ethereum‚Äôs base-layer security. If Ethereum‚Äôs signature scheme were compromised and Layer-1 wallets became exposed, the smart contracts securing billions in TVL (Total Value Locked) would be undermined; regardless of whether the dApps themselves were quantum-aware. o3 summarized the cascading risk simply: ‚ÄúIf the base layer fails, so does the application.‚Äù Compounding the issue is the immutability of many smart contracts. While some DeFi platforms use proxy architectures for upgrades, many early deployments do not, making them inflexible in crisis scenarios. Meme Coins and High-Beta Tokens: Virtually Defenseless At the other end of the spectrum lie meme coins and low-infrastructure tokens, which the o3 model described as ‚Äúnearly defenseless.‚Äù These tokens typically lack development teams, formal governance mechanisms, or upgrade paths, leaving them acutely vulnerable to any sudden shifts in cryptographic assumptions. In the event of Q-Day, such tokens would likely suffer immediate liquidity shocks, with whales offloading positions to avoid permanent loss. The community might attempt to fork the project onto a new chain, but without technical leadership, meaningful migration is unlikely. Who Is Ready for Q-Day? The o3 simulation‚Äôs sector-by-sector stress test does not predict which coins will succeed in market terms, but rather which systems have the structural capacity to survive a game-changing leap in computational power. Based on cryptographic architecture, governance agility, and ongoing research, the post-quantum readiness landscape looks like this: Best Positioned Today Apart from Algorand , Polkadot , Ethereum, and Cardano mentioned above, these other coins have been noted to be well positioned in the case of a Q-day. Cosmos Ecosystem (ATOM, Juno, Osmosis) Cosmos shares Polkadot‚Äôs modular philosophy. Independent zones (chains) communicate through IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), allowing sovereign upgrades. Projects like Juno and Osmosis have agile governance models and could implement PQC locally. Avalanche (AVAX) Employs a DAG-optimized consensus model (Snowball/Snowman), which increases redundancy and communication between subnets. Subnets (custom blockchains) can adopt PQC signatures independently. Governance is emerging, but the tech is flexible. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) A sharded blockchain with scalability and flexibility at its core. It already supports contract-based key rotation and multi-signature accounts, making future cryptographic migration plausible Tezos (XTZ) Tezos was one of the first blockchains to emphasize formal on-chain governance and self-amending protocols. It supports Michelson , a low-level functional language that allows for cryptographic primitives to be upgraded via governance proposals without forks. Radix (XRD) Radix uses a unique consensus model (Cerberus) and is focused on developer experience and modular architecture. While not currently post-quantum, its component-based DeFi engine and structured governance may allow for faster quantum-proof upgrades. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Built on hashgraph consensus (not a blockchain), Hedera offers high throughput and ABFT (asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance). Its enterprise focus includes forward-looking cryptographic considerations, and the council-led governance can act quickly. Most At Risk Monero , Shiba Inu and ERC-20 tokens, Dogecoin , Bitcoin was noted by o3 to have critical quantum-exposure risks , either due to obsolete cryptographic foundations, rigid governance, or a total dependency on vulnerable Layer-1 infrastructure. Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Dash (DASH): All forked from or closely related to Bitcoin, they inherit the same ECDSA vulnerabilities without demonstrating meaningful governance innovation or PQC research. Conclusion The takeaway is not to panic, but to prioritize strategic risk awareness . Quantum computing is not a hypothetical threat; it is an inevitable one . What remains uncertain is when it will become powerful enough to break widely used public-key cryptography. For blockchain projects, the prudent move isn‚Äôt to predict Q-Day‚Äôs exact date but to build architectures that can flex when it does arrive. That includes investing in research, improving governance, abstracting cryptography, and educating communities on quantum resilience.

Price action remained volatile, with BTC fluctuating between $107,194 and $108,489 during the 24-hour window, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. On June 29, 2025, President Donald Trump posted a pointed message on Truth Social addressing Republican lawmakers amid intense debate over his sweeping tax-and-spending package. ‚ÄúFor all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected. Don‚Äôt go too crazy! We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before,‚Äù he wrote. This statement underscores the deep divisions within the GOP as it wrestles with the ambitious legislation dubbed the ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill.‚Äù The bill, exceeding 900 pages, combines roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts with targeted spending reductions and increased funding for defense and border security. It seeks to make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump‚Äôs 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and certain auto loans. The child tax credit would rise to $2,200 under the Senate version, while deductions for seniors would increase temporarily. However, to offset these tax cuts, Republicans propose significant cuts to Medicaid and nutrition programs, sparking fierce debate within the party. Moderate Republicans from high-tax states are pushing for a higher cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT), while conservatives demand deeper spending cuts, particularly targeting Medicaid. These internal disagreements complicate efforts to secure the narrow Republican majorities needed in both chambers to pass the bill, which Democrats uniformly oppose as favoring the wealthy and worsening inequality. Trump‚Äôs social media message reflects an attempt to balance these competing pressures ‚Äî urging fiscal restraint to satisfy conservatives while emphasizing that robust economic growth will compensate for revenue losses and help reduce deficits over time. This supply-side economic approach projects that growth will ‚Äúmake it all up‚Äù despite near-term increases in the national debt, which nonpartisan analysts estimate could add trillions to the existing $36.2 trillion debt. Crypto analyst Will Clemente‚Äôs reaction on X (formerly Twitter) shortly after Trump‚Äôs post captures a common market sentiment: ‚ÄúHow can you read this and hold long term US treasuries at current yields lol... Also, how can you read this and not hold any Bitcoin or gold.‚Äù Clemente‚Äôs skepticism toward long-term U.S. Treasuries reflects concerns that the bill‚Äôs deficit-financed tax cuts and modest spending cuts signal a loose fiscal policy that could fuel inflation and currency debasement. In this context, traditional fixed-income assets like Treasuries may appear less attractive, as rising deficits and potential monetary accommodation threaten bond values. Conversely, hard assets such as gold and Bitcoin are increasingly viewed as stores of value and hedges against inflation and fiscal risk. The expectation of sustained deficits and political challenges to fiscal discipline bolster demand for these inflation-resistant assets. With the Senate racing to finalize the bill before the July 4 holiday, Trump‚Äôs call for unity and moderation highlights the high stakes and political challenges in passing one of the most consequential fiscal packages in recent U.S. history. The bill‚Äôs fate remains uncertain as lawmakers negotiate to balance tax relief, spending cuts, and political feasibility. Technical Analysis Highlights From June 28 15:00 to June 29 14:00 UTC, BTC traded from $107,194 to $108,489, a 1.21% intraday range. Support was established at $107,300, with multiple rebounds during the 02:00‚Äì03:00 window. Volume peaked at 7,538 BTC between 08:00 and 11:00 UTC on June 29, confirming upward momentum. During the final session hour (13:05‚Äì14:04 UTC), BTC fell from $108,219 to $108,059, forming a descending channel. A 130 BTC volume spike at 13:35 coincided with a sharp dip to $108,030, which was tested and held. Final intraday rally pushed price back toward $108K before fading slightly by 22:22 UTC to $107,937.

XRP, Avalanche, and Solana continue to dominate technical discussions. But while they each face their own challenges, a newer contender ‚Äî MAGACOIN FINANCE ‚Äî is pushing its way into the spotlight with bold analyst predictions and accelerating investor demand. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out isn‚Äôt just its political theme. It‚Äôs the numbers, the traction, and the strategy. With early buyers already anticipating up to 255x returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting up to potentially outpace some of the biggest names in the space. 1. XRP Price Forecast: Technical Strength Meets Delayed Fundamentals XRP price movements are closely mimicking Bitcoin‚Äôs pre-breakout trend ‚Äî a signal that has caught the attention of many technical analysts.When sentiment turns bullish in the market, this setup can result in a huge rally. The XRP price today continues to be suppressed by legal uncertainties and geopolitical disputes. But when it comes to longer term XRP price predictions, there are tens, if not more, of potential forecasts that point to high upside. The highest Q3 2025 estimates even go all the way up to $5.81. PHYSICAL DEMAND: Investor sentiment continues to be supported by buying interest and speculation regarding the potential for a XRP ETF. To those who ask: Will XRP price go up? analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Whatever the speed bumps in the short term, there is still a narrative for the asset over the next year if certain key regulatory hurdles are overcome. 2. Avalanche: Growth Potential with Measured Risk Avalanche has shown steady strength in recent weeks. Higher lows have formed a clear uptrend, yet resistance near the $18.50 range is proving to be a key battleground. A breakout with volume could open the door for sustained gains. But if that resistance holds, AVAX may retest lower levels. The AVAX price is also supported by Avalanche‚Äôs expanding real-world use cases. In New Jersey, property records are being digitized on Avalanche‚Äôs chain. Meanwhile, the Fan3 platform has launched to help brands engage fans globally using blockchain tools ‚Äî all powered by Avalanche. While short-term volatility remains, Avalanche price movement is being closely tracked. Analysts are paying attention to how the ecosystem‚Äôs adoption plays into long-term AVAX price strength. 3. Solana: Institutional Buzz Meets Meme Revenue Risks Solana continues to ride a wave of speculation. Hopes for a Solana ETF are growing, thanks to recent Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF successes. Institutional interest is strong, and developers are still flocking to the network. But a major concern has emerged. Roughly 75% of Solana‚Äôs recent chain revenue came from meme coin activity. That raises questions about the sustainability of its current revenue model. Solana news updates remain positive, but there‚Äôs a need for stronger fundamentals to back long-term gains. Still, analysts see a Q3 price target averaging $160.70, with highs potentially hitting $168.32. SOL price momentum is steady, but not without concerns. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Focus for 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the most sought-after tokens of the year. Its capped supply of 170 billion tokens creates a scarcity dynamic that early buyers see as a key advantage. Combined with no VC unlocks and a HashEx audit, the structure is winning over both retail and institutional investors. Every stage of its presale has sold out fast. Investor interest is growing daily. MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs bold, political identity is resonating across markets ‚Äî and its clear utility and transparent roadmap are only fueling more interest. While XRP, Avalanche, and Solana are being watched for technical patterns and speculation, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers something more direct ‚Äî upside. Analysts are now forecasting potential returns of up to 25x for early participants. The project‚Äôs momentum is strong, its smart contract is verified, and investor sentiment is climbing. As more eyes turn toward exchange listings, MAGACOIN FINANCE is expected to become one of the biggest breakout names of 2025. Final Word: MAGACOIN FINANCE Outpaces the Pack While XRP, Solana, and Avalanche continue to attract attention, none offer the same upside potential as MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP has legal delays. Avalanche faces resistance and market volatility. Solana is still trying to balance speculation with fundamentals. MAGACOIN FINANCE is moving faster, attracting high-volume buyers, and positioning itself for explosive growth. For investors looking for real returns ‚Äî and not just speculation ‚Äî MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the smarter move heading into 2025.

As the presale progresses, more retail buyers are noticing its potential. Measured Execution and Strategic Launch Countdown Unlike many projects that rush their launches, BlockDAG follows a precise, six-week countdown to the mainnet. Starting with the end of the presale, the transition to mainnet will be structured to ensure seamless execution. During this time, BlockDAG plans to roll out core infrastructure, launch community nodes, and release 40% of its airdrop. Additionally, it will also deploy DeFi components like decentralized exchanges (DEXs), oracles, and lending platforms. The plan culminates in the final marketing push and listing preparations. This transparency and attention to detail give potential users and supporters confidence that BlockDAG is ready to scale effectively. Strategic Growth and Path to Success In addition to the 100 million token airdrop, BlockDAG‚Äôs strategic partnerships, global expansion efforts, and developer incentives all point toward its future as one of the leading Layer 1 ecosystems. Its planned mainnet launch, combined with the growing number of active users and miners, gives BlockDAG a strong foundation to emerge as a top contender in the crypto space. BlockDAG is on track to be one of the most successful cryptocurrencies in 2025, thanks to its carefully crafted ecosystem, strategic development, and focus on community growth. If ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù in crypto means adoption, infrastructure, and execution, BlockDAG is already leading the way. BlockDAG‚Äôs Unique Hybrid Architecture and Adoption Potential BlockDAG is not attempting to mimic existing blockchain networks; instead, it combines the best features of multiple successful systems. Its hybrid architecture uses Proof-of-Work for security, DAG for scalability (enabling up to 15,000 transactions per second), and Ethereum‚Äôs smart contract compatibility for easy development and deployment of decentralized applications. With over 200,000 BDAG holders already, BlockDAG is demonstrating its adoption potential. The combination of a low presale price, early support from whales, a growing developer ecosystem, and active community engagement makes BlockDAG stand out as a unique project in the crypto space. Conclusion BlockDAG‚Äôs innovative hybrid architecture combines Proof-of-Work (PoW) security with Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scalability, allowing it to process thousands of transactions per second while ensuring decentralization. The project already has a live testnet with EVM compatibility, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) with lower fees and faster speeds than on Ethereum. Additionally, the strategic 100 million token airdrop and a U.S.-based sponsorship are further expanding BlockDAG‚Äôs ecosystem and preparing it for broader recognition. As the project moves forward, its unique approach to building infrastructure and growing its community sets it up for long-term success.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $36.8. By 2031, ICP‚Äôs price might reach a maximum of $113.32. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. The network leverages advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain‚Äôs future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let‚Äôs get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.90 Market Cap $2.61B Trading Volume $43.05M Circulating Supply 534.95M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $4.92 24-h Low $4.81 Internet Computer technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 7.65% 14-Day RSI 44.17 50-Day SMA $5.35 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 68 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $6.35 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP faces resistance at $5.056. MACD signals weak bearish momentum. ICP 1-day price analysis: ICP appears to be consolidating The 1-day chart for ICP on June 29 shows the price consolidating between $4.90 and $5.05. The recent price action has fluctuated within this narrow range, with multiple tests of the $4.90 support and attempts to break the $5.05 resistance. The MACD indicator shows weak bearish momentum as it hovers near the zero line, signaling indecisiveness in the market. ICP appears to be consolidating If ICP fails to break above $5.05 and establish momentum, it could remain trapped within the current consolidation range. A failure to maintain support at $4.64 would likely bring ICP back down to the next support at $4.31, which is critical for a potential rebound. ICP price analysis for 4-hour: ICP pulls back after testing key resistance level On the 4-hour chart, the coin has tested the upper Bollinger Band at $4.93 and is slightly pulling back, suggesting a possible overbought condition in the short term. The Balance of Power is negative at -0.38, showing a shift in momentum towards sellers. ICP pulls back after testing key resistance level The price is currently trading just below the upper resistance zone at $4.92, with a minor dip suggesting a small correction before potentially making another attempt to break resistance. If ICP fails to surpass $4.93, the price could drop to retest the lower support level at $4.65. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $4.77 BUY SMA 5 $4.96 SELL SMA 10 $4.96 SELL SMA 21 $5.34 SELL SMA 50 $5.35 SELL SMA 100 $5.30 SELL SMA 200 $6.35 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $5.12 SELL EMA 5 $5.15 SELL EMA 10 $5.15 SELL EMA 21 $5.25 SELL EMA 50 $5.80 SELL EMA 100 $6.80 SELL EMA 200 $7.86 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP seems to be in a state of indecision, hovering near critical support and resistance levels. If the price breaks above the $5.40 level, we could see a bullish continuation, but failure to maintain support above $4.64 could lead to further downward pressure. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies. Will Internet Computer reach $25? Yes, Internet Computer ICP might reach and surpass $25 as early as 2027. Will Internet Computer reach $50? Yes, Internet Computer is expected to reach $50. Will ICP reach $1000? Although its ATH sits at $750.73, attaining $1000 in the foreseeable future might be impossible. ICP is down 99% from its ATH and will require a massive turnaround in market fortunes to recapture previous highs. Does Internet Computer have a good long-term future? Yes, the Internet Computer coin shows a promising long-term future. Price predictions indicate steady growth, with a potential increase year-on-year, reflecting a positive trend and strong market potential.

The same survey found that current crypto owners say that tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) make up at least 14% of the total value of their financial assets. South Koreans: Crypto Trading on the Rise? The newspaper Cheonji Ilbo reported that the survey of 1,000 people nationwide was conducted in April this year by the Hana Financial Group‚Äôs Research Institute. South Korea called for a ‚Äúmutually beneficial‚Äù agreement on trade with the US during its new trade minister‚Äôs first trip to Washington this week. https://t.co/qeMmYlICCy ‚Äî Bloomberg (@business) June 28, 2025 The survey‚Äôs authors explained that 51% of the people they spoke to ‚Äúhad experience investing in crypto,‚Äù with 27% currently HODLing their coins. In this latter group, investors said they were holding onto an average of around 13 million won ($9,547) worth of coins. In the early stages of investment, the researchers found, traders tended to focus on Bitcoin. However, they also found that as traders gained experience, they tended to buy more altcoins, with a focus on stablecoins . Wallets on Multiple Exchanges The data also appears to indicate that many South Korean traders are prepared to shop around to find better prices. Over half of the respondents said they held crypto wallets on multiple domestic crypto exchanges . Seven out of 10 said they have traded on the market-leading trading platform Upbit. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past three months. (Source: CoinGecko) The majority of crypto-trading survey participants (60%) said they began investing in crypto in earnest during the 2020 Bitcoin bull run. Three-quarters of investors began investing with stakes worth less than 3 million won ($2,203). However, the value of their collective investments appears to have risen considerably. Over four in 10 of the crypto investors said they currently have coins worth more than 10 million won ($7,344) in their wallets. Majority of Traders Are Male Office Workers, Data Shows Most crypto investors were aged 40-49, with 67% of male respondents and just 33% of women saying they had bought coins. The majority of crypto investors (over half) said they were in white collar office jobs, with just 12% of physical laborers saying they had crypto holdings. The data also indicated that crypto investing-South Koreans tend to take more risks in the financial markets. The researchers noted that 38% of respondents showed signs of taking an ‚Äúactive‚Äù or ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù approach to investment tendency. This, they said, was twice the overall average of 20%.

XRP is holding steady‚Äîbut barely. And out of nowhere, a wildcard called MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting fire to the presale charts, flipping the political meme coin script for 2025. It started as a joke. Now, it‚Äôs a movement. With presale phases vanishing in hours and the token still priced under a penny, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn‚Äôt just gaining momentum‚Äîit‚Äôs charging full speed toward the kind of parabolic run that made early SHIBA and DOGE holders millionaires. Ethereum and XRP: Still Kings, But Slipping Let‚Äôs be clear‚ÄîEthereum isn‚Äôt going away. But right now, it‚Äôs stuck. A ‚Äúdeath cross‚Äù just formed on its two-week chart‚Äîsomething that preceded a 40% crash the last time it appeared in 2022. ETH is pinned near $2,460, facing weak demand and heavy resistance. Unless it clears $2,500 fast, analysts warn a drop to $2,100 could come next. XRP is faring better, thanks to its courtroom victory over the SEC. It‚Äôs trading around $2.20 and riding a wave of bullish speculation. But that $2.60 wall still hasn‚Äôt cracked. The hype is building, sure‚Äîbut the price isn‚Äôt moving fast enough to match it. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Already Moving This isn‚Äôt just another meme coin. MAGACOIN FINANCE is tapping into something raw and emotional‚Äîpolitics, culture, and identity‚Äîand it‚Äôs doing it with a war chest full of early investor capital. Millions raised. Thousands of wallets. Each presale phase sells out faster than the last. And yet, the price is still under $0.001. People aren‚Äôt buying it because of utility. They‚Äôre buying it because they feel it. Because it stands for something. Because it‚Äôs stirring the same kind of chaotic, high-voltage energy that gave rise to Trump, Dogecoin, and Reddit-fueled stock rallies. Analysts Say 25x to 35x Is Conservative‚ÄîSome Are Whispering 185x That‚Äôs not a typo. Conservative forecasts put MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs return potential between 25x and 35x for early buyers. But in this kind of narrative-driven market, where emotion often outpaces logic, there are louder whispers of 100x+. Some models even throw out 185x if momentum keeps climbing into listings. The fixed supply‚Äî170 billion tokens. The audit‚Äîcompleted. The price entry‚Äîstill dirt cheap. Everything about this setup screams breakout. Ethereum Builds Infrastructure. XRP Builds Payment Rails. MAGACOIN Builds Hype‚Äîand Hype Wins in Meme Markets. Don‚Äôt get it twisted. Ethereum and XRP will still be here in 2030. They‚Äôll have partnerships, upgrades, roadmaps. But MAGACOIN FINANCE might be the one that makes headlines this year. The one that people wish they‚Äôd bought when it was still under a penny. The one that rides into major listings with a wave of red caps, memes, and pure speculative fire. It won‚Äôt be the biggest by market cap. But in terms of raw returns? Cultural impact? 2025‚Äôs most talked-about political meme coin? MAGACOIN FINANCE might already be that. And if you‚Äôre still watching from the sidelines, you might be doing exactly what the early DOGE skeptics did‚Äîwaiting too long while others lock in generational wealth. Final Take Ethereum and XRP still dominate by scale. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is outpacing them where it matters most right now‚Äîmomentum, attention, and raw upside potential. It‚Äôs not trying to be the next smart contract king or cross-border solution. It‚Äôs trying to blow the roof off meme season before it even starts. And by the look of things, it just might pull it off.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins a new trading week, ETH is trading close to $2500, up 11% in the seven days, according to CoinDesk market data, outperforming BTC. Market observers have attributed ETH's outperformance versus bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies to a string of bullish headlines in the past few weeks. Stablecoins have regulatory clarity thanks to the GENIUS Act ‚Äì and Ethereum is home to the most stablecoin deposits; ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to see sizable flow. Technical analysis by CoinDesk's analyst Omkar Godbole indicates a potential bullish case is forming on-chain, with traders increasingly viewing $ 3,000 ETH as a possibility in the near future. But behind the scenes, something more fundamental is happening. Ethereum‚Äôs validator architecture, the backbone of its proof-of-stake security model, is undergoing a quiet transformation that could cement ETH‚Äôs role as Wall Street‚Äôs favorite programmable asset. At the center of that shift is distributed validator technology, or DVT, a system that allows Ethereum validators to be split across multiple operators and machines, making them far more resilient, secure, and decentralized. Obol Labs is one of the leading teams behind the technology. ‚ÄúEthereum is coming back in favor because it‚Äôs the most secure and battle-tested blockchain,‚Äù said Anthony Bertolino, head of ecosystem at Obol Labs. ‚ÄúAnd security comes from validators. The most advanced and secure ones now are distributed validators.‚Äù Obol‚Äôs technology eliminates a long-standing problem in Ethereum staking: single points of failure. Traditional validators rely on a single node to propose and attest to blocks. If that node goes offline or is misconfigured, the validator is penalized, or slashed in Ethereum parlance. Obol‚Äôs system uses threshold cryptography and an ‚Äúactive-active‚Äù architecture so that even if some nodes fail, the validator keeps running without interruption. This upgrade is not just a technical improvement. It is an institutional requirement. As Ethereum sees inflows from ETFs, funds, and structured finance products, staking infrastructure needs to meet the standards of traditional capital allocators. Blockdaemon, for instance, recently announced that it is integrating Obol's distributed validator technology into its staking infrastructure. Blockdaemon is a $100 billion name for institutional crypto. ‚ÄúHistorically, institutions had to choose between performance and security,‚Äù Bertolino said. ‚ÄúNow they get both.‚Äù Momentum is building fast. Lido, Ethereum‚Äôs largest staking protocol with $22 billion in total value locked , is preparing to approve distributed validator use across its ‚ÄúCurated Set‚Äù ‚Äî the collection of professional node operators who manage over 30 percent of all staked ETH. A new governance proposal would allow these operators to use either Obol or SSV in intra-operator setups, and eventually expand usage across thousands of validators. This move builds on the success of Lido‚Äôs Simple DVT Module, which has already deployed over 9,600 DVT-powered validators with a 97.5 percent effectiveness score, outperforming the network average. ‚ÄúThese clusters are already showing better uptime, higher effectiveness, and similar yields to conventional setups,‚Äù Bertolino said. ‚ÄúThis is the infrastructure shift that makes Ethereum staking enterprise-grade.‚Äù For Ethereum, the implications go beyond validator design. DVT mitigates one of the network‚Äôs core criticisms, that its staking layer is increasingly centralized, and helps fulfill the vision of Ethereum to be neutral, distributed infrastructure. ""Institutions are thinking about two things. How do I secure the assets, and how do I generate attractive yield? Historically, you had to choose one. DVT gives you both,‚Äù Bertolino said. And Wall Street continues to pay attention. News Recap: Short COIN, Long BTC as Coinbase Nears Overvaluation, Says 10x Research Coinbase shares have surged 84% in the past two months, far outpacing bitcoin‚Äôs 14% gain and raising red flags about overvaluation, according to 10x Research, covered late last week by CoinDesk . In a Friday note, Head of Research Markus Thielen recommended a short COIN/long BTC trade, arguing that Coinbase‚Äôs fundamentals‚Äîmainly trading volumes‚Äîdon‚Äôt justify the rally. ‚ÄúWhile Coinbase hasn‚Äôt quite breached the +30% overvaluation threshold, it‚Äôs approaching fast,‚Äù Thielen wrote, suggesting options strategies or pair trades to exploit the potential reversal. 10x‚Äôs model finds 75% of COIN‚Äôs price action is tied to bitcoin‚Äôs price and volumes, meaning recent gains likely reflect excessive speculation. The report notes other bullish catalysts, including Circle‚Äôs IPO and U.S. stablecoin legislation, are likely priced in, while Korean investor momentum is fading. ‚ÄúThis rare deviation suggests Coinbase‚Äôs valuation is extended and vulnerable to mean reversion,‚Äù Thielen said, warning that COIN could soon follow other overheated crypto stocks lower. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is trading above $108K as Asia opens its trading week, but analyst Micha√´l van de Poppe says it must break $109K resistance to sustain momentum, with the rally fueled more by leveraged futures than spot demand. ETH: Ethereum broke above $2,440 with strong volume support, signaling bullish momentum amid new U.S. stock market highs, improving global liquidity, and easing geopolitical tensions. Gold: Gold is trading at $3,248.26, down slightly, as Australia cuts its commodity export earnings forecast due to weak iron ore and gas prices despite surging gold. Nikkei 225: Nikkei 225 futures are trending higher with an expectation that the White House will reach trade deals with Japan and other export-heavy Asian economies.

According to a new report from CEX.IO, 45% of crypto card transactions fall under the 10-euro mark, reflecting a shift in consumer behaviour and highlighting crypto‚Äôs growing role in day-to-day payments. The report, shared with Cointelegraph, noted a 15% year-on-year increase in newly issued CEX.IO crypto cards across the continent in 2025. This trend indicates a broader acceptance of digital assets as a means for routine purchases and suggests that crypto cardholders are now mirroring traditional banking habits, especially when it comes to online spending. Online Spending Nearly Doubles Traditional Usage Rates While the European Central Bank (ECB) reports that 21% of card payments in the eurozone are made online, CEX.IO data shows that 40% of crypto card transactions occur via the internet. This figure nearly doubles the regional average, showcasing the comfort crypto users have with digital platforms. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing in Europe is that crypto card users aren‚Äôt just experimenting with new tech ‚Äî they‚Äôre showing us what everyday spending might look like in a truly cashless future,‚Äù said Alexandr Kerya, Vice President of Product Management at CEX.IO. He also revealed that average payment volumes have jumped 24% in the past month alone. Crypto Spending Patterns Mirror Traditional Banking The data further illustrates how crypto cardholders are incorporating digital currencies into their daily routines. Groceries represent 59% of crypto card purchases, which is close to the ECB‚Äôs 54% average for traditional bank cards. Spending at restaurants and bars accounts for 19% ‚Äî a higher figure than typical bank card usage in that category. The average crypto card transaction stands at ‚Ç¨23.70, lower than the ‚Ç¨33.60 average for traditional bank card payments, based on Mastercard‚Äôs Q1 2025 data. Stablecoins Lead Transactions as Other Cryptos Gain Ground Stablecoins play a dominant role in these transactions, powering 73% of all crypto card activity. Nevertheless, other leading digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Solana are also being used for essentials like groceries, dining, and transport. This mirrors broader usage trends across the crypto sector. For example, platforms like Oobit and Crypto.com are also reporting strong transaction volumes related to everyday spending and online shopping across their European user base. Institutional Pushbacks Continue Despite Adoption Gains However, not all financial institutions are welcoming this trend. Barclays has announced that it will block crypto purchases on its Barclaycard credit cards. The bank cited concerns over the volatility of digital assets and the lack of consumer protections available through traditional financial mechanisms. Barclays emphasized that crypto transactions are not covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, leaving users exposed in case of disputes or losses. Despite such institutional caution, the momentum behind crypto card usage continues to grow, reflecting an evolving financial landscape that is increasingly embracing digital innovation.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|LTC|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-29 23:43:55

However, while the figure surpassed the previous H1 record set in 2022, the numbers were considerably skewed by just one incident, a $1.5 billion attack on Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit. The Defining Breach The Bybit breach , which happened in February, was not just the largest crypto hack ever; it was a geopolitical act, with TRM Labs, alongside several other security firms, attributing it to North Korean state-sponsored actors. According to the report , the incident accounted for nearly 70% of all crypto thefts in the first half of 2025 and inflated the average hack size to $30 million, double that of H1 2024‚Äôs figure. In total, there were about 75 distinct attacks. January, April, and May saw significant cases, all exceeding $100 million, indicating a pervasive and persistent threat landscape beyond just the headline-grabbing mega hack. Overall, TRM‚Äôs insight estimated that groups linked to North Korea were responsible for at least $1.6 billion of the total losses so far this year. According to the analytics firm, proceeds from such operations were most likely used to not only evade sanctions placed on the Pyongyang regime, but also to help bankroll its strategic initiatives, including its nuclear program. Technically, the report noted that infrastructure intrusions targeting fundamental weaknesses like private key/seed phrase security or exchange front-ends were the dominant vector, accounting for over 80% of the stolen funds. These breaches, often amplified by social engineering or insider threats, exploit the core foundations of crypto security and usually result in incidents ten times larger, on average, than other methods. Additionally, protocol-level exploits, such as flash loan manipulations in DeFi, contributed another 12%, highlighting persistent smart contract vulnerabilities. A New Era of Cyber Warfare in Crypto H1 2025 also saw the emergence of a new front in how geopolitical conflicts are waged: the explicit use of crypto hacking as a tool of war. This was seen in the recent attack on Iran‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, Nobitex, by Gonjeshke Darande (Predatory Sparrow), a group reportedly linked to Israel, which stole more than $90 million from the platform. The group publicly stated their motivation, claiming they had targeted the exchange for its role in helping Iran circumvent sanctions and finance illicit activities. Interestingly, they transferred the stolen funds to vanity addresses lacking corresponding private keys, rendering them inaccessible, and strongly signaling that the operation was executed for symbolic or political retaliation, rather than financial gain.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $4.59 to $5.54. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW‚Äôs price movements. Given Flow coin‚Äôs strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.3287 Market Cap $523.59M Trading Volume $11.91M Circulating Supply 1.59B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.3032 24-hour High $0.3290 24-hour Low $0.3243 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.01% 50-Day SMA $0.3841 14-Day RSI 41.78 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 68 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.4503 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Flow coin is consolidating between $0.323 and $0.330. Support is at $0.290, and resistance is at $0.372. Flow coin 1-day price analysis: FLOW is hovering around the 0.236 Fibonacci level The 1-day price chart analysis for June 29 shows the price hovering around the 0.236 Fibonacci level, a crucial point in the recovery process. Immediate resistance lies at $0.372, while the next support could be near $0.290. The MACD on the chart is negative, indicating a bearish trend with potential for further downward movement. A reversal above $0.372 would confirm a momentum shift, but the market sentiment remains bearish. FLOW is hovering around the 0.236 Fibonacci level Flow coin 4-hour price analysis: FLOW shows moderate buying interest The 4-hour chart reflects a relatively stable price action within the range of $0.323 to $0.330, forming a consolidation pattern with a slight upward bias. A sharp move outside this range might indicate increased volatility. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) of 7.39M shows moderate buying interest, although it‚Äôs not strong enough to break above the resistance at $0.330. FLOW shows moderate buying interest FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3335 SELL SMA 5 $0.3425 SELL SMA 10 $0.3362 SELL SMA 21 $0.3534 SELL SMA 50 $0.3841 SELL SMA 100 $0.3874 SELL SMA 200 $0.4503 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3503 SELL EMA 5 $0.3610 SELL EMA 10 $0.3695 SELL EMA 21 $0.3798 SELL EMA 50 $0.4197 SELL EMA 100 $0.4910 SELL EMA 200 $0.5699 SELL What to expect from Flow? If FLOW breaks the support at $0.323, further downside towards $0.290 may occur, while a break above $0.330 could lead to a minor bullish move. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network‚Äôs unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

CNBC reports that Ric Edelman, who previously said that allocating as much as 1% to crypto was reasonable, is now saying that financial advisors should recommend allocating between 10% and 40% to digital assets. Says Edelman in an interview with CNBC‚Äôs Crypto World, ‚ÄúToday I am saying 40%, that‚Äôs astonishing. No one has ever said such a thing.‚Äù The founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals is now more bullish on crypto assets amid the massive changes in the industry. According to Edelman, Bitcoin and the broader crypto space faced numerous uncertainties four years ago ‚Äì from the possibility of government bans on BTC , to concerns about blockchain technology becoming obsolete, to questions about whether digital asset adoption would gain meaningful traction. ‚ÄúToday, all those questions have been resolved. It‚Äôs radically changed and is now a mainstream asset.‚Äù Edelman also says that Bitcoin and crypto should play a bigger role in long-term investment strategies as life expectancy in the US increases. According to the financial advisor, allocating 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds no longer works, given that Americans can live up to 85 today, or even much older with advances in tech and medicine. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a financial advisor and you had a 30-year-old client who was saving for their long-term future, you would tell them to put 100% of their money in stocks, because they have 50 years to go. Today‚Äôs 60-year-old is kind of like yesterday‚Äôs 30-year-old. You need to get better returns than you can get from bonds, and you need to hold equities longer than ever before.‚Äù Edelman notes that Bitcoin is a great portfolio diversifier as it doesn‚Äôt appear to be correlated with the performance of other asset classes. He also says that digital assets tend to outperform stocks, bonds, gold and others. ‚ÄúBitcoin prices don‚Äôt move in sync with stocks or bonds or gold or oil or commodities‚Ä¶ The crypto asset class offers the opportunity for higher returns than you‚Äôre likely to get in virtually any other asset class.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Ethereum (ETH) is testing a significant resistance level, and Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing renewed interest, with projections suggesting the potential for strong returns. While both continue to attract short-term attention, Unstaked is emerging as a long-term prospect with tangible utility and notable upside. At a current price of $0.012091 in Stage 22 and a launch goal of $0.1819, Unstaked unlocks a 28x return for early participants. With $10.6 million already raised and a platform centered on AI agents governed by users, Unstaked is establishing itself as a utility-driven contender. In a shifting market that increasingly favors substance over speculation, Unstaked is gaining recognition as a potential leading pick among next-generation crypto platforms. Ethereum (ETH) Consolidates Just Below Resistance Ethereum remains range-bound, currently trading just beneath the $2,540‚Äì$2,570 resistance level. This zone includes converging exponential moving averages and upper Bollinger Band limits. Despite several failed attempts to move past $2,600, buyers have maintained control near $2,510, with visible support emerging around $2,480. Indicators reflect a neutral market stance, with MACD showing minimal momentum and RSI hovering close to 49. A confirmed breakout above $2,570 could enable moves toward $2,660 and $2,710. However, failure to sustain upward momentum could open the door for a retest of support levels near $2,438. As volatility compresses and technical levels align, Ethereum (ETH) continues to approach a point where a breakout could signal broader altcoin movement. Dogecoin (DOGE) Repositions as Analysts Eye High Upside Potential Dogecoin has recovered modestly, trading near $0.1690 after briefly dipping below $0.174. The price remains within a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating that a larger directional move may be approaching. According to Ali Martinez, a breakout above $0.22 could trigger the beginning of a stronger rally. Meanwhile, Javon Marks forecasts an ambitious 600% increase, suggesting a long-term target of $1.25. While recent weakness was linked to declining open interest and overall market caution, structural indicators remain intact. A clean break above the $0.22 level may first target $0.65, representing a 260% gain. Within this landscape, Unstaked offers a contrasting opportunity. While Dogecoin rides technical momentum, Unstaked delivers real-world functionality with comparable upside potential. Unstaked: AI Utility, Transparent Governance, & High Growth Potential Unstaked‚Äôs rise is underpinned by its unique blend of AI integration and user-led governance. Priced at $0.012091 in its 22nd presale stage and aiming for a launch value of $0.1819, the project provides a potential 28x return. This pricing alone has drawn interest, but the platform‚Äôs operational focus has further strengthened investor interest. At its foundation, Unstaked empowers users to create and manage AI agents that perform various tasks, such as content management and data handling. After Unstaked‚Äôs public launch, these agents will function directly on-chain, offering verifiable transparency and ownership. Unlike many projects that promote AI as a vague concept, Unstaked ties its AI features to real governance structures, allowing participants to shape development and application. The team has also launched a $1,000,000 giveaway for early supporters, adding further appeal during the presale. Having already raised more than $10.6 million and sold over 1.2 billion tokens, Unstaked is gaining traction with serious capital. Compared to speculative bets, Unstaked represents a platform rooted in practical value with long-term growth potential. Crypto markets appear to be entering a new phase. Established names like Ethereum and Dogecoin are navigating familiar levels, waiting for signals to define their next moves. At the same time, Unstaked is capitalizing on early-stage enthusiasm by offering utility, community governance, and price potential that legacy tokens no longer provide. Looking Ahead Ethereum is consolidating and Dogecoin is recovering, but Unstaked is growing. Its use of AI, transparent mechanics, and planned token economics present a forward-thinking approach to crypto development. In a market slowly favoring platforms with real products and engaged communities, Unstaked‚Äôs early entry price and momentum may be difficult to overlook. As technical setups mature for ETH and DOGE, investors are increasingly evaluating emerging platforms. The broader trend suggests that future winners may not be the current leaders, but rather the projects laying groundwork today.

47059543,https://thecoinrise.com/web3-ais-0-000443-price-holds-strong-roi-potential-while-sol-link-show-signs-of-strong-breakouts/,1751241620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/47059543.jpeg,Web3 ai‚Äôs $0.000443 Price Holds Strong ROI Potential While SOL & LINK Show Signs of Strong Breakouts,https://thecoinrise.com/web3-ais-0-000443-price-holds-strong-roi-potential-while-sol-link-show-signs-of-strong-breakouts/,"Solana (SOL) is gaining traction within an ascending triangle, a technical setup often followed by sharp price moves. If this scenario plays out, SOL could surge 30% and reach $180. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) has gained momentum following its involvement in a central bank trial in Hong Kong. LINK rose 9% in a single day and continues drawing institutional interest. Unlike SOL and LINK, which rely on external triggers, Web3 ai ($WAI) builds internal value. WAI gives users access to a wide range of AI features and burns with each use, cutting total supply. Currently priced at $0.000443 in Stage 9, WAI is expected to list at $0.005242. Web3 ai has now raised over $8.5 million and is gaining steady traction. Solana: Breakout Pattern Could Lift Price Toward $180 Solana (SOL) continues to build within a bullish triangle, marked by resistance between $140 and $145 and higher support levels. This setup generally leads to a price spike. A break above $145 could open the way for SOL to approach $180. Rising volume and on-chain strength are backing the pattern. SOL has maintained key levels, and increased volume hints at stronger market confidence. Traders are keeping a close eye on a close above $145, with stop-losses likely placed just below the trendline. Should the move slow, the triangle may hold longer, offering another entry near $135. This setup gives a clear technical roadmap for short-term gains, making Solana a top crypto to buy now. Chainlink: Strong Price Move After CBDC Integration Chainlink (LINK) recently enabled a successful trial of digital asset transfers between a Hong Kong dollar and an Australian dollar stablecoin. This was achieved using its CCIP technology, linking public blockchains like Ethereum to private systems in real-time. Following the news, LINK jumped more than 9% in a single day, crossing $15 and outperforming major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Market indicators support the rise. Volatility dropped, and metrics like open interest and derivatives activity rose, showing solid market engagement. With support holding at $12.64 and a breakout in progress above $15, LINK could soon reach $16. Its involvement in national-level blockchain use cases continues to boost its position as one of the top cryptos to buy now. Web3 ai‚Äôs Price Under $0.001 Sets Up A 1747% Growth Potential Web3 ai is getting close to its main launch, and the current stage may be the last chance to enter at low prices. The team is rapidly working on software tools, a new user interface, and cross-chain functionality. All features are already under testing. With beta access scheduled for Q4, prices are projected to rise to $0.005242, a 1747% jump from the current $0.000443 in Stage 9. Over $8.5 million has been raised so far, covering development, audits, marketing, and liquidity planning. The platform will offer several AI-based features for daily crypto use, and every time a tool runs, WAI is burned. This shrinking supply increases demand. With a price still under a cent, Web3 ai is positioned as a strong option for those eyeing value-driven projects. As demand builds and features roll out, missing this entry may not be an option for long. The Bottom Line Both Solana and Chainlink show promise through strong setups and broader use. But they depend on outside news to sustain moves. Web3 ai‚Äôs WAI, on the other hand, is driven by built-in use and active scarcity. Priced at $0.000443, WAI could deliver a 1747% gain ahead of listing. Each feature burns supply, building long-term traction. While traders wait for SOL and LINK breakouts, WAI is already moving on clear fundamentals.

47059356,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=169928,1751241623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/47059356.jpeg,"Could XRP Still Hit a 20x ROI Target, or Will This Political Meme Crypto Achieve It First in 2025?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-xrp-still-hit-a-20x-roi-target-or-will-this-political-meme-crypto-achieve-it-first-in-2025/,"XRP has long been a symbol of crypto‚Äôs push for legitimacy ‚Äî backed by years of legal battles, institutional alignment, and infrastructure growth. But as 2025 unfolds, investors are asking a sharper question: Can XRP still deliver the type of exponential returns the altcoin market is known for? Or is the next big move already taking shape in a very different corner of the market ‚Äî one dominated not by financial institutions, but by political meme momentum? XRP‚Äôs Institutional Play: Maturity Meets Uncertainty Expectations of stronger institutional support have helped XRP weather market turbulence over the last few months. Technical analysis is still divided; some analysts point to hesitations close to important resistance zones, while others highlight strength in the setup as a whole. The token‚Äôs visibility has grown, particularly as U.S.-based financial entities inch closer to offering full-fledged crypto products tied to XRP. Major exchanges are getting ready for wider integration, and a number of futures-based instruments have already been approved. However, XRP‚Äôs long-term growth outlook is no longer just about infrastructure ‚Äî it‚Äôs now intertwined with regulatory rulings, Ripple‚Äôs evolving stablecoin strategy, and whether legacy use cases still resonate in a market increasingly driven by speed and sentiment. Ripple‚Äôs Stablecoin Focus May Blur XRP‚Äôs Role Ripple‚Äôs internal strategy has taken a decisive turn. Rather than positioning XRP as a backbone for international payments, the focus has shifted to a native stablecoin offering ‚Äî a move many in the industry see as a bet on reliability and integration over volatility. This change, while potentially strategic, has also introduced confusion around XRP‚Äôs long-term utility. With Ripple pushing a new financial product to meet the same use case, some investors are questioning whether XRP can continue to deliver growth at scale ‚Äî or whether it‚Äôs becoming more of a macro-aligned hedge than a vehicle for rapid gains. Meme Coin Mechanics: MAGACOIN FINANCE Grabs Attention While XRP‚Äôs future plays out through courtrooms and regulatory filings, another player is being discussed in analyst circles and trading groups: MAGACOIN FINANCE, a politically-charged meme token designed to tap into culture, momentum, and speculative capital. Unlike XRP, which is tied to legacy ambitions and enterprise partnerships, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built for market speed. Its structure is straightforward: viral branding, fast-moving narratives, and investor excitement around high-multiple return potential. According to several market observers, early-stage metrics and buying patterns suggest that this token may be positioning for a major upside move. Though speculative, internal forecasts in some reports are starting to model scenarios where 20x returns are not off the table. Two Very Different Roads to ROI The 2025 market is shaping up to reward both structure and sentiment ‚Äî but likely not in equal measure. XRP represents a long-term bet on institutional normalization, built on regulatory wins and financial integrations. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, operates on fast cycles, driven by participation waves and meme-based conviction. For ROI-focused traders, the decision comes down to timing and risk appetite. Do they wait for regulatory clarity and ETF momentum to potentially push XRP forward ‚Äî or do they act earlier on a high-volatility asset like MAGACOIN FINANCE that thrives on attention and rapid entry flows? MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Cross the Finish Line First While XRP‚Äôs journey is far from over, the altcoin market rarely rewards patience over momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its viral edge and growing presence among early adopters, may be first to hit a high-multiple return mark in this cycle. Analysts aren‚Äôt comparing the two in function ‚Äî but in outcome. And the outcome that matters most to investors right now? Return on entry. Whether or not XRP reaches its full potential this year, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly making the case that it could be the one to get there first.

Completely wrong. Six months into 2025, Trump‚Äôs presidency has bulldozed nearly every assumption Wall Street made about markets, inflation, and the strength of the US economy. What was supposed to be a year of American dominance, driven by Trump‚Äôs low-tax and high-tariff policies, turned into something else entirely. According to Bloomberg, those policies triggered fear, confusion, and some of the wildest price action seen in years. The fallout started fast. Massive moves in sovereign bonds kicked things off. Then the Japanese yen climbed nearly 9% against the dollar. Emerging markets began attracting attention again. But the real shock came from where traders least expected: the US dollar, stocks, and Trump‚Äôs own economic agenda. All of it got shredded, and the market‚Äôs golden trades are nowhere to be found. Trump‚Äôs policies weaken the dollar and blindside investors At the beginning of the year, the bet was simple: Trump‚Äôs economic plans would drive inflation higher, slow down any chance of Federal Reserve rate cuts, and push the dollar even higher. That‚Äôs not what happened. A Bloomberg index tracking the US currency posted its worst start to a year since 2005. The selloff was deep. The shock was global. Things escalated in April when Trump rolled out his ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs ‚Äî wide-reaching, aggressive penalties that rattled investor confidence. The impact was brutal. Worries over a possible US recession took hold, and traders started to believe Trump might be actively trying to weaken the dollar to help domestic industry. That‚Äôs a problem for the American government. It still depends on foreign investors to finance its massive debt pile. A weaker dollar means smaller returns for those investors. It also means less faith in US assets. JPMorgan strategist Meera Chandan said the dollar‚Äôs fading connection to interest rates and equities might reflect deeper cracks in its foundation. Her team expects another 2% drop in dollar strength by year-end. Banks like Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale, and JPMorgan had all expected the dollar to stay strong through the first half of the year. They were wrong. They thought it would lose value slowly, maybe late in the year. No one called this early collapse. US stocks crash, rebound, and leave traders confused Wall Street was all-in on American equities in January. Everyone had their chips on artificial intelligence and the strength of the US economy. The Nasdaq 100 was flying high. Then the crash came. Between February and April, almost $7 trillion in market cap vanished from the index. The optimism died quick. Part of the reason? China‚Äôs DeepSeek. The AI startup came out of nowhere and suddenly looked like a real threat to American tech dominance. That was the first crack. Then Trump‚Äôs tariff decisions added real fear that the US economy could stall. A March survey from Bank of America showed fund managers had pulled out of US stocks in record numbers. By April, bulls were gone. There was no upside, no appetite for risk, but then Trump did what nobody expected, pausing some of the harshest tariffs, which flipped everything. The S&P 500 exploded to new highs, the economy kept humming, and tech stocks got hot again, thanks to strong earnings and consistent growth. Large investors jumped back in by mid-April, and they haven‚Äôt backed off. The chaos showed how fast Trump‚Äôs policies can change market behavior. He introduced tariffs that helped drive stocks into a hole. Then he paused them and turned everything around. None of it was stable. Every trader caught off guard was forced to rethink their whole strategy. While the US dollar crumbled, the yen got stronger. At the start of the year, investors were already betting on Japan. The Bank of Japan was one of the few central banks expected to raise rates in 2025, while others were looking to cut. That alone made the yen look good. But then Trump added fuel to the fire. As markets reacted to Trump‚Äôs trade moves and the rising threat of recession, traders looked for safety. The yen, always seen as a haven in times of stress, was the obvious play. By June, it had gained nearly 9% against the dollar. It was one of the best performing currencies all year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

While traders react to the latest swings, savvy investors are using this moment to reposition. In the midst of these moves, one project is drawing increasing attention from analysts and early-stage investors alike: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum Faces Congestion and Innovation Pressures Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform, but its performance is being challenged by both internal and external factors. Ongoing concerns over network congestion and the complexity of scaling solutions have triggered fluctuating sentiment. While Ethereum‚Äôs roadmap toward full scalability is promising, short-term uncertainty is leading some traders to reduce exposure temporarily. This has created a rare opening for repositioning capital into emerging sectors of the crypto space. Cardano Struggles to Maintain Narrative Momentum Cardano, known for its research-driven approach and proof-of-stake model, has faced difficulties maintaining investor momentum. While its development team continues to roll out upgrades, the pace of real-world adoption has lagged behind expectations. This contrast between long-term potential and short-term indecision is sparking mixed reactions across technical and fundamental analysis circles. For investors seeking more immediate ROI catalysts, capital is starting to shift toward opportunities with stronger short-term positioning. XRP Enters Regulatory Clarity Phase Following major breakthroughs in the U.S. and Canadian regulatory landscape, XRP has entered a transitional phase. While analysts applaud developments such as the Canadian spot XRP ETF and mounting approval odds in the U.S., the asset‚Äôs near-term performance remains heavily influenced by institutional sentiment and ETF timelines. With XRP largely viewed as a longer-term play tied to legal and regulatory outcomes, some investors are reallocating to opportunities that carry more aggressive upside during this rotation window. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gaining Ground in Smart Capital Circles Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a token of interest among investors seeking asymmetric gains. Analysts highlight its scarcity-driven token model, external audit confirmation, and rising traction in investor research platforms. Previous stages sold out instantly, and the project continues to show strong momentum without relying on short-term hype cycles. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is its intrinsic design for structural growth ‚Äî a rare quality in a market filled with fleeting narratives. Positioned at the intersection of political themes and forward-looking infrastructure, the token is increasingly viewed as a strategic allocation for those preparing ahead of a potential market-wide surge in Q4 2025. Final Thoughts The current volatility in Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP isn‚Äôt a warning sign ‚Äî it‚Äôs a signal. For seasoned investors, these periods offer a chance to rebalance and realign. And in that realignment, high-upside, early-position tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are becoming part of the serious conversation. Whether you‚Äôre planning for the next rotation or preparing to capitalize on the next wave of retail momentum, the smartest moves often happen during moments of doubt. As institutional and retail dynamics continue to shift, the time to evaluate next-phase opportunities ‚Äî especially those with structural potential ‚Äî is now.

Hype coins are being pushed aside, and coins with real systems and working platforms are getting more attention. Among the names catching eyes are BlockDAG, Avalanche, Cosmos, and Cardano. These projects are making noise with their features and long-term promise. Each one brings a different angle to the table, but BlockDAG is moving quickly with its system upgrades and offers an attractive entry price. If you‚Äôre trying to find the top altcoins to buy today, this article will walk you through the latest info on these coins and explain why BlockDAG may be heading for a major rise. 1. BlockDAG: High-Speed Growth with 2,660% Return Already Seen BlockDAG is gaining traction fast, with strong presale figures and regular tech upgrades. So far, the project has raised $323.5 million and sold 23.3 billion coins, creating a solid path forward. It‚Äôs now in stage 29, priced at $0.0080 for a limited time. Those who bought in at stage 1 have already seen their holdings grow by 2,660%. With a projected listing value of $0.05, the current price point could lead to 16x gains. BlockDAG‚Äôs system includes its X1 app, which has drawn in over 2 million users already. The rollout of its mining devices, like the X30 and X100, is expected in July and August. After the recent GO LIVE reveal, the project confirmed listings on 20 exchanges, helping with easy market entry. With full audits from Halborn and CertiK, the project‚Äôs system is also backed by strong safety checks. If you‚Äôre reviewing the top altcoins to buy today, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as a top choice with both strong numbers and rapid platform growth. 2. Avalanche: Dealing with Dips but Showing Future Promise Avalanche (AVAX) has been bouncing between price zones, currently near $16.83 after dipping into the $15.72 to $17.13 range. Some expect a short-term slide below $15.50, but others remain hopeful for a rebound. Despite recent price swings, Avalanche remains active in DeFi use cases and keeps building its user base. It still deserves a spot on any list of top altcoins to buy today. With real apps and strong usage in decentralised systems, it shows that its network is still strong. While quick profits may be delayed, Avalanche could turn into a great option when market conditions improve. Keep it on your radar as it works on regaining its footing. 3. Cardano: Near Support, Ready for a Comeback Cardano (ADA) trades around $0.54, down from its past peak of $0.60. The price has fallen 6.5% lately, but the chart signals suggest it may be oversold. If ADA holds the $0.513 support line, a recovery could follow. Its base remains steady due to strong building activity. With over 2,000 projects underway and lots of large transfers happening, Cardano continues to push ahead. One key metric showing belief in ADA is the withdrawal of over $932 million from exchanges in 2024. Although it‚Äôs not the fastest mover, Cardano remains one of the top altcoins to buy today because of its steady platform upgrades and active user interest. 4. Cosmos: Focused Work Behind the Scenes Cosmos (ATOM) sits around $3.78, with support close to $3.60 and upper resistance between $3.87 and $4.00. The coin hasn‚Äôt shown major upward movement lately, but updates are coming regularly. The project has made solid steps with the IBC Eureka and Tokenomics 2.0 changes, strengthening its spot in cross-chain and DeFi tools. Links with Ethereum via IBC and its part in CBDC pilots show that Cosmos is slowly expanding its role. Even with sideways trading, Cosmos remains backed by its strong network and active dev team. For those hunting the top altcoins to buy today, Cosmos could reward patient holders as new upgrades are adopted. Final Say! Crypto continues to evolve, and different coins bring different strengths to the table. Cosmos offers cross-chain power, Cardano keeps growing its base, and Avalanche pushes forward in the DeFi space. But among these, BlockDAG shines with strong presale numbers and fast tech growth. With $323.5 million raised and a clear target of $0.05 on launch, BlockDAG‚Äôs $0.0080 price gives room for over 500% ROI. Plus, early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth since the first stage. With its large user base, upcoming mining tools, and 20 listings revealed during its GO LIVE announcement, BlockDAG is building fast. If you‚Äôre picking the top altcoins to buy today , all four projects deserve attention, but BlockDAG may offer the fastest path to returns.

They‚Äôve survived bear markets, attracted institutional backing, and delivered real-world utility. But in a market that rewards early positioning, many investors are now turning their attention to a new crop of undervalued tokens. At the top of that list is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project that‚Äôs gaining momentum fast‚Äîand could surprise even seasoned holders of XRP and Ethereum. Ethereum remains the smart contract standard, Avalanche offers fast execution and interoperability, and XRP is reclaiming relevance in global payments following regulatory clarity. Yet for all their strength, the upside on these large caps is starting to look capped‚Äîat least in the short term. That‚Äôs pushed many investors to scan the presale landscape for the kind of opportunities that don‚Äôt show up twice in a cycle. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Catching Serious Attention MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as more than just another presale. With a DeFi lending model, a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, it‚Äôs hitting all the right notes with early-stage investors. What‚Äôs driving the buzz isn‚Äôt just the low entry‚Äîit‚Äôs the speed of adoption. Wallet growth is climbing, and analysts are beginning to flag it as one of the few presales with both momentum and actual mechanics behind the hype. Unlike some of the smaller projects riding on promises, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rolling out with clear fundamentals and a roadmap that aligns with current DeFi trends. Its early appeal echoes the breakout stories of past cycles, where coins like Shiba Inu and Pepe caught fire‚Äîbut this time with a more structured financial use case. It‚Äôs also outpacing other new entrants like Mutuum Finance and Solaxy, which, while promising in their own right, haven‚Äôt matched the presale traction or community engagement that MAGACOIN FINANCE has managed to ignite. The difference? MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a coin that understands how to turn hype into movement‚Äîand possibly movement into serious returns. Not a Replacement‚ÄîBut a Strategic Addition Investors aren‚Äôt abandoning Ethereum or XRP. But they are recalibrating. There‚Äôs growing recognition that the next wave of wealth in crypto won‚Äôt just come from blue-chip assets. It‚Äôll come from spotting the winners before the rest of the market does. That‚Äôs where MAGACOIN FINANCE has found its lane‚Äîan early-stage coin with just enough heat to suggest it‚Äôs not a fluke, and just enough risk to keep the upside compelling. Of course, this isn‚Äôt without risk. Every presale project walks a tightrope between promise and execution. But for investors who understand that calculated bets are how generational gains are made in crypto, MAGACOIN FINANCE checks a lot of boxes. It‚Äôs early. It‚Äôs cheap. It‚Äôs growing. And it hasn‚Äôt hit an exchange yet. As the market heads into the second half of 2025, the split is becoming clearer: the coins that already made their run, and the ones that still have room to surprise. MAGACOIN FINANCE may not be a household name yet‚Äîbut neither was Dogecoin, until it was.

On X, his announcement was accompanied by a photo displaying an XRP logo tattoo on his arm, marking his belief in the project‚Äôs future for life. The tattoo quickly went viral after crypto influencer Digital Asset Investor shared it on his X feed. He noted that getting a tattoo, especially for someone over 50 with a Harvard M.B.A., wasn‚Äôt just a casual show of support. It signalled a deep, long-term belief. Garlinghouse replied with just two words: ‚Äú1,000%.‚Äù Ripple ends legal war with SEC The long battle between Ripple and the SEC is winding down. While the company had initially resisted the court‚Äôs conclusion that sales of institutional XRP were securities, it has since withdrawn its cross-appeal. This is a tactical retreat, and it‚Äôs evidence that Ripple is ready to proceed. Earlier this month, Judge Analisa Torres denied a coordinated plea from Ripple and the SEC for an indicative ruling. With the case stalled, Ripple decided not to push the litigation on the final prong regarding institutional sales. Instead, the firm will respect the court order and look for lawful opportunities to distribute XRP to institutions. Brad Garlinghouse announced the company‚Äôs new posture in a public statement that they had closed that chapter once and for all, and they can now focus on the most important place ‚Äì building the Internet of Value. Ripple has used the term ‚ÄúInternet of Value‚Äù for a while now to describe its larger goal‚Äîfrictionless cross-border asset transfer in worldwide payment systems. Now, with the shackles of litigation off its wrists, Ripple is increasingly zeroing in on realizing its vision. Ripple drives XRP ecosystem growth with renewed focus Ripple‚Äôs pivot towards development & expansion is already paying off. In June, the XRP Ledger witnessed a more than 7x spike in daily active addresses, indicating higher network usage. At the same time, transaction volume is increasing, indicating more use of XRP in real-world use and trading. Market sentiment has also shifted. The buzz around a US-approved XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) is building after Canada greenlit three XRP ETFs just days ago. Analysts think there‚Äôs a 95% chance XRP ETF will be here soon. This would make XRP available to institutional buyers and retirement accounts, driving liquidity and confidence in the market. Ripple has released version 2.5.0 of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This release includes substantial power enhancements and sets XRPL apart from its nearest competition with Ethereum and Solana. The improvements include faster and less expensive throughput and compatibility with smart contracts, fundamentals for developers who intend to build DApps on XRP. The update also improves the XRPL‚Äôs chain interoperability, a requirement in the future of finance. However, in the growing layer-1 blockchain space, the upgrade signals that Ripple wants to be a force once again, not just for a payments protocol but as a dApp development and execution platform, too.

S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures both rose by 0.1%, while Dow futures climbed 130 points, or 0.3%, according to data from CNBC. The market is now grinding toward the end of a strong month, even with global trade threats still lingering under Donald Trump‚Äôs second term. Traders are reacting fast to every development, but so far, the worst of Trump‚Äôs tariff moves haven‚Äôt hit, and that‚Äôs kept money flowing into stocks. The gains come after weeks of volatile headlines out of Washington and Beijing, with investors watching every trade comment. For now, the fear that tariff threats might become full-blown policies hasn‚Äôt played out. That relief helped the S&P 500 rally 4.4% in June. The Nasdaq, stacked with tech names, is up almost 6.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added around 3.7%. This rally has been fast and loud. Just two months ago in April, the S&P 500 was nearly 18% underwater for the year. Now it‚Äôs closing out the month with a fresh four-month high, finishing Friday‚Äôs session 0.5% higher at 6,173.07, overtaking the previous record of 6,147.43. Indexes break records while earnings chatter grows louder The Nasdaq Composite ended Friday at an all-time high too, rising 0.5% by the close. The Dow finished the week nearly 1% higher. The move wasn‚Äôt just driven by lower fear around trade. Company earnings are starting to guide the conversation again. John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet, said more S&P 500 companies are giving optimistic guidance than usual. Of the 110 companies that have issued EPS guidance so far for the second quarter, 51 issued upbeat projections. That‚Äôs better than the five-year average of 42 and the 10-year average of 39. Still, it‚Äôs not all sunshine. 59 companies gave negative EPS guidance. Even though some companies are hopeful, the actual growth rate for Q2 is expected to be slower. John said the estimated year-over-year earnings growth is around 5%, which would be the weakest since the final quarter of 2023. That contrast between good vibes and slowing numbers is exactly what‚Äôs keeping traders from going all-in. Everyone‚Äôs bullish, but no one wants to be caught holding the bag. Europe runs ahead of Wall Street while Asia follows cautiously Across the Atlantic, European markets outperformed their US peers in the first half of 2025. The Stoxx 600, covering broad European stocks, is up 7% year-to-date. Germany‚Äôs DAX has soared 20%, Italy‚Äôs FTSE MIB is up 16%, and Spain‚Äôs IBEX 35 has also climbed 20%. Even the UK‚Äôs FTSE 100, usually more sluggish, is up 7.7%. But the rally is making analysts nervous. Some are unsure if Europe can keep up the momentum, especially with the eurozone‚Äôs own political mess brewing. Asian markets opened higher Monday as investors worked through industrial production numbers from Japan and South Korea, plus manufacturing activity from China. Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 was up 1.13% in early trading. The Topix index also rose 0.77%. Over in Seoul, the Kospi added 0.63%, while the smaller-cap Kosdaq went flat. Australia‚Äôs ASX 200 opened 0.3% higher. In Hong Kong, futures for the Hang Seng Index pointed to a weak open, standing at 24,182. That‚Äôs below Friday‚Äôs close of 24,284.15. Away from stocks, gold stayed soft. It dropped after two straight weeks of losses, with risk appetite taking over. Investors are waiting for Trump‚Äôs administration to finalize multiple trade deals before the July 9 deadline. That risk-on mood is cutting into demand for safe-haven assets. Early Monday, bullion dropped as much as 0.8%, before recovering some of those losses. As of 8:24 a.m. local time, spot gold was down 0.2% to $3,269.16 per ounce. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was off 0.1%. Silver and palladium also fell, while platinum rose. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

But while DOGE builds slowly on familiar sentiment, a lesser-known coin is quietly outpacing expectations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.03 in the fifth phase of its presale, now over 40% sold out. Phase 5 buyers are set for a guaranteed profit of 100% ROI at launch. The project has already raised over $11.2 million, gaining serious momentum even as broader market sentiment leans cautious. For those wondering what crypto to invest in ahead of the next breakout cycle, the narrative is shifting, and Mutuum Finance may be writing its first chapter right now. Dogecoin Eyes $0.17 Milestone Amid Meme-Coin Rebound Dogecoin (DOGE) has recovered back to approximately find itself hovering at around 0.166 and is further supported by a 6-7 percent surge in price over the last 24 hours as it broke out of an important decline you star. This rebound marks the emerging interest in retail, and better technical energy, and on-chain metrics and whale amassing suggest further short-term momentum. Nevertheless, DOGE is held back by resistance on overheads at about $0.17-$0.18, an indication it is slowly rising but does not have a giant breakout. With the meme-coin market picking up the buzz once again, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging quietly as an alternative DeFi project. Mutuum Finance Hits $11.2 Million Funded Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on the move in popularity terms.

47064261,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=169938,1751247024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/47064261.jpeg,"XRP, Ethereum, and Solana Might Miss Next Crypto Wave ‚Äî Analysts Favor This Perfectly Timed Altcoin",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-ethereum-and-solana-might-miss-next-crypto-wave-analysts-favor-this-perfectly-timed-altcoin/,"XRP, Ethereum, and Solana have long been seen as the engines of the altcoin market. Their names are synonymous with resilience, utility, and institutional adoption. But with crypto markets entering a new rotation phase, some analysts now believe these established leaders may not lead the next wave of explosive growth. Instead, attention is shifting to earlier-stage altcoins‚Äîparticularly MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äîwhich some say could mirror the breakout patterns that propelled Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin in past cycles. This isn‚Äôt a dismissal of the major players. Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance, NFTs, and enterprise-level applications. Solana has achieved rare mainstream visibility, backed by powerful investor narratives and growing retail enthusiasm. XRP, after years of regulatory uncertainty, is regaining momentum on the back of possible ETF listings and settlement innovations. These coins aren‚Äôt going anywhere. But what they offer in stability, they may now lack in raw upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE Taps Into the Early-Mover Advantage A growing number of analysts argue the next generation of wealth-building in crypto will come from projects still in their early stages‚Äîthose with untapped narratives, viral community backing, and enough momentum to ride a full bull cycle from the ground up. That‚Äôs where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in. Unlike the blue-chip names that have already logged massive gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE is just getting started. Its presale phase has attracted a surge of attention, fueled by a low entry price and an emerging base of early supporters who view it as a high-risk, high-reward contender. What‚Äôs drawing comparisons to the early days of Dogecoin and Solana isn‚Äôt just the marketing. It‚Äôs the timing. MAGACOIN FINANCE is landing at a moment when retail and institutional traders alike are hungry for fresh narratives‚Äîtokens with room to move and communities eager to rally. The core of MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs appeal is its blend of meme coin virality and financial utility. It‚Äôs not just a token riding hype. It‚Äôs being built on a DeFi lending framework that positions it to participate in deeper, long-term conversations around value and use. This dual identity‚Äîas both a speculative play and a product with planned functionality‚Äîis what some analysts believe gives it a shot at outperforming more mature coins that may now struggle to recreate their historic gains. Market Rotation Is Fueling the Shift Toward Early-Stage Altcoins The trend behind this shift is called capital rotation. As coins like Ethereum and Solana consolidate after massive runs, liquidity begins to flow into smaller-cap projects with room for exponential growth. That rotation is already underway, and analysts say the conditions are now ideal for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to step into the spotlight. It has a story. It has a base. And critically, it hasn‚Äôt yet priced in the kind of parabolic move that defined the last cycle‚Äôs breakout winners. None of this makes MAGACOIN FINANCE a sure thing. It‚Äôs still early, untested, and entirely dependent on sustained traction. But that‚Äôs also why the upside is being taken seriously. The same could be said of Dogecoin when it was trading under a cent, or Solana when it was just another smart contract chain fighting for market share. Early-stage altcoins are where conviction meets risk‚Äîand sometimes, that mix delivers outsized rewards. XRP, Ethereum, and Solana will still move with the market. They will benefit from ETF momentum, institutional adoption, and long-term ecosystem growth. But according to a growing chorus of analysts, the next real breakout may come from outside the old guard. In 2021, that role belonged to Solana. In 2025, it might belong to MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Among them, TRON, Pi Network, and Sei Network are not just surviving but thriving, driven by unique market conditions and investor sentiment. This detailed exploration provides insights into why these digital assets are currently in the spotlight. Enhanced with insights from Outset PR , this analysis navigates the complexities of the crypto market, providing a clear view of how strategic public relations can elevate a project's visibility and traction. TRON (TRX): A Model of Resilience and Potential TRON's consistency in the market is noteworthy. Amidst the usual crypto volatility, TRX has maintained a stable trading range, positing itself as a robust component of any crypto portfolio. The current trading range of TRON is between $0.26 and $0.29, with an immediate resistance at $0.31. Should TRX breach this threshold, it could target the $0.33 mark, translating to a near 15% gain. Such movements underscore its potential for steady gains. Technical View: The alignment of its simple moving averages and moderate RSI and Stochastic readings suggest a balanced technical posture without strong bearish or bullish biases. Thus, TRX presents a stable asset for cautious investors looking for gradual growth. Source: TradingView Pi Network (PI): A Dark Horse Poised for Recovery Pi Network's recent trading activities show significant volatility with a downward trend last month. However, current indicators and market sentiment suggest a potential recovery. Should Pi Network overcome the immediate resistance near eighty cents, it could climb to a more robust price point, offering investors substantial returns. Data Source: CoinMarketCap Sei Network (SEI): Indicators of Upcoming Gains Sei Network, though experiencing a recent dip, shows signs of an impending surge. The altcoin's technical indicators demonstrate a preparation for a bullish reversal, potentially increasing its value by 30% if it surpasses the $0.23 mark. Market Position: With a support level believed to be around 15 cents and recent upticks in weekly gains, Sei Network could be gearing up for a notable ascent in its valuation.

XRP Investors Believe So,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoin-finance-be-the-most-talked-about-crypto-by-late-2025-xrp-investors-believe-so/,"The second half of 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal time in the digital asset market. As established names like XRP continue to push through key resistance zones, investors are simultaneously identifying a new name making quiet but significant waves: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts tracking macro sentiment shifts say it‚Äôs not just another speculative project. It‚Äôs increasingly being viewed as a high-upside play‚Äîparticularly by experienced holders of long-standing tokens like XRP. XRP Momentum and Market Shifts XRP has stuck to the headlines throughout much of 2025 despite the constant volatility. It recently bounced back from critical technical levels, supported by institutional inflows and movements from large wallets. On-chain metrics reveal whales moving hundreds of millions without selling‚Äîa rarity that usually indicates conviction. However, with XRP‚Äôs renewed momentum, some long-time investors are reshuffling their bags. The reason? They want to secure a potential large gain before it becomes popular. Enter MAGACOIN FINANCE. A New Crypto Contender Catching Fire MAGACOIN FINANCE is being talked about more frequently in private forums, research desk briefings, and early-stage investor groups. It‚Äôs drawing attention not just for its mechanics, but for its timing‚Äîemerging at a point when capital rotation into fresh narratives is accelerating. Among the many altcoins vying for attention, one presale stands out: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Backed by a scarcity-driven model and a fixed token structure, it‚Äôs already attracting capital from sophisticated investors rotating out of larger-cap assets. Analysts have ranked it as one of the top presale cryptocurrencies for 2025 ‚Äî and early buyers are already sitting on substantial returns. With a verified audit, no VC control, and rising demand, momentum is building fast. Analyst Projections Fuel the Conversation Research desks have begun flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as a standout in long-term strategy reports. Unlike speculative plays based on hype, this project is gaining traction on fundamentals‚Äîscarcity design, market fit, and investor behavior patterns. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a project that insiders can‚Äôt stop talking about. The meme coin leader, say evermore crypto analysts. And not because it is hype-driven. However, design and branding, as well as early adoption behaviour, draw attention. As more people become aware of a product, it is not surprising to see a surge in sales. Buyers are making high-conviction moves, which are gaining momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE has shown the first signs of breakout-level traction, and analysts believe it may become one of the top-three cryptocurrencies on all major exchanges by H2 2025. Why XRP Investors Are Paying Close Attention XRP investors are known for their resilience, research orientation, and appetite for asymmetric bets. As a group, they‚Äôve historically been among the earliest adopters of emerging trends, from regulatory arbitrage to utility-based ecosystems. What‚Äôs driving it? It‚Äôs not just meme energy. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly turning into a narrative coin of the cycle‚Äîone that merges pop culture, politics, and early-stage investor hype in a way that‚Äôs creating massive network effects. Unlike most low-cap tokens that vanish after launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE is hitting all the right psychological and strategic triggers. It‚Äôs got a capped supply, rapid retail demand, and a wave of community-led content fueling viral growth. Final Thoughts: Momentum Meets Timing The digital asset space is still rewarding entry and narratives going into 2025. XRP appears strong and is beyond the ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù stage while the buzz around MAGACOIN FINANCE is hard to miss. It‚Äôs not about who has what; it‚Äôs about when momentum and timing collide with structural scarcity. Many members believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the name that rocks the crypto circle as the year closes out.

Older Layer 1 networks keep evolving, while utility-focused platforms are now gaining strong attention. Alongside, regulatory changes and global company interest are shaping the way success is measured in crypto. Projects showing traction before launch, worldwide partnerships, and strong scaling ability are taking leading positions. BlockDAG is one such project, seeing fast growth in its presale and user base. Solana and XRP are seeing stronger market confidence, while Avalanche is focusing on expanding its GameFi network. Here is a detailed look at four ecosystems defining success this year. BlockDAG: $324M Raised, 2 Million Users, Strong Pre-Launch Ecosystem BlockDAG has reached one of the largest presales, raising over $324 million with 23.3 billion coins sold. Its unique system combines DAG and Proof-of-Work to handle 2,000‚Äì15,000 transactions each second. The EVM support makes developer onboarding simple. Its X1 Miner App already has over 2 million users, and more than 18,000 ASIC miners have been bought. A 100 million coin airdrop has started, covering testnet, presale, social, and referrals to build its ecosystem firmly. Its US-based sponsorship and 20 revealed exchange listings add strong backing. Currently in Batch 29, BlockDAG (BDAG) Network‚Äôs price is $0.0080, with early buyers seeing a 2,660% growth in their funds since Batch 1. The roadmap shows a six-week final rollout before its Q4 2025 listing, giving an important window for early participants. Solana: ETF Filing and Global Deals Lift Price Solana rose from $127 to $146 this week as geopolitical risks eased and institutional interest returned. The fresh filing of a spot SOL ETF by Galaxy and Invesco indicates deeper Wall Street involvement. On the development side, Solana has launched tools to prevent sandwich attacks and is working with Kazakhstan for tokenization systems. Major firms are also exploring Solana. Payment leader Fiserv plans stablecoin use on Solana‚Äôs network. Despite market swings, Solana‚Äôs DeFi locked value and daily user count keep growing, cementing its place as one of the most supported networks. Ripple (XRP): Whale Buying, Rules Progress, and Ledger Boosts XRP climbed from $1.90 to $2.20 this week due to heavy whale buying and important upgrades. Its new XRP Ledger 2.5.0 brings batch payments, escrow functions, and DEX controls, making it better for large users. Ripple has also secured over 50 US money transmitter licenses, supporting its stablecoin RLUSD launch. At Apex 2025, Ripple shared expansion plans, pushing market optimism. Analysts now target $2.40 as the next price level, with whale activity and clear rules supporting XRP‚Äôs growth path. Avalanche (AVAX): Gaming Subnets Drive Activity Avalanche price remains around $17.70, but its ecosystem is seeing big moves. GameFi subnets are becoming popular, with Beam and GUNZ recording high transactions. Web3 games like Off The Grid and MapleStory N are seeing millions of NFT mints and user gains. Daily transactions have crossed one million after recent upgrades. Developer attraction remains high due to grants and hackathons. Though its price has yet to rise with on-chain growth, many believe AVAX will jump once broader conditions improve, as it maintains strong developer support and scalable design. Final Thoughts! What makes the best cryptos right now ? It‚Äôs about strong networks, user numbers, developer work, and real-world use. BlockDAG is fast becoming a major name with a record presale and solid systems. Solana‚Äôs ETF filing and business links keep it in focus. Ripple‚Äôs legal clarity and whale demand make it stronger for the future. Avalanche‚Äôs GameFi success shows niche power. Whether it is early players like BlockDAG or major coins like Solana and XRP, traction before excitement remains the key.

The move , approved by shareholders on June 29, signals a significant departure of the company from previous financial policies , pushing it to the vanguard of corporate adoption of Bitcoin in Spain. A new solution for Bitcoin adherents, the firm has so far purchased 54 BTC, worth around ‚Ç¨5.8 million at current prices, and is also eyeing wider expansions. In a recent filing with BME Growth ‚Äî Spain‚Äôs growth division for small- and medium-sized enterprises ‚Äî Vanadi hinted that they wished to become the largest business holder of Bitcoin in Spain. Vanadi‚Äôs stock price went parabolic following the company‚Äôs Bitcoin play, increasing more than threefold in June. The increase marks an apparent increase in investor appetite for companies leveraging digital assets as a treasury strategy . Vanadi had said in its translated announcement: ‚ÄúSimilar to companies such as Strategy or Metaplanet, Vanadi Coffee redefines its business model and will use Bitcoin as its main reserve asset and accumulate large amounts of Bitcoin as part of its treasury.‚Äù The company is looking to replicate the high-wager Bitcoin treasury models of Strategy, which holds over 200,000 BTC, and Metaplanet. The Japanese firm has recently tweaked its balance sheet policy to the pro-Bitcoin side. Vanadi struggles to recover with a Bitcoin bet Vanadi‚Äôs had been struggling financially and operationally; its 2024 financial statement lists that it was operating at a loss of ‚Ç¨3.3m, an increase of 15.8% from the previous period. Competition and operating costs have eaten away at profitability bit by bit as the cost of coffee has risen ever higher, dragging the firm further into financial strain. Meanwhile, Vanadi was looking for more money to build long-term. It received two large investment offers in May. One was from a tiny local software consultancy, a one-man outfit in Alicante, and he offered 50 million euros. The other was Alpha Blue Ocean, an international firm that announced it would back 15 companies in 15 countries with over ‚Ç¨1.5 billion in investment. Critics raise concerns over Vanadi‚Äôs ambitious Bitcoin move Vanadi‚Äôs daring foray into Bitcoin is not risk-free. The company has a handful of stores serving espresso and pastries, and it is now dipping a toe in the complex world of crypto treasury management. But analysts and sceptics have raised red flags. They also note that Vanadi‚Äôs small size, slim operating margins and inexperience in crypto could be left open to volatility and then to scrutiny by regulators. Unlike Strategy, whose tech-focused leadership team has many years of experience navigating capital markets, Vanadi‚Äôs management has a steep learning curve ahead. And the regulatory climate for digital assets in Spain is also conservative. It‚Äôs not part of an activist group, but it is dynamic, and screwing any of this up in compliance or implementation would be expensive. Vanadi is not alone, though. Companies worldwide are adding Bitcoin to their treasury, which is becoming a trend. US-based crypto firm Bakkt recently revealed its intentions to purchase as much as $1 billion of Bitcoin. Tesla and Coinbase are among the companies that have pursued comparable treasury strategies. What sets Vanadi apart, however, is the scale of its ambition relative to its core business. A ‚Ç¨1 billion Bitcoin bet on a caf√© chain with six locations and persistent losses is an aggressive bet by any measure. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This is one of the biggest shake-ups of investment advice for a decade. Millions of British savers will be granted access to ‚Äútargeted support‚Äù under wide-ranging new rules to aid people‚Äôs quest for better returns on their money. Barclays‚Äô analysis shows that around 13 million adults in the UK are keeping about ¬£430 billion in cash, based on the savers who currently have more than six months‚Äô income in savings, which could be invested. Meanwhile, companies such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Vanguard have already started offering these services. FCA unveils new changes to the UK‚Äôs financial advice market The FCA described ‚Äúa once-in-a-generation change‚Äù to the UK‚Äôs financial advice market. This change will allow companies to suggest to a group of people sitting on so much cash to consider investing some in shares to earn better returns over time. The move comes more than a decade after the FCA‚Äôs Retail Distribution Review, which was intended to increase the quality of financial advice but has also made it more expensive for the population. This left many people unable to afford such services, resulting in an ‚Äúadvice gap‚Äù. The FCA said the new regime is a remedy created to help more than half of British savers , who said in a recent survey that they needed further assistance investing their money. Based on the regulator‚Äôs argument, 7million British adults have more than ¬£10,000 in cash savings and no investments. Hence, people between 13.5 million and 30.6million might gain from this focused assistance. The regulator also said it would consult on developing rules for this new activity of targeted support by December, enabling companies to make generic offers to groups of consumers with similar characteristics. This would no longer be caught by the burdensome requirements to give customers a ‚Äúpersonal recommendation,‚Äù such as undertaking a fully detailed suitability assessment. Apart from these new changes, the FCA also plans to introduce a second, more focused, category called ‚Äúsimplified advice.‚Äù In this category, firms will be able to make a suggestion on a financial product to a customer, subject to a short document detailing their ‚Äúessential relevant facts‚Äù ‚Äì without having to conduct the full suitability assessment. Several prominent figures acknowledged the importance of the FCA‚Äôs proposal Several prominent figures have commented on FCA‚Äôs proposals. Dan Olley, chief executive of Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK‚Äôs largest ‚ÄúDIY‚Äù investment site, said the proposals will be genuinely transformational in cementing a healthy retail investment culture in the UK. According to Olley, it was obvious that there are important moments in life when several people find themselves in the advice gap. He further elaborated that in this situation, one cannot afford financial advice but needs more help than the rules permit. James Daley, a leader of the consumer group Fairer Finance, said the changes were moving in the right direction. However, he insists that these proposals must be put in place with strong consumer protections ‚Äì and that customers should have confidence that these options will not lead to their exploitation. Jon Cleborne, the leader of Vanguard in Europe, also commented on the topic of discussion. Cleborne highlighted that FCA‚Äôs proposals are important for helping more people enjoy the benefits of long-term investing and reach their financial goals. Lastly, Verona Kenny, the chief distribution officer at Aberdeen Adviser, reported that over 40% of individuals acknowledged that they have done little to prepare financially for retirement. Based on her argument, the new changes appear to be the best opportunity in a generation to address this issue. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Despite its early presence and significant impact during previous market cycles, XRP has not mirrored the broader growth seen across the crypto sector over the past decade. Analysts suggest that even a partial recovery of its past market dominance could trigger a significant price increase. XRP‚Äôs Lagging Growth Compared to the Market Over the last ten years, the global cryptocurrency market has surged from $4.28 billion to over $3.28 trillion, a staggering 76,528% increase. Bitcoin and several altcoins have grown in parallel with this expansion, recording gains that align with or exceed the market‚Äôs pace. XRP, however, has not followed this trend. A key factor limiting XRP‚Äôs growth has been ongoing regulatory challenges, most notably its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These issues led to temporary delistings from major exchanges, restricting access for U.S.-based investors and stalling momentum during critical growth periods. Historical Market Dominance: XRP vs. Bitcoin In May 2017, XRP reached its peak market dominance of 31.33%, supported by a market capitalization of $15.28 billion when the total crypto market was $48.78 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap stood at $29 billion, giving it a 59.45% share of the total market. Since then, Bitcoin has grown in line with the market. Its capitalization has risen to $2.132 trillion, a 7,251% increase from 2017. XRP, on the other hand, has climbed only 743% during the same period, reaching a market cap of $128.8 billion. Consequently, XRP‚Äôs market dominance has dropped from 31.33% to just 3.96%, while Bitcoin‚Äôs has increased to 65.75%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Price Projections Based on Reclaiming Market Share Given the current crypto market cap of $3.28 trillion, analysts have explored hypothetical scenarios in which XRP regains a portion of its former dominance. If XRP were to recover just half of its 2017 market dominance, 15.665%, its market capitalization would rise to approximately $513.8 billion. With the circulating supply of XRP estimated at 59 billion tokens, this would result in a price of roughly $8.70 per coin. Notably, this aligns with predictions made by industry figures such as George Tung, who has suggested that XRP could realistically reach $8 to $10 under favourable conditions by the end of the year. While some commentators see $8 as a significant target, others argue that it still undervalues XRP‚Äôs full potential, especially given its historical market standing. What If XRP Fully Recovers Its Past Dominance? In a more aggressive scenario, where XRP returns to its full 31.33% dominance, its market capitalization would exceed $1.027 trillion at the current overall market valuation. Based on the existing supply, this would drive the price of one XRP token to approximately $17.40 . Although achieving such a market share would require a significant shift in investor sentiment and regulatory clarity, the figures suggest that substantial upside remains possible, even if XRP only partially regains its historical position. XRP‚Äôs current valuation appears modest when measured against its historical performance and the broader market‚Äôs growth. A return to just half of its peak market dominance would more than quadruple its current price, while a full recovery could propel XRP to levels not previously reached. These scenarios, although hypothetical, provide a framework for evaluating XRP‚Äôs long-term potential in a maturing cryptocurrency market.

With Bitcoin consolidating and major altcoins facing mixed momentum, presales with strong fundamentals are taking center stage. Among the most talked-about candidates are MAGACOIN FINANCE, Qubetics, and Mutuum‚Äîthree projects gaining traction for their unique structures and explosive early momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Momentum Meets Market Narrative MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly emerged as one of the most dominant forces in the 2025 crypto cycle. Its presale has already raised significant amounts, with each stage selling out rapidly and early buyers seeing significant paper gains. The project operates with a fixed supply model and has passed a full audit by HashEx, signaling credibility in a market often lacking transparency. Backed by asymmetric upside potential and a politically infused narrative, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been labeled by analysts as a defining early-entry opportunity of the year. Its structure resists inflation, and with no venture capital unlocks in sight, institutional and retail investors alike are watching closely. Analysts have noted its consistent traction in presale rankings and speculative forecasts continue to rise. Qubetics (TICS): Aiming to Bridge Web3 Fragmentation With over $18M raised during the presale which has sold hundreds of millions of tokens, Qubetics is entering the final phase of the presale. Qubetics is a cross-chain Web3 aggregator that aims to fix blockchain fragmentation, one of the ecosystem‚Äôs biggest issues. It‚Äôs distinctive value proposition evolves from its QubeQode IDE, an integrated development environment aimed at using decentralized applications across chains. Qubetics reduced the supply of the total tokens by more than 60%. This will make the tokens more scarce. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): DeFi Utility With Scaling Ambitions Mutuum Finance has garnered attention as one of the few presale projects that deliver on both innovation and investor confidence. The platform combines decentralized lending, a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, and a Layer 2 scaling model ‚Äî all within a transparent, CertiK-audited ecosystem. Investor incentives and smart tokenomics have propelled the project to raise significant capital in a short time. Analysts are watching closely as each presale phase narrows the gap between entry and launch valuation. With forecasts projecting multi-fold returns, Mutuum Finance is becoming a serious contender for investors targeting the DeFi resurgence in 2025. Final Thoughts: Presale Season Heating Up As Q4 2025 draws closer, a presale-driven momentum is becoming theme in crypto investing. MAGACOIN FINANCE, Qubetics, and Mutuum offer a scarcity-based political narrative, infrastructure-grade tooling, and innovative DeFi design, respectively.

The idea, first introduced in 2022 by game developer and XRP proponent Chad Steingraber, is gaining renewed attention as market conditions evolve and institutional interest in blockchain utility increases. Although XRP is currently trading around $2 , Steingraber maintains that a combination of institutional adoption, strategic asset utility, and supply restrictions could drive the asset‚Äôs value to unprecedented levels. It consists of three components: 1 ‚Äì Assets built on the XRP Ledger (Stablecoins are the ‚Äúutility‚Äù) 2 ‚Äì XRP becomes a reserve asset to power the utility 3 ‚Äì XRP is removed from public supply by institutions This is how IT WILL. https://t.co/d7ysY5euXc ‚Äî Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) June 28, 2025 Foundation of the $20,000 Projection Chad Steingraber‚Äôs $20,000 price prediction is based on three main assumptions. He outlines a path where XRP transforms from a speculative asset into a core infrastructure component for global finance. According to him, this transformation hinges on three primary developments: Tokenized Asset Issuance on the XRP Ledger: Steingraber believes the adoption of the XRP Ledger by governments and institutions for issuing stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will generate new demand for XRP. As the native token of the ledger, XRP would facilitate settlements involving these tokenized assets, thus increasing its utility. Use as a Reserve Asset: In this scenario, XRP would no longer function primarily as a tradable token. Instead, it would be held by financial institutions as a reserve asset , akin to how central banks hold gold. These reserves would support internal liquidity, enable seamless value transfer, and serve as backing for institution-specific digital assets. Absorption of Public Supply by Institutions: Steingraber suggests that over time, financial institutions will accumulate large amounts of XRP and remove them from public markets by locking them into private ledgers. This would reduce the circulating supply available for retail investors and could cause a significant price increase due to heightened scarcity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Role of Public Markets and the Transition to Private Use Steingraber views the current retail-driven XRP market as temporary. He argues that major institutions are unlikely to rely on public trading platforms due to transparency and regulatory concerns. Instead, enterprise participants would shift to private networks and rely on specialized liquidity providers to settle large-scale transactions securely. This shift implies that public trading of XRP is a transitional phase, with a more utility-focused institutional use case on the horizon. Anticipated Supply Shock and Institutional Demand Surge Another critical element in Steingraber‚Äôs forecast is a potential supply crisis triggered by rapid institutional acquisition. He claims that only around 20 billion XRP tokens remain in circulation after accounting for lost, burned, or locked coins. He warns that once institutions begin acquiring XRP aggressively, the available supply could fall to under 100 million tokens. Such a sharp reduction in supply, if met with sudden institutional demand, could lead to rapid price acceleration. However, he asserts that this demand would be driven by utility and operational necessity, not speculation. Global Competition for XRP Steingraber broadens the outlook by suggesting that competition for XRP will not be limited to U.S.-based institutions. He anticipates demand from international banks, sovereign wealth funds, and private entities seeking to integrate XRP into their digital infrastructure. He envisions XRP becoming an essential component of the global financial system. While the theory presents a compelling vision for XRP‚Äôs future utility, it remains highly controversial. It does not fully address the competitive landscape, where other digital assets also offer institutional-grade utility. Furthermore, the proposed valuation depends on widespread adoption that has yet to materialize at scale. Nevertheless, the discussion continues to attract interest, especially among XRP supporters who see long-term potential in its unique ledger technology and use cases.

With all 15 presale stages already completed and the Bonus Round ongoing, the project is drawing the attention of investors due to its AI-driven architecture and price increase. Lightchain AI presents a virtual machine to carry out AI tasks and a model that rewards users according to their computational value‚Äìfeatures that builders and investors prefer. As the July 2025 mainnet launch approaches, Lightchain AI is showing that traders are noticing the project due to its real-world usage and hype. Ethereum Focuses on Core Development and Long-Term Upgrades Ethereum has been focusing on platform development and long-term upgrades that are expected to make the network scalable, efficient, and user-friendly. The newly launched Pectra upgrade, which was launched on May 7, 2025, fixed several issues and added new features like the staking limit increase and wallet usage. In addition, Ethereum Next‚Äôs roadmap will focus on the Fulu-Osaka upgrade, which is expected to launch by the end of 2025 or early 2026, developing Verkle trees to reduce storage requirements and increase network efficiency. With developments like the single-shot finality which is expected to reduce transaction confirmation times, Ethereum‚Äôs place in the blockchain world is secured. Lightchain AI Captures Immediate Interest From Active Traders Lightchain AI has been gaining attention from investors due to its structure, which focuses on real-world usage, and its presale. With Stage 15 already completed, the Bonus Round offers fixed token pricing and increased value, especially after the removal of the 5% Team Allocation. Those tokens will now be used to support the development of the protocol, developer grants, and builder rewards‚Äìshowing a move that puts the platform first. Lightchain AI‚Äôs tokenomics is expected to build investor confidence, with 40% of the supply allocated to presale, 28.5% to staking rewards, 15% to liquidity, 6.5 to treasury, and 5% to marketing and partnerships. The platform‚Äôs improved gas system allows users to pay for transactions based on how complex the AI tasks they are carrying out are, ensuring usage without issues. For traders looking for functionality over speculation, Lightchain AI offers a better structure. Traders Act Fast‚ÄîAnd All Eyes Are on Lightchain AI Traders in the crypto market always go for any investment opportunity they discover, and right now, they are moving towards Lightchain AI. With its Bonus Round price fixed at $0.007 and with over $20.9 million raised, the project is attracting attention. What makes it special? Decentralized validator nodes, AI-powered infrastructure, and a developer Grant pool that is pushing development on the platform. With the mainnet launch and public code release expected to happen in the coming weeks, Lightchain AI is shaping up to be the next move for traders looking for opportunities in the crypto industry.

Yet, even amid this institutional breakthrough, one emerging project is generating powerful early momentum among traders: MAGACOIN FINANCE. While XRP‚Äôs ETF milestone represents a step forward for mainstream adoption, many are pivoting toward early-phase assets that offer greater upside. XRP ETF News Marks Institutional Milestone Ripple has come a long way to gain credibility among institutions. Purpose Investments has launched the world‚Äôs first spot XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker XRPP, providing investors with direct exposure to XRP in CAD as well as USD. Canada is already recognized as a world leader in regulated access to cryptos for institutions. This development cements Canada‚Äôs position as a leader in this field and sets an important precedent for others. Bloomberg analysts now assign a 95% probability to a US recession. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot XRP ETF when there is enough regulatory clarity and Ripple‚Äôs legal case is settled. According to the odds on Polymarket, the majority of predictions indicate that it could be approved by the end of the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE Captures Attention With Strategic Timing While XRP‚Äôs institutional story dominates headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly becoming a breakout force in the early-stage investment space. Its presale phases have seen instant sellouts, and analyst coverage is intensifying around what many now see as one of the most structurally aligned new tokens of the year. The project‚Äôs appeal lies in its architectural scarcity, security verifications, and early-mover advantage. These features have made it a target for capital rotation among investors looking beyond legacy plays. With the broader market seeking asymmetric returns ahead of the next major bull cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized not for its comparisons ‚Äî but for its independent setup and compelling risk-reward ratio. Market Dynamics Favor Early Entries Institutional attention is building around regulatory milestones, but seasoned investors understand that much of the explosive growth in crypto emerges from earlier phases ‚Äî before large capital fully enters the space. While XRP is set to benefit from ETF listings and long-term adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as an opportunity for meaningful portfolio transformation during the pre-mainstream window. Pro traders and early adopters are already reallocating capital into strategic assets with credible foundations and timing advantages ‚Äî and MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to top that list. Final Thoughts Ripple‚Äôs ETF progress is a defining moment for the asset class, offering XRP a new gateway into institutional portfolios. Yet, even as major tokens gain regulatory validation, a new frontier is forming ‚Äî one where projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are setting the tone for early-stage, high-conviction investment strategies.

The Bank of Korea reportedly informed participating banks that it will temporarily halt discussions related to the second stage of its central bank digital currency pilot, which was originally slated to begin later this year. A BOK official confirmed the decision to Bloomberg , citing the need for reassessment amid shifting priorities. New President‚Äôs Stablecoin Push Prompts Central Bank Caution The delay comes as newly elected President Lee Jae-myung places growing emphasis on stablecoins. Just weeks into office, Lee has proposed expanding the field of issuers by allowing companies with as little as 500m won, or about $370,000, in equity to issue won-based stablecoins.

Crypto Holdings Now Key Part of Personal Wealth for Millions in South Korea Meanwhile, South Korea remains one of the world‚Äôs most active crypto markets. Over a third of the population, roughly 18m people, are involved in digital asset trading. On particularly busy days, local crypto exchange volumes have surpassed those of traditional equity markets such as the Kospi and Kosdaq. A recent industry survey found that more than half of South Koreans aged 20 to 59 have experience trading crypto . Moreover, one in four currently hold digital coins. For those invested, crypto now makes up at least 14% of their total financial portfolios. In addition, many maintain wallets across several domestic exchanges. Enthusiasm around digital assets has also spilled into the stock market. Shares of companies linked to the Bank of Korea‚Äôs CBDC initiative have rallied in recent weeks .

Solana (SOL), XRP, and Avalanche (AVAX) have all shown signs of strength, but analysts suggest their near-term upside may be limited. Technical resistance, legal overhangs, and slow-moving institutional adoption are slowing momentum across the board. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building massive traction as a new force in the market. Its capped supply, politically charged branding, and aggressive tokenomics are positioning it as a high-upside entry point heading into the next wave of altcoin rallies. Let‚Äôs break down where each coin stands‚Äîand why many investors are shifting attention toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. 1. Solana Price Outlook: ETF Hopes, But No Green Light Yet Solana has still been favored by retail traders and developers. Speculation and anticipation of a Solana ETF increased. But no Solana ETFs were filed or approved by the end of June 2025. Which has kept the SOL price between a range. SOL‚Äôs rise has been dramatic, but it‚Äôs partly driven by meme-coin action ‚Äî which raises questions of sustainability. It is ok not to agree with some Solana price predictions for Q3 2025, most of which ranges $150 ‚Äì $175. If momentum picks up, a rally to $180 or $183 is possible. The downside risk is real. Without a confirmed ETF or clearer institutional backing, Solana could slide back toward the $125‚Äì$135 range. SOL price chart XRP Price Prediction: ETF Buzz Meets Regulatory Uncertainty XRP‚Äôs chart is already showing initial signs of a potential breakout, as was the case with Bitcoin before its recent surge. Regulatory certainty is backing sentiment, and Ripple‚Äôs continued expansion around the world is still propelling long-term optimism. Forecasts for XRP in Q3 2025 are $2.20-$3.50. If Ripple ETF is approved and institutional adoption becomes more robust, XRP price could hit $5.81 or even $8. Court delays and sector-wide withdrawals might, however, see XRP back into the $1.78‚Äì$2.10 support zone. Speculators trading the price of XRP are optimistic but wary. A breakout over $3.40 would validate a breakout, but the direction to go will largely depend on regulatory news. XRP price chart Avalanche Price: Signs of Growth, But Resistance Ahead Avalanche continues to attract attention for its real-world use cases. From New Jersey digitizing real estate on-chain to the launch of the Fan3 engagement platform, AVAX is proving its utility. However, the AVAX price remains volatile. Technically, AVAX is forming higher lows but struggling to break past key resistance around $18.50. If it clears this mark with strong volume, a short-term push toward $30‚Äì$32 is possible. The $36‚Äì$44 range will be tough to crack without major momentum. Forecasts for Avalanche price in 2025 average around $40. In a highly bullish market, some analysts suggest it could reach $65, though that remains a stretch unless sentiment improves broadly. AVAX price chart Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Getting Analyst Attention MAGACOIN FINANCE is going to be this year‚Äôs hidden gem! While existing altcoins languish in technical quibbles and regulatory lags, MAGACOIN is booming with organic demand and vigorous fundamentals. With a project capped at 170 billion, there are no secrets or hidden inflation. That fixed supply model is fueling early accumulation as demand grows among investors. Earlier phases were quickly sold out, and new buyers are flocking before listing on the big exchanges. Security is another major factor. MAGACOIN FINANCE is audited by HashEx, which has helped draw both retail buyers and large crypto funds. Lack of VC control also makes confidence in the project‚Äôs inherent worth that much stronger. Some analysts predict potential returns of 20x, particularly for those who get in early. Its branding ‚Äî bold, political and polarizing ‚Äî is resonating with a significant portion of crypto investors in search of a sense of vibrancy and identity. The Smarter Move for ROI While XRP, Solana, and Avalanche all have long-term potential, they are moving at a slower pace. Each faces headwinds‚Äîwhether from legal delays, ETF speculation, or resistance zones. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a faster, more explosive opportunity. Analysts tracking early market behavior say the token‚Äôs design, capped supply, and community-driven rise could make it one of the biggest gainers of the year. For investors focused on maximum upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the clear favorite in 2025.

This persistent inability to break through has characterized the cryptocurrency‚Äôs performance in recent weeks, leaving analysts to speculate on its next moves. Analyst Predicts Major Upswing Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has outlined two potential scenarios for the Bitcoin price trajectory in the near term, offering insights into both immediate volatility and a long-term bullish outlook. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit emphasized the significance of the current market conditions, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach between $120,000 and $150,000 in the coming months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 According to Doctor Profit, the market is poised for a breakout. He noted, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre standing in front of a breakout, one that has the potential to send Bitcoin into the $120,000‚Äì$150,000 zone over the next few months.‚Äù This assertion is supported by data reflecting strong on-chain activity, favorable technical structures, liquidity flow, and macroeconomic factors. While the long-term outlook appears promising, he cautioned that short-term fluctuations will remain prevalent. Two Scenarios For The Bitcoin Price Doctor Profit outlined two primary outcomes that traders should consider. The first scenario involves a bullish breakout from a bull flag pattern, allowing Bitcoin to surge past the $113,000 resistance level and continue climbing without a pullback. However, the analyst views this scenario as overly simplistic, suggesting that market makers typically prefer not to allow such parabolic moves to occur without a preceding shakeout. The second scenario, which appears more likely, involves either a rejection at the bull flag breakout or a liquidity grab at the $113,000 mark. This would potentially lead Bitcoin to revisit the lower boundary of the current range, around $90,000 to $93,000. Doctor Profit noted that this region is attractive because it contains significant liquidity and a notable gap in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures market. He views a dip to these levels not as a bearish signal, but rather as an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin. In his analysis, he stated, ‚Äú$93K is not bearish. It‚Äôs clearly a gift!.‚Äù Doctor Profit believes that this potential dip would not only reset market leverage but also shake out weaker hands, creating a more robust foundation for a subsequent rally. Macroeconomic Trends Favor BTC Looking at the long-term prospects, Doctor Profit highlighted that larger wallets continue to accumulate Bitcoin, indicating that major investors are positioning themselves for a significant upward movement. He pointed to macroeconomic indicators, particularly the M2 money supply, which suggests that Bitcoin remains undervalued relative to broader economic trends. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Notably, the Bitcoin price has been trading within its current range for 226 days, which echoes patterns observed during previous accumulation phases before major price breakouts. As Doctor Profit concluded, the Bitcoin price trajectory remains optimistic, with expectations of reaching between $120,000 and $150,000 in the foreseeable future. He notes that while there are multiple paths to achieving this target, a dip into the $90,000 to $93,000 range would provide a crucial opportunity for accumulation and set the stage for a powerful upward move.

33767162,[object Object],1751254254,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,IRS Intensifies Scrutiny Of Crypto With Surge In Warning Letters,https://bitcoinist.com/irs-intensifies-scrutiny-of-crypto-with-letters/,"As crypto prices see a new rebound with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the pack, US investors are not only anticipating significant returns on BTC and other digital assets but also facing increased scrutiny from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Recent reports indicate that the Internal Revenue Service has dispatched a wave of warning letters to crypto investors, raising alarms about the accuracy of the information they provided on their tax returns. Crypto Tax Inquiries Skyrocket In the past two months, the number of these warning letters has spiked, signaling a renewed focus on digital asset reporting. Crypto tax experts have noted that this uptick is markedly higher than in previous years. David Kemmerer, co-founder and CEO of CoinLedger, reported a dramatic increase in support inquiries related to IRS communications . From May to June, conversations on CoinLedger about ‚ÄúIRS letters‚Äù surged to nearly 800, a ninefold increase compared to the same timeframe in 2024. Kemmerer explained, ‚ÄúThousands of investors are getting these letters. Naturally, when that happens, we see a flood of customers coming to us asking, ‚ÄòWhat do I do?‚Äô‚Äù This sentiment is echoed by two crypto tax attorneys, Jordan Bass and Andrew Gordon, who have also observed a noticeable rise in inquiries regarding these IRS notifications. Bass mentioned that his firm received inquiries from at least ten recipients of the letters in the last two months, a significant increase from the previous year when no inquiries were reported. IRS Warning Letters The IRS has a history of intensifying its efforts to ensure compliance among cryptocurrency investors. Following the agency‚Äôs acquisition of thousands of customer records from Coinbase in 2017, it implemented a series of ‚Äúvoluntary compliance‚Äù letters aimed at encouraging accurate reporting among investors. The latest notices inform recipients that the Internal Revenue Service possesses information indicating they hold ‚Äúone or more accounts containing virtual currency.‚Äù While some letters advise recipients to review their reporting for accuracy, others require a response, either through amended returns or explanations justifying their reported transactions. Interestingly, Gordon noted a potential commonality among recent recipients of the letters, many of whom had accounts on the Seychelles-based crypto exchange Poloniex , raising questions about the data the IRS may have accessed to trigger these communications. Kemmerer speculated that the increased outreach from the IRS typically follows the agency acquiring new data, suggesting that the notices might be part of broader enforcement efforts. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure there are just people randomly getting selected, and the lucky ones get these scary letters,‚Äù he said.

Over the past week, both assets have shown comparable price movements, reacting to broader market conditions and geopolitical events. However, a key question for SHIB investors is: what would the token‚Äôs price look like if it achieved the same market capitalization as XRP at its all-time high? To assess this, we compare the historical peak market cap of XRP with SHIB‚Äôs current valuation and circulating supply. This theoretical analysis helps illustrate the kind of price growth required for SHIB to reach a new high, though it is not intended as financial advice. Recent Price Movement Comparison Both XRP and SHIB experienced a price decline on June 22, following the intensification of the Iran-Israel conflict. XRP fell below $2 to approximately $1.90 but has since recovered significantly. As of now, XRP is trading around $2.19 , reflecting a 15.2% increase from its June 22 low. Similarly, Shiba Inu dropped to $0.00001010 on the same date. Since then, the token has rebounded and is currently priced at approximately $0.00001153 , representing a 12.87% rise. XRP‚Äôs Historical Market Cap High Although XRP reached a price peak of $3.84 in January 2018, its market capitalization at that time was around $128 billion. However, a new all-time high for market cap was achieved in January 2025, when XRP reached a market valuation of $190 billion. This was despite the price being slightly lower, at approximately $3.34, due to an increase in the circulating supply resulting from ongoing token releases by Ripple through its escrow program. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Calculating SHIB‚Äôs Potential Price at XRP‚Äôs ATH Market Cap As of its current price of $0.00001140, SHIB holds a market capitalization of roughly $6.71 billion. Assuming the circulating supply remains fixed at 589.25 trillion tokens, reaching XRP‚Äôs peak market cap of $190 billion would require a substantial increase. To match this valuation, SHIB‚Äôs market cap would need to grow by approximately 2,731%. At this level, the price per SHIB token would be around $0.0003224, representing a significant rise and establishing a new record high for the asset. Forecasts from Analysts and Models This price level is not entirely speculative. Several analysts and AI-based forecasting models have already projected similar targets for SHIB in the medium to long term. For instance, Himanshu Maradiya, affiliated with the CIFDAQ Blockchain Ecosystem, told Forbes that SHIB could trade between $0.0001 and $0.0003 by the end of the year, contingent on favourable market developments. Meanwhile, a panel of blockchain analysts featured by Finder expects SHIB to gradually appreciate, forecasting it may not reach the $0.0003 mark until between 2030 and 2035. Beyond that, they anticipate the token could eventually hit $0.0008543. In contrast, artificial intelligence models like Gemini and ChatGPT suggest a slightly earlier timeline. According to their projections, SHIB could trade around $0.0003 sometime between 2025 and 2026. This analysis illustrates the price that Shiba Inu could theoretically reach if it attains the same market capitalization that XRP attained at its highest point. While $0.0003224 may seem ambitious, it is grounded in a logical extrapolation of market cap data and supply dynamics. Nonetheless, such projections rely on a range of factors, including market adoption, utility development, and overall investor sentiment.

This level has proven difficult for XRP to break in recent days, with the token getting rejected each time it approaches this zone. A confirmed move above $2.20, with prices holding steadily, could open the door for a rally toward the next target around $2.25. The next resistance area sits between $2.30 and $2.35. Support Zones to Watch On the downside, XRP has strong support levels between $2.10 and $2.07. If prices drop, these levels are expected to attract buying interest and potentially stabilize the market. As of now, XRP seems to be trading sideways within this range, showing no clear breakout in either direction. A Market Moving with Bitcoin XRP‚Äôs next big move could depend heavily on what Bitcoin does next. If Bitcoin struggles to break through its own resistance levels, altcoins like XRP could follow a similar path, staying range-bound for a little longer. On the other hand, if Bitcoin makes a strong breakout, it might give XRP the momentum it needs to move higher. Long-Term Outlook Still Positive Looking at the bigger picture, XRP has been holding firm within a wider price channel for several months. While the short-term trend appears neutral, the long-term setup remains bullish as long as prices stay above key support levels. On the bullish side, XRP now has over 7.1 million wallets.. The price may be taking a short break, but another big move could be coming soon. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.19.

After the United States and Israel bombed three of Iran‚Äôs major nuclear sites ‚Äî Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan ‚Äî there‚Äôs growing concern that Tehran may have used the chaos to hide its most dangerous nuclear material. That fear isn‚Äôt just about war though, folks. It‚Äôs about inflation, too. Nuclear uncertainty hits markets hard, and when oil traders and policymakers don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming, prices go up. Supply chains panic. Governments hoard. The bombs may have landed in Iran, but the economic pressure is global. According to Reuters , US President Donald Trump confirmed that the strikes involved bunker-busting bombs, claiming the sites were ‚Äúobliterated.‚Äù But the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is in charge of monitoring Iran‚Äôs nuclear program, said the real damage is still unknown ‚Äî especially at Fordow, the underground facility responsible for producing most of Iran‚Äôs high-level enriched uranium. Rafael Grossi, the head of the agency, said on Monday that the centrifuges were likely badly damaged, but there‚Äôs no clear evidence yet that the actual stockpile ‚Äî nearly 9 tonnes in total, including the 400+ kg enriched close to weapons-grade ‚Äî was hit. Tehran may have moved uranium before the first bombs dropped Grossi also said Iran had notified him on June 13, just hours before Israel launched its first attacks, that it was ‚Äútaking measures to protect its nuclear equipment and materials.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt give details, but officials think that means the uranium was quietly relocated. One diplomat familiar with the situation said much of the enriched uranium from Fordow appeared to have been moved ‚Äúdays in advance,‚Äù almost like Tehran was warned. A satellite image showing trucks lined up near the facility before the strike backs up that claim. Trump dismissed that completely. In an interview with Fox News‚Äô Sunday Morning Futures, he insisted: ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt move anything. It‚Äôs very dangerous to do. It is very heavy ‚Äî very, very heavy. It‚Äôs a very hard thing to do.‚Äù Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also said he hadn‚Äôt seen any intelligence proving Iran relocated its uranium. The search for the material is now a long process. Olli Heinonen, who served as the IAEA‚Äôs top inspector between 2005 and 2010, told Reuters that verifying the stockpile‚Äôs status could take months. ‚ÄúThere could be materials which are inaccessible, distributed under the rubble or lost during the bombing,‚Äù he said. It‚Äôll involve forensics, environmental samples, and complex recovery operations. Iran says it‚Äôs done nothing wrong. But earlier this month, the IAEA‚Äôs 35-member Board of Governors passed a resolution accusing Iran of violating its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Tehran responded by voting in parliament to suspend cooperation with the IAEA. It also accused the watchdog of helping justify the airstrikes by providing diplomatic cover. The IAEA denies that claim. Grossi admitted his team can‚Äôt confirm if Iran‚Äôs nuclear work is entirely peaceful. But he said there‚Äôs also no solid evidence of a coordinated weapons program. Still, without knowing what happened to that 400 kg of enriched uranium, governments are forced to make their own risk calls. Heinonen said transparency from the agency will be key. ‚ÄúMember states can then make their own risk assessments,‚Äù he said. Still though, no matter which side is right, it wouldn‚Äôt end well for the world‚Äôs economy.

Prices are shaky, and many investors are being cautious. But while the well-known coins are slowing down, a new project called MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to get a lot of attention. Thanks to strong buying activity, generous staking rewards, and growing support from crypto analysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about investment opportunities of 2025. Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP: Popular, But Facing Challenges Ethereum (ETH): Price Worries Despite Institutional Support Ethereum is still the second biggest cryptocurrency by market value (over $296 billion), trading at around $2,453. Even though there‚Äôs been some good news, like ETF approvals and interest from big investors, Ethereum‚Äôs price has dropped 3.1% over the past week and lost over 7% in the last 30 days. Some technical patterns are making traders nervous, and a recent network upgrade (Shapella) released about $30 billion worth of ETH, which could increase selling in the short term. Cardano (ADA): Investors are Buying, But Controversy Lingers Cardano is trading at around $0.56 after falling 6% this week, though it‚Äôs still up more than 55% for the year. Large investors (also known as ‚Äúwhales‚Äù) are buying up ADA, and there are rumors of a partnership with Litecoin that could help its future. However, the project has taken a hit due to allegations involving its founder, Charles Hoskinson, and how funds from its early days were handled. That has made some investors hesitant in the short term. XRP: Legal Issues Keep Buyers Cautious XRP is trading at around $2.19, but its price continues to swing up and down due to its ongoing legal case with the U.S. SEC. Ripple (the company behind XRP) recently filed a new motion for a settlement, but legal experts aren‚Äôt confident that the matter will be resolved anytime soon. Meanwhile, XRPL‚Äôs tech upgrades are solid, but the token remains suppressed below its May highs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Presale of 2025 While other major cryptos fight to maintain footing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is seizing the spotlight as one of the most talked-about presales of the year, drawing in both retail and institutional interest at an accelerating pace. MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs presale is advancing rapidly. The previous rounds sold out quickly‚Äîseeing a flood of demand as investors chase the kind of early-stage upside rarely seen in the current market. Some estimates place potential returns at 30x or more for early backers if launch price targets are hit. With a capped total supply (reported at 170 billion tokens) and decentralized, inflation-resistant tokenomics, MAGACOIN FINANCE is engineered to drive long-term value. The project‚Äôs smart contract has been fully audited by HashEx, giving investors added security and confidence. Presale participants are offered high APY staking incentives and analysts are turning increasingly bullish on MAGACOIN FINANCE, pointing to strong fundamentals, supply scarcity, and explosive presale traction. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being featured on leading crypto platforms and is frequently highlighted in Q3 2025‚Äôs top crypto picks. Final words: Why You Should Pay Attention Now With Ethereum flashing bearish signs, Cardano under scrutiny, and XRP locked in a legal gray zone, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few projects showing true breakout potential to outperform them all in 2025. If you‚Äôre looking for high-growth potential before exchange listings, now may be your best shot.

This has raised concerns across the crypto market. He has sold over $3 million worth of MSTR stock in recent months. Insiders Offload $13.6M With No Buying On June 18, Phong Le disposed of 8,400 shares of Class A stock, though he still holds over 16,000 shares, plus 10,500 in preferred shares across two series.

Experts are asking if Bitcoin is the ‚Äúsuperior asset,‚Äù as Saylor claims, then why buy MicroStrategy stock at all.

However, some long-term holders argue that it is just routine transfers and not a sign of lost confidence. However, MSTR is up 27% year-to-date, beating the broader market, and MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin stash is now nearing 600,000 BTC. Saylor Hints at Another Bitcoin Buy Recently, Saylor shared the company‚Äôs BTC tracker on X, showing that they are just 7,655 short of 600K. His posts usually come right before a new purchase.

The price is consolidating and might aim for a move above the $2.220 resistance. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.20 zone. The price is now trading above $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $2.190 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2.220 resistance zone. XRP Price Eyes Fresh Surge XRP price formed a base above the $2.080 level and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.120 and $2.150 resistance levels. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $2.190 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even cleared the $2.20 level. A high was formed at $2.2191 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $2.20 level, but it is still above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.070 swing low to the $2.2191 high. The price is now trading above $2.180 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.220 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.250 level. The next resistance is $2.320. A clear move above the $2.320 resistance might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance or even $2.450 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.50. Downside Correction? If XRP fails to clear the $2.220 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.180 level. The next major support is near the $2.1450 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.070 swing low to the $2.2191 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.1450 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.120 support. The next major support sits near the $2.080 zone.

In a recent update, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the company is officially dropping its cross-appeal against the SEC. In a post on social media, Garlinghouse shared, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what‚Äôs most important ‚Äî building the Internet of Value. Lock in.‚Äù He also said that the SEC is expected to drop its appeal too, just as it had previously indicated. Now, speculations are rising about whether the SEC might formally drop its appeal during a closed-door meeting scheduled for July 3, 2025. Why July 3 Matters According to the SEC‚Äôs official notice, a private meeting will be held on July 3 at 2:00 p.m. ET. The meeting is closed to the public and will cover various topics, including settlements, administrative proceedings, and litigation matters, which many in the crypto community believe could involve the Ripple case. The meeting details were published under the Sunshine Act Notice, which lists the agenda as including the ‚Äúresolution of litigation claims.‚Äù This has fueled rumors that the SEC might use this opportunity to officially vote on withdrawing its appeal. What Legal Experts Say Former SEC attorney Marc Fagel weighed in on the situation, clarifying that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing further for Judge Torres to do. She already issued her final judgment a year ago, so once both parties have dismissed their appeals (which the SEC still needs to vote on), it will go into effect.‚Äù Fagel explained that the only step left is for the SEC to hold a vote to drop its appeal, something that could very well happen during the July 3 meeting. What‚Äôs Next for Ripple and XRP? If the SEC drops its appeal, it would mark the official end of one of crypto‚Äôs longest and most closely watched legal battles. Ripple would finally be free to move ahead without the legal cloud hanging over it, and the XRP community is already beaming with excitement about what this could mean for the token‚Äôs future.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-30 04:19:54

In a statement issued Sunday, the Tehran-based platform said that wallet access was being reactivated in phases, beginning with verified users and spot wallets. Other wallet types will follow, contingent on the completion of identity checks. Nobitex urged users to complete verification promptly and noted that wallet balances would become visible once all security and data accuracy checks were finalized. ‚ÄúWe are working to resume withdrawal, deposit, and trading services for verified users with minimal delay,‚Äù the company said.

Any transfers to the old addresses could result in permanent fund loss. Users relying on automated systems such as mining rigs or saved withdrawal configurations were told to update their details or wait for new personal addresses to be issued. The platform‚Äôs gradual reboot follows a highly disruptive breach earlier this month. The cyberattack prompted Iran‚Äôs central bank to intervene. Authorities React to Hack With Curbs on Operating Hours for Domestic Exchanges Authorities have since ordered all domestic crypto exchanges to limit operations between 10am and 8pm. This measure aims to strengthen security and reduce the risk of after-hours attacks. Meanwhile, the pro-Israel hacking group Predatory Sparrow, also known as Gonjeshke Darande, claimed responsibility for the breach. The incident marks yet another escalation in cyberwarfare involving state-linked actors in the region. Nobitex handles the bulk of Iran‚Äôs crypto trades. It plays a key role in the country‚Äôs expanding digital asset ecosystem. However, the recent breach has shaken user confidence. It has also raised concerns about the strength of Iran‚Äôs broader financial infrastructure, especially as cyber threats grow more sophisticated.

BNB Drops & NEAR Stalls",https://thecoinrise.com/with-18200-miners-sold-blockdag-ignites-a-new-mining-era-bnb-drops-near-stalls/,"This week has been hard for Binance, and the Binance Coin (BNB) price chart shows it clearly with a big fall. The chart is flashing warning signals after dropping sharply. At the same time, Near Protocol (NEAR) price momentum is slowing down, with traders focusing on support levels as bearish patterns remain firm. On a separate note, BlockDAG (BDAG) is seeing massive growth by making mining easy on phones. More than 2 million people now use its app for mining, and 18,200 hardware miners have been sold, making BlockDAG stand out among popular crypto coins for its easy mining setup. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Chart Hints at More Weakness Ahead Looking at the Binance Coin (BNB) price chart shows a clear fall in mood. Its price fell from $697.55 on May 27 to nearly $600 now. Even with an 8% rise in stablecoin transactions, which are now over $749 billion on BSC, BNB stays under selling pressure. Charts hint at a deeper fall as it broke main support and formed a head-and-shoulders pattern. On the Binance Coin (BNB) price chart, RSI and Stochastic Oscillator readings show sellers still lead. Support could hold near $500, but a longer-term recovery remains possible. Near Protocol (NEAR) Price Momentum Weakens More Near Protocol (NEAR) price momentum remains negative despite a sudden 90% rise in trading volumes. The token has dropped to $1.89, a 15% weekly decline, showing the bearish mood stays strong. All major EMAs are pointing down, hinting that weakness may continue. Resistance is mild near $2.15, while $1.98 support is closely watched as a possible breakdown mark. No strong triggers are seen, keeping Near Protocol (NEAR) price momentum firmly weak, although some traders bet on quick rebounds. Unless the overall market lifts, downside pressure may keep rising. BlockDAG Hits 18,200 Miners Sold & 2M Users as Mining Demand Skyrockets BlockDAG is changing mining by making it easy for everyone. Its X1 Miner App now has over two million users mining BDAG on their phones. Alongside, 18,200 X-Series miners have been sold, proving strong demand for both phone and hardware mining. The miner range offers options for all types of users. For those starting small, the X10 fits well, while the X30 and X100 are for higher daily BDAG returns. Whether one is testing it out or building a full setup, BlockDAG gives simple tools for every plan without adding confusion. The next shipments are set for July 7 for X30 and X100 , and August 15 for X10. These devices can mine up to 600 and 2,000 BDAG per day. They focus on performance while staying quiet and compact. Rising sales show users want easy ways to scale mining without problems. BlockDAG‚Äôs coin is gaining attention, too. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1, with prices rising from $0.001 to $0.0276. Currently, the coin is priced at $0.0080 as a limited-time offer, drawing interest from those hunting early gains. A total of 23.3 billion coins have been sold, with presale funding over $324 million toward the $600 million aim. As more miners join and devices ship out, BlockDAG is getting compared with other popular crypto coins, and talks of a $10 future price keep circulating, keeping its spotlight strong. Final Verdict! Recent weakness on the Binance Coin (BNB) price chart signals caution, with sellers still strong. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) price momentum remains downbeat, with no clear lift seen. Both may need strong triggers for recovery. On the other hand, BlockDAG moves ahead with over 2 million miners, 18,200 devices sold, and its coin at just $0.0080 as a limited-time offer. With more devices coming and growing use, BlockDAG is shaping up as more than just another name; it is among the top popular crypto coins to track before prices climb and the window closes.

This dramatic spike is raising eyebrows across the industry ‚Äî especially among analysts watching for signs of institutional involvement. Could this be the early tremor of a larger wave of investment interest? Let‚Äôs dive into what this surge might mean for XRP and the broader altcoin market. XRP Hovers with Cautious Optimism as Bulls Await Stronger Signals Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between a little over $2 and $2.30, indicating cautious trading sentiment. Bulls are finding it hard to push past the $2.45 resistance, suggesting bears have some control. However, support exists just below $2, offering a safety net. Over the past month, XRP has fallen by just over 10%, hinting at potential for a rebound. If momentum shifts, XRP could aim for the $2.70 mark, marking a 17% rise from the current upper range. The RSI hovers near 52, indicating a balanced market, while the MACD is slightly negative. Overall, XRP's short-term potential hinges on breaking resistance, offering promising growth if bulls gain strength. Conclusion The $3.95 billion surge in XRP futures is more than just a number ‚Äî it‚Äôs a signal. Whether it stems from institutional FOMO or renewed speculative interest, the momentum behind XRP is building at a critical technical juncture. If bulls can overcome the current resistance zones, the path toward $2.70 and beyond becomes increasingly realistic. For now, all eyes remain on XRP as it dances between caution and potential breakout. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Both are positioned for long-term relevance, but short-term headwinds and broader market shifts are pushing investors to seek new narratives. Among the rising contenders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most discussed tokens in institutional research circles. XRP Approaches Regulatory Clarity and ETF Speculation XRP continues to capture institutional interest, especially as legal uncertainty winds down. With regulatory breakthroughs in Canada and positive momentum toward a U.S. spot ETF approval, analysts view XRP as entering a maturing phase. However, this maturity also brings slower, more measured growth expectations. Much of the anticipated upside is now seen as tied to ETF developments and macro adoption curves. While XRP‚Äôs long-term fundamentals remain intact, short-term gains may be more constrained as capital seeks more agile, high-leverage opportunities. Cardano Aims to Reclaim Developer Momentum Cardano‚Äôs journey in 2025 has been shaped by network upgrades and renewed efforts to attract developers and dApp ecosystems. Despite its academic foundation and proven sustainability model, Cardano continues to face questions about real-world traction and user adoption rates. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic but note that Cardano‚Äôs price trajectory is increasingly linked to execution. In a fast-moving market, the slow-and-steady approach may offer resilience, but it doesn‚Äôt always deliver the explosive returns sought by early-phase investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE Rises as a High-Upside Play While XRP and Cardano lean on established infrastructures, MAGACOIN FINANCE is generating attention for its rare early-entry profile, scarcity-focused design, and rising traction across independent research platforms. Previous stages sold out instantly, and interest continues to grow among early-stage investors seeking asymmetric upside. What differentiates MAGACOIN FINANCE is its strategic positioning: analysts see it as a token designed for structural momentum, not just cyclical waves. As capital rotates across the crypto space, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being identified as a standalone force that benefits from emerging macro trends, narrative cycles, and scarcity dynamics. With a model that rewards timing and strategic entry, it has carved out a space in portfolios seeking high-range forecasts over the next market leg. Final Thoughts The 2025 landscape is filled with both proven altcoins and promising newcomers. XRP and Cardano maintain their foundational roles, but the next breakout opportunities are increasingly being found in lesser-known assets with high-leverage potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands at the intersection of strategic positioning, investor interest, and market narrative alignment. For those recalibrating their portfolios ahead of 2026, this emerging token offers a rare entry window that analysts say could deliver meaningful upside ‚Äî especially as traditional altcoins trend sideways or consolidate. In a market driven by timing and positioning, the smart money is already watching where the next wave is forming.

He admitted he was initially late to the game, buying his first Bitcoin at $6,000. At the time, it felt expensive. But looking back, he wishes he had purchased more. WHAT IS EXPENSIVE? I was late into Bitcoin. I waited too long‚Ä¶.which may have been a good thing. I waited because I did not understand today‚Äôs modern money. So I bought my first Bitcoin at $6000 a coin. It was expensive. Today I wish I had bought more at $6000. Today‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 30, 2025 He shared his regret about not buying more gold, silver, and Bitcoin earlier. He blames his hesitation on being too focused on fiat money, which he calls ‚Äúfake money.‚Äù He also reflected on how many people regret not chasing their dreams, especially later in life. Buying Bitcoin at $107K Now that Bitcoin trades around $107,000, Kiyosaki acknowledges the same feeling, thinking it‚Äôs too expensive. Yet, he‚Äôs still buying more. His reasoning is quite simple, as he explains that if Bitcoin hits $1 million, he knows he‚Äôll look back on today‚Äôs price and feel the same regret for not buying more. That‚Äôs why he urges people to stop obsessing over price tags and instead pay attention to how much of an asset they own. He believes poor people tend to focus too much on price, while the wealthy focus on accumulating quantity. Whether it‚Äôs gold, silver, or Bitcoin, Kiyosaki says he doesn‚Äôt worry about daily price swings. For him, the key is building up holdings over time, not trying to time the perfect entry. [post_titles_links postid=‚Äù476645‚Ä≥] Power on One Satoshi Kiyosaki encouraged even small investors to participate. Even if someone can only afford one Satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin, he believes they‚Äôll be grateful in five years. In his view, a Satoshi bought today could carry significant value in the future. Based on historical trends, if Bitcoin continues to double in price every 4‚Äì5 years, even a small investment could yield big returns. A 2023 MIT study found that adding crypto assets to a portfolio could reduce long-term risk by up to 15%. Although he doesn‚Äôt claim to know whether Bitcoin will reach $1 million, Kiyosaki made it clear that in hindsight, every previous price point feels like a bargain. He describes the $107,000 Bitcoin as ‚Äúpriceless,‚Äù emphasizing the long-term potential of the asset rather than its current cost.

Former President Donald Trump also weighed in by praising Bitcoin‚Äôs role in alleviating pressure on the US dollar and subtly referencing the Triffin Dilemma. This is a core flaw in the dollar‚Äôs global reserve status. Meanwhile, Human Rights Foundation‚Äôs Alex Gladstein pointed out Bitcoin‚Äôs use as a shield against authoritarian control due to its censorship-resistant qualities and historical utility in pro-democracy movements. With increasing distrust in fiat currencies, ballooning government debt, and weakening institutional credibility, all of these narratives come together to present Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a growing pillar in both economic realignment and individual empowerment. Younger Generations Turning to Bitcoin Market analyst Jordi Visser offered a provocative outlook on the future of Bitcoin, and suggested that the disillusionment of younger generations with the existing economic order could be a major force behind the cryptocurrency‚Äôs long-term price appreciation. On a recent episode of entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano‚Äôs podcast, Visser said that people aged 25 and younger are becoming increasingly skeptical of capitalism and are instead advocating for a new system rooted in greater public spending and expansive social benefits. This generational shift, he argues, is being fueled by economic uncertainty, the erosion of trust in traditional institutions, and the looming threat of widespread job displacement caused by artificial intelligence. According to Visser, the growing frustration and lack of faith in the current system are prompting governments to ramp up spending to try and placate the masses‚Äîan action that inevitably leads to more money printing. He believes that this ongoing reliance on fiat currency and debt-driven economics will only strengthen the case for Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. ‚ÄúThe more people are angry, the more money the government has to print,‚Äù Visser explained. This cycle of monetary expansion will drive Bitcoin‚Äôs price higher over time, regardless of public perception or institutional resistance. He predicts that Bitcoin will increasingly replace fiat assets as it becomes a more trusted financial instrument. AI protest Visser also issued a broader warning about the long-term viability of capitalism itself. He suggested that the rapid development of AI and robotic technologies‚Äîespecially humanoid robots and autonomous vehicles‚Äîcould make human labor obsolete, further concentrating wealth in the hands of a few and destabilizing the capitalist framework. He believes this technological shift is imminent, with commercial adoption of self-driving cars and robotic labor likely within five years. These kinds of advancements, he said, will act as a wake-up call for society. He beieleves it will force a reevaluation of existing economic models and accelerate interest in decentralized assets like Bitcoin. Trump Says Bitcoin Eases Pressure on the Dollar President Donald Trump also recently expressed his strong support for Bitcoin by praising its growing role in the US economy during a White House press conference on Friday. Trump described the cryptocurrency industry as ‚Äúamazing,‚Äù due to its job creation potential and increasing use as a means of payment. He suggested that Bitcoin helps relieve pressure on the US dollar, a statement that digital asset researcher Anders X believes alludes to the Triffin Dilemma. This is a long-standing economic conflict where the issuer of the world‚Äôs reserve currency must sacrifice domestic monetary stability to meet global demand for liquidity. As the issuer of the global reserve currency, the United States is required to maintain persistent trade deficits in order to supply enough dollars to the global market. While this practice supports international trade and provides a short-term solution to global liquidity needs, it undermines the long-term value of the dollar due to ongoing money creation. This systemic contradiction fuels concerns about currency debasement and inflation. Trump‚Äôs previous comments about potentially paying off national debt with Bitcoin means that there is a growing awareness of the contrast between the inflation-prone dollar and Bitcoin‚Äôs capped supply. Critics, however, point out that even if the US Treasury were to acquire the entire Bitcoin supply, it would fall far short of covering the nation‚Äôs ballooning $37 trillion debt . With deficits continuing to rise, many analysts believe this debt trajectory is unsustainable and could ultimately lead to a collapse in the dollar‚Äôs value. Macroeconomist Lyn Alden captured this sentiment with the now-famous phrase ‚Äúnothing stops this train.‚Äù This reflects the consensus that governments will continue printing money indefinitely. This pessimism is already playing out in financial markets. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar‚Äôs strength against a basket of other major currencies, recently fell to its lowest level in three years. At the same time, US government bond yields are still elevated, which signals weakening investor confidence in the government‚Äôs ability to manage its debt responsibly. Bitcoin Rescues People From Tyranny At the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington, D.C., Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein addressed a room of American political leaders, and talked about Bitcoin‚Äôs critical role in countering authoritarian regimes. Gladstein pointed out that Bitcoin continues to prove itself as a powerful financial tool for people living under oppressive governments by offering a decentralized alternative to state-controlled fiat systems. According to him, when used correctly‚Äîwithout tying personal identity to transactions‚ÄîBitcoin makes it a lot harder for governments to monitor, freeze, or seize individual assets. Gladstein stated that one of Bitcoin‚Äôs most valuable features is its resistance to manipulation by authoritarian leaders. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be inflated or weaponized to exert control over citizens, Bitcoin cannot be hyperinflated, and self-custodied wallets remain outside the reach of state interference. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre self-custoding your Bitcoin, governments can‚Äôt delete or freeze your stuff, and they certainly can‚Äôt hyperinflate you,‚Äù he said. He shared that the Human Rights Foundation first recognized Bitcoin‚Äôs potential during Ukraine‚Äôs 2013 pro-democracy protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych. Protesters at the time faced frozen bank accounts, yet Bitcoin provided a way to receive financial support when traditional banking systems failed. Despite initial skepticism‚ÄîBitcoin was valued at just $100 then‚Äîthe technology proved very effective when it came to delivering funds across borders and into the hands of those fighting for democratic freedoms. Gladstein concluded that Bitcoin already helped countless people escape the financial reach of authoritarian governments and continues to do so. Since joining the Human Rights Foundation in 2007, he saw firsthand how the technology empowers people in regions where human rights are regularly violated. According to him, Bitcoin is not just a technological innovation but a tool for resistance, making it, as he put it, ‚Äúbad for dictators.‚Äù",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-30 05:30:00

Analyst Explains the Real Reason",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-is-bitcoin-stuck-at-100000-and-not-rising-analyst-explains-the-real-reason/,"Charles Edwards, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis company Capriole Investments, made remarkable statements about the stagnation in the Bitcoin price and recent market dynamics. According to Edwards, the reason Bitcoin is stuck at $100,000 levels despite the interest (FOMO) from institutional investors is due to selling pressure from long-term investors. Edwards stated that since the spot ETF launch in January 2024, long-term Bitcoin holders (LTH) have been selling to Wall Street and liquidating their positions. Stating that this situation is reflected in the media in different ways, Edwards argued that the real reason is these sales. The CEO recalled a prediction he made in April, saying that companies holding Bitcoin treasury would create a ‚Äúflywheel‚Äù effect, triggering a massive buying wave in the market and pushing the ETF narrative to the background. Edwards said that this effect is now clearly visible and many new companies are joining this trend. Related News: Latest Report on Cryptocurrency Owners in South Korea Released - Major Changes Are Underway, Here Are the Trends Examining on-chain data, Edwards explained that there has been a huge increase in the number of investors holding BTC for more than 6 months in the last two months, and that the purchases made by this group more than covered all the BTC sold by LTHs in the last 1.5 years. He evaluated this situation as ‚Äúincredible.‚Äù Edwards also stated that such aggressive increases are usually followed by price squeezes, which is a short-term bullish sign. However, Edwards noted that there is still some weakness in the general on-chain data, and stated that recovery is possible if this buying momentum continues: ‚ÄúCan Treasury companies continue this rapid pace of buying? I think this cycle is just beginning. If aggressive buying by investors with a 6-month holding continues, the market could overcome this weakness.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

What started as a politically branded, community-first token has quickly become one of the most closely watched opportunities in the early-stage altcoin market. Now, traders from legacy ecosystems‚Äîespecially XRP, Ethereum, and Avalanche‚Äîare paying attention. Despite the long-term potential of those established chains, many holders are shifting focus toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, lured by its capped supply, rapid presale growth, and aggressive upside projections. For those seeking asymmetric gains before the next altcoin run kicks into full gear, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a serious contender. Why the Rotation From XRP, ETH, AVAX Is Happening Now The story begins with timing. XRP has made major strides this year, thanks in part to ETF speculation and a strengthened regulatory outlook. But after a strong rally, price action has cooled into a consolidation phase. Ethereum, despite rolling out long-awaited upgrades, has also seen sideways movement as staking yields normalize and institutional adoption stabilizes. Meanwhile, Avalanche is working through its own recovery after a price dip earlier this year, but momentum remains tepid In a market built on momentum and narrative, that lull is prompting traders to look elsewhere. And MAGACOIN FINANCE is delivering just the right combination of novelty and promise. Its presale is filling rapidly. Some analysts are forecasting 25x to 50x returns from current levels, placing it in the same conversation as early Shiba Inu or Solana‚Äîprojects that were once overlooked, then exploded. What Makes MAGACOIN FINANCE Different Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings structure. Its token supply is capped at 170 billion. Smart contracts have been audited. And perhaps most importantly, there‚Äôs no VC control‚Äîthe ownership model is entirely community-driven. This transparency is catching the eye of seasoned traders, particularly those weary of dilution, slow roadmaps, or centralized decision-making in older Layer-1 ecosystems. MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs setup mirrors some of the best traits from previous breakout tokens‚Äîcommunity energy, early access pricing, and a narrative that‚Äôs generating attention on crypto Twitter and beyond. Utility and Listings on the horizon While most meme-inspired tokens lack long-term strategy, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with plans for a referral-based incentive model and a clear roadmap aimed at encouraging long-term holding and participation. These features are already drawing interest from Ethereum and Avalanche traders who are used to earning yield through protocol engagement‚Äîand now see early-stage entry into MAGACOIN FINANCE as a more asymmetric bet with significantly higher upside. Community growth has also been exponential, fueled by politically charged branding and a meme-forward marketing strategy. But this isn‚Äôt a one-dimensional campaign‚Äîexchange listings are reportedly on the horizon. And that‚Äôs where traders are hoping to catch the next big move. Historically, some of the most explosive gains in crypto come just before or after a token‚Äôs first major exchange debut. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be sitting right at that inflection point. The Asymmetric Opportunity For XRP, ETH, and AVAX traders, the calculus is simple. These are powerful projects with massive potential‚Äîbut at their current valuations, they‚Äôre unlikely to deliver 30x returns in a single cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, still sits in the early innings. That‚Äôs what makes it attractive to experienced investors who understand risk but are ready to reposition for a bigger swing. This isn‚Äôt about abandoning blue chips‚Äîit‚Äôs about timing. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE has the story, structure, and speed to justify the attention it‚Äôs getting.

While altcoins brace for significant bounce-backs, BNB Chain will officially roll out the Maxwell hardfork today, June 30, 2025. The upgrade aims to enrich Binance‚Äôs chain through enhanced efficiency and speed. BNB Chain @BNBCHAIN ¬∑ Follow ‚ö†Ô∏è Maxwell Hardfork goes live in a few hours, here‚Äôs everything you need to know üßµ üëá 8:24 PM ¬∑ Jun 29, 2025 130 Reply Copy link Read 56 replies First and foremost, Maxwell will halve BSC‚Äôs block time to only 0.75 seconds from 1.5 seconds, making it a sub-second platform. It‚Äôs noteworthy that today‚Äôs fork builds on last year‚Äôs Lorentz upgrade momentum, reflecting the team‚Äôs continued dedication to scalability, speed, and enriched user experience. BSC‚Äôs journey to efficiency: from Loretz upgrade to Maxwell BNB Chain is among the blockchain projects that take speed as a foundational element for success in the sector. It rolled out the Lorentz fork in April 2025 to reduce block times from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds. The update brought noticeable enhancement across validator efficiency, dApp responsiveness, and DeFi performance. BNB Chain flourished after Lorentz. For instance, it delivered only a $0.04 transaction fee. Moreover, Dune‚Äôs data shows BSC outshined all decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in daily volume. Source ‚Äì Dune Analytics Meanwhile, the Maxwell upgrade will take these advancements to another level. Node operators, developers, and users can anticipate smooth app interactions and swift transaction confirmations. What to expect with Maxwell hardfork? The latest upgrade transforms BNB Smart Chain‚Äôs ecosystem with three main improvements. Firstly, it introduces BEP-524 to slash the block interval to 0.75 seconds. That means doubling BSC‚Äôs transaction throughput capability. Users will enjoy accelerated offerings from minting and token swaps to smart contract execution and GameFi activities. Secondly, Maxwell enhanced validator messaging by enhancing existing p2p communication models. That will reduce possible syncing lags, boosting network stability even during faster activities. Validators will experience fewer delays when proposing and voting on blocks. Finally, the BPE-564 standard introduces two messaging mechanisms, GetBlocksByRangeMsg and RangeBlocksMsg. These will enable nodes to synch massive block groups at once, enriching syncing speed and reliability across the BSC network. The Maxwell update isn‚Äôt about boosting speed alone. It represents a strategic step toward a more efficient and faster blockchain future. The upgrade reflects BSC‚Äôs dedication to dominating web3 adoption amid renewed demand for responsive performance in NFTs, DeFi, and online gaming. BNB price outlook The native token displayed bullishness as enthusiasts brace for network enhancements. BNB trades at $655 after rebounding from the support at $642. Chart by Coinamrketcap Its increasing daily trading volume suggests a possible upward continuation. Continued bullishness amid the Maxwell upgrade and broad market uptrends could fuel BNB‚Äôs price to the next resistance at $720. A breakout might propel the token to the crucial obstacle at $760, beyond which BNB will shift its trajectory to bullishness. However, sudden selling pressure might cause the token to plunge to the support barrier at $520-$540.

Crypto markets were a little slower to react, remaining mostly flat over the past week and into the weekend. The Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation gauge, core PCE, showed that price increases accelerated in May, raising inflation concerns. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that he expects to see a pickup in inflation this summer, but reiterated his ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù approach. On Sunday, President Trump commented on the July 9 deadline for the 90-day tariff pause, stating, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I need to extend it, but could.‚Äù Economic Events June 30 to July 4 June‚Äôs ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Manager‚Äôs Index (PMI) is due on Tuesday. This report shows business conditions in the manufacturing sector and serves as a significant leading indicator of overall economic conditions. There are also job openings data due on Tuesday, which could reflect conditions in the labor market. Wednesday and Thursday will see more labor market reports, with nonfarm payrolls and unemployment figures released. These reports represent the number of new jobs created during the previous month, along with the percentage of people actively seeking employment. They are significant economic indicators, as the shift in the number of jobs is strongly associated with overall economic health. June‚Äôs ISM Services PMI, due on Thursday, will reflect business conditions in the services sector and is another leading economic indicator. Traditional markets are closed on Friday for the July 4 celebrations as we enter the second half of the year. Crypto Market Outlook Digital asset markets remained flat over the weekend but gained during early Asian trading on Monday morning to reach $3.46 trillion in total capitalization. Bitcoin has reached a two-week high, tapping $108,750 in early trading on Monday, but it faced resistance there yet again and fell back to $108,500 at the time of writing. The assed has struggled at this level at least five times over the past week where it has been rejected. Ethereum is doing a little better, having reached its support-turned-resistance level of $2,500 on Monday morning after a 2.8% gain.

In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Cyclop expressed a bullish outlook, labeling the current market conditions as the best long setup for Ethereum he has seen in years. Analyst Sees $4,000 Target This Summer Cyclop highlighted that Ethereum short positions have reached all-time highs, a situation reminiscent of a previous spike that occurred just weeks ago. The analyst noted that liquidity has been swept on both sides, creating a scenario where market uncertainty may actually benefit Ethereum. ‚ÄúMost doubt ETH and altcoins right now‚ÄîI‚Äôm betting on $4,000 this summer,‚Äù he stated confidently. Related Reading: TD Sequential Flashes Buy: Dogecoin Ready For Rebound To $0.21 Cyclop outlined several key factors driving his optimistic stance. First, he pointed to the recent Pectra update, which has reinvigorated interest in Ethereum by enhancing transaction capabilities, updating security features, and improving staking options. This update has reportedly led to increased demand, contributing to a potential price surge. Moreover, Cyclop emphasized the broader macroeconomic landscape, noting that cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating beyond Bitcoin (BTC), with Ethereum taking a prominent role. The analyst suggests that major corporations and banks are beginning to purchase and stake Ethereum, further boosting trust and interest in the digital asset which could ultimately result in more demand and more price uptrends. Ethereum Rallies May Trigger Altcoin Boom On-chain metrics also favor Ethereum, with the cryptocurrency ranking highly in various categories, according to Cyclop. It currently stands as the second-highest by fees, leads in bridged net flows, and ranks third in stablecoin supply changes, showcasing its robust market position. Another critical aspect of Cyclop‚Äôs analysis concerns altcoins and the upcoming altseason, traditionally characterized by a rush of investment into Ethereum before spilling over into smaller tokens. He pointed out that historical patterns indicate that Ethereum price rallies often trigger broader altcoin surges, and the current market sentiment suggests that many altcoins are at their lowest ebb. Related Reading: Dogecoin Silent Build-Up: Double Bottom Hints At Explosive Move To $0.47 While Cyclop acknowledges that a majority of altcoins may face significant challenges, he argues that ETH remains undervalued, especially with Bitcoin trading near $100,000. He has made strategic moves, reallocating some of his Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum and promising strong altcoins. His initial target for Ethereum is $3,000, where he plans to take profits, followed by a series of sell orders between $4,000 and $6,000. As of press time, ETH trades at $2,500, a 12% price increase in the weekly time frame.

This decline has pushed its market cap below $4 billion, despite several big updates on Pi Day 2. Pi‚Äôs Price Drops Despite Major Updates The Pi Core Team announced new features, including an AI initiative, upgrades to the Pi App Studio, and a new Ecosystem Directory Staking system that lets users stake Pi to boost app visibility. Other highlights included integration with Onramper, a new Pi Wallet upgrade, and Node version 0.5.2 with improved security. The price still failed to rally as no exchange listing was announced, and concerns such as the upcoming token unlocks and the project‚Äôs centralized control have yet to be resolved. Token Unlocks Threaten to Add $215M in Sell Pressure Between late June and July 2025, approximately 276 million Pi tokens, representing about 3.7% of the circulating supply, are set to be unlocked. This will introduce over $215 million in sell pressure to the market. Historically, similar token unlocks have led to major price declines, ranging from 30% to 77%, and there is a strong possibility this pattern could repeat.

Big Move Expected In The Year-End The next big day is scheduled for December 28, 2025 (Pi Year-End Summary Day), which is still several months away. If no strong market catalyst emerges in the near term, then a strong rebound appears unlikely. According to CoinDCX, Pi Network is set for a bullish second half of 2025. It may start around $1.20 in July and reach up to $2.80 by December. It may see a small dip in September before picking up again. Pi Coin Short-Term Price Prediction Pi Network started the month around $0.70 and dropped steadily, hitting a low around $0.42 mid-month. Around June 24-26, the price surged near $0.66 before falling again. Currently, it is trading around $0.52, a level that has been tested multiple times and may act as short-term support.

At the Digital Bhutan panel, co-hosted by Binance, officials laid out a clear vision: bring crypto out of theory and into everyday life. ‚ÄúTourists complain they can‚Äôt use SWIFT or pay easily. Binance Pay fixes that,‚Äù said Damcho Rinzin, director of the department of tourism. Rinzin added that travelers are already using crypto to buy local goods ‚Äî in one case, even groceries to cook their own meals. Bhutan‚Äôs ambitions remain modest, just 300,000 visitors a year. But it wants them to stay longer and spend more ‚Äî with Binance Pay‚Äôs 40 million plus user base as a lever. Binance CEO Richard Teng framed it as a shift from speculation to infrastructure. ‚ÄúThis is the first national crypto payments system,‚Äù Teng said. ‚ÄúThe average crypto tourist spends $1,000 ‚Äî nearly three times a regular tourist ‚Äî and merchants receive instant settlements,‚Äù he added. With over 1,000 merchants onboarded, and zero fees on Binance Pay compared to steep charges from other providers, Bhutan hopes to build a community-driven, tech-savvy ecosystem that aligns with its values. DK Bank, which played a pioneering role in Bhutan‚Äôs early bitcoin mining efforts, is now spearheading crypto adoption on the ground. ‚ÄúMobile and QR payments are already high,‚Äù said the bank‚Äôs CEO, Ugyen Tenzin said. ‚ÄúCrypto just fits,"" he added. ""And this is just the start,"" said Hobeng Lim, managing director of finance at Gelephu Mindfulness City. Gelephu Mindfulness City is a planned city in the country which merges technology, like blockchain, with culture, and sustainability., Lim added that they are many more blockchain-native projects in the pipeline, with digital assets formally recognized as a future growth engine. ‚ÄúCrypto is not a side experiment, It‚Äôs a core industry,‚Äù Lim said.

On the geopolitical front, the ceasefire between Israel and Iran appears to be holding, easing global tensions and dampening safe-haven demand for the dollar. Gold rose to around $3,280 per ounce on Monday, helped by a weaker US dollar. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.88% to surpass 40,700, while the broader Topix Index rose 0.8% to 2,863 on Monday, with both benchmarks reaching their highest levels in nearly a year. The Japanese yen strengthened toward 144 per dollar on Monday, approaching two-week highs. Meanwhile, data showed Japan‚Äôs industrial production rose less than expected in May, as elevated US tariffs continued to dampen the outlook. However, trade friction between Japan and the US remains unresolved, as the 25% US tariff on Japanese car imports continues to be a sticking point in bilateral negotiations, with little sign of progress. Japan‚Äôs housing starts plunged 34.4% year-over-year in May 2025, sharply missing market expectations of a 14.8% drop and worsening from a 26.6% decline in the previous month. Looking ahead, investors are turning their attention to Tuesday‚Äôs Tankan survey for a clearer read on corporate sentiment and the broader economic environment. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.42% rose 0.2% to around 3,430 on Monday, snapping a two-day losing streak, as weak manufacturing data fueled expectations of additional stimulus, and the offshore yuan strengthened to around 7.16 per dollar on Monday, recouping losses from the previous week, as the latest PMI data reinforced expectations of further stimulus measures. Official data showed China‚Äôs manufacturing PMI edged up to 49.7 in June from 49.5 but remained in contraction for a third straight month. The non-manufacturing PMI also rose slightly to 50.5, indicating tepid growth in services and construction. Beijing confirmed Friday a new trade agreement with Washington. The deal stipulates China will review export applications under its control rules, in exchange for the U.S. rolling back several restrictive measures targeting Chinese entities. Markets now await Tuesday‚Äôs Caixin PMI data for further insight into private-sector momentum. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.26% to 24,183 in Monday morning trade, extending losses for a third straight session amid broad weakness in consumer and financial stocks. India¬†( SENSEX ) fell 0.34% to 83,797 in early trade on Monday, erasing solid gains from the prior session, as traders engaged in profit-taking after the BSE Sensex hit a record high on Friday. On the data front, India's external debt reached a record high of USD 736.3 billion in the March quarter, primarily driven by an increase in non-government debt. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.53% to 8,534 on Monday, extending last week‚Äôs gains as investor sentiment improved amid easing concerns over broad US tariffs. The Australian dollar edged higher to around $0.653 on Monday. Domestically, the Melbourne Institute‚Äôs Monthly Inflation Gauge showed a modest uptick in June, reversing the previous month's decline and marking the fourth increase this year. Australia's private sector credit edged lower to 0.5% month-over-month in May 2025, compared to market expectations and the prior month's 0.7%. Investors now await Australia‚Äôs June manufacturing PMI for insights into the health of the sector and the country's overall economic momentum. In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended higher amid optimism for trade deals and rate cut hopes, overshadowing Trump's Canada trade talk comments. On the economic front, investors are closely watching key US labor market indicators this week, including job openings data, the ADP employment report, and the non-farm payrolls report, which could provide further insights into the Federal Reserve's rate path. U.S. stock futures rose on Monday as Wall Street aimed to close out a strong June, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hitting new all-time highs: Dow +0.57% ; S&P 500 +0.39% ; Nasdaq +0.55% .

Whispers are flying that Ripple might have secretly acquired a popular crypto exchange , and the community isn‚Äôt staying quiet about it. What started as a casual comment on social media has snowballed into full-blown speculation, with people connecting dots, making predictions, and trying to figure out if there‚Äôs any truth to it. And one name that has popped up several times is Uphold. So, Where Did This All Start? It kicked off when Ripple‚Äôs CEO dropped a major update about the company‚Äôs long-running legal fight with the SEC. Ripple officially announced they‚Äôre dropping their cross appeal , and the case is finally being put to rest. Naturally, this big moment got the entire crypto community talking. But what really caught people‚Äôs attention was when one of the well-known crypto exchanges jumped into the conversation on social media. A simple two-word reply from their official account was enough to send crypto Twitter into overdrive, with people speculating whether Ripple was about to acquire them. Crypto Rumors Move Fast Soon, posts and threads claiming Ripple had bought out a crypto exchange started flooding X (formerly Twitter). Even other exchanges like Kraken got casually dragged into the gossip. But one name kept popping up more than the rest, Uphold. RUMORS: DID RIPPLE JUST ACQUIRE A TOP CRYPTO EXCHANGE? NO CONFIRMATION YET ‚Äî BUT THE INTERNET‚ÄôS ON FIRE. IF TRUE‚Ä¶ EVERYTHING CHANGES. #XRP #RIPPLE ‚Äî Pumpius (@pumpius) June 28, 2025 Coinpedia‚Äôs Two Cents: Why Would Ripple Even Consider Buying an Exchange? Well, there‚Äôs actually a reason this rumor felt believable. Not long ago, Ripple CEO revealed they‚Äôve got over $1 billion in cash reserves specifically set aside for expanding the company. And they‚Äôve made it clear they don‚Äôt just want to focus on payments and liquidity anymore. Ripple‚Äôs ambitions stretch into areas like custody, compliance, and tokenization, and having an exchange under their wing would make a lot of sense down the road. That‚Äôs probably why the internet latched onto the idea so quickly. Ripple aspires to be more than just liquidity & payments. Acquisitions in crypto-friendly markets (like UAE and Switzerland), for expansion. pic.twitter.com/yTRMEasngN ‚Äî Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) May 18, 2023 Is There Any Truth to It? As of now ‚Äî no. There‚Äôs no official confirmation from Ripple, Uphold, or anyone else involved. The exchange‚Äôs cheeky reply on social media seems to have been nothing more than good timing and playful interaction during a huge moment for Ripple. That said, considering Ripple‚Äôs billion-dollar war chest and their stated plans for expansion, it wouldn‚Äôt be shocking if something like this happened at some point in the future. Crypto loves a good rumor, and this one checked all the boxes, mystery, money, and a touch of drama. While it appears to be nothing more than speculation for now, it serves as a reminder that Ripple is sitting on serious resources and big ambitions. Conclusion Claim DID RIPPLE JUST ACQUIRE A TOP CRYPTO EXCHANGE? Verdict False Fact-Check by Coinpedia As per Coinpedia‚Äôs research and review of official sources, there is no credible or verifiable evidence linking Ripple to the acquisition of Kraken or Uphold exchanges.

In a N ews interview aired on Sunday, Trump said the trade relationship heavily favors Japan and that the United States is getting a bad deal . ‚ÄúSo we give Japan no cars. They won‚Äôt take our cars, right? And yet we take millions and millions of their cars into the United States. It‚Äôs not fair,‚Äù Trump said during the interview. The president emphasized that the United States and Japan recognize the trade imbalance . Trump said he had described the circumstances to Japanese officials, who accepted the problem and the fact that the United States has a large trade deficit with Japan. Trump hinted that Japan could fill the gap by increasing its purchases of American vehicles, oil and other goods. Source: Companies, MarkLines, China Automotive Technology and Research Center and Bloomberg Intelligence The US has complained for decades that Japan‚Äôs safety and emissions standards constitute so-called non-tariff barriers to American cars. Japanese automakers have flourished in the American market, but carmakers from the United States have long had difficulty penetrating the Japanese market. Tariff tensions mount as US-Japan talks race against July 9 deadline As time ticks toward the July 9 deadline, under that agreement, if the Doha talks made no progress, the US would be free to impose 25% tariffs on Japanese car imports ‚Äî under a ‚Äúreciprocal tariff‚Äù provision the Trump administration has championed ‚Äî if there was no trade deal by then. Japan‚Äôs chief negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, extended his stay in Washington DC, for follow-up talks with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to stave off a trade rupture. The two men have had a series of discussions over the past several months in an attempt to address long-running trade irritants. On Sunday, the Japanese government released a statement describing the recent talks as productive. Akazawa and Lutnick reportedly had a ‚Äúfruitful discussion‚Äù and agreed to ‚Äúcontinue seeking a deal that benefits both the US and Japan.‚Äù However, behind-the-scenes reports suggest the talks are stuck on core issues, including how to measure market access for American cars and how Japan could offset the deficit to satisfy US demands. Despite the positive tone of the joint statement, there‚Äôs still no sign of a formal agreement or even a reprieve from the tariffs. Analysts say a failure to reach a deal could spark retaliation and damage bilateral trade relations. Trump threatens 25% tariff on Japanese cars in bold unilateral trade move Trump‚Äôs comments also signal a growing willingness to act unilaterally. He warned that the US could impose tariffs without any further discussion or approval from Japan. On Sunday, Trump said he planned to send letters to trading partners, including Japan, informing them of new tariff measures. He said he could send a letter to Japan outlining that the country would be required to pay a 25% tariff on its car exports to the United States. The blunt statement went beyond mere rhetoric. It is a continuation of what Trump believes prayerfully will be ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù trade policies to slash the US trade deficits through the empowerment of aggressive tariff design. Trump has in the past used methods similar to those of trading partners, including China and the European Union. Critics said that threatening tariffs have tended to bring countries to the negotiating table, but it is also a strategy that could backfire by unnerving global trade.

47078808,https://coinpaper.com/9744/stablecoins-and-crypto-cards-gain-ground-in-europe-s-everyday-economy,1751263200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Stablecoins and Crypto Cards Gain Ground in Europe's Everyday Economy,https://coinpaper.com/9744/stablecoins-and-crypto-cards-gain-ground-in-europe-s-everyday-economy,"Stablecoins and crypto debit cards are gaining meaningful traction in Europe‚Äôs evolving financial ecosystem, with recent data showing significant growth in both internet-based settlements and everyday spending. While stablecoins now surpass traditional card networks like Visa and Mastercard in onchain volume, crypto cards are matching ‚Äî and in some areas outpacing ‚Äî banks when it comes to micro-payments and online purchases. Stablecoins Leapfrog Card Giants to Become the Internet‚Äôs Default Settlement Layer The race to own the internet‚Äôs checkout button is over‚Äîfor now. Data gathered by blockchain-infrastructure provider Alchemy shows that dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies have already pushed past Visa and Mastercard in on-chain transaction volume by roughly 7%, cementing stablecoins as the fastest-growing payment rail on the planet. Stablecoins have seen ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù adoption and are becoming the default settlement layer for the internet, Alchemy‚Äôs head of engineering Noam Hurwitz says. Behind the numbers is a simple value proposition: near-instant, borderless transfers that cost a fraction of a cent and clear 24/7‚Äîfeatures legacy card networks still struggle to match. The result, Hurwitz added, is a decisive shift in how money moves online. PayPal, Stripe and Visa have all embedded stablecoin rails to trim costs and speed up settlement, effectively hiding the blockchain complexity behind familiar user interfaces. By leaning on Alchemy‚Äôs APIs, these firms can decouple the user experience from the underlying technology while gaining real-time finality, Hurwitz explained. A Trillion-Dollar Liquidity Pool in Treasurys One knock-on effect of stablecoin growth is a massive new buyer of US debt. Market leader Tether (USDT) generated an estimated $13 billion in profit last year and now holds roughly $113 billion in US Treasurys‚Äîmore than the government of Germany. Those reserve-backed holdings anchor the broader tokenized-finance stack, Hurwitz noted, turning tokenized money into the bedrock of an emerging on-chain economy. Momentum accelerated on June 17 when the US Senate passed the bipartisan Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act). The bill creates a federal licensing regime for issuers and removes much of the legal gray area that has kept banks and payment giants on the sidelines. Industry lawyers say the legislation could be signed into law before year-end, providing a clear runway for further institutional adoption. Traditional finance isn‚Äôt standing still. J.P. Morgan‚Äôs blockchain unit Kinexys is piloting a permissioned USD deposit token‚ÄîJPMD‚Äîon Coinbase‚Äôs Layer-2 network Base. The project promises interest-bearing balances, real-time liquidity and 24-hour settlement for corporate treasuries, positioning bank-issued tokens as a ‚Äúsuperior alternative to stablecoins ‚Äù for some clients. Fragmented Chains and UX Hurdles Remain Despite eye-popping throughput, the stablecoin landscape is still fragmented across multiple blockchains. Enterprises must vet each network‚Äôs reliability, liquidity depth and counter-party risk‚Äîno trivial task for treasury teams used to a single clearing house. Hurwitz argues that the next wave of adoption will come from Layer-2 networks purpose-built for individual platforms, stitched together by seamless cross-chain bridges. However, not everyone is sold on the idea that privately issued tokens can serve as ‚Äúmoney.‚Äù In its 2025 Annual Economic Report, the Bank for International Settlements said stablecoins fail crucial tests of singleness, elasticity and integrity, likening them to 19th-century banknotes that sometimes traded at discounts. The BIS instead backs central-bank digital currencies and tokenized deposits as safer foundations for digital finance. Layer-2s and Interoperability Alchemy expects most financial-services firms to launch their own Layer-2 chains over the next five years, each monetizing niche ecosystems while relying on stablecoins for final settlement. If cross-chain interoperability matures as quickly as liquidity has, stablecoins could underpin a more connected, always-on financial web‚Äîone where swapping tokenized dollars for tokenized securities or real-world assets happens in a single click, anywhere on Earth. Crypto Cards Challenge Banks for the Checkout Crown in Europe In related news, data from CEX.IO and other payment providers show digital-asset cards closing the gap with ‚Äî and in key areas beating ‚Äî traditional banks at Europe‚Äôs point of sale. Europe‚Äôs long-running love affair with cash is fading fastest at the lower end of the purchase spectrum, and crypto cards are seizing the moment. According to a 2025 spend-pattern survey released by London-based exchange CEX.IO, 45 percent of all crypto-linked card transactions in the region are for less than ‚Ç¨10. That tiny-ticket share rivals the cozy hold cash once enjoyed at corner bakeries, newsstands and transit kiosks, and now outpaces the slice claimed by debit- and credit-card issuers backed by high-street banks. The report arrives as the number of newly issued CEX.IO cards jumped 15 percent year-to-date, hinting that Europeans are warming to the idea of spending stablecoins and mainstream crypto assets the same way they swipe or tap a bank card. Digital natives aren‚Äôt just tapping in caf√©s. They‚Äôre checking out online at a pace traditional cards have yet to match. While European Central Bank data show that 21 percent of all euro-area card payments are remote, CEX.IO‚Äôs customers conduct 40 percent of their transactions over the internet. The elevated e-commerce usage mirrors findings from rivals Oobit and Crypto.com, both of which have logged outsized crypto-card traffic at online retailers, airline sites and app stores. Where the Money Goes: Groceries, Dining and Daily Life Far from the crypto-luxury stereotype, most purchases are decidedly ordinary. The average crypto-card transaction clocks in at ‚Ç¨23.70, meaning users are reaching for digital assets to buy sandwiches and detergent more often than big-ticket electronics. By comparison, Mastercard pegs the average European bank-card purchase at ‚Ç¨33.60. Behind the scenes, stablecoins fund roughly 73 percent of purchases, confirming their rise as a low-volatility medium for everyday exchange. Yet holders still dip into more volatile assets: Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and Solana collectively account for a quarter of grocery, dining and transport payments in the dataset. The asset mix underscores consumers‚Äô willingness to spend, not just hoard, their crypto. Cryptocurrencies used for purchases (Source: CEX.IO) A Cashless Future, One Tap at a Time ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing in Europe is that crypto-card users aren‚Äôt just experimenting with new tech ‚Äî they‚Äôre forming the habits that will define a truly cashless future,‚Äù said Alexandr Kerya, vice-president of product management at CEX.IO. He noted that average monthly payment volume across the company‚Äôs cardholders rose 24 percent in May alone, even as price volatility remained muted. Crypto card spending distribution (Source: CEX.IO) Those habits are reinforced by a wave of new offerings. Kraken and Mastercard launched a co-branded debit card last year; meme-coin ecosystem Floki followed suit with a 13-asset card this spring. Fintechs have responded by deepening rewards programs and upping transaction limits, hoping to keep pace with a customer base that clearly values immediate settlement and blockchain transparency. Not everyone is cheering. UK banking giant Barclays announced it will block crypto purchases on Barclaycard credit lines starting next month, citing fears of unsustainable debt loads and the absence of investor protections. The lender warned customers that digital-asset transactions fall outside the safety net of the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The move signals a widening philosophical divide: fintechs lean on real-time blockchain settlement to reduce fraud and chargebacks, whereas legacy banks remain wary of an asset class still navigating regulatory scrutiny and sharp market swings. The Road to Parity ‚Äî and Beyond Three trends suggest crypto cards could soon match, or surpass, traditional bank cards across more spending categories: 1. Merchant Acceptance Large payment processors now route crypto authorization through the same EMV rails they use for fiat transactions, minimizing friction for shops and restaurants. 2. Regulatory Clarity The European Union‚Äôs Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework rolls out this year, creating a passportable license that card issuers can leverage continent-wide. 3. Stablecoin Maturity With tokenized euros and CBDC pilots advancing, volatility concerns around crypto payments may recede, opening the door for payroll deposits and utility billing. If those forces converge, crypto cards might not just rival bank plastics for micro-spending; they could become the default in a post-cash Europe‚Äîone tap, scan or click at a time.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-30 06:00:00

According to a Bloomberg report citing an unnamed Bank of Korea official, the central bank has suspended plans for the second phase of its CBDC pilot, which had been scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2025. Participating banks have reportedly been informed that discussions would be temporarily paused. Authorities are reevaluating the role of a CBDC as they are pivoting toward regulating private stablecoin issuers, the official noted. The Bank of Korea had been preparing to expand its CBDC testing under ‚ÄúProject Han River,‚Äù which began earlier this year with a consortium of seven banks. The second phase was expected to include features such as peer-to-peer transfers and merchant payments. However, banks reportedly raised concerns over high costs and the lack of a clear commercialization plan, prompting the central bank to reassess the project‚Äôs future. Instead, the central bank will continue to monitor progress on a legislative proposal that would establish a regulatory framework for Korean won-based stablecoins. The proposed legislation, introduced under the Digital Asset Basic Act , outlines licensing requirements for issuers and includes provisions for reserve management and user protection. You might also like: South Korean stocks ride crypto wave as new president backs won-based tokens The move aligns with President Lee Jae-myung‚Äôs broader agenda to accelerate stablecoin development . Since taking office earlier this month, Lee has prioritised the institutionalisation of KRW-backed digital tokens as a strategic financial initiative. His administration supports a licensing regime that would permit companies with as little as ‚Ç©500 million ($370,000) in equity capital to issue stablecoins, subject to regulatory approval. Democratic Party leaders have framed the rollout of won-denominated stablecoins as essential to preserving South Korea‚Äôs monetary sovereignty. Party lawmakers argue that local crypto markets are overly reliant on U.S. dollar-pegged assets like USDT and USDC, and warn that continued dominance by foreign stablecoins could undermine domestic financial policy. These stablecoins reportedly accounted for over ‚Ç©57 trillion ($42 billion) in trading volume during the first quarter of 2025. Min Byeong-deok, head of the Digital Asset Committee, has warned that without swift action, Korea may lag in the race for stablecoin leadership. He contends that the market for stablecoins could surpass even artificial intelligence or semiconductors and has called for regulatory measures to support issuance by compliant entities. Commercial banks have already responding to this policy shift. Eight of the country‚Äôs largest banks, including KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Woori, and Nonghyup, have launched a joint initiative to issue a KRW-pegged stablecoin.

Both have seen institutional interest, exchange integration, and community support over the years. But in 2025, they‚Äôre no longer delivering the sharp price movement they once did‚Äîand that‚Äôs shifting analyst attention elsewhere. One project catching that spotlight is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale altcoin that‚Äôs building traction while bigger names tread water. Solana and XRP Face Slower Roads Ahead For Solana, 2025 hasn‚Äôt brought the momentum many expected. Although the network remains fast and cost-effective, cracks are starting to show. DeFi activity is slipping, and user funds are flowing toward alternative Layer 1s offering newer incentives. While Solana still benefits from its speed and branding, the growth curve is flattening. Price projections have been scaled back, and new narratives around the token are scarce. XRP has managed to claw its way back into the conversation, thanks largely to regulatory progress and ETF speculation. But for all the optimism, its price remains constrained. XRP‚Äôs market cap now sits above $130 billion, and that sheer size makes explosive growth difficult. Analysts expect steady appreciation, not the kind of breakout rallies that defined its earlier years. The issue for both assets is simple: they‚Äôve matured. What once made them speculative rockets now makes them stable‚Äîbut less exciting‚Äîholds. In today‚Äôs market, where investors are actively rotating capital into faster-moving opportunities, being ‚Äúsafe‚Äù often translates to being overlooked. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Case for a Timely, High-Upside Bet That‚Äôs why analysts are now pointing toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. Still in its early stages, this project is drawing comparisons to coins like Solana and Dogecoin before their first major runs. Its presale has attracted thousands of participants, and the price is still below a cent‚Äîan entry point that gives retail investors room to move before major listings occur. The appeal is straightforward. MAGACOIN FINANCE has a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, a transparent smart contract audited by HashEx, and no vesting schedule or venture capital drag. That means early buyers won‚Äôt be undercut post-launch, a rare structure in today‚Äôs market. As listings approach, even modest demand could send the price sharply higher‚Äîa dynamic that just doesn‚Äôt exist anymore for top-tier coins. What‚Äôs especially important is timing. Crypto tends to reward projects that launch into the right market conditions. With capital moving away from large caps and toward smaller, narrative-driven plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned to benefit from that trend. Its growth has been fueled by a grassroots community‚Äînot institutional money‚Äîwhich gives it flexibility and viral potential. Of course, there‚Äôs risk. The project is new, and like all presales, it depends on execution. But for investors with an appetite for higher upside and early access, the structure and momentum behind MAGACOIN FINANCE have made it one of the most talked-about altcoin opportunities of the year. FINAL WORDS Solana and XRP may still deliver in the long run. They offer credibility and infrastructure. But when it comes to finding breakout returns in this cycle, more analysts are turning to projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äîwhere the window for exponential growth hasn‚Äôt closed yet.

Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis: ARB is currently changing hands at $0.3616, marking a notable u-turn from its 24-hour low of $0.3058 and brushing against an intraday high of $0.3891. On the 4-hour chart, the price has broken above the key resistance at $0.3332, now turned support, and is sustaining gains above the mid-Bollinger band at $0.3171. Bollinger Bands have expanded sharply, indicating rising volatility, while the price is currently hovering near the upper band. The RSI reading of 76.22 indicates overbought conditions, which may call for a minor pullback before another leg higher. However, the surge in volume suggests buyers are still firmly in control. Looking ahead, the immediate resistance lies at $0.420, followed by a stronger upper bar at $0.450, which aligns with a key supply zone visible on the chart. If bulls maintain momentum and breach these levels, ARB could confirm a short-term breakout trend. Conversely, a break below $0.3332 may expose the token to downside risk, making $0.325 a critical stop-loss level for traders. Holding some ARB, and curious about its long-term forecast?
