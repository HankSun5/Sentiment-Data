Prices touched $3,833 during the trading session before easing slightly, while spot levels held at $3,829, up by 1.9% and US futures for December closed at $3,855.20, a gain of 1.2%, according to data from CNBC. Meanwhile, the US dollar index plunged by 0.2%, making all gold priced in dollars cheaper for international buyers, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. The surge came as investors sought safety on expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, looming political gridlock in Washington, and renewed conflict overseas. David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures, said: “Safe-haven demand focused on the potential US government shutdown is one of the driving factors behind gold’s rally. The dollar is under some light pressure in response to that, certainly supporting the precious metals complex.” President Donald Trump met with senior congressional leaders on Monday to push for an extension of government funding. Without a deal, the United States would face a federal shutdown starting Wednesday. That standoff added fuel to gold’s run, which is already up more than 43% this year. Fed cuts and global conflicts drive momentum Friday’s release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index came in line with forecasts, reassuring markets that the Fed has space to ease policy. Traders are betting on cuts at the October and December meetings. Meger added: “The PCE data from last week was viewed as not standing in the way of an additional one or two Fed rate cuts. They continue to be a supportive factor for gold and silver.” Overseas, the war in Ukraine added to safe-haven flows as Russia’s defense ministry announced that its troops had taken control of the village of Shandryholove in the eastern Donetsk region, a sign of yet another escalation by president Vlad Putin. In the corporate arena, the world’s largest gold miner Newmont revealed that CEO Tom Palmer will retire at the end of the year after more than a decade at the company. Rival Barrick confirmed earlier in the day that its CEO Mark Bristow had also stepped down. Elsewhere, silver jumped 1.9% to $46.85, its strongest in over 14 years. Platinum advanced 1.5% to $1,592.65, a level last touched 12 years ago. Palladium was the outlier, slipping 1.1% to $1,255.61. AI stocks rebound as Wall Street steadies While gold grabbed headlines, U.S. equities also regained ground after a rough week. The S&P 500 added 0.26% to close at 6,661.21, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.48% to finish at 22,591.15. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched higher by 68.78 points, or 0.15%, ending at 46,316.07. That bounce came after the prior week marked the S&P’s weakest since August 1, the Nasdaq’s softest since early August, and the Dow’s first loss in three weeks. Tech stocks linked to the AI trade helped lift sentiment. Nvidia gained about 2% following concerns that its infrastructure projects with OpenAI might struggle with energy demands. Advanced Micro Devices added over 1%, while Micron Technology surged more than 4%. These showed investors were still betting on chips despite doubts about the pace of expansion. Away from tech, Electronic Arts soared 4.5% after confirming plans to go private in a $55 billion deal. That announcement added to a wave of corporate activity. Goldman Sachs calculated that U.S. mergers and acquisitions this year have already topped $1 trillion, up 29% compared to the same period last year. Despite last week’s stumble, the return of buyers on Monday steadied Wall Street. But the real spotlight stayed on gold, now locked in as the leading hedge against Washington’s budget fight, Fed policy, and a world on edge.

Dogecoin (DOGE), long a community favorite, continues to draw attention for its mainstream recognition and meme-driven momentum. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is turning out to be one of the next-gen DeFi platforms with future-proof lending and borrowing solutions that are above hype. Mutuum Finance is presently at stage 6 level of $0.035 in its presale. Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $16.52 million and onboarded more than 16,640 holders, demonstrating a positive sign regarding market sentiment. Mutuum Finance’s high potential for upside, in that it could outcompete regular meme coins by offering real utility and explosive expansion next year Dogecoin Struggles to Keep the Line as Bears Close in Dogecoin (DOGE) is facing a severe test this week, falling 17% to around $0.225 as vulnerability in the broader market drags Bitcoin beneath $110K and Ethereum beneath $4,000. The $0.20 level has now become a strong psychological support, with bulls fighting hard to hold it to avoid further decline. On the upper side, the $0.25 remains the first key resistance, and turning it around could be the key to a push towards $0.288. Technical indicators, however, show a cautious outlook: the RSI is at 34, pointing to intense selling pressure, and a bearish MACD signals bearish momentum. If $0.20 holds, the next big support is at $0.189, a price level that may decide DOGE’s near future fate. And with critical PCE figures imminent, the volatility would only be amplified. While DOGE investors await this make-or-break test, attention is already being focused on new Mutuum Finance which is alternatives with better fundamentals. Mutuum Finance Presale Numbers Show Strong Support Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has set a new presale record milestone at Stage 6 today. Tokens are valued at $0.035 today, up by 16.17% from the previous round. The investor interest continues to be high, with over 16,640 investors investing more than $16.52 million thus far. In line with its people-first philosophy, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway as an expression of gratitude to early backers. 10 users will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, and this is indicative of the project’s dedication to long-term value creation and building its network. Improved Security and Efficient Risk Management Security matters the most to Mutuum Finance. The company initiated a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program to motivate developers and security researchers toward bug discovery and reporting. The findings are graded on four stages of severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, to provide end-to-end protection against threats and platform security strategy. In effect, Mutuum Finance is an LTV protocol that is risk-adjusted. Every asset has a collateral limit properly calibrated based on the risk of the asset to yield a more secure and balanced lending platform. Additional safeguarding of users during times of volatile market conditions, the protocol has a buffer reserve mechanism wherein higher-risk assets have proportionally higher reserve values as additional collateral. Dynamic LTV rates and liquidation rates are calibrated against prevailing market conditions so that the protocol is extremely responsive and volatility-sensitive. Reserve multipliers from a range of as low as 10% on riskier classes to 35% on more conservative classes represent an additional level of systemic hedges. Efficiency is the other corner of Mutuum Finance’s paradigm. Assets are minimized to be kept as collateral in an attempt to be capable of utilizing utmost amounts of capital, and correlated assets of the same type are optimized for ultimate lending and borrowing efficiency. Altogether, these deals reduce the risk of insolvency, promote user confidence, and create a more stable and sustainable lending market. Mutuum’s Edge 2025 could see DOGE keep going off community-momentum of its own, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is turning out to be the superior growth wager. Its DeFi strategy, good security, and real utility make it stand out. Having raised $16.52 million and having over 16,640 investors already committed at $0.035, momentum is building rapidly.

Related Reading: XRP Gets A Retirement Twist: Expert Calls It A 401(k) The resolution of Ripple’s case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2025 cleared a long-standing obstacle, confirming that XRP is not a security in secondary transactions. This milestone has motivated major institutions to get involved. XRP ETF Launch and Institutional Catalysts Drive Rally The debut of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) marked a notable regulatory shift, with $37.7 million in first-day trading volume. BlackRock’s partnership with Ripple on its RLUSD stablecoin and Ripple’s application for Federal Reserve payment access through a national trust bank charter showcase the project’s growing institutional presence. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity network, which processed $1.3 trillion in Q2 2025, further strengthens XRP’s role in cross-border settlements. September’s rally saw XRP rise by 385%, stabilizing between $2.86 and $2.87 while whales accumulated tens of millions of tokens. With six more ETF applications pending approval in October and CME preparing to list XRP options on October 13, the token’s bullish catalysts remain strong. Analysts project medium- to long-term price targets ranging from $5 to $22, with some anticipating $30 or higher by 2026. XRP's price trends sideways on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Technical Outlook: Key Levels to Watch XRP remains above its $2.80 support level, even as volatility continues. Resistance is forming around $3.00, with a breakout likely to pave the way toward $3.40, $4.00, and ultimately $5. Surpassing the $5 mark could boost momentum toward $7. On the downside, immediate support is at $2.60, with further levels at $2.25 and $2.00. Technical indicators are still favorable, with the CCI (50) and Directional Movement Index indicating bullish signs. Traders are considering dip-buying around $2.60, with stop losses near $2.00 and profit targets between $4 and $5. Whale Influence and ETF Scrutiny Despite rising institutional confidence, concerns over concentrated XRP ownership persist. The recent Cyber Hornet ETF filing with the SEC flagged whale dominance as a potential risk, arguing that large holders retain the power to influence price movements disproportionately. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, XRP’s pre-minted supply structure increases liquidity concerns, making it more vulnerable to large transactions. Regulators worldwide have taken notice, with high-value transfers now under closer scrutiny.

The recovery comes as investors are growing ahead of the fourth quarter, supported by an $800 million jump in open interest and rising funding rates. The flagship cryptocurrency rallied on Sunday, rising over 2% to reclaim $112,000 and settle at $112,197. The price is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $113,805. Countries To Ramp Up Bitcoin (BTC) Purchases Jan3 founder Samson Mow believes countries are preparing to ramp up Bitcoin (BTC) adoption after initial skepticism. Mow stated, “I think we’re on the tail end of gradually, and we’re at the beginning phases of suddenly. These things happen very quickly.” Speaking on the What Bitcoin Did podcast, Samson stated that countries are warming up to the idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, adding, “It’s like literally gradually, then suddenly. I think it is simply a matter of time before we see a massive run-up, and we see a massive nation-state FOMO, you know, panic.” However, Mow emphasized that while President Donald Trump had signed an executive order for a Bitcoin reserve, the US had yet to begin buying. Bitcoin Whale Moves Funds After 12 Years A dormant Bitcoin wallet holding $44 million worth of BTC has moved the funds for the first time in 12 years, according to data from Lookonchain. Data shows the wallet transferred around 400 BTC in equal batches of 15, roughly emptying the wallet. While the transaction data does not show the source of the funds, Lookonchain stated that the wallet was funded by miners 15 years ago. The reason behind the transfers also remains unknown, as does the identity of the wallet owner. Satoshi-era Bitcoin wallets have seen a jump in activity as Bitcoin surges to new highs. Holders have been keen to liquidate their holdings and lock in their profits. Galaxy Digital executed one of the largest Bitcoin sales in history, completing a transaction of over 80,000 BTC , valued at more than $9 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has made a strong start to the week as it recovers from last week’s bloodbath. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a marginal decline on Saturday before rallying, rising over 2% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,197. BTC is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $114,086. Market analyst Jordi Visser stated that BTC’s path to new all-time highs will be littered with major corrections of 20% or more in Q4. Visser compared the flagship cryptocurrency to Nvidia, the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, and the first to reach a $4 trillion valuation, adding that BTC could behave similarly. “I just want to remind people that Nvidia is up over 1,000% since ChatGPT’s launch. During that time period, which is less than three years, you've had five corrections of 20% or more in Nvidia before it went back up to all-time highs. Bitcoin's going to do the same thing.” BTC’s strong recovery is supported by a surge in buying pressure that began on Sunday. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency has gained over 4% in the past two sessions, undoing the losses from Thursday’s decline. Farzam Ehsani, CEO and co-founder of VALR, stated, “Bitcoin’s Monday morning rise reflects a mix of macro relief, with a softer U.S. dollar and steadier rate expectations, alongside a cleaned-up leverage after recent liquidations and renewed accumulation from larger players.” According to most experts, last week’s losses were largely due to quarter-end rebalancing. Open interest for CME’s Bitcoin futures dropped almost $3 billion to $14.73 billion between September 18 and 25. Meanwhile, options fell to $4.63 billion. Spot Bitcoin ETFs also registered substantial outflows last week as part of the rebalancing. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.41% to $115,282 on Sunday. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 2% to $112,736. Sellers retained control on Tuesday with BTC falling 0.64% to a low of $111,502 before settling at $112,017. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 1% to reclaim $113,000 and settling at $113,348. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $109,681. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,197. Bullish sentiment has persisted during the ongoing session, with BTC up almost 2%, trading around $114,040. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Ethereum Price Predictions: What’s Got The Market So Bullish? This conviction follows a strong confluence of support, with the lower boundary of a 2-month brewing bull flag pattern aligning with a broader ascending channel at $3,800. The setup has created a launchpad, flipping to level from past resistance to support as momentum indicators turned bullish. The RSI has sharply recovered from the oversold threshold at 30, often marking a bottom as sellers exhaust and buyers step in. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram is approaching the signal line in a potential golden cross, suggesting this bounce could mark the start of a lasting uptrend. The $4,500 level stands as the key threshold for a bull flag breakout. If fully realised, the pattern targets a new all-time high at $5,560 and a retest of the broader ascending channel. With a breakout here too, the Ethereum price could extend towards $8,000 , representing nearly a 100% gain from current levels. With stacking catalysts like U.S. interest rate cuts and new staking ETH ETFs attracting inflows, this setup could be realised before year-end. A breakdown below $3,800, however, could set sights back on past accumulation zones. A 15% fall to $3,500 could be the next floor.

This on-chain move signals wallet activity but does not confirm a sale or transfer to an exchange. 400 Bitcoin moved after 12 years Arkham Intelligence on-chain data shows the address was dormant since November 2013. Bitcoin price context: ~ $720 in 2013 versus over $114,000 today (CoinGecko data). 400 Bitcoin moved: long-dormant wallet reactivated after 2013; learn implications and market context—read the full analysis from COINOTAG. What happened when a long-dormant address moved 400 Bitcoin? 400 Bitcoin were spent from an address that had been inactive since November 2013, according to Arkham Intelligence on-chain records. The transaction moved roughly $44 million worth of BTC and marks one of several high-profile reactivations of Satoshi-era-era wallets in 2025. Why did a 2013 Bitcoin wallet move after 12 years? Old addresses holding large balances often belong to early miners or long-term holders. In 2013 Bitcoin traded near $720 (CoinGecko), and miners could mine coins on desktop setups. Institutional custody practices and secondary-market trades can explain late movements, but a wallet reactivation alone does not prove intent to sell. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/400-bitcoin-wallet-reactivated-2013"" }, ""headline"": ""Long-dormant address moves 400 Bitcoin for first time since 2013"", ""description"": ""An address holding 400 Bitcoin moved after 12 years of dormancy; on-chain data and market context analyzed by COINOTAG."", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-09-29T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-09-29T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""articleBody"": ""An address that held 400 Bitcoin moved funds for the first time since November 2013. Arkham Intelligence on-chain records identify the transaction, which transferred roughly $44 million at current market prices. Reactivations of old wallets can reflect a range of activities from custodial reshuffles to sales, and should be interpreted in context with exchange flows and known institutional actions.""} How significant is a 400 BTC move for markets? Moves of several hundred Bitcoin can prompt trader attention because such reactivations historically preceded increased volatility. However, context matters: earlier in 2025 a 14-year holder sold 80,000 BTC in a single execution that involved institutional coordination. Market impact depends on whether coins go to exchanges or into cold storage. What on-chain signals help interpret this reactivation? Key signals include destination address type, exchange deposit patterns, and clustering analysis. Arkham Intelligence tracing can show whether outputs moved to custodial wallets or were split across multiple addresses—each pattern implies different intent. Frequently Asked Questions Did the wallet owner necessarily sell 400 Bitcoin? No. A transfer from a long-dormant address is a reactivation of funds but does not confirm a sale. Coins may be moved to new cold storage, multisig custody, or to exchanges—additional on-chain signals are required to infer selling. How does a wallet from 2013 likely originate? Addresses from that era commonly belong to early miners or initial adopters. Mining then required only desktop hardware; those coins often remained untouched for years until reactivation or estate transfers. Can this move drive Bitcoin price swings? Potentially—but not automatically. Price impact rises if large holdings are consolidated and transferred to exchanges.

The move follows the agency’s September 18 approval of generic listing standards, which streamline the process for bringing new cryptocurrency ETFs to market. SCOOP: The @SECGov has asked issuers of $LTC , $XRP , $SOL , $ADA , and $DOGE ETFs to withdraw their 19b-4 filings following the approval of the generic listing standards, which replace the need for those filings. Am told withdrawals could start happening as soon as this week. — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) September 29, 2025 The instruction does not represent a setback for issuers. Instead, it reflects a procedural shift that eliminates the need for case-by-case exchange rule changes for each token. Crypto ETF Market Expands Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum Under New Rules Under the new framework, exchanges such as Nasdaq, Cboe BZX, and NYSE Arca can list crypto ETFs under generic rules , provided the products meet predefined criteria. The SEC’s new generic ETF listing rule compresses approval timelines and shifts pressure onto issuers to meet operational demands quickly. #sec #etf https://t.co/F6kKt6gFMS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 25, 2025 Issuers now advance directly with S-1 registration statements, the last step before an ETF can launch. Withdrawals of the now-unnecessary 19b-4 filings are expected to begin this week, with several October deadlines approaching for existing applications. At least 16 proposals covering tokens beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum remain under SEC review. The shift is part of what regulators describe as a maturing framework for cryptocurrency financial products. The agency’s approval of generic standards was designed to provide a stable platform for digital asset ETFs while including exemptions that encourage on-chain capital market development. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the new framework reduces barriers while maintaining investor protection, noting that the rules support innovation without compromising oversight. For issuers including Grayscale, 21Shares, and VanEck, the change is important. Previously, each product required two separate approvals: one from the exchange via a 19b-4 filing and another from the asset manager through an S-1. The dual process often stretched nine months or more. With generic standards in place, timelines can shrink to as few as 75 days. The SEC has already applied the new framework in practice. On September 18, the regulator approved Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) , the first multi-crypto exchange-traded product to list under the streamlined system. The @SECGov has approved @Grayscale 's Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), marking the first multi-crypto ETP to hit the market. #SEC #Grayscale https://t.co/bKCqaHSrdA — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 18, 2025 GDLC offers exposure to Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, and currently manages over $915 million in assets. Its approval marked a turning point for multi-asset crypto products in the U.S. market. The change comes amid a flood of new filings. On September 17, issuers submitted at least five fresh ETF proposals , ranging from a Bitwise spot Avalanche ETF to Tuttle’s “Income Blast” funds covering Bonk, Litecoin, and Sui. ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci said the applications demonstrate how quickly the market is expanding beyond traditional Bitcoin and Ethereum products. SEC Faces Wave of Crypto ETF Deadlines as Solana, XRP Filings Near Key Dates More than 92 crypto ETF applications are now pending before the SEC. Deadlines for several of those filings fall in October and November. Franklin Templeton’s Solana and XRP ETF applications face a November 14 decision after the SEC used its maximum 60-day extension authority earlier this month. SEC postpones Franklin Solana ETF ruling by 60 days to November 14 as 92 crypto ETF applications await review despite 99% approval odds. #Solana #ETF https://t.co/GIIlmQmsgt — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 11, 2025 BlackRock’s amendment to add staking to its iShares Ethereum Trust is now due October 30. Grayscale’s Hedera Trust decision is scheduled for November 12, while proposals tied to Dogecoin, Litecoin, and other altcoins are scattered across the same timeframe. Bloomberg analysts project over a 95% chance of approval for Solana and XRP ETFs before year-end, despite repeated extensions. Prediction markets reflect similar optimism, with Polymarket odds on a Solana ETF approval currently at 99% . Analysts argue that the new standards make the timeline less dependent on formal deadlines, since the SEC can approve S-1 filings at any time if products meet eligibility requirements. The SEC is also coordinating with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on broader digital asset regulation. A joint roundtable is planned to align approaches across agencies as part of Chair Atkins’ “Project Crypto” initiative , launched in July to modernize securities rules for the digital era. For investors and issuers, the withdrawal of 19b-4 filings shows how the regulatory environment is shifting from case-by-case hurdles to standardized procedures. While many products still await review, the procedural streamlining shows faster paths to market for a wide range of cryptocurrency ETFs.

If Congress doesn’t agree on a funding deal by midnight Tuesday, large parts of the federal government will stop running. The shutdown would freeze economic reports, delay key data, and make life harder for anyone trying to predict what the Federal Reserve will do next with interest rates. That uncertainty would rattle Bitcoin and the wider crypto market. Traders are especially focused on the jobs report. It’s supposed to drop this Friday, but if there’s no funding, it won’t. That’s a problem, because employment data directly affects the Fed’s interest rate decisions, and Bitcoin traders rely on that information to know where the market’s going. Without it, some will hesitate, others will panic, and volatility could jump fast. Shutdown delays data, feeds Bitcoin swings This shutdown wouldn’t hit everything, but it would stall agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and releases economic data, as Cryptopolitan has reported . If the payroll report doesn’t come out, it won’t just delay numbers—it’ll shake confidence across financial markets. Analysts from Bitunix warned that this kind of delay “heightens fragility,” saying a mix of rate-cut hopes, political drama, and market fear could lead to “sharp drop-and-rebound swings” for Bitcoin and other risk assets. Deutsche Bank’s John Reid said the jobs report could be the first real casualty. “This week’s big event might not actually happen,” he said. “Back in October 2013, the shutdown meant we didn’t get the September jobs report until the 22nd of the month.” So, traders could be staring at a data blackout that lasts for weeks, just when they need clarity. That kind of delay can trigger wild price movements. Nansen’s Nicolai Sondergaard said a shutdown “could spike short-term volatility” in crypto. But he added , “I do wonder if it will be more than that, if investors at large assume the ‘shutdown’ will be resolved quickly.” He also said it’s possible the broader financial markets feel the hit before anything happens at all. As of now, Bitcoin is trading over $114,000, up 3.8% in the past 24 hours. But it’s still down 0.7% compared to two weeks ago, according to CoinGecko. That tells you where the mood is: slightly up, but uncertain as hell. Shutdowns have hit Bitcoin both ways This wouldn’t be Bitcoin’s first shutdown. In 2013, a 16-day closure sent the coin up 14%—from $132.04 to $151.34. But during the record-long 35-day shutdown between December 2018 and January 2019, Bitcoin dropped 6%, going from $3,802.22 to $3,575.85. The difference? In 2013, the market was in a strong bull run. In 2018, it was bleeding. Julio Moreno from Cryptoquant explained: “The demand for Bitcoin was growing strongly as it entered the final stage of the bull cycle [in 2013].” In contrast, by late 2018, “demand for BTC was contracting during a bear market.” Now, he says, things look more like 2013. “Bitcoin demand is growing, as we enter Q4, which is typically a positive season in terms of price performance.” Still, nothing is guaranteed. On the prediction market Myriad, run by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan, users are losing faith in future rate cuts. The percentage of people who doubt the Fed will deliver two cuts in 2025 jumped from 40% to 75% just this month. Some expect cuts at the Fed’s last two meetings of the year. Others think no cuts will happen until 2026. Get seen where it counts.

Assembly Bill 471, introduced by Republican members of the Wisconsin Assembly and referred to the Committee on Financial Institutions, aims to shield some digital asset activities from money transmitter licensing requirements. If successful, the bill would make it easier to accept crypto payments, build blockchain software, run mining rigs, or even stake tokens, without having to secure a state license. Wisconsin Republicans propose protections The bill exempts a range of cryptocurrency-related activities, such as mining, staking, and digital asset-for-digital asset exchanges where no conversion to legal tender occurs, from licensing requirements. In addition, the legislation introduces a securities exemption for third-party providers offering technical staking services, so long as any rewards distributed are strictly those generated by the blockchain network itself. This measure is expected to make Wisconsin a more attractive jurisdiction for crypto entrepreneurs in a country that has taken a pro-crypto stance since the return of President Donald Trump to the White House. The regulatory landscape is divided The push for AB471 comes as Wisconsin lawmakers remain split on how to handle crypto-related issues. While Republican lawmakers are more pro-crypto and champions of advancing proposals that increase penetration and crypto-activities in the state, Democrats have taken a more defensive approach. Democrats in the state legislature have filed bills seeking stricter oversight of cryptocurrency kiosks , citing their role in facilitating scams targeting elderly residents. A bill filed in July in the Assembly by state House Democrats wants to mandate all virtual currency kiosks operating in the state to have a Division of Banking license. It also wants to mandate the kiosks to project fraud alert warnings and the performance of full KYC by kiosk operators. In addition, the bill caps daily transactions per customer at $1,000. The bill was filed in the state senate by Democrats in August and has been referred to the Committee on Financial Institutions and Sporting Heritage. The two approaches by the state’s legislators highlight the tension between promoting innovation and addressing consumer protection risks. Critics, however, warn that these exemptions could open the door to abuses and complicate coordination with federal regulators such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Wisconsin is not the first state to pursue crypto-friendly legislation, but the breadth of its proposed exemptions sets it apart. States such as Wyoming and Texas have passed laws providing clarity for digital asset custody, mining, and token issuance, with many states having crypto-related bills waiting to move to the next level. If AB471 passes, Wisconsin could position itself alongside Wyoming as one of the most permissive environments for Bitcoin businesses in the US. Market participants say that could attract firms engaged in staking, node operation, and software development.

The letter urged the agency to investigate Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software for its reported failures to properly detect and respond to railroad crossings. There is a growing number of reported near-collisions The Full Self-Driving system Tesla boasts allows a vehicle to drive occupants “almost anywhere,” and they don’t have to do anything; it handles everything from route navigation to lane changes, steering and parking. However, it still requires the supervision of a human driver. Democratic Senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal, in their letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, want a probe, citing the growing number of these reported near-collisions. “Although mistakes such as a missed traffic sign or an illegal lane change are dangerous, a miscalculation at a train crossing can lead to catastrophic, multi-fatality collisions involving vehicle occupants, train passengers, and rail workers,” the letter reads. The NHTSA has launched an investigation into Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system since October 2024 after four reported collisions occurred in reduced roadway visibility conditions like sun glare, fog or airborne dust. The two senators now want the NHTSA to consider imposing limitations on Tesla’s use of the system. “The agency should consider clear and obvious actions to protect the public, including restricting Tesla’s FSD to the road and weather conditions it was designed to operate in,” they said. Tesla’s FSD shows promise in some real-world applications The letter from the senators is turning up amid a broader scrutiny of Tesla’s autonomous driving tech. Aside from the probe the NHTSA launched in October 2024, in January 2025, the agency started investigating 2.6 million Teslas over crashes linked to a remote vehicle-movement feature. The NHTSA is also looking into Tesla’s deployment of self-driving robotaxis in Austin, Texas, which launched in June. It has avoided making hasty conclusions, and according to a July 1 email, the agency claimed to still be reviewing the deployment and demanded to know if Tesla employees would be able to remotely operate the vehicles. Recent shortcomings with the FSD have become ammo for critics like Dan O’Dowd, CEO of Green Hills Software and founder of The Dawn Project, a group that has been campaigning to ban Tesla FSD. In a September 20, 2025 X post, Dan shared a video of a Tesla on FSD moving towards an active railroad crossing. Even though there were flashing red lights, the vehicle kept going without stopping, and the whole time, the driver’s feet were positioned away from the pedals to demonstrate hands-off operation. O’Dowd has predicted the flaw “is going to kill somebody” and has accused supporters of ignoring the piling evidence. In the video he shared, the car could be seen steadily advancing toward and crossing the tracks despite the visible warnings, aligning with the senators’ concerns about detection failures. However, some defenders of Tesla have said this flaw is not enough to outrightly dismiss the FSD technology, instead of encouraging its evolution. Some have been sharing positive experiences with the FSD as well. However, the railroad detection issue and increasing number of near-collisions are real issues that could ultimately lead to regulatory bumps if Tesla cannot convince the NHTSA and its users that the tech is safe.

Bitcoin appears ready to surpass its historic high of $124,128, set back in August, although it has remained a consistent challenge over what has been a bearish September. On the regulatory side, the US crypto industry is expecting long-awaited clarity. President Trump signed the GENIUS Act earlier this summer, the nation’s first law mandating full-reserve backing for stablecoins. Around the same time, the SEC introduced Project Crypto, an initiative designed to align securities regulations with blockchain-based assets. Together, these policy shifts could provide the backdrop for the next major altcoin run. According to ChatGPT’s forecasts, XRP, Solana, and Pi Network could rank among the most significant winners in the months ahead. XRP (Ripple): ChatGPT Predicts $20 Potential, A 7× Jump ChatGPT suggests that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could rally to $20 by late 2025, roughly seven times its current level of $2.86. The token has already enjoyed a breakout year, breaking past its 2018 record of $3.40 before hitting $3.65 on July 18, followed by a 22% correction down to current levels. XRP’s global relevance continues to expand, highlighted by its 2024 recognition from the UN Capital Development Fund as a practical solution for low-cost cross-border transfers in emerging markets. Ripple also closed its long-running dispute with the SEC earlier this year, after the agency dropped its case, reinforcing the pivotal 2023 ruling that XRP’s retail sales were not securities. That decision remains a landmark win for the entire altcoin ecosystem. ChatGPT projects XRP will likely trade in the $5–$10 range heading into 2026, with upside toward $20 if the Trump administration delivers on anticipated crypto legislation. In addition, several high-profile spot XRP ETF applications are expected to receive approval by mid-October, potentially unlocking significant institutional inflows. Technicals also back the case for growth. XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) hovers around 46, giving it plenty more room for [roce growth in the near-term, while bullish chart structures, like the appearance of three bullish flag formations across its support and resistance lines this year, suggest a breakout may be brewing. XRP could revisit $4 by October, building on its 354% gain over the past 12 months, which ultimately proved more profitable than Bitcoin’s 71% and Ethereum’s 56% returns. Solana (SOL): ETF Speculation and Ecosystem Growth Could Drive a $600 Run Solana ($SOL) has solidified its place as a leading smart contract network, supported by a $112.8 billion market cap and $11.27 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) across its DeFi ecosystem. Institutional adoption and developer activity remain strong. Speculation around a potential U.S. spot Solana ETF is growing, raising expectations of inflows similar to those seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Adding fuel to the narrative, Trump has floated the possibility of Solana being included in a future U.S. Bitcoin reserve, though under his proposal, the government would acquire tokens only through asset seizures, not open-market purchases, unlike Bitcoin. From a price perspective, Solana hit $250 in January, dropped to $100 by April, and has recovered to $207. Last week, it hovered around $220 more than once, nearly testing this year’s highs. After breaking out of a descending wedge, ChatGPT predicts a path to $600 by year’s end, double its former record of $293.31. Achieving that would likely require favorable regulatory moves and ETF approvals. Pi Network ($PI): ChatGPT Predicts Aggressive Growth From Tap-to-Mine Model Pi Network ($PI) is famous for pioneering the mobile-based “tap-to-mine” system, allowing users to earn tokens simply by logging into the app daily and tapping. Currently priced near $0.2655, ChatGPT outlines a best-case scenario where the coin could skyrocket to $3 by year’s end, a tidy increase of more than 11x. Given the team’s hands-on development of the network, some upcoming milestones may provide justification for bullish expectations. The developers have been steadily rolling out new upgrades in recent weeks, passing from version 19 towards version 23 and a potential mainnet launch after, both of which could inject fresh momentum. Since its February 2025 debut, Pi Network has displayed extreme volatility, including a 171% rally in May. Its RSI now sits at just 29, reflecting deep undervaluation and potential for a rebound. Seeing a return to February’s $2.99 peak is a reasonable, though ambitious, target. Even if the ultra-bullish case doesn’t unfold, October’s historic seasonality in crypto could support prices climbing up towards the dollar by November. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A New Canine Meme Coin is Coming For DOGE through Degen Community Building Fun For investors hunting higher-risk bets outside ChatGPT’s top calls, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presents itself as Dogecoin’s “degen cousin,” leaning into people’s love of high-volatility plays and degen meme culture as its core narrative. While Dogecoin has evolved into a mainstream digital asset, Maxi Doge fully embraces its speculative image. Its presale has already raised more than $2.6 million within the first month. Launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI is pushing hardcore grassroots community growth through viral channels like Telegram and Discord, as well as trading competitions and collaborations with other projects. Of the 150.24 billion tokens minted, about 25% are reserved for the “Maxi Fund,” a pool dedicated to marketing and partnerships. Staking is live during the presale, currently offering yields of 129% APY, though these rewards shrink as participation grows. The current presale price sits at $0.0002595, with incremental increases set for each subsequent funding round. Investors can join via the official Maxi Doge site using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Bitcoin remains about 10% down from its all-time high (ATH) of $124,128, set last month. At the same time, its dominance is falling, and investor enthusiasm has spilled over into leading altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have reached fresh milestones over the past year. Much of this renewed momentum can be traced back to two landmark policy changes in Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the country’s first comprehensive stablecoin regulatory bill. Soon after, the SEC unveiled Project Crypto, an initiative designed to update securities laws for the digital asset age. With sentiment improving, attention has turned to major altcoins such as XRP, Pepe, and Dogecoin, which are being watched as some of the most attractive dip-buying opportunities ahead of a potential bull cycle. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payments Leader and 2025’s Best Crypto Altcoin Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) spiked to a record $3.65 on July 18, coinciding with the GENIUS Act’s passage, surpassing its previous 2018 peak of $3.40. It has since corrected to around $2.86, about 22% below the recent high. XRP’s appeal lies in its role as a cost-efficient solution for international remittances, positioning it as a modern alternative to legacy systems such as SWIFT. Its reputation has been reinforced by endorsements from the UN Capital Development Fund and recognition within the U.S. financial community. Ripple’s regulatory clout was also evident earlier this year when CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined a White House panel on crypto policy. The launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, shows its ambition to capture a slice of the fast-growing stablecoin sector. Momentum accelerated after a decisive 2023 court ruling determined XRP’s retail transactions were not securities, marking a watershed moment in Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC. In the past 12 months, XRP has soared 354%, essentially quintupling Bitcoin’s 70% gains over the same period. Following July’s surge, XRP found support near $3 before seasonal weakness in September pulled it below that level. At present, its RSI sits near 42 and appears to be trending lower, offering further discounting potential. While interest rate cuts and the approval of the first spot XRP ETF didn’t spark an immediate rally, likely because markets had priced them in, upcoming ETF rulings in October could push XRP past the $4 threshold in short order. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Meme Coin Pioneer’s Push Toward $1 Created in 2013 as a lighthearted joke, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into the most widely recognized meme coin, backed by a loyal community and currently valued at $34.8 billion in market cap. The token broke into the mainstream in 2021, boosted by high-profile supporters including Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons. This May, institutional speculation around a possible U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF drove DOGE back above $0.25. It now trades at roughly $0.2307, up 2% overnight in line with the broader market rally. The $74.6 billion meme sector, represented by Dogecoin, has only risen a modest 0.4%, while it has kept pace with more established names like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. It appears investors are flipping to a risk-on outlook, but not quite risk-embracing enough to go for smaller market cap meme coins. DOGE’s RSI stands near 44, hinting at plenty of headroom for further price rises over the week. Additionally, October is historically a bullish month for crypto, which could fuel significant upside. With Tesla accepting DOGE for select payments and major platforms like PayPal and Revolut expanding integration, Dogecoin’s real-world use cases continue to grow. Should momentum hold, DOGE could test $0.50 by mid-October, with the much-discussed $1 milestone still on the horizon. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): The Best Meme Coin for Utility Among Blue Chip Crypto Projects Launched in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has risen to become the second-largest meme coin, carrying a market cap of almost $7 billion. In the last 24 hours, SHIB gained 1.4%, which means that, like its inspiration, Dogecoin, it outperformed the broader meme coin sector. SHIB’s relative resilience, large market cap, and expanding functionality make it trade more like a blue-chip digital asset than a speculative meme coin. It currently trades at around $0.00001179. Technically, SHIB has formed two bullish setups in the past year: a descending wedge (November–March) and a flag pattern since May. Breaking resistance at $0.000022 could open a path toward $0.00003 by late October, with more aggressive targets between $0.00006 and $0.00009 possible if a strong bull run develops. Unlike many meme tokens, SHIB has meaningful applications. These include Shibarium, an Ethereum-based Layer-2 solution designed to cut fees and speed up transactions, as well as privacy-enhancing tools aimed at broadening adoption. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Layer-2 Presale Reaching for 2025 Growth Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as one of 2025’s most promising presales, aiming to combine Bitcoin’s security with the scalability of Layer-2 technology while leveraging meme-driven virality and decentralized governance. The project seeks to expand Bitcoin’s utility by enabling faster payments, smart contract functionality, and community-led decision-making. So far, the presale has raised over $18.8 million, with analysts predicting post-launch upside of 10× or more. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers low-cost smart contracts and features a Canonical Bridge that enables near-instant Bitcoin transfers while also supporting dApps, meme tokens, and payment solutions. A recent Coinsult audit found no vulnerabilities, further boosting confidence. The HYPER token underpins the ecosystem through staking, transaction fees, and governance rights. Early participants can earn up to 63% APY through staking and receive voting power once governance goes live.

52448202,591831,1759185015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52448202.jpeg,Not A Fan Of Ethereum? ARK Invest’s CEO Cathie Wood Reveals Favorite Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/not-a-fan-of-ethereum/,"Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, has built a reputation as one of the most outspoken advocates of the crypto industry. In recent remarks, she made it clear that while she sees value in Ethereum’s ecosystem, her conviction lies most strongly with Bitcoin. Her stance is rooted not only in her most recent statements, but in a consistent narrative she’s developed over the years. Bitcoin Is The Pure Cryptocurrency While speaking on The Master Investor podcast hosted by Wilfred Frost on YouTube, Cathie Wood reiterated her belief that Bitcoin is the pure cryptocurrency and described it as the global quantity rules-based monetary system. She noted that Bitcoin’s Layer-1 blockchain has never been hacked, and this sets it apart from other networks. She also expressed concern that Ethereum may lose dominance as Layer-2 solutions capture more activity and fees. “In fact, Bitcoin owns the cryptocurrency space when it comes to pure crypto,” she said. “We think it’s going to be the biggest one by far,” she continued. Despite her preference for Bitcoin, Wood has softened somewhat toward Ethereum in certain respects. She acknowledged Ethereum’s importance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and said it plays a very important role in the ecosystem. However, this importance could be undermined by other Layer-2 networks like Coinbase’s Base, which are going to be competing with one another. Earlier Statements And Views On Crypto Assets More recently, Cathie Wood praised Ethereum’s shift toward zero-knowledge proof (ZK) scaling techniques, even if she admitted she doesn’t fully grasp all the technical details. “I can’t say I understand all of the details, but the Ethereum Foundation does seem to be proposing the right moves for scalability and privacy,” she said on the social media platform X. At the same time, the Ark Invest CEO also noted some new protocols and on-chain derivatives platforms like Uniswap as ones to watch. She compared Hyperliquid to Solana’s early days and noted that it has promising potential. Still, she has been clear that not every cryptocurrency earns her confidence. Wood has stated openly that she is not a believer in the vast majority of tokens circulating in the market. Instead, her conviction rests on a few core assets that she believes will dominate in the long term. In her view, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana stand apart as the big three. “Those are the big three right now,” she said. She acknowledged the importance of stablecoins but also noted that they do not belong in the same category as these leading cryptocurrencies. Ark Invest, through its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), owns 43,799 BTC worth $4.91 billion. Cathie Wood has made strong, repeated predictions for Bitcoin’s future value. Back in May, she reaffirmed her belief that Bitcoin could trade as high as $1.5 million by 2030. The company also maintains exposure to Ethereum, including positions connected to Bitmine Immersion, whose recent Ethereum acquisition spree has made it the biggest Ethereum treasury firm in the world.",Ethereum|ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF|ARKB|Base|bitcoin|Bitmine Immersion|cathie wood|coinbase|decentralized finance|DeFi|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum ecosystem|Ethereum foundation|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum treasury|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Hyperliquid|solana|The Master Investor Podcast|Wilfred Frost|Youtube|Zero-Knowledge Proof|ZK,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|SOL|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-29 22:30:15

XRP and Cardano are up by at least 3% in the past 24 hours, while Plasma, which has almost doubled since launching a few days ago, remains in a very bullish position, despite dropping by 10% today. We examine these three coins in this article, considering their technicals and their fundamentals, and providing a forecast of where they could be in the near and more distant term. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Altcoin Eyes Climb Above $5 As ETF Approvals Get Closer XRP has risen by 3.4% in the past 24 hours, with its current price of $2.87 representing a 2% increase in a week and a 1.5% rise in the past month. What this means is that XRP has begun to recover after a period of falls, with the fourth quarter likely to bring some substantial gains. This prediction comes from two places, with the first being that the coin’s indicators remain in an oversold position, predicting an imminent rebound. In fact, we see XRP’s relative strength index (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) beginning to bounce up from low levels, implying that a significant rebound may have begun. Source: TradingView On top of this, XRP’s fundamentals are possibly the best of any coin in the market, save for Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum and Solana. For one, there are upwards of 10 XRP ETF applications awaiting a decision from the SEC, and analysts give a very high probability of approval . An influx of institutional money into XRP ETFs will send the coin’s price flying, while XRP is also likely to attract greater use and adoption as Ripple continues to grow its business . This all makes for a hugely promising crypto price prediction, with XRP likely to cross $3 in the next couple of weeks, while it also has a good chance of climbing above $5 before 2025 is done. Crypto Price Prediction: Plasma ($XPL) – New Tether-Linked Stablecoin Token Set to Rally Again XPL is the native token of Plasma, a layer-one network designed specifically for stablecoins. Launched by Tether’s sister firm Bitfinex, Plasma already has a total value locked in of $5.5 billion , while it had previously raised in excess of $370 million from investors . This put XPL in a prime position to grow, with the coin up by 80% in relation to its lowest recorded price on CoinGecko ($0.7218). It has corrected by 13% in the past 24 hours, yet its chart shows that it’s positioning nicely for a rebound in the near term. Source: TradingView Its RSI and MACD have both dropped into oversold territory and are close to bottoming, which should mean that the XPL price recovers quickly. It could retest its ATH of $1.68 in the next few weeks, while additional Plasma growth could see it reach $3 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA)—ETF Approval and L1 Growth Will Push Alt to New Highs At $0.7946, ADA is up by 3% in 24 hours, although it remains down by 7% in a fortnight and by 5% in a month. It does, however, boast a 100% increase in the past year, putting it in a good position to make further gains as we get closer to 2026. As with XRP, ADA is waiting for a boost from ETF approvals, and while it has only 1 ETF application to its name, the fact that it’s from Grayscale gives it a strong chance of approval. And for a coin that doesn’t receive too much institutional attention, this ETF could make a big difference. If we look at its chart today, we see that its indicators continue to sit in an oversold range, having struggled to remain above 50 since the end of July. Source: TradingView This would suggest that Cardano is close to rebounding, and there is some indication that whales have been accumulating the token in recent days . When combined with Cardano’s status as one of the major and biggest layer-one networks , such indicators would suggest that the end of the year could be very kind to ADA’s price. It’s likely to regain $1 by the end of October, while an end-of-year bull rally could see it top its ATH of $3.09 and even make it beyond $4. PEPENODE Raises $1.5 Million in Ongoing Presale: Why This Mine-to-Earn Token Could Surge The three tokens above all look extremely promising right now, but if the market does enjoy an end-of-year bull rally, then investors may want to diversify into newer, small-cap tokens as well. This is because such tokens can outperform the market average by considerable margins, particularly if they go viral and gain some big exchange listings. This kind of thing can also happen with presale coins, which can surge when they list for the first time, especially if they’ve had a big sale. One coin enjoying a popular sale at the moment is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 mine-to-earn token that has been attracting lots of attention recently. Are you ready to build your own virtual meme coin mining rig? ◉ Buy Meme Nodes ◉ Upgrade Facilities ◉ Earn meme Coins All on PEPENODE. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/xNoWz5H2Ox — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 28, 2025 It has now raised $1.5 million in its presale, which it opened only a few weeks ago, providing a clear sign of its future potential. PEPENODE has been attracting investment because of its unique value proposition, with the coin boasting an original mine-to-earn system. It invites PEPENODE holders to spend their tokens in order to develop virtual mining rigs, with PEPENODE itself usable to add more nodes to a rig. And the more nodes a user has, the more rewards they will earn, with payouts in popular meme tokens such as FARTCOIN and Pepe. Holders will also be able to stake PEPENODE, with the coin currently offering yields in excess of 800%. This all makes PEPENODE a very bullish prospect, with investors able to join its sale by visiting the PEPENODE website . The coin is currently available at $0.0010788, although this price will rise periodically for the duration of the sale.

A sustained ETH rally would likely re-rate BitMine’s equity given its crypto-heavy treasury and ongoing share buybacks. BitMine holds 2.65M+ ETH, valued at more than $11 billion — above its ~$9–9.2B market cap. Ethereum’s bullish flag pattern and support near $4,100 point to a potential move toward $5,000. BitMine’s share repurchases and treasury accumulation amplify upside if ETH rises; risk remains in market liquidity and demand. BitMine stock: analysis of Ethereum breakout potential and investor implications. Read the data-driven outlook and next steps for shareholders. What is driving BitMine stock’s potential rise? BitMine stock is primarily driven by its large Ethereum treasury and market exposure to ETH price moves. The company holds over 2.65 million ETH, creating a strong balance-sheet lever should Ethereum break to higher levels, while concurrent buybacks reduce outstanding shares and can lift per-share value. How could an Ethereum breakout to $5,000 affect BitMine? If Ethereum reaches $5,000, BitMine’s ETH holdings would be worth roughly $13.25 billion at current reported holdings. That valuation would materially exceed BitMine’s current market capitalization (~$9–9.2B), likely prompting a significant re-rating of the stock if realized and reflected in investor expectations. BitMine’s stock could rise significantly as Ethereum nears a strong breakout. The company holds over $11 billion in crypto assets. BitMine holds over $11 billion in Ethereum, significantly exceeding its $9 billion market cap. Ethereum’s bullish flag pattern suggests the cryptocurrency could break toward $5,000 in the near future. BitMine’s ongoing stock repurchases may enhance shareholder value amid a rising Ethereum price. BitMine (BMNR) stock shows signs of a potential bullish move driven by the company’s concentrated exposure to Ethereum (ETH). Management disclosures indicate a substantial ETH treasury that creates direct sensitivity to Ethereum price action. BitMine’s reported treasury includes more than 2.65 million ETH. At recent prices this was estimated at over $11 billion, which notably exceeds the company’s market capitalization near $9–9.2 billion. BitMine chairman Tom Lee has publicly expressed optimism on Ethereum’s structural role in finance and AI-driven decentralised applications, noting long-term value drivers. Why are Ethereum technicals pointing bullish? Ethereum has held above its 50-day moving average and key support near $4,106, forming a bullish flag continuation pattern. This setup typically signals a consolidation before continuation toward prior highs, with $4,950 and the $5,000 psychological level the next notable targets. Source: TradingView A successful breakout would translate to a higher mark-to-market for BitMine’s ETH holdings. Coupled with ongoing share repurchases, fewer outstanding shares could magnify per-share gains for holders. However, investors should weigh risks including ETH volatility, regulatory changes, and demand dynamics for miner/treasury stocks. How should investors evaluate BitMine’s risk and reward? Assess BitMine by separating intrinsic business operations from treasury exposure. The upside is large if ETH appreciates; downside is meaningful if ETH falls or illiquidity limits realizing treasury value. Monitor on-chain ETH metrics, TradingView technicals, and BitMine’s disclosed buyback cadence for signal confirmation. Frequently Asked Questions How many ETH does BitMine hold? BitMine holds over 2.65 million ETH, which recent estimates value at more than $11 billion based on prevailing market prices. Will BitMine’s buybacks affect shareholder value? Share repurchases reduce outstanding shares and can increase earnings per share and equity value, especially when combined with rising asset values like ETH. Key Takeaways Balance-sheet leverage : BitMine’s large ETH treasury creates asymmetric upside if Ethereum rises. Technical catalyst : Ethereum’s bullish flag and support levels point to a potential move toward $5,000. Risk management : Investors should track buybacks, on-chain ETH data, and market liquidity when sizing positions. Conclusion BitMine’s concentrated Ethereum holdings position the company to benefit materially from an ETH breakout. Investors should combine technical signals on Ethereum with BitMine’s buyback activity and treasury disclosures to form a data-driven view. For shareholders, the next weeks of price action in ETH will be a key determinant of BitMine stock performance. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How many ETH does BitMine hold?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""BitMine holds over 2.65 million ETH, which recent estimates place at more than $11 billion at current market prices."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Could Ethereum rising to $5,000 boost BitMine stock?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

After four years leading New York’s Department of Financial Services, the most powerful crypto regulator in the United States is leaving office this October. Her exit, confirmed Monday by Governor Kathy Hochul, brings an end to a tenure defined by crypto enforcement, consumer protection policies, and major restructuring of a state agency that went from background player to headline-grabbing powerhouse. According to a press release issued by Hochul’s office, Adrienne will be replaced by Kaitlin Asrow, who will take over as Acting Superintendent on October 18. Adrienne, a former Obama administration official, had been appointed by Hochul back in August 2021. Since then, she pushed DFS into the middle of national debates over financial supervision. “It has been a privilege and an honor to serve New Yorkers,” Adrienne said in her official exit statement, thanking both the governor and her team for helping make DFS “a more equitable, transparent, and resilient financial system.” Adrienne Harris oversaw crypto enforcement and financial reforms During Adrienne’s four-year run, DFS recovered over $725 million in restitution for New Yorkers. She became the first person from New York to join the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council. Under her, DFS reworked how check cashing fees are calculated, a move that saved New Yorkers over $22 million. She led efforts to require insurance companies to cover insulin without co-pays. She enforced guardrails around how AI is used in insurance pricing, particularly making sure underwriting wasn’t secretly discriminating against consumers. She also gave final approval to rules that gave DFS power over Pharmacy Benefit Managers, and her team began examining those businesses for the first time. Kaitlin, who has served as Executive Deputy Superintendent of DFS’s Research & Innovation Division since 2021, is now set to take the reins. Her background includes time at the Federal Reserve , where she served as a Senior Policy Advisor for both the Bank of San Francisco and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. At the Fed, she helped coordinate innovation policy between all twelve district banks and across the FDIC and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Before that, Kaitlin worked at the Financial Health Network, a think tank focused on consumer financial health. She holds a Bachelor of Arts from Stanford University and a Master of Public Policy from the University of Chicago. Inside DFS, she’s best known for building out the department’s crypto oversight program and pushing forward policies related to financial inclusion and technological modernization. The New York governor said Kaitlin was the right choice to continue the Department’s work, adding, “Kaitlin is well suited to lead the Department into the future.” Asrow’s promotion puts the crypto-heavy Research & Innovation Division right at the top of New York’s financial regulatory structure.

XRP commentator Chad Steingraber, in a post on social media platform X, argued that the amount of the altcoin actually available for retail trading is going to be a fraction of its total supply. His comments came in response to discussions about the role of institutional and network-led lockups, with projects such as Axelar and Flare Networks working to secure billions of XRP tokens. XRP Might Be Gearing Up For Short Squeeze The discussion began after a popular crypto commentator posted about Axelar’s plan to lock up $10 billion worth of XRP, a move that would remove around 5% of the token available to retail traders. Similarly, Flare Networks has set a goal of locking up 5 billion XRP. These two initiatives alone would place significant pressure on the pool of XRP available for active trading. Related Reading: Demand For XRP On CME Explodes As Reports Show Over $18 Billion Steingraber noted that XRP’s active trading supply is what ultimately influences market pricing, not the total supply figure often cited. As such, he suggested that such accumulation by these companies, combined with other supply constraints, could reduce the number of the token available for public trading. Particularly, Steingraber predicted that this number could fall drastically to as low as 21 million XRP, an amount symbolically identical to Bitcoin’s hard cap. The possibility of only 21 million XRP being available for trading from its current circulating supply of 59 billion tokens is very ambitious. However, the scenario of this drastic fall becomes possible if Spot XRP ETFs are approved in the United States. Institutional ETFs would demand a steady supply of XRP for custody, and this would create large-scale accumulation that could permanently restrict availability on exchanges. In such a case, supply shocks could become very common. Aside from new institutional lockups, there are other clear signs that XRP’s active trading pool is thinning. A notable example is crypto exchange Coinbase, where XRP reserves have dropped sharply in recent months. Adding to that, Ripple itself still controls a large portion of the total supply, with billions of the token locked in escrow. Although these tokens are technically part of circulation, they are unavailable for retail use and are released only under strict schedules. Price Impact Of A 21 Million Effective Supply The idea that XRP’s active trading supply could fall to just 21 million tokens shows how scarcity could alter its valuation. Based on today’s circulating supply of about 59 billion XRP and a market price of $2.89, XRP has a market capitalization of about $172.8 billion. If that same market capitalization were concentrated into only 21 million tokens, the implied price per coin would be about $8,120.

Rounded base and support DOGE trades above the 200‑day EMA at $0.2199 and holds $0.20–$0.22 support. Historical rallies from similar setups have produced 30–40% gains; market cap near $35.365B per CoinGecko data. Dogecoin price outlook: DOGE holds key support near $0.20–$0.22 above the 200‑day EMA; read analyst targets and data-driven levels now. What is the Dogecoin price outlook? Dogecoin price outlook shows constructive technical structure: a third rounded accumulation base with support at $0.20–$0.22, trading above the 200‑day EMA, and a near-term golden cross that could propel DOGE toward $0.33–$0.35 if momentum confirms. Short‑term risk remains the $0.20 zone. How does the approaching golden cross affect Dogecoin? The golden cross — when the 50‑day moving average crosses above the 200‑day moving average — is a bullish signal for DOGE. Historically, similar moving‑average crossovers have coincided with extended rallies. Traders monitor confirmation (volume and follow‑through) before treating it as a buy signal. Dogecoin forms its third rounded base since 2015, holding $0.20–$0.22 support as a golden cross nears with targets toward $0.35. Dogecoin forms the third rounded base since 2015, holding $0.20–$0.22 support for potential new rally. DOGE trades above 200-day EMA at $0.2199, with historical rallies showing 30–40% gains from here. Golden cross pattern nears, projecting continuation toward $0.33 and resistance near $0.35 levels. Dogecoin is approaching a technical inflection after multiple long‑term accumulation phases. The latest rounded base displays gradual upward progression and price stability, supported by a rising trendline. Historical cycles show that similar consolidations have often preceded sizeable rallies, and market participants are now tracking breakout signals. Why do rounded bases matter for Dogecoin? Rounded bases indicate multi‑period accumulation and reduced volatility, which can precede trend continuation. Traders view a sustained hold above rounded support—here $0.20–$0.22—as evidence of buyer conviction and a prerequisite for measured upside targets. Long-Term Accumulation Phases and Breakout Potential Analyst Javon Marks identified three rounded accumulation phases for Dogecoin, each followed by significant expansion. The 2015–2017 base preceded a sharp 2018 rally, and the 2018–2020 base set the stage for the 2021 peak. Repeating basing structures suggest durable capital re‑entry when liquidity conditions improve. $DOGE (Dogecoin) setting new All Time Highs in a nearly +150% move from here shouldn’t be much of a question AT ALL … pic.twitter.com/NZwHk6iAH2 — JAVON MARKS (Twitter) — September 28, 2025 After the 2021 rally, DOGE entered a wider consolidation that created another rounded structure. That base has remained above rising curved support, maintaining stability despite broader market volatility. Each cycle of accumulation and breakout historically delivered gains that often exceeded prior rallies. The current setup shows Dogecoin trading near $0.23 with a market capitalization of $35.365 billion, per CoinGecko. Fully diluted valuation aligns closely at $35.371 billion. Maintaining the $0.20–$0.22 support band is critical for continuation of the upward cycle, as breakdowns below that zone could negate bullish projections. What are the key market data points and support levels? Key on‑chain and market metrics provide context for price action. Dogecoin’s DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) is reported at $20.27 million per DeFiLlama, with a 3.90% daily decline. Chain fee and revenue figures were modest, and decentralized exchange activity showed low recent volume—factors that can cap immediate volatility. Source: DeFiLlama Technically, DOGE sits above the 200‑day exponential moving average at $0.2199 and the 100‑day simple moving average at $0.2129. Historical rebounds from comparable bands have yielded 30–40% upside, which aligns with the $0.33–$0.35 target range noted by market commentators. Commentator Cas Abbe noted the approaching golden cross and observed that “when DOGE pumps, Altseason starts.” That view emphasizes the correlation between strong mid‑cap token performance and broader altcoin cycles. Traders should seek volume confirmation and watch resistance near $0.33–$0.35. Frequently Asked Questions What is the immediate support for DOGE? Immediate support is the $0.20–$0.22 band; holding this zone with price above the 200‑day EMA at $0.2199 preserves the bullish case and opens targets toward $0.33–$0.35. How likely is a 30–40% rally from current levels? Historical patterns from similar consolidation zones produced 30–40% rallies, but probability depends on market liquidity, macro conditions, and confirmation from moving averages and trading volume. Key Takeaways Rounded accumulation: Third rounded base since 2015 suggests structured accumulation and potential for continuation. Technical setup: DOGE trading above the 200‑day EMA; golden cross approaching — watch volume for confirmation. Risk management: Support at $0.20–$0.22 is critical; a decisive break below would alter the outlook. Conclusion Dogecoin’s price outlook is constructive while support near $0.20–$0.22 holds and the 200‑day EMA remains a floor. A confirmed golden cross and rising volume would strengthen the case for moves toward $0.33–$0.35.

The proposed reforms, according to sources who spoke to Bloomberg, would extend Masak’s anti-money laundering (AML) jurisdiction to include both crypto and fiat accounts. The measures are intended to align with those developed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international body that creates standards addressing money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The FATF, an intergovernmental watchdog of which Turkey is a member, removed Ankara from its “grey list” of countries subject to increased monitoring in June 2024, following progress on its mechanisms for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The bill is expected to be presented to the Grand National Assembly, although no specific timeline has been disclosed. On approval, Masak will have the authority to freeze or close accounts suspected of illicit use across payment systems, electronic money institutions, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges. It would also be able to impose transaction limits or blacklist crypto wallets linked to criminal activity. Turkey moves to clamp down on rented crypto accounts The main focus of the legislation is to curb the rise of so-called “rented accounts” — accounts that criminals pay individuals to use for activities such as illegal gambling or financial fraud . Masak is a major player in Turkey’s anti-money laundering efforts as it collects and analyzes suspicious transaction reports, refers cases to prosecutors, and serves as a liaison on international compliance issues. While trading and investment in digital assets remain legal in Turkey, and profits are not yet subject to taxation as of October, the government has been moving to tighten the rules surrounding cryptocurrencies. Reports indicate that the Finance Ministry is forming new rules that would require crypto exchanges to collect detailed information on the source and purpose of transactions, as well as introduce limits on stablecoin transfers. Earlier this year, the Capital Markets Board (CMB), one of Turkey’s key financial regulators, said it had restricted access to several platforms offering “unauthorized” digital asset services, such as PancakeSwap, a popular decentralized exchange. All crypto players in Turkey are now required to register locally, as the board was granted increased powers in March 2025, with strict anti-money laundering and customer protection requirements to be met. Among the key rules are ID checks on transactions exceeding 15,000 lira, transfer limits on stablecoins, and delays in cash withdrawals for certain purposes. Turkey’s move aligns with that of other countries, including Kazakhstan and Russia, which have been cracking down on digital asset markets. While trading and holding cryptocurrencies remain legal, the use of payment services has been illegal since 2021. Turks turn to crypto as Lira’s crisis fuels digital asset adoption Cryptocurrency adoption in Turkey has been steadily increasing for some time. According to the latest Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index, released in September, this increase is supported by the growth of centralized retail platforms and the growing presence of institutional crypto services in the country. A major catalyst, however, has been the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira. Since 2018, the lira has been facing a prolonged financial and economic crisis marked by high inflation, rising borrowing costs, and widespread loan defaults. Several citizens have turned to dollar-pegged stablecoins and BRC as alternative stores of value as the lira’s value has eroded. To understand the scale of the lira’s decline: In 2020, one Bitcoin was worth about 100,000 Turkish lira. Today, that exact figure exceeds 4.6 million lira, showing both Bitcoin’s price appreciation and the lira’s steep depreciation.

The 45-year-old Zhang, also known as Zhimin Qian reportedly masterminded the crime in China between 2014 and 2017 that left 128,000 people out of pocket. She was arrested last year in April after spending years on the run. Zhang had an accomplice also from China, in crypto laundering According to the Guardian, Zhang kept the proceeds in bitcoin, although UK made a breakthrough in the case after raiding a Hampstead mansion in 2018 where they seized devices holding 61,000 bitcoins valued at £1.4 billion at the time and has appreciated in value to over £5 billion at the prevailing prices. The fortune has reportedly been at the center of an intense battle between the UK government and Chinese investors over who gets to keep it, according to a Sky News article. This was believed to be the largest single cryptocurrency seizure in the world, as per the Metropolitan police. The woman pleaded guilty on Monday at a Southwark crown court to acquiring crypto that was criminal property and possessing it between October 2017 and April 2024. Zhang had reportedly fled China using a fake St Kitts and Nevis passport in 2017 and entered the UK. A year later, she attempted money laundering by purchasing properties with the assistance of 43-year-old Jian Wen, a Chinese takeaway worker. According to the Guardian , Wen was incarcerated for six years and eight months for her role in the scam in May last year. Sentencing for Zhang, who appeared in court aided by a Mandarin interpreter will be at a later date. Her accomplice, Wen, arrived in the UK in 2007 and lived a modest life in Leeds between 2011 and 2017 before she started working at a Chinese take-away in south-east London in September of 2017. However, her life took a sudden change as she laundered proceeds of the fraud, driving around in a Mercedes. She also flew her son over from China 18 months later to attend a private school. Zhang reportedly fled after police raided the Hampstead mansion, also known as the Manor House, where they seized a safety deposit box that contained digital wallets that had huge amounts in bitcoin. But her accomplice – Wen maintained she had no idea the bitcoin came from proceeds of crime further claiming that Zhang had tricked her, adding that she had helped Zhang run a jeweller business with branches in China, Malaysia, and Singapore. The case is expected to bring closure to the victims A judge ordered Wen in January this year to pay back over 3 million pounds within three months or serve jail term for another seven years. Head of Met’s economic cybercrime command Will Lyne commended the team for the effort they put towards solving the case. “This is one of the largest money-laundering cases in UK history and among the highest-value cryptocurrency cases globally.” Lyne. “Through a meticulous investigation and unprecedented cooperation with Chinese law enforcement, we were able to obtain compelling evidence of the criminal origins of the cryptoassets Qian attempted to launder in the UK … My thoughts are with the thousands of victims defrauded in this scheme,” added Lyne. Zhang’s solicitor, Roger Sahota of Berkeley Square Solicitors, said this was likely to bring closure to the many victims that were defrauded. “By pleading guilty today, Ms Zhang hopes to bring some comfort to investors who have waited since 2017 for compensation, and to reassure them that the significant rise in cryptocurrency values means there are more than sufficient funds available to repay their losses,” said Sahota. This also come on the backdrop of rising crypto scams across the world. Recently EU member states stopped a crypto scam that resulted in heavy losses for victims in about two dozen countries.

What Does He Know?,https://timestabloid.com/prominent-trader-reopens-17-6-million-short-against-xrp-what-does-he-know/,"A well-known cryptocurrency trader has re-entered the market with a highly leveraged bet against XRP, opening a $17.6 million short position shortly after taking heavy losses from earlier trades on both XRP and Bitcoin. XRP Price Recovery Pressures Short Sellers The broader digital asset market showed modest recovery over the weekend, with XRP climbing 2% in the past 24 hours to trade above $2.80. This rebound proved costly for traders who had maintained large short positions, including the pseudonymous investor Falllling. Data from the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that the trader was forced to partially liquidate previous positions during the upswing, suffering significant losses. The earlier bets included a 1,366.67 BTC short worth around $150 million at 40x leverage and an additional 2.78 million XRP short valued at $7.7 million with 20x leverage. The trades were set with liquidation thresholds of $110,280 for Bitcoin and $3.0665 for XRP. As the market rose, both trades were closed at a loss, resulting in an estimated $3.4 million setback for the trader. As the market rebounded, gambler @qwatio was partially liquidated! He closed his short positions on $BTC and $XRP , losing $3.4M. He then reopened a 20x short on 6.17M $XRP ($17.6M), with a liquidation price of $2.9155. https://t.co/beUxvfctNU https://t.co/cqRQ4wLXdu pic.twitter.com/UUVBkWaRd4 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 29, 2025 New Position Reopened Despite these losses, Falllling quickly re-entered the market with another aggressive position. The new trade involves a short bet against 6.17 million XRP, valued at approximately $17.6 million, again placed with 20x leverage. The liquidation point for this trade is set at $2.9155, marginally above XRP’s current price of $2.88 . According to available data, the position is already showing a paper loss of more than $34,000. Such a strategy highlights the risks associated with high leverage. A price increase to the liquidation threshold would erase the entire position, while any significant downward movement could yield outsized gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market-Wide Liquidations Increase The weekend rally triggered widespread liquidations across the cryptocurrency market. According to Coinglass data, a total of $348.51 million in positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Short positions accounted for the majority at $280.82 million, while long positions made up $87.69 million. XRP alone contributed approximately $2.81 million in short liquidations, while Bitcoin led the market with $47.26 million. Analysts note that if XRP advances to $2.916, slightly above the liquidation level of Falllling’s position, nearly $44 million in XRP shorts could be liquidated. The trader’s decision to reopen such a large bet against XRP underscores ongoing bearish sentiment among some market participants, even as the broader market shows signs of stabilizing. With liquidation levels set so close to current prices, XRP’s short-term movements could determine whether the strategy results in another substantial loss or a major gain .

According to his statement, the withholding of public matching funds and persistent questions about his legal past left the campaign without the money or momentum it needed. Adams will remain in office until January 1, 2026, and his name will still appear on the November 4, 2025, ballot because the deadline to remove it has already passed. Campaign Funds And Legal Shadows Reports have disclosed that the city Campaign Finance Board paused matching payments to Adams’s bid, a move he said crippled fundraising. He also faces a cloud from an indictment brought in 2024; he has pleaded not guilty. In 2025, the Department of Justice moved to drop the case, an action that drew sharp attention and allegations of political influence by critics. Only in America. Only in New York.Thank you for making my story a reality. pic.twitter.com/efHuyBnITJ — Eric Adams (@ericadamsfornyc) September 28, 2025 Adams told supporters that the steady stream of questions about his legal future made it impossible to run a serious campaign. Polls showed him trailing key rivals, and donors became hesitant. A Pro-Crypto Mayor’s Exit Could Shift Policy Adams had positioned New York as welcoming to cryptocurrency firms and blockchain projects. According to media coverage, he pushed for measures such as a municipal Bitcoin bond and changes to the city’s BitLicense rules to make them more industry friendly. Those efforts helped craft his image as a pro-crypto mayor. With him stepping back, the fate of those policies is less certain. Supporters in the crypto sector worry that momentum could slow without his voice in City Hall, while opponents say any successor may push for tighter consumer protections. The Race Reconfigured Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic primary and now leads in general election polls. Andrew Cuomo, who lost the primary, is running as an independent and could pick up votes from those uneasy about Mamdani. Curtis Sliwa remains the Republican contender. Adams did not endorse any candidate when he withdrew. Analysts say his exit may consolidate some anti-Mamdani voters around Cuomo, though nothing is guaranteed. What The Withdrawal Means For Voters Voters face a shorter list of clear choices. Adams argued that constant scrutiny and a lack of campaign funds left him with little option but to step aside. He warned of “insidious forces” using government power to push division, language that sent ripples through local politics. City officials and activists will now press the remaining candidates to lay out plans on jobs, housing, public safety, and how they would handle the growing but contested crypto sector in the city.

The decision would open access for more than 50 million clients, who collectively hold about $11 trillion in assets with the firm. At present, the company does not manage any crypto ETFs, and its clients are blocked from buying Bitcoin or Ether ETFs managed by other firms. A Vanguard spokesperson allegedly confirmed the review to Crypto in America , saying, “We continuously evaluate our brokerage offer, investor preferences, and the evolving regulatory environment. If and when a decision is made, clients will hear directly from Vanguard.” This cautious language reflects years of resistance, during which the firm labeled crypto “immature” and warned that it could cause “havoc” in long-term portfolios. Former Chief Executive Officer Tim Buckley flatly declared the company would never launch a Bitcoin fund. Founder Jack Bogle once went further, telling investors to avoid the coin “like the plague.” Salim Ramji pushes change as new Vanguard chief The discussion around crypto gained new weight when Salim Ramji, a former BlackRock executive, took over as CEO last year. Salim became the first outsider to lead the company, breaking a tradition where every leader had been trained by Bogle himself. Unlike Tim, Salim has shown openness to blockchain and Bitcoin, signaling a break from the hostile stance that defined Vanguard for decades. His leadership coincided with the rollout of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, which stunned Wall Street with record inflows. A few months later, regulators approved the first spot Ether ETFs, adding momentum to the sector. Together, these ETFs now oversee more than $142 billion. BlackRock’s IBIT fund dominates the space with about $84 billion, while nearly $24 billion of that sum came in during 2025 alone, making IBIT one of the top five funds for inflows across all U.S. ETFs. The surge has been impossible for large firms to ignore. President Donald Trump’s White House has embraced crypto, while hedge funds, pensions, and banks have committed billions. BlackRock’s ETHA fund, focused on Ether, has amassed about $15 billion in assets. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the wave of demand explains the review. “The astounding success of the ETFs added a lot to the pressure. Had Bitcoin ETFs been a flop, I don’t think they would consider lifting the ban,” Eric said. Vanguard weighs tradition against market pressure At 55, Salim is attempting to satisfy long-time employees still loyal to Bogle while answering the calls of investors who want crypto access. He once had ambitions at BlackRock and now has to prove himself in a culture that mistrusts outsiders. His task is balancing new opportunities with what Vanguard is famous for: cheap, passive investing. Bogle’s most famous advice, “Don’t look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack!” still defines the firm’s strategy. Today, Vanguard’s index funds dominate workplace retirement plans, with assets under management swelling by about $2.5 trillion in the last three years. Hundreds of billions of dollars are added annually through direct deposits. “The age of Bogle is alive and well, and part of my mission here is to make sure that we advance and extend it for decades to come,” Salim said recently while speaking on campus, wearing jeans, a pale-blue shirt, and a dark blazer. But sadly, Vanguard’s average fee has dropped to only about 0.07%, and costs are rising, raising doubts about whether that model can keep helping the company with its ambitious expansion. Meanwhile, its top competitor BlackRock has solved the problem by using stock to buy private investment firms that generate higher fees, while Vanguard is owned by the investors in its funds, lacks public stock, and has no intention of pursuing acquisitions.

The liquidation jitters still linger among market participants, and the turbulence shook short-term sentiment. Despite this, experts say that the bull market appears intact. In fact, CryptoQuant revealed that several on-chain signals are pointing to further upside potential. Mid-Cycle Reset An important metric in this regard, the MVRV ratio – which measures the relationship between Bitcoin’s market value and the average cost basis of its holders- has cooled back toward the 2.0 level. Previous instances have shown that this range has been a mid-cycle reset zone rather than a danger signal. Investors remain comfortably in profit, but without the kind of overheated conditions that often precede sharp corrections. In past cycles, CryptoQuant found that similar consolidations in the MVRV ratio represented the beginning of renewed, stronger expansions. The behavior of long-term holders further validated this outlook. On-chain data shows that profit-taking among these investors has diminished considerably, and those who have held coins for months or years are largely choosing to sit tight. Their conviction not only demonstrates confidence in Bitcoin’s longer-term trajectory but also effectively tightens supply in the market. Such a reduction in selling pressure creates a supportive backdrop for future price increases, particularly if new demand emerges. These factors collectively mirror crucial “mid-cycle” phases seen in both 2017 and 2020, when Bitcoin slowed before breaking into more powerful rallies. Recent volatility, then, looks less like the exhaustion of the bitcoin bull market and more like a healthy pause, which the analytic platform described as a “digestion” phase where excesses are cleared before momentum resumes. “If history rhymes, today’s consolidation could mark the groundwork for the next major leg upward – suggesting the bull market is alive and well.” $140K to $170K BTC Is Next Prominent market commentator Mr. Wall Street also observed that Bitcoin remains firmly above support levels despite recent turbulence in his detailed technical and macro analysis. He noted that BTC is currently hovering just above the same support zone where he opened long positions near $107,500, only 12% below its all-time high of $125,000. Dismissing the calls for a cycle top and an impending bear market, the analyst argued that “none of the major macro indicators have flashed,” and that market structure remains intact. He even went on to emphasize that current weakness stems from temporary macro uncertainty rather than structural distribution, and added that “there’s no imbalance nor geopolitical event that can trigger a down move from here.” Going forward, the analyst expects a highly bullish Q4 and predicts new highs in the $140,000-$170,000 range before the cycle peak is reached. He also forecasts up to six Federal Reserve rate cuts within the next six months. For traders, he identified the 4-hour EMA200 as the next short-term target and explained that the current region offers an attractive entry for new longs. Upcoming US economic releases, including job openings, ISM data, and unemployment figures, could spark short-term volatility, but he maintained that the broader bull trend remains unshaken.

Shares of the company, formerly known as MicroStrategy, have fallen about 20% since June while Bitcoin has risen roughly 6% and hit record highs, according to Bloomberg Television. This reversal has led critics to question the long-term value of the five-year-old crypto buy-and-hold strategy Saylor created. “I’m not really concerned,” Saylor said during a Bloomberg interview on Monday. “What happens is, the premium will expand as our leverage increases and the volatility in Bitcoin increases. When the volatility falls and our leverage falls, sometimes the premium will contract.” Saylor transformed Strategy from an enterprise software business into a Bitcoin treasury company, creating a stock market proxy for holding crypto without owning tokens directly.Since mid‑2020, the stock has surged more than 2,600%. For years, Strategy traded at a premium more than double the value of the Bitcoin it owned.That gap has narrowed sharply, with the company now valued at about 1.46 times the roughly $73 billion in Bitcoin it holds. Crypto treasuries have attracted over $44 billion this year as promoters framed them as steady buyers turning coins from speculative bets into financial infrastructure. “The market is still working to digest the new business model,” Saylor said . “The Bitcoin treasury company is an idea that’s only come to the forefront in the past year or so.” Strategy manages leverage as smaller rivals hit limits The broader group of crypto‑holding firms is under strain. Nearly a third of publicly traded companies with Bitcoin reserves now trade below the value of their holdings. Small players are especially exposed. Their limited liquidity makes issuing new stock more expensive, and their dependence on convertible notes creates interest costs and repayment risks. Strategy has said it will retire all of its convertible notes within four years and switch to preferred shares, which have no maturity date. Many competitors cannot match that approach because they lack size or strong credit. “What happens when Bitcoin drops 50%?” asked Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments. “Enthusiasm for treasury companies will wane, mNAVs will compress and you will have 100s of companies start to question their treasury strategy altogether.” His warning highlights how quickly investor sentiment can change if the market turns. Strategy’s plan to exit convertible notes is designed to reduce those pressures before a downturn tests its model. New entrants launch crypto vehicles as ETFs erode Strategy’s edge The space around Strategy has become crowded.Over the past year, influencers and politically connected figures have launched crypto vehicles through SPACs and reverse mergers.Many of these ventures lack Strategy’s trading liquidity and scale and may not survive a downturn. “Is this market frothy? I think it is,” said Jack Mallers, co‑founder and chief executive officer of Twenty One Capital Inc., during a Bloomberg TV interview on Wednesday. “What we learned is, creating a Bitcoin treasury company is not a scarcity within itself. Anyone can register a business, attempt to go public and try to raise money to buy Bitcoin.” Another threat comes from the rise of spot Bitcoin exchange‑traded funds. Initially, Strategy and the ETFs both gained from a post‑election rally under President Donald Trump. Now the comparison has shifted. Funds let investors get Bitcoin exposure without the risks tied to corporate governance, leverage or dilution. “Investors are momentum investors,” said Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke University. “When the price is going up, they are buyers. When the price goes down or remains flat, there is less enthusiasm.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-29 23:55:18

One of the most ambitious projections is that the token could eventually reach $10,000 , a claim dismissed by some as unrealistic but supported by others who argue that XRP’s fundamentals could justify such levels. Comparisons to Bitcoin’s Early Growth XRP advocate Xena recently revisited this projection, drawing parallels between the skepticism surrounding XRP today and doubts about Bitcoin in its early years. She highlighted that when Bitcoin traded below $1,000, many considered predictions of far higher prices unreasonable. Over time, however, Bitcoin rose from a few cents to more than $100,000, proving many critics wrong. According to Xena, XRP’s current price above $2 has led many to disregard the possibility of exponential growth, but she believes history shows that such dismissals can be premature. She stressed that conviction and long-term patience are essential, arguing that dismissing XRP’s potential mirrors the attitudes that caused many investors to underestimate Bitcoin. Without a doubt…and it's not a belief. It will. I know, I know. Some people always say : let's cross ATH first. But that's not the point. When articles said Bitcoin will reach $1M people said let's reach $1000 first. Look at the price today. And many regret not holding a… https://t.co/DHtcauZGFt — Xena XRP (@XenaXrp) June 25, 2025 To bolster her argument, Xena cited Arthur Britto, a Ripple co-founder, who has been quoted as saying XRP was designed to accommodate values as high as $10,000 per token. She acknowledged that even if the asset fell short of this figure, such a design consideration still points toward the possibility of significantly higher valuations than the current market price. Efficiency in Cross-Border Payments Other commentators have also reinforced the idea of a higher XRP valuation. An account known as Chesty Puller’s Ghost referenced insights from Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, who in 2017 outlined why a low XRP price could hinder efficient cross-border transactions. Schwartz explained that conducting large transfers at low token prices would require impractically large quantities of XRP. For example, sending $1 million at $1 per coin would take one million tokens, while moving $50 billion would demand 50 billion XRP. Conversely, at $10,000 per token, only 100 XRP would be needed for a $1 million transfer, making the network more practical for large-scale financial settlements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Timeline for Adoption Adding to these arguments, Jake Claver, Managing Director at Digital Ascension Group, has publicly attached a timeline for XRP to reach the $10,000 level. He suggested that such growth could take place within 24 months, positioning the asset for major institutional integration by 2027. Claver’s projection, while ambitious, underscores the belief among some advocates that XRP’s design and intended use case support far higher valuations. Proponents such as Xena emphasize that the focus should not be on convincing skeptics but on encouraging those who already see XRP’s potential to remain committed. For these advocates, the real issue is not whether the token can ever reach $10,000 but whether investors are willing to stay positioned if it does. While predictions of XRP reaching $10,000 remain controversial, advocates argue that historical precedents in the crypto market, the token’s design considerations, and its utility in global payments justify a case for significant long-term appreciation.

What Is The Bitcoin Tracker And Why Does It Matter Michael Saylor has once again released the Strategy Bitcoin tracker, a chart that the market has come to watch closely. According to the X post, the latest buy brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin treasury holdings to 639,835 BTC, which is approximately $70.01 billion. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Says Bitcoin Is Not Just An Asset; What Is It Then? CryptosRus has stated that the familiar orange dots continue their steady climb upward and to the right, a simple yet powerful indicator hinting that additional BTC buys may be on deck. Every time this chart comes out, the market leans in. Saylor’s conviction has transcended simple corporate policy to become a genuine market signal. An analyst known as BitBull has confirmed a crucial turning point for the Bitcoin market, highlighting that BTC Open Interest has fallen to its lowest level in a month, effectively wiping out all the leverage that had built up during September. BitBull views this deleveraging event as a positive and healthy development for the market. By purging excessive leverage, the market is now considered to be in a healthier state, which could set the stage for a reversal upward in BTC price. Why The Current Bitcoin Run Is Only The Beginning Market analyst Zynx has offered insights into the BTC market and future price targets, pointing out that the bull market is still in its early stages and has significant room to run. He stated that BTC needs to cross $151,000 just to equal its all-time high in Gold, which suggests a specific metric where BTC’s price, relative to the price of an ounce of gold, would match its previous peak ratio. Related Reading: Bitcoin Daily RSI At Most Oversold Level Since April — Time To Buy? Historically, every cycle since the inception, BTC has more than doubled its price in Gold at a minimum, usually much more than that. However, the $300,000 target is looking increasingly realistic. While it is impossible to give a time frame, if history repeats, crossing the $151,000 all-time high within the next six months is expected. Furthermore, what makes this cycle fascinating is the macro overlay. Some analysts, such as EneaDenkt and others, are using the US Business Cycle Institute for Supply Management (ISM) as a key indicator for predicting the timing when BTC will peak. Zynx concluded by acknowledging that this is definitely a very interesting time for the BTC rally, and this cycle will definitely be like no other.

What is the current Ethereum price outlook? Ethereum price is testing a critical inflection zone: reclaiming $4,841 is essential to confirm a bullish reversal toward $5,864; failure risks a pullback to $2,750. Short-term indicators (RSI, open interest) suggest both a possible bounce and the risk of deeper correction depending on follow-through. How can ETH reclaim $4,841 and what happens if it fails? For ETH to break the downtrend, buying pressure must push price above $4,841 with sustained volume. A decisive close above that level would re-open the path to prior highs near $5,864.

On-chain metric MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands show ETH between the +0.5σ and +1.0σ bands as of late September 2025, indicating elevated realized-value divergence. How does the RSI support a potential reversal? ETH price momentum indicators are mixed. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index plunged from 82 on Sept. 13 to 14.5 — the lowest since April 2025. Historically, similar extreme RSI lows (April and June 2025) preceded meaningful rallies, suggesting a possible short-term bounce if buying volume appears. Source: Crypto Rover via X When did open interest and whale activity influence the recent move? Open interest recently experienced a sharp reset, one of the largest since early 2024, wiping excessive leverage and reducing short-term speculative pressure. Analyst Darkfost notes this reset — particularly on major derivatives venues — left the market in cleaner condition. At the same time, a whale accumulated approximately $235.7 million in ETH this week and currently shows roughly $19.4 million in unrealized losses.

If ETH fails at $4,841, selling pressure may escalate and push price toward the next major support near $2,750. Traders should watch stop-flow and leverage removal as these can accelerate declines. How should traders interpret the current whale activity? Whale accumulation of $235.7M in ETH, despite showing $19.4M in paper losses, indicates larger participants may be positioning for longer-term upside while retail decides on near-term profit-taking. Key Takeaways Critical level: Reclaiming $4,841 is necessary to confirm a bullish reversal toward $5,864. Momentum signal: RSI at 14.5 suggests a potential short-term bounce but needs volume confirmation. On-chain context: Open interest reset and whale accumulation indicate reduced leverage and strategic dip buying. Conclusion In summary, the Ethereum price outlook is balanced between a potential bounce from oversold conditions and the risk of a deeper correction if $4,841 remains out of reach.

These zones often act as magnets where leveraged positions are triggered, producing rapid directional moves. A breach of these clusters could accelerate both downside liquidations and upside short-squeezes. Buyers within the wedge structure view $260 and $300 as key upside objectives. Conversely, failure to hold the $200 support could expose SOL to a test of $190, increasing selling pressure. Source: TradingView How does market positioning affect near‑term bias? Binance market positioning shows long accounts at 72.91% and shorts at 27.09%, reinforcing a bullish bias.

Volatility zones $205–$215 : Liquidation clusters can spark rapid swings in either direction. Targets and risk management : If $200 holds, aim for $260 and $300; otherwise, expect pressure toward $190 and increased liquidations. Conclusion Solana’s breakout consolidation above the wedge trendline, backed by exchange outflows and bullish positioning, creates a constructive setup for further gains. Traders should monitor $200 support and $205–$215 liquidity clusters closely.

The CSI 300 Index is now forecast to close out 2025 at just 4,675 points, a tiny 1.2% gain from this Monday, according to 16 analysts reportedly surveyed by Bloomberg. That’s after the index already rose 17% this year. And it gets worse. By next June, those same analysts expect a mere 5.5% rise. What began as an AI-fueled breakout is now looking like a stall. This year’s rally has done a little work to wash off the “uninvestable” tag China earned, but global investors still don’t trust it. Geopolitical tensions, old Trump-era policies, and a weak economy are still blocking serious capital from returning. “2025 is about holding ground,” said Haris Khurshid of Karobaar Capital. “Policy support is there, but it’s inconsistent, and global funds are reluctant to re-risk until the geopolitical tone stabilizes.” Tech stocks lead but valuations flash warning signs China’s market jump this year was driven by AI and tech stocks. The Hang Seng Tech Index exploded 42%, with chipmakers Hua Hong Semiconductor and SMIC rising more than 233% and 140%. In September alone, Alibaba jumped almost 50% after throwing out some big AI investment plans. Everyone’s riding the tech wave, but analysts are getting nervous. Twelve of the Bloomberg survey participants called AI the most crowded trade in China right now. “Every yuan of AI capex is being rewarded with a higher stock price, but at some point investors will want to see cash flows and not just announcements,” said Khurshid. Almost all 21 analysts surveyed said foreign capital is crucial if this rally wants to keep moving. Without it, domestic enthusiasm can’t carry the load. But the money is hesitating. Policy shifts, weak macro numbers, and US-China uncertainty still spook long-term investors. Zijin Gold lands record IPO as Hong Kong regains IPO momentum While the broader market cools, Zijin Gold has pulled off a monster move. The mining giant raised $3.2 billion ahead of its Hong Kong debut, making it the largest IPO globally since May. Shares were priced at HK$71.59, valuing the firm at HK$187.9 billion ($24 billion). It’s now bigger than Teck Resources in Canada. The listing had been set for Monday, but Super Typhoon Ragasa delayed trading to Tuesday. Hong Kong now claims the two biggest IPOs of 2025 so far, with Zijin Gold second only to CATL’s $5.3 billion mega-deal. Michelle Leung said Zijin “picked the best time” to go public. She added that gold’s price boom has pumped up valuations across miners. As of Sept. 28, Zijin’s IPO was priced at a 26% discount to its global peers. The IPO attracted a heavy lineup of buyers. GIC, Hillhouse, BlackRock, Fidelity, and Millennium were among cornerstone investors who agreed to hold shares for at least six months. Together, they took about half the float. Zijin plans to use the IPO cash to buy a mine in Kazakhstan and upgrade sites globally. The company manages its parent group’s gold assets outside China, with mines from Central Asia to Africa, Australia, and South America. The firm has become one of the fastest-growing gold miners in the world. Other miners have cashed in too. PT Merdeka Gold Resources raised $280 million in Jakarta this month, Indonesia’s largest IPO this year. Shandong Gold Mining also raised $500 million selling shares. Traders are now watching a long list of possible triggers for the last quarter: the Golden Week holiday, Fourth Plenum in October, a Trump-Xi meeting at APEC, the Central Economic Work Conference in December, and possible action from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). About half of the analysts surveyed expect the PBOC to roll out some form of stimulus by year-end, especially if the Federal Reserve cuts rates first. But don’t expect fireworks. “The PBOC has hinted it’s ready to step in if growth shows more strain,” said Khurshid. “I’d look for small, targeted steps, rather than a big, broad stimulus package.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",News|China,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|BUSINESS|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-30 00:12:54

This event aimed to coordinate policy projects with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Notably, the CFTC and the SEC are two of the primary financial regulatory bodies in the US. Regarding the rules governing the digital asset markets in the US, both agencies have been assigned important roles in regulating this critical sector. To break this down, the SEC will oversee crypto securities, and the CFTC is expected to receive more authority from Congress to oversee most digital asset transactions. The SEC and the CFTC aim to join forces to enhance crypto regulations Paul Atkins and Acting Chairman Caroline Pham of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission demonstrated their commitment to clear boundaries between securities and commodities . According to them, this will ease the operation of firms or apps across both areas without encountering problems. For this goal to succeed, Atkins needed the two financial regulators to join forces. In a statement, he argued that the two agencies must work together. The chairman made these remarks while speaking to financial compliance lawyers and industry spokespersons at the SEC headquarters in Washington. However, for both agencies to work together smoothly, the SEC’s leader further emphasized the importance of establishing a strong system. On the other hand, Caroline Pham remarked, “It’s a new day, and the turf war is over.” In the meantime, it is worth noting that, although it is rare for these two agencies, which usually display differing opinions, to showcase such strong emotions, the CFTC still lacks a permanent leader. Concerning the CFTC’s permanent leader, sources have emphasized the importance of their presence, arguing that this will ensure the agency’s strategic choices remain stable even in the face of possible management changes. To address these concerns, Pham mentioned that individuals need not be afraid, uncertain, or doubtful about what the CFTC is doing. This is because the agency is progressing very well, she added. This statement was in reference to the popular acronym from the crypto community. Atkins praised Pham’s leadership skills at CFTC, noting that with these skills, their alliance on crypto-related initiatives is moving full-speed ahead. Atkins sparks hope for a new turn in the crypto space with significant development Earlier, reporters had questioned Atkins about President Donald Trump’s intentions in the crypto ecosystem. Respondingly, the commissioner stated that Trump got things in motion and pointed out his recent plan to sign a market structure bill by the end of 2025. He concluded that they would see how that turned out. Atkins added that the SEC will pay attention to asset tokenization, but warned it may take a “year or two” to implement the appropriate regulations around this area. Based on his argument, the possibilities are almost limitless. The commissioner also quashed speculation of an SEC-CFTC merger, referring to such talk as “imaginative.” Monday’s roundtable discussion was a follow-up SEC event about the cryptocurrency world, and this time it showcased more cooperation between agencies, featuring digital assets and blockchain experts from companies like Kraken and Crypto.

BlackRock moved 49,607.8 ETH and 340.5 BTC (~$244M) to Coinbase Prime within an hour. Market prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum showed modest daily gains despite the transfer. On-chain analysis (Lookonchain) and industry experts suggest the transfer is likely operational—custody, rebalancing, or liquidity—rather than a strategic exit. BlackRock transfers Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime, sparking market attention; read analysis and implications for institutional crypto flows — learn more. BlackRock transfers $244 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime, raising speculation over potential shifts in its crypto strategy. BlackRock transferred $244 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime, sparking speculation about a potential sell-off. Despite large transactions, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to show positive daily gains, unaffected by BlackRock’s move. Some experts believe BlackRock’s move is operational rather than indicative of a strategy change, focusing on liquidity needs. Despite a slight uptick in the broader cryptocurrency market, institutional interest remains volatile, prompting major firms to adjust settlement and custody processes. On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that BlackRock transferred a significant portion of its Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings to a Coinbase Prime wallet, prompting market attention and analyst commentary. What happened when BlackRock transferred $244 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum? BlackRock transferred 49,607.8 ETH and 340.5 BTC (about $244 million) to a Coinbase Prime wallet in under an hour. The transaction triggered speculation about a potential sell-off, but immediate market reaction was muted as both assets posted modest daily gains. How large were the transfers and what do the numbers show? The on-chain move comprised 49,607.8 ETH and 340.5 BTC , totaling roughly $244 million at the time of transfer. Transfers of this scale are notable for institutional portfolios but do not automatically imply liquidation; they can indicate custody migration, internal rebalancing, or liquidity provisioning. Why analysts think this is likely operational, not a strategic exit? Several market analysts and custody specialists note that Coinbase Prime functions as a prime broker and custodian for institutions. Operational reasons for transfers include settlement, liquidity management, regulatory compliance, and internal accounting. Historical patterns show BlackRock has continued to accumulate crypto assets over longer timeframes, supporting the view that this transfer may be procedural. Market context supports a cautious reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum recorded daily gains of roughly 4% and 4.24% respectively on the day of the transfer, indicating broader demand counterbalanced the move. Official statements from asset managers are the most definitive source; no public BlackRock confirmation on intent was available at publication. How could this move affect market liquidity and prices? Short-term liquidity can be impacted if transferred assets are moved to exchange custody and subsequently offered for sale. However, the reported transfer did not coincide with sharp downward price moves. Institutional flows often create temporary order-book pressure but require follow-through to alter longer-term price direction. What should traders and investors watch next? Watch for additional on-chain movements from the same wallet, exchange outflows, and any official updates from BlackRock. Market depth and trading volumes around key support levels will determine whether this transfer becomes a catalyst for further volatility or remains an operational adjustment. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/blackrock-coinbase-transfer"" }, ""headline"": ""BlackRock transfers $244M in Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime — Analysis"", ""description"": ""BlackRock transferred 49,607.8 ETH and 340.5 BTC (~$244M) to Coinbase Prime.

There is no direct evidence of a sale following the transfer. On-chain activity showed the assets moved to Coinbase Prime, and market prices remained resilient, which suggests no immediate liquidation occurred. How can I track institutional crypto transfers? Use on-chain analytics platforms and monitor public wallet flows for large transfers. Look for repeated transfers from the same address, exchange inflows, and timing relative to market orders for clearer signals. Key Takeaways Transfer scale : BlackRock moved ~49,607.8 ETH and 340.5 BTC (~$244M) to Coinbase Prime. Market reaction : Bitcoin and Ethereum posted modest daily gains, indicating limited immediate price disruption. Likely interpretation : Analysts view the move as operational custody or liquidity management rather than a strategic exit; monitor follow-up on-chain activity and official statements. Conclusion BlackRock’s transfer of Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime is a significant institutional event, but available evidence points toward operational reasons rather than a wholesale strategy change.

The Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation unfolded at sunrise and zeroed in on the contractor that keeps Antminer rigs running at the 30 MW site, recently sold by Poolin. Witnesses allegedly said the raid looked like a war scene. “Helicopters, snipers, armed men,” one source told Blockspace while describing an ICE helicopter circling above before “a cavalcade of black Tahoes arrived at the scene.” He added agents asked “leading questions… ‘who does this, who does that.’” Multiple agencies were present: ICE, the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) all took part, according to a person on site. Agents detain ADW Tech staff and seize documents Law enforcement removed 12 or 13 workers, roughly half the repair shop staff, from the Pyote facility after they failed to show proper credentials. The same source said ICE targeted Chinese nationals and took everyone with expired visas. The raid did not affect other local operators such as Genesis Digital Assets, which runs a 195 MW bitcoin mine in Pyote but was not a subject of this action. ADW Tech is a Bitmain contractor and certified Antminer repair shop embedded within Lonestar Dream. The company’s presence highlights how West Texas has become a hub for mining, drawing big names with cheap power and wide land. Poolin’s recent sale of the site still left ADW Tech doing the repair work, and that is where federal scrutiny landed. The action comes as Bitmain-linked repair centers in the U.S. face rising government attention. This raid connects with a longer story involving the Trump administration’s handling of mining hardware imports. At the end of 2024, CBP began sporadically holding and seizing ASIC miner shipments at U.S. ports, sometimes keeping them for months and charging holding fees without explaining the flags. Several shipments stayed detained into 2025 after Trump took office and only began to be released by late Q1 and early Q2. Officials said they were looking for restricted AI chips on ASIC miners’ control boards from Sophgo, a semiconductor company that shares Bitmain CEO Micree Zhan. The U.S. Department of Commerce is actively investigating possible sanctions violations by Sophgo, which ties directly to why these miners and repair hubs are now under heavy federal focus.

The collection launched strongly with a floor near $68,700 and about $45 million in first-day volume. One rare piece, Hypurr #21, sold for 9,999 HYPE ($467,000), stressing strong demand among NFT traders and Hyperliquid’s early community. Most NFTs were allocated to participants from the November 2024 Genesis Event, with some allocations also made to the Hyper Foundation and core contributors. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Trading Volume Surges Hyperliquid’s network excitement coincides with increased derivatives activity: daily spot trading rose, futures volume increased approximately 13.9% to $1.8 billion, and open interest grew to $2.28 billion, indicating active short-term trading interest even if longer-term confidence remains cautious. Technically, $50 is the immediate resistance to surpass; $44 serves as a strong support level. With RSI near 46, MACD negative, and Bollinger Bands tightening, traders are watching for volatility to expand, which could shape the next move. Institutional Nods and New Infrastructure Strengthen the Narrative Institutional chatter fuels optimism: ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood recently compared Hyperliquid’s growth to that of early Solana, placing the DEX firmly on the radar of big money. Behind the scenes, the team continues to broaden its defenses. Hyperliquid launched permissionless spot quote assets on mainnet, with USDH (backed by cash and U.S. Treasuries) serving as the first quote. This move enables community-driven listings through Dutch auctions and introduces HYPE/USDH pairs, expanding liquidity while lowering barriers. Launched in February 2025, the HyperEVM programmability layer connects smart contracts with the chain’s HyperBFT consensus and HyperCore liquidity, allowing developers to create lending markets, vault tokenization, and liquid staking. Risks: Unlock Overhang, Security Alerts, Rising Competition Tailwinds aside, investors face genuine risks. A rival perpetuals platform, Aster, briefly surpassed Hyperliquid’s weekly volume after the token launch, highlighting intense competition in the DEX space. Security concerns arose when researcher ZachXBT reported the theft of eight Hypurr NFTs worth $400K shortly after launch, another reminder to improve wallet security. Most importantly, a pending $12B HYPE unlock threatens price discovery; additional supply might pressure prices if not absorbed by demand. To sum this up, if HYPE exceeds $50 on high volume, bulls could target a retest of the $59 all-time high from Sept. 18 and might move into the $55–$65 range next. Falling below $44 could cause a drop into the high-$30s.

Treasury wallets now hold over 20.9 million SOL, roughly 3.64% of the total supply, indicating that large investors are increasingly viewing SOL alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum as part of diversified crypto portfolios. Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Incoming As Axelar And Flare Target 8 Billion Tokens Companies like Forward Industries and Brera Holdings have disclosed their asset exposure, while ARK has added Solana-related equities and continues to emphasize the network’s expansion. Meanwhile, speculation about a potential Solana staking ETF has gained momentum; if approved, it could reduce circulating supply and provide yield access, potentially attracting significant new capital into SOL. Mid-cycle analyst targets of $300–$500 reflect this institutional interest along with rising on-chain activity. SOL's price trends to the upside but with some losses on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD chart on Tradingview Firedancer + Alpenglow: Leap in Performance vs. Decentralization Risk Solana’s technology roadmap provides another boost. Jump Crypto’s Firedancer client proposes SIMD-0370 to remove the fixed compute block limit, allowing higher-performance validators to process more complex blocks and increasing overall throughput. At the same time, the Alpenglow upgrade (testnet scheduled for December) aims to drastically reduce transaction finality, from approximately 12.8 seconds to 150 milliseconds, making Solana the fastest major chain. These changes could strengthen Solana’s leadership in high-volume DeFi and payments. However, critics warn that increasing centralization may occur if smaller validators cannot afford the necessary hardware upgrades. The primary challenge is striking a balance between raw speed and validator diversity, which is crucial for evaluating the network’s long-term resilience. Price Levels: Can Solana (SOL) Bulls Defend $207? Currently, SOL hovers near $208–$210, up modestly on the day as momentum rebuilds. The market now focuses on $207 as the first support level; a sustained hold preserves the uptrend and keeps a retest of $230–$253 possible, with $257 (the 52-week high) remaining above. Losing $207 opens the door to $190–$185 as the next demand zone, and a deeper shakeout could test $165–$167. Short-term sentiment is supported by improving tape dynamics, higher spot volumes, and active addresses, although macro factors remain a swing factor. For traders, the constructive setup is to hold $207, reclaim $223–$230, and then challenge $253–$257. For investors, the thesis relies on three pillars: increasing treasury ownership and potential ETF catalysts, throughput leadership from Firedancer and Alpenglow, and expanding real-world utility across DeFi and commerce.
