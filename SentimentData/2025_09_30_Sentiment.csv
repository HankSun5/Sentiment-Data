Prices touched $3,833 during the trading session before easing slightly, while spot levels held at $3,829, up by 1.9% and US futures for December closed at $3,855.20, a gain of 1.2%, according to data from CNBC. Meanwhile, the US dollar index plunged by 0.2%, making all gold priced in dollars cheaper for international buyers, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. The surge came as investors sought safety on expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, looming political gridlock in Washington, and renewed conflict overseas. David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures, said: “Safe-haven demand focused on the potential US government shutdown is one of the driving factors behind gold’s rally. The dollar is under some light pressure in response to that, certainly supporting the precious metals complex.” President Donald Trump met with senior congressional leaders on Monday to push for an extension of government funding. Without a deal, the United States would face a federal shutdown starting Wednesday. That standoff added fuel to gold’s run, which is already up more than 43% this year. Fed cuts and global conflicts drive momentum Friday’s release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index came in line with forecasts, reassuring markets that the Fed has space to ease policy. Traders are betting on cuts at the October and December meetings. Meger added: “The PCE data from last week was viewed as not standing in the way of an additional one or two Fed rate cuts. They continue to be a supportive factor for gold and silver.” Overseas, the war in Ukraine added to safe-haven flows as Russia’s defense ministry announced that its troops had taken control of the village of Shandryholove in the eastern Donetsk region, a sign of yet another escalation by president Vlad Putin. In the corporate arena, the world’s largest gold miner Newmont revealed that CEO Tom Palmer will retire at the end of the year after more than a decade at the company. Rival Barrick confirmed earlier in the day that its CEO Mark Bristow had also stepped down. Elsewhere, silver jumped 1.9% to $46.85, its strongest in over 14 years. Platinum advanced 1.5% to $1,592.65, a level last touched 12 years ago. Palladium was the outlier, slipping 1.1% to $1,255.61. AI stocks rebound as Wall Street steadies While gold grabbed headlines, U.S. equities also regained ground after a rough week. The S&P 500 added 0.26% to close at 6,661.21, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.48% to finish at 22,591.15. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched higher by 68.78 points, or 0.15%, ending at 46,316.07. That bounce came after the prior week marked the S&P’s weakest since August 1, the Nasdaq’s softest since early August, and the Dow’s first loss in three weeks. Tech stocks linked to the AI trade helped lift sentiment. Nvidia gained about 2% following concerns that its infrastructure projects with OpenAI might struggle with energy demands. Advanced Micro Devices added over 1%, while Micron Technology surged more than 4%. These showed investors were still betting on chips despite doubts about the pace of expansion. Away from tech, Electronic Arts soared 4.5% after confirming plans to go private in a $55 billion deal. That announcement added to a wave of corporate activity. Goldman Sachs calculated that U.S. mergers and acquisitions this year have already topped $1 trillion, up 29% compared to the same period last year. Despite last week’s stumble, the return of buyers on Monday steadied Wall Street. But the real spotlight stayed on gold, now locked in as the leading hedge against Washington’s budget fight, Fed policy, and a world on edge.

Dogecoin (DOGE), long a community favorite, continues to draw attention for its mainstream recognition and meme-driven momentum. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is turning out to be one of the next-gen DeFi platforms with future-proof lending and borrowing solutions that are above hype. Mutuum Finance is presently at stage 6 level of $0.035 in its presale. Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $16.52 million and onboarded more than 16,640 holders, demonstrating a positive sign regarding market sentiment. Mutuum Finance’s high potential for upside, in that it could outcompete regular meme coins by offering real utility and explosive expansion next year Dogecoin Struggles to Keep the Line as Bears Close in Dogecoin (DOGE) is facing a severe test this week, falling 17% to around $0.225 as vulnerability in the broader market drags Bitcoin beneath $110K and Ethereum beneath $4,000. The $0.20 level has now become a strong psychological support, with bulls fighting hard to hold it to avoid further decline. On the upper side, the $0.25 remains the first key resistance, and turning it around could be the key to a push towards $0.288. Technical indicators, however, show a cautious outlook: the RSI is at 34, pointing to intense selling pressure, and a bearish MACD signals bearish momentum. If $0.20 holds, the next big support is at $0.189, a price level that may decide DOGE’s near future fate. And with critical PCE figures imminent, the volatility would only be amplified. While DOGE investors await this make-or-break test, attention is already being focused on new Mutuum Finance which is alternatives with better fundamentals. Mutuum Finance Presale Numbers Show Strong Support Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has set a new presale record milestone at Stage 6 today. Tokens are valued at $0.035 today, up by 16.17% from the previous round. The investor interest continues to be high, with over 16,640 investors investing more than $16.52 million thus far. In line with its people-first philosophy, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway as an expression of gratitude to early backers. 10 users will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, and this is indicative of the project’s dedication to long-term value creation and building its network. Improved Security and Efficient Risk Management Security matters the most to Mutuum Finance. The company initiated a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program to motivate developers and security researchers toward bug discovery and reporting. The findings are graded on four stages of severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, to provide end-to-end protection against threats and platform security strategy. In effect, Mutuum Finance is an LTV protocol that is risk-adjusted. Every asset has a collateral limit properly calibrated based on the risk of the asset to yield a more secure and balanced lending platform. Additional safeguarding of users during times of volatile market conditions, the protocol has a buffer reserve mechanism wherein higher-risk assets have proportionally higher reserve values as additional collateral. Dynamic LTV rates and liquidation rates are calibrated against prevailing market conditions so that the protocol is extremely responsive and volatility-sensitive. Reserve multipliers from a range of as low as 10% on riskier classes to 35% on more conservative classes represent an additional level of systemic hedges. Efficiency is the other corner of Mutuum Finance’s paradigm. Assets are minimized to be kept as collateral in an attempt to be capable of utilizing utmost amounts of capital, and correlated assets of the same type are optimized for ultimate lending and borrowing efficiency. Altogether, these deals reduce the risk of insolvency, promote user confidence, and create a more stable and sustainable lending market. Mutuum’s Edge 2025 could see DOGE keep going off community-momentum of its own, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is turning out to be the superior growth wager. Its DeFi strategy, good security, and real utility make it stand out. Having raised $16.52 million and having over 16,640 investors already committed at $0.035, momentum is building rapidly.

Related Reading: XRP Gets A Retirement Twist: Expert Calls It A 401(k) The resolution of Ripple’s case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2025 cleared a long-standing obstacle, confirming that XRP is not a security in secondary transactions. This milestone has motivated major institutions to get involved. XRP ETF Launch and Institutional Catalysts Drive Rally The debut of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) marked a notable regulatory shift, with $37.7 million in first-day trading volume. BlackRock’s partnership with Ripple on its RLUSD stablecoin and Ripple’s application for Federal Reserve payment access through a national trust bank charter showcase the project’s growing institutional presence. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity network, which processed $1.3 trillion in Q2 2025, further strengthens XRP’s role in cross-border settlements. September’s rally saw XRP rise by 385%, stabilizing between $2.86 and $2.87 while whales accumulated tens of millions of tokens. With six more ETF applications pending approval in October and CME preparing to list XRP options on October 13, the token’s bullish catalysts remain strong. Analysts project medium- to long-term price targets ranging from $5 to $22, with some anticipating $30 or higher by 2026. XRP's price trends sideways on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Technical Outlook: Key Levels to Watch XRP remains above its $2.80 support level, even as volatility continues. Resistance is forming around $3.00, with a breakout likely to pave the way toward $3.40, $4.00, and ultimately $5. Surpassing the $5 mark could boost momentum toward $7. On the downside, immediate support is at $2.60, with further levels at $2.25 and $2.00. Technical indicators are still favorable, with the CCI (50) and Directional Movement Index indicating bullish signs. Traders are considering dip-buying around $2.60, with stop losses near $2.00 and profit targets between $4 and $5. Whale Influence and ETF Scrutiny Despite rising institutional confidence, concerns over concentrated XRP ownership persist. The recent Cyber Hornet ETF filing with the SEC flagged whale dominance as a potential risk, arguing that large holders retain the power to influence price movements disproportionately. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, XRP’s pre-minted supply structure increases liquidity concerns, making it more vulnerable to large transactions. Regulators worldwide have taken notice, with high-value transfers now under closer scrutiny.

The recovery comes as investors are growing ahead of the fourth quarter, supported by an $800 million jump in open interest and rising funding rates. The flagship cryptocurrency rallied on Sunday, rising over 2% to reclaim $112,000 and settle at $112,197. The price is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $113,805. Countries To Ramp Up Bitcoin (BTC) Purchases Jan3 founder Samson Mow believes countries are preparing to ramp up Bitcoin (BTC) adoption after initial skepticism. Mow stated, “I think we’re on the tail end of gradually, and we’re at the beginning phases of suddenly. These things happen very quickly.” Speaking on the What Bitcoin Did podcast, Samson stated that countries are warming up to the idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, adding, “It’s like literally gradually, then suddenly. I think it is simply a matter of time before we see a massive run-up, and we see a massive nation-state FOMO, you know, panic.” However, Mow emphasized that while President Donald Trump had signed an executive order for a Bitcoin reserve, the US had yet to begin buying. Bitcoin Whale Moves Funds After 12 Years A dormant Bitcoin wallet holding $44 million worth of BTC has moved the funds for the first time in 12 years, according to data from Lookonchain. Data shows the wallet transferred around 400 BTC in equal batches of 15, roughly emptying the wallet. While the transaction data does not show the source of the funds, Lookonchain stated that the wallet was funded by miners 15 years ago. The reason behind the transfers also remains unknown, as does the identity of the wallet owner. Satoshi-era Bitcoin wallets have seen a jump in activity as Bitcoin surges to new highs. Holders have been keen to liquidate their holdings and lock in their profits. Galaxy Digital executed one of the largest Bitcoin sales in history, completing a transaction of over 80,000 BTC , valued at more than $9 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has made a strong start to the week as it recovers from last week’s bloodbath. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a marginal decline on Saturday before rallying, rising over 2% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,197. BTC is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $114,086. Market analyst Jordi Visser stated that BTC’s path to new all-time highs will be littered with major corrections of 20% or more in Q4. Visser compared the flagship cryptocurrency to Nvidia, the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, and the first to reach a $4 trillion valuation, adding that BTC could behave similarly. “I just want to remind people that Nvidia is up over 1,000% since ChatGPT’s launch. During that time period, which is less than three years, you've had five corrections of 20% or more in Nvidia before it went back up to all-time highs. Bitcoin's going to do the same thing.” BTC’s strong recovery is supported by a surge in buying pressure that began on Sunday. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency has gained over 4% in the past two sessions, undoing the losses from Thursday’s decline. Farzam Ehsani, CEO and co-founder of VALR, stated, “Bitcoin’s Monday morning rise reflects a mix of macro relief, with a softer U.S. dollar and steadier rate expectations, alongside a cleaned-up leverage after recent liquidations and renewed accumulation from larger players.” According to most experts, last week’s losses were largely due to quarter-end rebalancing. Open interest for CME’s Bitcoin futures dropped almost $3 billion to $14.73 billion between September 18 and 25. Meanwhile, options fell to $4.63 billion. Spot Bitcoin ETFs also registered substantial outflows last week as part of the rebalancing. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.41% to $115,282 on Sunday. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 2% to $112,736. Sellers retained control on Tuesday with BTC falling 0.64% to a low of $111,502 before settling at $112,017. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 1% to reclaim $113,000 and settling at $113,348. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The price recovered on Friday, rising 0.61% but was back in the red on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $109,681. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,197. Bullish sentiment has persisted during the ongoing session, with BTC up almost 2%, trading around $114,040. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Ethereum Price Predictions: What’s Got The Market So Bullish? This conviction follows a strong confluence of support, with the lower boundary of a 2-month brewing bull flag pattern aligning with a broader ascending channel at $3,800. The setup has created a launchpad, flipping to level from past resistance to support as momentum indicators turned bullish. The RSI has sharply recovered from the oversold threshold at 30, often marking a bottom as sellers exhaust and buyers step in. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram is approaching the signal line in a potential golden cross, suggesting this bounce could mark the start of a lasting uptrend. The $4,500 level stands as the key threshold for a bull flag breakout. If fully realised, the pattern targets a new all-time high at $5,560 and a retest of the broader ascending channel. With a breakout here too, the Ethereum price could extend towards $8,000 , representing nearly a 100% gain from current levels. With stacking catalysts like U.S. interest rate cuts and new staking ETH ETFs attracting inflows, this setup could be realised before year-end. A breakdown below $3,800, however, could set sights back on past accumulation zones. A 15% fall to $3,500 could be the next floor.

This on-chain move signals wallet activity but does not confirm a sale or transfer to an exchange. 400 Bitcoin moved after 12 years Arkham Intelligence on-chain data shows the address was dormant since November 2013. Bitcoin price context: ~ $720 in 2013 versus over $114,000 today (CoinGecko data). 400 Bitcoin moved: long-dormant wallet reactivated after 2013; learn implications and market context—read the full analysis from COINOTAG. What happened when a long-dormant address moved 400 Bitcoin? 400 Bitcoin were spent from an address that had been inactive since November 2013, according to Arkham Intelligence on-chain records. The transaction moved roughly $44 million worth of BTC and marks one of several high-profile reactivations of Satoshi-era-era wallets in 2025. Why did a 2013 Bitcoin wallet move after 12 years? Old addresses holding large balances often belong to early miners or long-term holders. In 2013 Bitcoin traded near $720 (CoinGecko), and miners could mine coins on desktop setups. Institutional custody practices and secondary-market trades can explain late movements, but a wallet reactivation alone does not prove intent to sell. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/400-bitcoin-wallet-reactivated-2013"" }, ""headline"": ""Long-dormant address moves 400 Bitcoin for first time since 2013"", ""description"": ""An address holding 400 Bitcoin moved after 12 years of dormancy; on-chain data and market context analyzed by COINOTAG."", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-09-29T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-09-29T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""articleBody"": ""An address that held 400 Bitcoin moved funds for the first time since November 2013. Arkham Intelligence on-chain records identify the transaction, which transferred roughly $44 million at current market prices. Reactivations of old wallets can reflect a range of activities from custodial reshuffles to sales, and should be interpreted in context with exchange flows and known institutional actions.""} How significant is a 400 BTC move for markets? Moves of several hundred Bitcoin can prompt trader attention because such reactivations historically preceded increased volatility. However, context matters: earlier in 2025 a 14-year holder sold 80,000 BTC in a single execution that involved institutional coordination. Market impact depends on whether coins go to exchanges or into cold storage. What on-chain signals help interpret this reactivation? Key signals include destination address type, exchange deposit patterns, and clustering analysis. Arkham Intelligence tracing can show whether outputs moved to custodial wallets or were split across multiple addresses—each pattern implies different intent. Frequently Asked Questions Did the wallet owner necessarily sell 400 Bitcoin? No. A transfer from a long-dormant address is a reactivation of funds but does not confirm a sale. Coins may be moved to new cold storage, multisig custody, or to exchanges—additional on-chain signals are required to infer selling. How does a wallet from 2013 likely originate? Addresses from that era commonly belong to early miners or initial adopters. Mining then required only desktop hardware; those coins often remained untouched for years until reactivation or estate transfers. Can this move drive Bitcoin price swings? Potentially—but not automatically. Price impact rises if large holdings are consolidated and transferred to exchanges.

The move follows the agency’s September 18 approval of generic listing standards, which streamline the process for bringing new cryptocurrency ETFs to market. SCOOP: The @SECGov has asked issuers of $LTC , $XRP , $SOL , $ADA , and $DOGE ETFs to withdraw their 19b-4 filings following the approval of the generic listing standards, which replace the need for those filings. Am told withdrawals could start happening as soon as this week. — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) September 29, 2025 The instruction does not represent a setback for issuers. Instead, it reflects a procedural shift that eliminates the need for case-by-case exchange rule changes for each token. Crypto ETF Market Expands Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum Under New Rules Under the new framework, exchanges such as Nasdaq, Cboe BZX, and NYSE Arca can list crypto ETFs under generic rules , provided the products meet predefined criteria. The SEC’s new generic ETF listing rule compresses approval timelines and shifts pressure onto issuers to meet operational demands quickly. #sec #etf https://t.co/F6kKt6gFMS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 25, 2025 Issuers now advance directly with S-1 registration statements, the last step before an ETF can launch. Withdrawals of the now-unnecessary 19b-4 filings are expected to begin this week, with several October deadlines approaching for existing applications. At least 16 proposals covering tokens beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum remain under SEC review. The shift is part of what regulators describe as a maturing framework for cryptocurrency financial products. The agency’s approval of generic standards was designed to provide a stable platform for digital asset ETFs while including exemptions that encourage on-chain capital market development. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the new framework reduces barriers while maintaining investor protection, noting that the rules support innovation without compromising oversight. For issuers including Grayscale, 21Shares, and VanEck, the change is important. Previously, each product required two separate approvals: one from the exchange via a 19b-4 filing and another from the asset manager through an S-1. The dual process often stretched nine months or more. With generic standards in place, timelines can shrink to as few as 75 days. The SEC has already applied the new framework in practice. On September 18, the regulator approved Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) , the first multi-crypto exchange-traded product to list under the streamlined system. The @SECGov has approved @Grayscale 's Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), marking the first multi-crypto ETP to hit the market. #SEC #Grayscale https://t.co/bKCqaHSrdA — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 18, 2025 GDLC offers exposure to Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, and currently manages over $915 million in assets. Its approval marked a turning point for multi-asset crypto products in the U.S. market. The change comes amid a flood of new filings. On September 17, issuers submitted at least five fresh ETF proposals , ranging from a Bitwise spot Avalanche ETF to Tuttle’s “Income Blast” funds covering Bonk, Litecoin, and Sui. ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci said the applications demonstrate how quickly the market is expanding beyond traditional Bitcoin and Ethereum products. SEC Faces Wave of Crypto ETF Deadlines as Solana, XRP Filings Near Key Dates More than 92 crypto ETF applications are now pending before the SEC. Deadlines for several of those filings fall in October and November. Franklin Templeton’s Solana and XRP ETF applications face a November 14 decision after the SEC used its maximum 60-day extension authority earlier this month. SEC postpones Franklin Solana ETF ruling by 60 days to November 14 as 92 crypto ETF applications await review despite 99% approval odds. #Solana #ETF https://t.co/GIIlmQmsgt — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 11, 2025 BlackRock’s amendment to add staking to its iShares Ethereum Trust is now due October 30. Grayscale’s Hedera Trust decision is scheduled for November 12, while proposals tied to Dogecoin, Litecoin, and other altcoins are scattered across the same timeframe. Bloomberg analysts project over a 95% chance of approval for Solana and XRP ETFs before year-end, despite repeated extensions. Prediction markets reflect similar optimism, with Polymarket odds on a Solana ETF approval currently at 99% . Analysts argue that the new standards make the timeline less dependent on formal deadlines, since the SEC can approve S-1 filings at any time if products meet eligibility requirements. The SEC is also coordinating with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on broader digital asset regulation. A joint roundtable is planned to align approaches across agencies as part of Chair Atkins’ “Project Crypto” initiative , launched in July to modernize securities rules for the digital era. For investors and issuers, the withdrawal of 19b-4 filings shows how the regulatory environment is shifting from case-by-case hurdles to standardized procedures. While many products still await review, the procedural streamlining shows faster paths to market for a wide range of cryptocurrency ETFs.

If Congress doesn’t agree on a funding deal by midnight Tuesday, large parts of the federal government will stop running. The shutdown would freeze economic reports, delay key data, and make life harder for anyone trying to predict what the Federal Reserve will do next with interest rates. That uncertainty would rattle Bitcoin and the wider crypto market. Traders are especially focused on the jobs report. It’s supposed to drop this Friday, but if there’s no funding, it won’t. That’s a problem, because employment data directly affects the Fed’s interest rate decisions, and Bitcoin traders rely on that information to know where the market’s going. Without it, some will hesitate, others will panic, and volatility could jump fast. Shutdown delays data, feeds Bitcoin swings This shutdown wouldn’t hit everything, but it would stall agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and releases economic data, as Cryptopolitan has reported . If the payroll report doesn’t come out, it won’t just delay numbers—it’ll shake confidence across financial markets. Analysts from Bitunix warned that this kind of delay “heightens fragility,” saying a mix of rate-cut hopes, political drama, and market fear could lead to “sharp drop-and-rebound swings” for Bitcoin and other risk assets. Deutsche Bank’s John Reid said the jobs report could be the first real casualty. “This week’s big event might not actually happen,” he said. “Back in October 2013, the shutdown meant we didn’t get the September jobs report until the 22nd of the month.” So, traders could be staring at a data blackout that lasts for weeks, just when they need clarity. That kind of delay can trigger wild price movements. Nansen’s Nicolai Sondergaard said a shutdown “could spike short-term volatility” in crypto. But he added , “I do wonder if it will be more than that, if investors at large assume the ‘shutdown’ will be resolved quickly.” He also said it’s possible the broader financial markets feel the hit before anything happens at all. As of now, Bitcoin is trading over $114,000, up 3.8% in the past 24 hours. But it’s still down 0.7% compared to two weeks ago, according to CoinGecko. That tells you where the mood is: slightly up, but uncertain as hell. Shutdowns have hit Bitcoin both ways This wouldn’t be Bitcoin’s first shutdown. In 2013, a 16-day closure sent the coin up 14%—from $132.04 to $151.34. But during the record-long 35-day shutdown between December 2018 and January 2019, Bitcoin dropped 6%, going from $3,802.22 to $3,575.85. The difference? In 2013, the market was in a strong bull run. In 2018, it was bleeding. Julio Moreno from Cryptoquant explained: “The demand for Bitcoin was growing strongly as it entered the final stage of the bull cycle [in 2013].” In contrast, by late 2018, “demand for BTC was contracting during a bear market.” Now, he says, things look more like 2013. “Bitcoin demand is growing, as we enter Q4, which is typically a positive season in terms of price performance.” Still, nothing is guaranteed. On the prediction market Myriad, run by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan, users are losing faith in future rate cuts. The percentage of people who doubt the Fed will deliver two cuts in 2025 jumped from 40% to 75% just this month. Some expect cuts at the Fed’s last two meetings of the year. Others think no cuts will happen until 2026. Get seen where it counts.

Assembly Bill 471, introduced by Republican members of the Wisconsin Assembly and referred to the Committee on Financial Institutions, aims to shield some digital asset activities from money transmitter licensing requirements. If successful, the bill would make it easier to accept crypto payments, build blockchain software, run mining rigs, or even stake tokens, without having to secure a state license. Wisconsin Republicans propose protections The bill exempts a range of cryptocurrency-related activities, such as mining, staking, and digital asset-for-digital asset exchanges where no conversion to legal tender occurs, from licensing requirements. In addition, the legislation introduces a securities exemption for third-party providers offering technical staking services, so long as any rewards distributed are strictly those generated by the blockchain network itself. This measure is expected to make Wisconsin a more attractive jurisdiction for crypto entrepreneurs in a country that has taken a pro-crypto stance since the return of President Donald Trump to the White House. The regulatory landscape is divided The push for AB471 comes as Wisconsin lawmakers remain split on how to handle crypto-related issues. While Republican lawmakers are more pro-crypto and champions of advancing proposals that increase penetration and crypto-activities in the state, Democrats have taken a more defensive approach. Democrats in the state legislature have filed bills seeking stricter oversight of cryptocurrency kiosks , citing their role in facilitating scams targeting elderly residents. A bill filed in July in the Assembly by state House Democrats wants to mandate all virtual currency kiosks operating in the state to have a Division of Banking license. It also wants to mandate the kiosks to project fraud alert warnings and the performance of full KYC by kiosk operators. In addition, the bill caps daily transactions per customer at $1,000. The bill was filed in the state senate by Democrats in August and has been referred to the Committee on Financial Institutions and Sporting Heritage. The two approaches by the state’s legislators highlight the tension between promoting innovation and addressing consumer protection risks. Critics, however, warn that these exemptions could open the door to abuses and complicate coordination with federal regulators such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Wisconsin is not the first state to pursue crypto-friendly legislation, but the breadth of its proposed exemptions sets it apart. States such as Wyoming and Texas have passed laws providing clarity for digital asset custody, mining, and token issuance, with many states having crypto-related bills waiting to move to the next level. If AB471 passes, Wisconsin could position itself alongside Wyoming as one of the most permissive environments for Bitcoin businesses in the US. Market participants say that could attract firms engaged in staking, node operation, and software development.

The letter urged the agency to investigate Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software for its reported failures to properly detect and respond to railroad crossings. There is a growing number of reported near-collisions The Full Self-Driving system Tesla boasts allows a vehicle to drive occupants “almost anywhere,” and they don’t have to do anything; it handles everything from route navigation to lane changes, steering and parking. However, it still requires the supervision of a human driver. Democratic Senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal, in their letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, want a probe, citing the growing number of these reported near-collisions. “Although mistakes such as a missed traffic sign or an illegal lane change are dangerous, a miscalculation at a train crossing can lead to catastrophic, multi-fatality collisions involving vehicle occupants, train passengers, and rail workers,” the letter reads. The NHTSA has launched an investigation into Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system since October 2024 after four reported collisions occurred in reduced roadway visibility conditions like sun glare, fog or airborne dust. The two senators now want the NHTSA to consider imposing limitations on Tesla’s use of the system. “The agency should consider clear and obvious actions to protect the public, including restricting Tesla’s FSD to the road and weather conditions it was designed to operate in,” they said. Tesla’s FSD shows promise in some real-world applications The letter from the senators is turning up amid a broader scrutiny of Tesla’s autonomous driving tech. Aside from the probe the NHTSA launched in October 2024, in January 2025, the agency started investigating 2.6 million Teslas over crashes linked to a remote vehicle-movement feature. The NHTSA is also looking into Tesla’s deployment of self-driving robotaxis in Austin, Texas, which launched in June. It has avoided making hasty conclusions, and according to a July 1 email, the agency claimed to still be reviewing the deployment and demanded to know if Tesla employees would be able to remotely operate the vehicles. Recent shortcomings with the FSD have become ammo for critics like Dan O’Dowd, CEO of Green Hills Software and founder of The Dawn Project, a group that has been campaigning to ban Tesla FSD. In a September 20, 2025 X post, Dan shared a video of a Tesla on FSD moving towards an active railroad crossing. Even though there were flashing red lights, the vehicle kept going without stopping, and the whole time, the driver’s feet were positioned away from the pedals to demonstrate hands-off operation. O’Dowd has predicted the flaw “is going to kill somebody” and has accused supporters of ignoring the piling evidence. In the video he shared, the car could be seen steadily advancing toward and crossing the tracks despite the visible warnings, aligning with the senators’ concerns about detection failures. However, some defenders of Tesla have said this flaw is not enough to outrightly dismiss the FSD technology, instead of encouraging its evolution. Some have been sharing positive experiences with the FSD as well. However, the railroad detection issue and increasing number of near-collisions are real issues that could ultimately lead to regulatory bumps if Tesla cannot convince the NHTSA and its users that the tech is safe.

Bitcoin appears ready to surpass its historic high of $124,128, set back in August, although it has remained a consistent challenge over what has been a bearish September. On the regulatory side, the US crypto industry is expecting long-awaited clarity. President Trump signed the GENIUS Act earlier this summer, the nation’s first law mandating full-reserve backing for stablecoins. Around the same time, the SEC introduced Project Crypto, an initiative designed to align securities regulations with blockchain-based assets. Together, these policy shifts could provide the backdrop for the next major altcoin run. According to ChatGPT’s forecasts, XRP, Solana, and Pi Network could rank among the most significant winners in the months ahead. XRP (Ripple): ChatGPT Predicts $20 Potential, A 7× Jump ChatGPT suggests that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could rally to $20 by late 2025, roughly seven times its current level of $2.86. The token has already enjoyed a breakout year, breaking past its 2018 record of $3.40 before hitting $3.65 on July 18, followed by a 22% correction down to current levels. XRP’s global relevance continues to expand, highlighted by its 2024 recognition from the UN Capital Development Fund as a practical solution for low-cost cross-border transfers in emerging markets. Ripple also closed its long-running dispute with the SEC earlier this year, after the agency dropped its case, reinforcing the pivotal 2023 ruling that XRP’s retail sales were not securities. That decision remains a landmark win for the entire altcoin ecosystem. ChatGPT projects XRP will likely trade in the $5–$10 range heading into 2026, with upside toward $20 if the Trump administration delivers on anticipated crypto legislation. In addition, several high-profile spot XRP ETF applications are expected to receive approval by mid-October, potentially unlocking significant institutional inflows. Technicals also back the case for growth. XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) hovers around 46, giving it plenty more room for [roce growth in the near-term, while bullish chart structures, like the appearance of three bullish flag formations across its support and resistance lines this year, suggest a breakout may be brewing. XRP could revisit $4 by October, building on its 354% gain over the past 12 months, which ultimately proved more profitable than Bitcoin’s 71% and Ethereum’s 56% returns. Solana (SOL): ETF Speculation and Ecosystem Growth Could Drive a $600 Run Solana ($SOL) has solidified its place as a leading smart contract network, supported by a $112.8 billion market cap and $11.27 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) across its DeFi ecosystem. Institutional adoption and developer activity remain strong. Speculation around a potential U.S. spot Solana ETF is growing, raising expectations of inflows similar to those seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Adding fuel to the narrative, Trump has floated the possibility of Solana being included in a future U.S. Bitcoin reserve, though under his proposal, the government would acquire tokens only through asset seizures, not open-market purchases, unlike Bitcoin. From a price perspective, Solana hit $250 in January, dropped to $100 by April, and has recovered to $207. Last week, it hovered around $220 more than once, nearly testing this year’s highs. After breaking out of a descending wedge, ChatGPT predicts a path to $600 by year’s end, double its former record of $293.31. Achieving that would likely require favorable regulatory moves and ETF approvals. Pi Network ($PI): ChatGPT Predicts Aggressive Growth From Tap-to-Mine Model Pi Network ($PI) is famous for pioneering the mobile-based “tap-to-mine” system, allowing users to earn tokens simply by logging into the app daily and tapping. Currently priced near $0.2655, ChatGPT outlines a best-case scenario where the coin could skyrocket to $3 by year’s end, a tidy increase of more than 11x. Given the team’s hands-on development of the network, some upcoming milestones may provide justification for bullish expectations. The developers have been steadily rolling out new upgrades in recent weeks, passing from version 19 towards version 23 and a potential mainnet launch after, both of which could inject fresh momentum. Since its February 2025 debut, Pi Network has displayed extreme volatility, including a 171% rally in May. Its RSI now sits at just 29, reflecting deep undervaluation and potential for a rebound. Seeing a return to February’s $2.99 peak is a reasonable, though ambitious, target. Even if the ultra-bullish case doesn’t unfold, October’s historic seasonality in crypto could support prices climbing up towards the dollar by November. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A New Canine Meme Coin is Coming For DOGE through Degen Community Building Fun For investors hunting higher-risk bets outside ChatGPT’s top calls, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presents itself as Dogecoin’s “degen cousin,” leaning into people’s love of high-volatility plays and degen meme culture as its core narrative. While Dogecoin has evolved into a mainstream digital asset, Maxi Doge fully embraces its speculative image. Its presale has already raised more than $2.6 million within the first month. Launched as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI is pushing hardcore grassroots community growth through viral channels like Telegram and Discord, as well as trading competitions and collaborations with other projects. Of the 150.24 billion tokens minted, about 25% are reserved for the “Maxi Fund,” a pool dedicated to marketing and partnerships. Staking is live during the presale, currently offering yields of 129% APY, though these rewards shrink as participation grows. The current presale price sits at $0.0002595, with incremental increases set for each subsequent funding round. Investors can join via the official Maxi Doge site using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Bitcoin remains about 10% down from its all-time high (ATH) of $124,128, set last month. At the same time, its dominance is falling, and investor enthusiasm has spilled over into leading altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have reached fresh milestones over the past year. Much of this renewed momentum can be traced back to two landmark policy changes in Washington. First, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the country’s first comprehensive stablecoin regulatory bill. Soon after, the SEC unveiled Project Crypto, an initiative designed to update securities laws for the digital asset age. With sentiment improving, attention has turned to major altcoins such as XRP, Pepe, and Dogecoin, which are being watched as some of the most attractive dip-buying opportunities ahead of a potential bull cycle. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payments Leader and 2025’s Best Crypto Altcoin Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) spiked to a record $3.65 on July 18, coinciding with the GENIUS Act’s passage, surpassing its previous 2018 peak of $3.40. It has since corrected to around $2.86, about 22% below the recent high. XRP’s appeal lies in its role as a cost-efficient solution for international remittances, positioning it as a modern alternative to legacy systems such as SWIFT. Its reputation has been reinforced by endorsements from the UN Capital Development Fund and recognition within the U.S. financial community. Ripple’s regulatory clout was also evident earlier this year when CEO Brad Garlinghouse joined a White House panel on crypto policy. The launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, shows its ambition to capture a slice of the fast-growing stablecoin sector. Momentum accelerated after a decisive 2023 court ruling determined XRP’s retail transactions were not securities, marking a watershed moment in Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC. In the past 12 months, XRP has soared 354%, essentially quintupling Bitcoin’s 70% gains over the same period. Following July’s surge, XRP found support near $3 before seasonal weakness in September pulled it below that level. At present, its RSI sits near 42 and appears to be trending lower, offering further discounting potential. While interest rate cuts and the approval of the first spot XRP ETF didn’t spark an immediate rally, likely because markets had priced them in, upcoming ETF rulings in October could push XRP past the $4 threshold in short order. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Meme Coin Pioneer’s Push Toward $1 Created in 2013 as a lighthearted joke, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into the most widely recognized meme coin, backed by a loyal community and currently valued at $34.8 billion in market cap. The token broke into the mainstream in 2021, boosted by high-profile supporters including Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons. This May, institutional speculation around a possible U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF drove DOGE back above $0.25. It now trades at roughly $0.2307, up 2% overnight in line with the broader market rally. The $74.6 billion meme sector, represented by Dogecoin, has only risen a modest 0.4%, while it has kept pace with more established names like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. It appears investors are flipping to a risk-on outlook, but not quite risk-embracing enough to go for smaller market cap meme coins. DOGE’s RSI stands near 44, hinting at plenty of headroom for further price rises over the week. Additionally, October is historically a bullish month for crypto, which could fuel significant upside. With Tesla accepting DOGE for select payments and major platforms like PayPal and Revolut expanding integration, Dogecoin’s real-world use cases continue to grow. Should momentum hold, DOGE could test $0.50 by mid-October, with the much-discussed $1 milestone still on the horizon. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): The Best Meme Coin for Utility Among Blue Chip Crypto Projects Launched in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has risen to become the second-largest meme coin, carrying a market cap of almost $7 billion. In the last 24 hours, SHIB gained 1.4%, which means that, like its inspiration, Dogecoin, it outperformed the broader meme coin sector. SHIB’s relative resilience, large market cap, and expanding functionality make it trade more like a blue-chip digital asset than a speculative meme coin. It currently trades at around $0.00001179. Technically, SHIB has formed two bullish setups in the past year: a descending wedge (November–March) and a flag pattern since May. Breaking resistance at $0.000022 could open a path toward $0.00003 by late October, with more aggressive targets between $0.00006 and $0.00009 possible if a strong bull run develops. Unlike many meme tokens, SHIB has meaningful applications. These include Shibarium, an Ethereum-based Layer-2 solution designed to cut fees and speed up transactions, as well as privacy-enhancing tools aimed at broadening adoption. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Layer-2 Presale Reaching for 2025 Growth Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as one of 2025’s most promising presales, aiming to combine Bitcoin’s security with the scalability of Layer-2 technology while leveraging meme-driven virality and decentralized governance. The project seeks to expand Bitcoin’s utility by enabling faster payments, smart contract functionality, and community-led decision-making. So far, the presale has raised over $18.8 million, with analysts predicting post-launch upside of 10× or more. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers low-cost smart contracts and features a Canonical Bridge that enables near-instant Bitcoin transfers while also supporting dApps, meme tokens, and payment solutions. A recent Coinsult audit found no vulnerabilities, further boosting confidence. The HYPER token underpins the ecosystem through staking, transaction fees, and governance rights. Early participants can earn up to 63% APY through staking and receive voting power once governance goes live.

52448202,591831,1759185015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52448202.jpeg,Not A Fan Of Ethereum? ARK Invest’s CEO Cathie Wood Reveals Favorite Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/not-a-fan-of-ethereum/,"Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, has built a reputation as one of the most outspoken advocates of the crypto industry. In recent remarks, she made it clear that while she sees value in Ethereum’s ecosystem, her conviction lies most strongly with Bitcoin. Her stance is rooted not only in her most recent statements, but in a consistent narrative she’s developed over the years. Bitcoin Is The Pure Cryptocurrency While speaking on The Master Investor podcast hosted by Wilfred Frost on YouTube, Cathie Wood reiterated her belief that Bitcoin is the pure cryptocurrency and described it as the global quantity rules-based monetary system. She noted that Bitcoin’s Layer-1 blockchain has never been hacked, and this sets it apart from other networks. She also expressed concern that Ethereum may lose dominance as Layer-2 solutions capture more activity and fees. “In fact, Bitcoin owns the cryptocurrency space when it comes to pure crypto,” she said. “We think it’s going to be the biggest one by far,” she continued. Despite her preference for Bitcoin, Wood has softened somewhat toward Ethereum in certain respects. She acknowledged Ethereum’s importance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and said it plays a very important role in the ecosystem. However, this importance could be undermined by other Layer-2 networks like Coinbase’s Base, which are going to be competing with one another. Earlier Statements And Views On Crypto Assets More recently, Cathie Wood praised Ethereum’s shift toward zero-knowledge proof (ZK) scaling techniques, even if she admitted she doesn’t fully grasp all the technical details. “I can’t say I understand all of the details, but the Ethereum Foundation does seem to be proposing the right moves for scalability and privacy,” she said on the social media platform X. At the same time, the Ark Invest CEO also noted some new protocols and on-chain derivatives platforms like Uniswap as ones to watch. She compared Hyperliquid to Solana’s early days and noted that it has promising potential. Still, she has been clear that not every cryptocurrency earns her confidence. Wood has stated openly that she is not a believer in the vast majority of tokens circulating in the market. Instead, her conviction rests on a few core assets that she believes will dominate in the long term. In her view, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana stand apart as the big three. “Those are the big three right now,” she said. She acknowledged the importance of stablecoins but also noted that they do not belong in the same category as these leading cryptocurrencies. Ark Invest, through its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), owns 43,799 BTC worth $4.91 billion. Cathie Wood has made strong, repeated predictions for Bitcoin’s future value. Back in May, she reaffirmed her belief that Bitcoin could trade as high as $1.5 million by 2030. The company also maintains exposure to Ethereum, including positions connected to Bitmine Immersion, whose recent Ethereum acquisition spree has made it the biggest Ethereum treasury firm in the world.",Ethereum|ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF|ARKB|Base|bitcoin|Bitmine Immersion|cathie wood|coinbase|decentralized finance|DeFi|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum ecosystem|Ethereum foundation|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum treasury|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Hyperliquid|solana|The Master Investor Podcast|Wilfred Frost|Youtube|Zero-Knowledge Proof|ZK,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|SOL|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-29 22:30:15

XRP and Cardano are up by at least 3% in the past 24 hours, while Plasma, which has almost doubled since launching a few days ago, remains in a very bullish position, despite dropping by 10% today. We examine these three coins in this article, considering their technicals and their fundamentals, and providing a forecast of where they could be in the near and more distant term. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Altcoin Eyes Climb Above $5 As ETF Approvals Get Closer XRP has risen by 3.4% in the past 24 hours, with its current price of $2.87 representing a 2% increase in a week and a 1.5% rise in the past month. What this means is that XRP has begun to recover after a period of falls, with the fourth quarter likely to bring some substantial gains. This prediction comes from two places, with the first being that the coin’s indicators remain in an oversold position, predicting an imminent rebound. In fact, we see XRP’s relative strength index (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) beginning to bounce up from low levels, implying that a significant rebound may have begun. Source: TradingView On top of this, XRP’s fundamentals are possibly the best of any coin in the market, save for Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum and Solana. For one, there are upwards of 10 XRP ETF applications awaiting a decision from the SEC, and analysts give a very high probability of approval . An influx of institutional money into XRP ETFs will send the coin’s price flying, while XRP is also likely to attract greater use and adoption as Ripple continues to grow its business . This all makes for a hugely promising crypto price prediction, with XRP likely to cross $3 in the next couple of weeks, while it also has a good chance of climbing above $5 before 2025 is done. Crypto Price Prediction: Plasma ($XPL) – New Tether-Linked Stablecoin Token Set to Rally Again XPL is the native token of Plasma, a layer-one network designed specifically for stablecoins. Launched by Tether’s sister firm Bitfinex, Plasma already has a total value locked in of $5.5 billion , while it had previously raised in excess of $370 million from investors . This put XPL in a prime position to grow, with the coin up by 80% in relation to its lowest recorded price on CoinGecko ($0.7218). It has corrected by 13% in the past 24 hours, yet its chart shows that it’s positioning nicely for a rebound in the near term. Source: TradingView Its RSI and MACD have both dropped into oversold territory and are close to bottoming, which should mean that the XPL price recovers quickly. It could retest its ATH of $1.68 in the next few weeks, while additional Plasma growth could see it reach $3 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA)—ETF Approval and L1 Growth Will Push Alt to New Highs At $0.7946, ADA is up by 3% in 24 hours, although it remains down by 7% in a fortnight and by 5% in a month. It does, however, boast a 100% increase in the past year, putting it in a good position to make further gains as we get closer to 2026. As with XRP, ADA is waiting for a boost from ETF approvals, and while it has only 1 ETF application to its name, the fact that it’s from Grayscale gives it a strong chance of approval. And for a coin that doesn’t receive too much institutional attention, this ETF could make a big difference. If we look at its chart today, we see that its indicators continue to sit in an oversold range, having struggled to remain above 50 since the end of July. Source: TradingView This would suggest that Cardano is close to rebounding, and there is some indication that whales have been accumulating the token in recent days . When combined with Cardano’s status as one of the major and biggest layer-one networks , such indicators would suggest that the end of the year could be very kind to ADA’s price. It’s likely to regain $1 by the end of October, while an end-of-year bull rally could see it top its ATH of $3.09 and even make it beyond $4. PEPENODE Raises $1.5 Million in Ongoing Presale: Why This Mine-to-Earn Token Could Surge The three tokens above all look extremely promising right now, but if the market does enjoy an end-of-year bull rally, then investors may want to diversify into newer, small-cap tokens as well. This is because such tokens can outperform the market average by considerable margins, particularly if they go viral and gain some big exchange listings. This kind of thing can also happen with presale coins, which can surge when they list for the first time, especially if they’ve had a big sale. One coin enjoying a popular sale at the moment is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 mine-to-earn token that has been attracting lots of attention recently. Are you ready to build your own virtual meme coin mining rig? ◉ Buy Meme Nodes ◉ Upgrade Facilities ◉ Earn meme Coins All on PEPENODE. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/xNoWz5H2Ox — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 28, 2025 It has now raised $1.5 million in its presale, which it opened only a few weeks ago, providing a clear sign of its future potential. PEPENODE has been attracting investment because of its unique value proposition, with the coin boasting an original mine-to-earn system. It invites PEPENODE holders to spend their tokens in order to develop virtual mining rigs, with PEPENODE itself usable to add more nodes to a rig. And the more nodes a user has, the more rewards they will earn, with payouts in popular meme tokens such as FARTCOIN and Pepe. Holders will also be able to stake PEPENODE, with the coin currently offering yields in excess of 800%. This all makes PEPENODE a very bullish prospect, with investors able to join its sale by visiting the PEPENODE website . The coin is currently available at $0.0010788, although this price will rise periodically for the duration of the sale.

A sustained ETH rally would likely re-rate BitMine’s equity given its crypto-heavy treasury and ongoing share buybacks. BitMine holds 2.65M+ ETH, valued at more than $11 billion — above its ~$9–9.2B market cap. Ethereum’s bullish flag pattern and support near $4,100 point to a potential move toward $5,000. BitMine’s share repurchases and treasury accumulation amplify upside if ETH rises; risk remains in market liquidity and demand. BitMine stock: analysis of Ethereum breakout potential and investor implications. Read the data-driven outlook and next steps for shareholders. What is driving BitMine stock’s potential rise? BitMine stock is primarily driven by its large Ethereum treasury and market exposure to ETH price moves. The company holds over 2.65 million ETH, creating a strong balance-sheet lever should Ethereum break to higher levels, while concurrent buybacks reduce outstanding shares and can lift per-share value. How could an Ethereum breakout to $5,000 affect BitMine? If Ethereum reaches $5,000, BitMine’s ETH holdings would be worth roughly $13.25 billion at current reported holdings. That valuation would materially exceed BitMine’s current market capitalization (~$9–9.2B), likely prompting a significant re-rating of the stock if realized and reflected in investor expectations. BitMine’s stock could rise significantly as Ethereum nears a strong breakout. The company holds over $11 billion in crypto assets. BitMine holds over $11 billion in Ethereum, significantly exceeding its $9 billion market cap. Ethereum’s bullish flag pattern suggests the cryptocurrency could break toward $5,000 in the near future. BitMine’s ongoing stock repurchases may enhance shareholder value amid a rising Ethereum price. BitMine (BMNR) stock shows signs of a potential bullish move driven by the company’s concentrated exposure to Ethereum (ETH). Management disclosures indicate a substantial ETH treasury that creates direct sensitivity to Ethereum price action. BitMine’s reported treasury includes more than 2.65 million ETH. At recent prices this was estimated at over $11 billion, which notably exceeds the company’s market capitalization near $9–9.2 billion. BitMine chairman Tom Lee has publicly expressed optimism on Ethereum’s structural role in finance and AI-driven decentralised applications, noting long-term value drivers. Why are Ethereum technicals pointing bullish? Ethereum has held above its 50-day moving average and key support near $4,106, forming a bullish flag continuation pattern. This setup typically signals a consolidation before continuation toward prior highs, with $4,950 and the $5,000 psychological level the next notable targets. Source: TradingView A successful breakout would translate to a higher mark-to-market for BitMine’s ETH holdings. Coupled with ongoing share repurchases, fewer outstanding shares could magnify per-share gains for holders. However, investors should weigh risks including ETH volatility, regulatory changes, and demand dynamics for miner/treasury stocks. How should investors evaluate BitMine’s risk and reward? Assess BitMine by separating intrinsic business operations from treasury exposure. The upside is large if ETH appreciates; downside is meaningful if ETH falls or illiquidity limits realizing treasury value. Monitor on-chain ETH metrics, TradingView technicals, and BitMine’s disclosed buyback cadence for signal confirmation. Frequently Asked Questions How many ETH does BitMine hold? BitMine holds over 2.65 million ETH, which recent estimates value at more than $11 billion based on prevailing market prices. Will BitMine’s buybacks affect shareholder value? Share repurchases reduce outstanding shares and can increase earnings per share and equity value, especially when combined with rising asset values like ETH. Key Takeaways Balance-sheet leverage : BitMine’s large ETH treasury creates asymmetric upside if Ethereum rises. Technical catalyst : Ethereum’s bullish flag and support levels point to a potential move toward $5,000. Risk management : Investors should track buybacks, on-chain ETH data, and market liquidity when sizing positions. Conclusion BitMine’s concentrated Ethereum holdings position the company to benefit materially from an ETH breakout. Investors should combine technical signals on Ethereum with BitMine’s buyback activity and treasury disclosures to form a data-driven view. For shareholders, the next weeks of price action in ETH will be a key determinant of BitMine stock performance. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How many ETH does BitMine hold?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""BitMine holds over 2.65 million ETH, which recent estimates place at more than $11 billion at current market prices."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Could Ethereum rising to $5,000 boost BitMine stock?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

After four years leading New York’s Department of Financial Services, the most powerful crypto regulator in the United States is leaving office this October. Her exit, confirmed Monday by Governor Kathy Hochul, brings an end to a tenure defined by crypto enforcement, consumer protection policies, and major restructuring of a state agency that went from background player to headline-grabbing powerhouse. According to a press release issued by Hochul’s office, Adrienne will be replaced by Kaitlin Asrow, who will take over as Acting Superintendent on October 18. Adrienne, a former Obama administration official, had been appointed by Hochul back in August 2021. Since then, she pushed DFS into the middle of national debates over financial supervision. “It has been a privilege and an honor to serve New Yorkers,” Adrienne said in her official exit statement, thanking both the governor and her team for helping make DFS “a more equitable, transparent, and resilient financial system.” Adrienne Harris oversaw crypto enforcement and financial reforms During Adrienne’s four-year run, DFS recovered over $725 million in restitution for New Yorkers. She became the first person from New York to join the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council. Under her, DFS reworked how check cashing fees are calculated, a move that saved New Yorkers over $22 million. She led efforts to require insurance companies to cover insulin without co-pays. She enforced guardrails around how AI is used in insurance pricing, particularly making sure underwriting wasn’t secretly discriminating against consumers. She also gave final approval to rules that gave DFS power over Pharmacy Benefit Managers, and her team began examining those businesses for the first time. Kaitlin, who has served as Executive Deputy Superintendent of DFS’s Research & Innovation Division since 2021, is now set to take the reins. Her background includes time at the Federal Reserve , where she served as a Senior Policy Advisor for both the Bank of San Francisco and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. At the Fed, she helped coordinate innovation policy between all twelve district banks and across the FDIC and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Before that, Kaitlin worked at the Financial Health Network, a think tank focused on consumer financial health. She holds a Bachelor of Arts from Stanford University and a Master of Public Policy from the University of Chicago. Inside DFS, she’s best known for building out the department’s crypto oversight program and pushing forward policies related to financial inclusion and technological modernization. The New York governor said Kaitlin was the right choice to continue the Department’s work, adding, “Kaitlin is well suited to lead the Department into the future.” Asrow’s promotion puts the crypto-heavy Research & Innovation Division right at the top of New York’s financial regulatory structure.

XRP commentator Chad Steingraber, in a post on social media platform X, argued that the amount of the altcoin actually available for retail trading is going to be a fraction of its total supply. His comments came in response to discussions about the role of institutional and network-led lockups, with projects such as Axelar and Flare Networks working to secure billions of XRP tokens. XRP Might Be Gearing Up For Short Squeeze The discussion began after a popular crypto commentator posted about Axelar’s plan to lock up $10 billion worth of XRP, a move that would remove around 5% of the token available to retail traders. Similarly, Flare Networks has set a goal of locking up 5 billion XRP. These two initiatives alone would place significant pressure on the pool of XRP available for active trading. Related Reading: Demand For XRP On CME Explodes As Reports Show Over $18 Billion Steingraber noted that XRP’s active trading supply is what ultimately influences market pricing, not the total supply figure often cited. As such, he suggested that such accumulation by these companies, combined with other supply constraints, could reduce the number of the token available for public trading. Particularly, Steingraber predicted that this number could fall drastically to as low as 21 million XRP, an amount symbolically identical to Bitcoin’s hard cap. The possibility of only 21 million XRP being available for trading from its current circulating supply of 59 billion tokens is very ambitious. However, the scenario of this drastic fall becomes possible if Spot XRP ETFs are approved in the United States. Institutional ETFs would demand a steady supply of XRP for custody, and this would create large-scale accumulation that could permanently restrict availability on exchanges. In such a case, supply shocks could become very common. Aside from new institutional lockups, there are other clear signs that XRP’s active trading pool is thinning. A notable example is crypto exchange Coinbase, where XRP reserves have dropped sharply in recent months. Adding to that, Ripple itself still controls a large portion of the total supply, with billions of the token locked in escrow. Although these tokens are technically part of circulation, they are unavailable for retail use and are released only under strict schedules. Price Impact Of A 21 Million Effective Supply The idea that XRP’s active trading supply could fall to just 21 million tokens shows how scarcity could alter its valuation. Based on today’s circulating supply of about 59 billion XRP and a market price of $2.89, XRP has a market capitalization of about $172.8 billion. If that same market capitalization were concentrated into only 21 million tokens, the implied price per coin would be about $8,120.

Rounded base and support DOGE trades above the 200‑day EMA at $0.2199 and holds $0.20–$0.22 support. Historical rallies from similar setups have produced 30–40% gains; market cap near $35.365B per CoinGecko data. Dogecoin price outlook: DOGE holds key support near $0.20–$0.22 above the 200‑day EMA; read analyst targets and data-driven levels now. What is the Dogecoin price outlook? Dogecoin price outlook shows constructive technical structure: a third rounded accumulation base with support at $0.20–$0.22, trading above the 200‑day EMA, and a near-term golden cross that could propel DOGE toward $0.33–$0.35 if momentum confirms. Short‑term risk remains the $0.20 zone. How does the approaching golden cross affect Dogecoin? The golden cross — when the 50‑day moving average crosses above the 200‑day moving average — is a bullish signal for DOGE. Historically, similar moving‑average crossovers have coincided with extended rallies. Traders monitor confirmation (volume and follow‑through) before treating it as a buy signal. Dogecoin forms its third rounded base since 2015, holding $0.20–$0.22 support as a golden cross nears with targets toward $0.35. Dogecoin forms the third rounded base since 2015, holding $0.20–$0.22 support for potential new rally. DOGE trades above 200-day EMA at $0.2199, with historical rallies showing 30–40% gains from here. Golden cross pattern nears, projecting continuation toward $0.33 and resistance near $0.35 levels. Dogecoin is approaching a technical inflection after multiple long‑term accumulation phases. The latest rounded base displays gradual upward progression and price stability, supported by a rising trendline. Historical cycles show that similar consolidations have often preceded sizeable rallies, and market participants are now tracking breakout signals. Why do rounded bases matter for Dogecoin? Rounded bases indicate multi‑period accumulation and reduced volatility, which can precede trend continuation. Traders view a sustained hold above rounded support—here $0.20–$0.22—as evidence of buyer conviction and a prerequisite for measured upside targets. Long-Term Accumulation Phases and Breakout Potential Analyst Javon Marks identified three rounded accumulation phases for Dogecoin, each followed by significant expansion. The 2015–2017 base preceded a sharp 2018 rally, and the 2018–2020 base set the stage for the 2021 peak. Repeating basing structures suggest durable capital re‑entry when liquidity conditions improve. $DOGE (Dogecoin) setting new All Time Highs in a nearly +150% move from here shouldn’t be much of a question AT ALL … pic.twitter.com/NZwHk6iAH2 — JAVON MARKS (Twitter) — September 28, 2025 After the 2021 rally, DOGE entered a wider consolidation that created another rounded structure. That base has remained above rising curved support, maintaining stability despite broader market volatility. Each cycle of accumulation and breakout historically delivered gains that often exceeded prior rallies. The current setup shows Dogecoin trading near $0.23 with a market capitalization of $35.365 billion, per CoinGecko. Fully diluted valuation aligns closely at $35.371 billion. Maintaining the $0.20–$0.22 support band is critical for continuation of the upward cycle, as breakdowns below that zone could negate bullish projections. What are the key market data points and support levels? Key on‑chain and market metrics provide context for price action. Dogecoin’s DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) is reported at $20.27 million per DeFiLlama, with a 3.90% daily decline. Chain fee and revenue figures were modest, and decentralized exchange activity showed low recent volume—factors that can cap immediate volatility. Source: DeFiLlama Technically, DOGE sits above the 200‑day exponential moving average at $0.2199 and the 100‑day simple moving average at $0.2129. Historical rebounds from comparable bands have yielded 30–40% upside, which aligns with the $0.33–$0.35 target range noted by market commentators. Commentator Cas Abbe noted the approaching golden cross and observed that “when DOGE pumps, Altseason starts.” That view emphasizes the correlation between strong mid‑cap token performance and broader altcoin cycles. Traders should seek volume confirmation and watch resistance near $0.33–$0.35. Frequently Asked Questions What is the immediate support for DOGE? Immediate support is the $0.20–$0.22 band; holding this zone with price above the 200‑day EMA at $0.2199 preserves the bullish case and opens targets toward $0.33–$0.35. How likely is a 30–40% rally from current levels? Historical patterns from similar consolidation zones produced 30–40% rallies, but probability depends on market liquidity, macro conditions, and confirmation from moving averages and trading volume. Key Takeaways Rounded accumulation: Third rounded base since 2015 suggests structured accumulation and potential for continuation. Technical setup: DOGE trading above the 200‑day EMA; golden cross approaching — watch volume for confirmation. Risk management: Support at $0.20–$0.22 is critical; a decisive break below would alter the outlook. Conclusion Dogecoin’s price outlook is constructive while support near $0.20–$0.22 holds and the 200‑day EMA remains a floor. A confirmed golden cross and rising volume would strengthen the case for moves toward $0.33–$0.35.

The proposed reforms, according to sources who spoke to Bloomberg, would extend Masak’s anti-money laundering (AML) jurisdiction to include both crypto and fiat accounts. The measures are intended to align with those developed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international body that creates standards addressing money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The FATF, an intergovernmental watchdog of which Turkey is a member, removed Ankara from its “grey list” of countries subject to increased monitoring in June 2024, following progress on its mechanisms for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The bill is expected to be presented to the Grand National Assembly, although no specific timeline has been disclosed. On approval, Masak will have the authority to freeze or close accounts suspected of illicit use across payment systems, electronic money institutions, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges. It would also be able to impose transaction limits or blacklist crypto wallets linked to criminal activity. Turkey moves to clamp down on rented crypto accounts The main focus of the legislation is to curb the rise of so-called “rented accounts” — accounts that criminals pay individuals to use for activities such as illegal gambling or financial fraud . Masak is a major player in Turkey’s anti-money laundering efforts as it collects and analyzes suspicious transaction reports, refers cases to prosecutors, and serves as a liaison on international compliance issues. While trading and investment in digital assets remain legal in Turkey, and profits are not yet subject to taxation as of October, the government has been moving to tighten the rules surrounding cryptocurrencies. Reports indicate that the Finance Ministry is forming new rules that would require crypto exchanges to collect detailed information on the source and purpose of transactions, as well as introduce limits on stablecoin transfers. Earlier this year, the Capital Markets Board (CMB), one of Turkey’s key financial regulators, said it had restricted access to several platforms offering “unauthorized” digital asset services, such as PancakeSwap, a popular decentralized exchange. All crypto players in Turkey are now required to register locally, as the board was granted increased powers in March 2025, with strict anti-money laundering and customer protection requirements to be met. Among the key rules are ID checks on transactions exceeding 15,000 lira, transfer limits on stablecoins, and delays in cash withdrawals for certain purposes. Turkey’s move aligns with that of other countries, including Kazakhstan and Russia, which have been cracking down on digital asset markets. While trading and holding cryptocurrencies remain legal, the use of payment services has been illegal since 2021. Turks turn to crypto as Lira’s crisis fuels digital asset adoption Cryptocurrency adoption in Turkey has been steadily increasing for some time. According to the latest Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index, released in September, this increase is supported by the growth of centralized retail platforms and the growing presence of institutional crypto services in the country. A major catalyst, however, has been the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira. Since 2018, the lira has been facing a prolonged financial and economic crisis marked by high inflation, rising borrowing costs, and widespread loan defaults. Several citizens have turned to dollar-pegged stablecoins and BRC as alternative stores of value as the lira’s value has eroded. To understand the scale of the lira’s decline: In 2020, one Bitcoin was worth about 100,000 Turkish lira. Today, that exact figure exceeds 4.6 million lira, showing both Bitcoin’s price appreciation and the lira’s steep depreciation. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The 45-year-old Zhang, also known as Zhimin Qian reportedly masterminded the crime in China between 2014 and 2017 that left 128,000 people out of pocket. She was arrested last year in April after spending years on the run. Zhang had an accomplice also from China, in crypto laundering According to the Guardian, Zhang kept the proceeds in bitcoin, although UK made a breakthrough in the case after raiding a Hampstead mansion in 2018 where they seized devices holding 61,000 bitcoins valued at £1.4 billion at the time and has appreciated in value to over £5 billion at the prevailing prices. The fortune has reportedly been at the center of an intense battle between the UK government and Chinese investors over who gets to keep it, according to a Sky News article. This was believed to be the largest single cryptocurrency seizure in the world, as per the Metropolitan police. The woman pleaded guilty on Monday at a Southwark crown court to acquiring crypto that was criminal property and possessing it between October 2017 and April 2024. Zhang had reportedly fled China using a fake St Kitts and Nevis passport in 2017 and entered the UK. A year later, she attempted money laundering by purchasing properties with the assistance of 43-year-old Jian Wen, a Chinese takeaway worker. According to the Guardian , Wen was incarcerated for six years and eight months for her role in the scam in May last year. Sentencing for Zhang, who appeared in court aided by a Mandarin interpreter will be at a later date. Her accomplice, Wen, arrived in the UK in 2007 and lived a modest life in Leeds between 2011 and 2017 before she started working at a Chinese take-away in south-east London in September of 2017. However, her life took a sudden change as she laundered proceeds of the fraud, driving around in a Mercedes. She also flew her son over from China 18 months later to attend a private school. Zhang reportedly fled after police raided the Hampstead mansion, also known as the Manor House, where they seized a safety deposit box that contained digital wallets that had huge amounts in bitcoin. But her accomplice – Wen maintained she had no idea the bitcoin came from proceeds of crime further claiming that Zhang had tricked her, adding that she had helped Zhang run a jeweller business with branches in China, Malaysia, and Singapore. The case is expected to bring closure to the victims A judge ordered Wen in January this year to pay back over 3 million pounds within three months or serve jail term for another seven years. Head of Met’s economic cybercrime command Will Lyne commended the team for the effort they put towards solving the case. “This is one of the largest money-laundering cases in UK history and among the highest-value cryptocurrency cases globally.” Lyne. “Through a meticulous investigation and unprecedented cooperation with Chinese law enforcement, we were able to obtain compelling evidence of the criminal origins of the cryptoassets Qian attempted to launder in the UK … My thoughts are with the thousands of victims defrauded in this scheme,” added Lyne. Zhang’s solicitor, Roger Sahota of Berkeley Square Solicitors, said this was likely to bring closure to the many victims that were defrauded. “By pleading guilty today, Ms Zhang hopes to bring some comfort to investors who have waited since 2017 for compensation, and to reassure them that the significant rise in cryptocurrency values means there are more than sufficient funds available to repay their losses,” said Sahota. This also come on the backdrop of rising crypto scams across the world. Recently EU member states stopped a crypto scam that resulted in heavy losses for victims in about two dozen countries.

What Does He Know?,https://timestabloid.com/prominent-trader-reopens-17-6-million-short-against-xrp-what-does-he-know/,"A well-known cryptocurrency trader has re-entered the market with a highly leveraged bet against XRP, opening a $17.6 million short position shortly after taking heavy losses from earlier trades on both XRP and Bitcoin. XRP Price Recovery Pressures Short Sellers The broader digital asset market showed modest recovery over the weekend, with XRP climbing 2% in the past 24 hours to trade above $2.80. This rebound proved costly for traders who had maintained large short positions, including the pseudonymous investor Falllling. Data from the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that the trader was forced to partially liquidate previous positions during the upswing, suffering significant losses. The earlier bets included a 1,366.67 BTC short worth around $150 million at 40x leverage and an additional 2.78 million XRP short valued at $7.7 million with 20x leverage. The trades were set with liquidation thresholds of $110,280 for Bitcoin and $3.0665 for XRP. As the market rose, both trades were closed at a loss, resulting in an estimated $3.4 million setback for the trader. As the market rebounded, gambler @qwatio was partially liquidated! He closed his short positions on $BTC and $XRP , losing $3.4M. He then reopened a 20x short on 6.17M $XRP ($17.6M), with a liquidation price of $2.9155. https://t.co/beUxvfctNU https://t.co/cqRQ4wLXdu pic.twitter.com/UUVBkWaRd4 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 29, 2025 New Position Reopened Despite these losses, Falllling quickly re-entered the market with another aggressive position. The new trade involves a short bet against 6.17 million XRP, valued at approximately $17.6 million, again placed with 20x leverage. The liquidation point for this trade is set at $2.9155, marginally above XRP’s current price of $2.88 . According to available data, the position is already showing a paper loss of more than $34,000. Such a strategy highlights the risks associated with high leverage. A price increase to the liquidation threshold would erase the entire position, while any significant downward movement could yield outsized gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market-Wide Liquidations Increase The weekend rally triggered widespread liquidations across the cryptocurrency market. According to Coinglass data, a total of $348.51 million in positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Short positions accounted for the majority at $280.82 million, while long positions made up $87.69 million. XRP alone contributed approximately $2.81 million in short liquidations, while Bitcoin led the market with $47.26 million. Analysts note that if XRP advances to $2.916, slightly above the liquidation level of Falllling’s position, nearly $44 million in XRP shorts could be liquidated. The trader’s decision to reopen such a large bet against XRP underscores ongoing bearish sentiment among some market participants, even as the broader market shows signs of stabilizing. With liquidation levels set so close to current prices, XRP’s short-term movements could determine whether the strategy results in another substantial loss or a major gain .

According to his statement, the withholding of public matching funds and persistent questions about his legal past left the campaign without the money or momentum it needed. Adams will remain in office until January 1, 2026, and his name will still appear on the November 4, 2025, ballot because the deadline to remove it has already passed. Campaign Funds And Legal Shadows Reports have disclosed that the city Campaign Finance Board paused matching payments to Adams’s bid, a move he said crippled fundraising. He also faces a cloud from an indictment brought in 2024; he has pleaded not guilty. In 2025, the Department of Justice moved to drop the case, an action that drew sharp attention and allegations of political influence by critics. Only in America. Only in New York.Thank you for making my story a reality. pic.twitter.com/efHuyBnITJ — Eric Adams (@ericadamsfornyc) September 28, 2025 Adams told supporters that the steady stream of questions about his legal future made it impossible to run a serious campaign. Polls showed him trailing key rivals, and donors became hesitant. A Pro-Crypto Mayor’s Exit Could Shift Policy Adams had positioned New York as welcoming to cryptocurrency firms and blockchain projects. According to media coverage, he pushed for measures such as a municipal Bitcoin bond and changes to the city’s BitLicense rules to make them more industry friendly. Those efforts helped craft his image as a pro-crypto mayor. With him stepping back, the fate of those policies is less certain. Supporters in the crypto sector worry that momentum could slow without his voice in City Hall, while opponents say any successor may push for tighter consumer protections. The Race Reconfigured Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic primary and now leads in general election polls. Andrew Cuomo, who lost the primary, is running as an independent and could pick up votes from those uneasy about Mamdani. Curtis Sliwa remains the Republican contender. Adams did not endorse any candidate when he withdrew. Analysts say his exit may consolidate some anti-Mamdani voters around Cuomo, though nothing is guaranteed. What The Withdrawal Means For Voters Voters face a shorter list of clear choices. Adams argued that constant scrutiny and a lack of campaign funds left him with little option but to step aside. He warned of “insidious forces” using government power to push division, language that sent ripples through local politics. City officials and activists will now press the remaining candidates to lay out plans on jobs, housing, public safety, and how they would handle the growing but contested crypto sector in the city.

The decision would open access for more than 50 million clients, who collectively hold about $11 trillion in assets with the firm. At present, the company does not manage any crypto ETFs, and its clients are blocked from buying Bitcoin or Ether ETFs managed by other firms. A Vanguard spokesperson allegedly confirmed the review to Crypto in America , saying, “We continuously evaluate our brokerage offer, investor preferences, and the evolving regulatory environment. If and when a decision is made, clients will hear directly from Vanguard.” This cautious language reflects years of resistance, during which the firm labeled crypto “immature” and warned that it could cause “havoc” in long-term portfolios. Former Chief Executive Officer Tim Buckley flatly declared the company would never launch a Bitcoin fund. Founder Jack Bogle once went further, telling investors to avoid the coin “like the plague.” Salim Ramji pushes change as new Vanguard chief The discussion around crypto gained new weight when Salim Ramji, a former BlackRock executive, took over as CEO last year. Salim became the first outsider to lead the company, breaking a tradition where every leader had been trained by Bogle himself. Unlike Tim, Salim has shown openness to blockchain and Bitcoin, signaling a break from the hostile stance that defined Vanguard for decades. His leadership coincided with the rollout of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, which stunned Wall Street with record inflows. A few months later, regulators approved the first spot Ether ETFs, adding momentum to the sector. Together, these ETFs now oversee more than $142 billion. BlackRock’s IBIT fund dominates the space with about $84 billion, while nearly $24 billion of that sum came in during 2025 alone, making IBIT one of the top five funds for inflows across all U.S. ETFs. The surge has been impossible for large firms to ignore. President Donald Trump’s White House has embraced crypto, while hedge funds, pensions, and banks have committed billions. BlackRock’s ETHA fund, focused on Ether, has amassed about $15 billion in assets. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the wave of demand explains the review. “The astounding success of the ETFs added a lot to the pressure. Had Bitcoin ETFs been a flop, I don’t think they would consider lifting the ban,” Eric said. Vanguard weighs tradition against market pressure At 55, Salim is attempting to satisfy long-time employees still loyal to Bogle while answering the calls of investors who want crypto access. He once had ambitions at BlackRock and now has to prove himself in a culture that mistrusts outsiders. His task is balancing new opportunities with what Vanguard is famous for: cheap, passive investing. Bogle’s most famous advice, “Don’t look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack!” still defines the firm’s strategy. Today, Vanguard’s index funds dominate workplace retirement plans, with assets under management swelling by about $2.5 trillion in the last three years. Hundreds of billions of dollars are added annually through direct deposits. “The age of Bogle is alive and well, and part of my mission here is to make sure that we advance and extend it for decades to come,” Salim said recently while speaking on campus, wearing jeans, a pale-blue shirt, and a dark blazer. But sadly, Vanguard’s average fee has dropped to only about 0.07%, and costs are rising, raising doubts about whether that model can keep helping the company with its ambitious expansion. Meanwhile, its top competitor BlackRock has solved the problem by using stock to buy private investment firms that generate higher fees, while Vanguard is owned by the investors in its funds, lacks public stock, and has no intention of pursuing acquisitions.

The liquidation jitters still linger among market participants, and the turbulence shook short-term sentiment. Despite this, experts say that the bull market appears intact. In fact, CryptoQuant revealed that several on-chain signals are pointing to further upside potential. Mid-Cycle Reset An important metric in this regard, the MVRV ratio – which measures the relationship between Bitcoin’s market value and the average cost basis of its holders- has cooled back toward the 2.0 level. Previous instances have shown that this range has been a mid-cycle reset zone rather than a danger signal. Investors remain comfortably in profit, but without the kind of overheated conditions that often precede sharp corrections. In past cycles, CryptoQuant found that similar consolidations in the MVRV ratio represented the beginning of renewed, stronger expansions. The behavior of long-term holders further validated this outlook. On-chain data shows that profit-taking among these investors has diminished considerably, and those who have held coins for months or years are largely choosing to sit tight. Their conviction not only demonstrates confidence in Bitcoin’s longer-term trajectory but also effectively tightens supply in the market. Such a reduction in selling pressure creates a supportive backdrop for future price increases, particularly if new demand emerges. These factors collectively mirror crucial “mid-cycle” phases seen in both 2017 and 2020, when Bitcoin slowed before breaking into more powerful rallies. Recent volatility, then, looks less like the exhaustion of the bitcoin bull market and more like a healthy pause, which the analytic platform described as a “digestion” phase where excesses are cleared before momentum resumes. “If history rhymes, today’s consolidation could mark the groundwork for the next major leg upward – suggesting the bull market is alive and well.” $140K to $170K BTC Is Next Prominent market commentator Mr. Wall Street also observed that Bitcoin remains firmly above support levels despite recent turbulence in his detailed technical and macro analysis. He noted that BTC is currently hovering just above the same support zone where he opened long positions near $107,500, only 12% below its all-time high of $125,000. Dismissing the calls for a cycle top and an impending bear market, the analyst argued that “none of the major macro indicators have flashed,” and that market structure remains intact. He even went on to emphasize that current weakness stems from temporary macro uncertainty rather than structural distribution, and added that “there’s no imbalance nor geopolitical event that can trigger a down move from here.” Going forward, the analyst expects a highly bullish Q4 and predicts new highs in the $140,000-$170,000 range before the cycle peak is reached. He also forecasts up to six Federal Reserve rate cuts within the next six months. For traders, he identified the 4-hour EMA200 as the next short-term target and explained that the current region offers an attractive entry for new longs. Upcoming US economic releases, including job openings, ISM data, and unemployment figures, could spark short-term volatility, but he maintained that the broader bull trend remains unshaken.

52451107,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=823125,1759190118,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52451107.jpeg,Michael Saylor shrugs off shrinking by premium as Strategy sticks to Bitcoin playbook,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/saylor-sticks-to-bitcoin-playbook/,"Michael Saylor is standing firm as Strategy’s once wide premium over its Bitcoin holdings contracts. Shares of the company, formerly known as MicroStrategy, have fallen about 20% since June while Bitcoin has risen roughly 6% and hit record highs, according to Bloomberg Television. This reversal has led critics to question the long-term value of the five-year-old crypto buy-and-hold strategy Saylor created. “I’m not really concerned,” Saylor said during a Bloomberg interview on Monday. “What happens is, the premium will expand as our leverage increases and the volatility in Bitcoin increases. When the volatility falls and our leverage falls, sometimes the premium will contract.” Saylor transformed Strategy from an enterprise software business into a Bitcoin treasury company, creating a stock market proxy for holding crypto without owning tokens directly.Since mid‑2020, the stock has surged more than 2,600%. For years, Strategy traded at a premium more than double the value of the Bitcoin it owned.That gap has narrowed sharply, with the company now valued at about 1.46 times the roughly $73 billion in Bitcoin it holds. Crypto treasuries have attracted over $44 billion this year as promoters framed them as steady buyers turning coins from speculative bets into financial infrastructure. “The market is still working to digest the new business model,” Saylor said . “The Bitcoin treasury company is an idea that’s only come to the forefront in the past year or so.” Strategy manages leverage as smaller rivals hit limits The broader group of crypto‑holding firms is under strain. Nearly a third of publicly traded companies with Bitcoin reserves now trade below the value of their holdings. Small players are especially exposed. Their limited liquidity makes issuing new stock more expensive, and their dependence on convertible notes creates interest costs and repayment risks. Strategy has said it will retire all of its convertible notes within four years and switch to preferred shares, which have no maturity date. Many competitors cannot match that approach because they lack size or strong credit. “What happens when Bitcoin drops 50%?” asked Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments. “Enthusiasm for treasury companies will wane, mNAVs will compress and you will have 100s of companies start to question their treasury strategy altogether.” His warning highlights how quickly investor sentiment can change if the market turns. Strategy’s plan to exit convertible notes is designed to reduce those pressures before a downturn tests its model. New entrants launch crypto vehicles as ETFs erode Strategy’s edge The space around Strategy has become crowded.Over the past year, influencers and politically connected figures have launched crypto vehicles through SPACs and reverse mergers.Many of these ventures lack Strategy’s trading liquidity and scale and may not survive a downturn. “Is this market frothy? I think it is,” said Jack Mallers, co‑founder and chief executive officer of Twenty One Capital Inc., during a Bloomberg TV interview on Wednesday. “What we learned is, creating a Bitcoin treasury company is not a scarcity within itself. Anyone can register a business, attempt to go public and try to raise money to buy Bitcoin.” Another threat comes from the rise of spot Bitcoin exchange‑traded funds. Initially, Strategy and the ETFs both gained from a post‑election rally under President Donald Trump. Now the comparison has shifted. Funds let investors get Bitcoin exposure without the risks tied to corporate governance, leverage or dilution. “Investors are momentum investors,” said Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke University. “When the price is going up, they are buyers. When the price goes down or remains flat, there is less enthusiasm.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",News|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-29 23:55:18

One of the most ambitious projections is that the token could eventually reach $10,000 , a claim dismissed by some as unrealistic but supported by others who argue that XRP’s fundamentals could justify such levels. Comparisons to Bitcoin’s Early Growth XRP advocate Xena recently revisited this projection, drawing parallels between the skepticism surrounding XRP today and doubts about Bitcoin in its early years. She highlighted that when Bitcoin traded below $1,000, many considered predictions of far higher prices unreasonable. Over time, however, Bitcoin rose from a few cents to more than $100,000, proving many critics wrong. According to Xena, XRP’s current price above $2 has led many to disregard the possibility of exponential growth, but she believes history shows that such dismissals can be premature. She stressed that conviction and long-term patience are essential, arguing that dismissing XRP’s potential mirrors the attitudes that caused many investors to underestimate Bitcoin. Without a doubt…and it's not a belief. It will. I know, I know. Some people always say : let's cross ATH first. But that's not the point. When articles said Bitcoin will reach $1M people said let's reach $1000 first. Look at the price today. And many regret not holding a… https://t.co/DHtcauZGFt — Xena XRP (@XenaXrp) June 25, 2025 To bolster her argument, Xena cited Arthur Britto, a Ripple co-founder, who has been quoted as saying XRP was designed to accommodate values as high as $10,000 per token. She acknowledged that even if the asset fell short of this figure, such a design consideration still points toward the possibility of significantly higher valuations than the current market price. Efficiency in Cross-Border Payments Other commentators have also reinforced the idea of a higher XRP valuation. An account known as Chesty Puller’s Ghost referenced insights from Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, who in 2017 outlined why a low XRP price could hinder efficient cross-border transactions. Schwartz explained that conducting large transfers at low token prices would require impractically large quantities of XRP. For example, sending $1 million at $1 per coin would take one million tokens, while moving $50 billion would demand 50 billion XRP. Conversely, at $10,000 per token, only 100 XRP would be needed for a $1 million transfer, making the network more practical for large-scale financial settlements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Timeline for Adoption Adding to these arguments, Jake Claver, Managing Director at Digital Ascension Group, has publicly attached a timeline for XRP to reach the $10,000 level. He suggested that such growth could take place within 24 months, positioning the asset for major institutional integration by 2027. Claver’s projection, while ambitious, underscores the belief among some advocates that XRP’s design and intended use case support far higher valuations. Proponents such as Xena emphasize that the focus should not be on convincing skeptics but on encouraging those who already see XRP’s potential to remain committed. For these advocates, the real issue is not whether the token can ever reach $10,000 but whether investors are willing to stay positioned if it does. While predictions of XRP reaching $10,000 remain controversial, advocates argue that historical precedents in the crypto market, the token’s design considerations, and its utility in global payments justify a case for significant long-term appreciation.

What Is The Bitcoin Tracker And Why Does It Matter Michael Saylor has once again released the Strategy Bitcoin tracker, a chart that the market has come to watch closely. According to the X post, the latest buy brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin treasury holdings to 639,835 BTC, which is approximately $70.01 billion. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Says Bitcoin Is Not Just An Asset; What Is It Then? CryptosRus has stated that the familiar orange dots continue their steady climb upward and to the right, a simple yet powerful indicator hinting that additional BTC buys may be on deck. Every time this chart comes out, the market leans in. Saylor’s conviction has transcended simple corporate policy to become a genuine market signal. An analyst known as BitBull has confirmed a crucial turning point for the Bitcoin market, highlighting that BTC Open Interest has fallen to its lowest level in a month, effectively wiping out all the leverage that had built up during September. BitBull views this deleveraging event as a positive and healthy development for the market. By purging excessive leverage, the market is now considered to be in a healthier state, which could set the stage for a reversal upward in BTC price. Why The Current Bitcoin Run Is Only The Beginning Market analyst Zynx has offered insights into the BTC market and future price targets, pointing out that the bull market is still in its early stages and has significant room to run. He stated that BTC needs to cross $151,000 just to equal its all-time high in Gold, which suggests a specific metric where BTC’s price, relative to the price of an ounce of gold, would match its previous peak ratio. Related Reading: Bitcoin Daily RSI At Most Oversold Level Since April — Time To Buy? Historically, every cycle since the inception, BTC has more than doubled its price in Gold at a minimum, usually much more than that. However, the $300,000 target is looking increasingly realistic. While it is impossible to give a time frame, if history repeats, crossing the $151,000 all-time high within the next six months is expected. Furthermore, what makes this cycle fascinating is the macro overlay. Some analysts, such as EneaDenkt and others, are using the US Business Cycle Institute for Supply Management (ISM) as a key indicator for predicting the timing when BTC will peak. Zynx concluded by acknowledging that this is definitely a very interesting time for the BTC rally, and this cycle will definitely be like no other.

What is the current Ethereum price outlook? Ethereum price is testing a critical inflection zone: reclaiming $4,841 is essential to confirm a bullish reversal toward $5,864; failure risks a pullback to $2,750. Short-term indicators (RSI, open interest) suggest both a possible bounce and the risk of deeper correction depending on follow-through. How can ETH reclaim $4,841 and what happens if it fails? For ETH to break the downtrend, buying pressure must push price above $4,841 with sustained volume. A decisive close above that level would re-open the path to prior highs near $5,864.

On-chain metric MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands show ETH between the +0.5σ and +1.0σ bands as of late September 2025, indicating elevated realized-value divergence. How does the RSI support a potential reversal? ETH price momentum indicators are mixed. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index plunged from 82 on Sept. 13 to 14.5 — the lowest since April 2025. Historically, similar extreme RSI lows (April and June 2025) preceded meaningful rallies, suggesting a possible short-term bounce if buying volume appears. Source: Crypto Rover via X When did open interest and whale activity influence the recent move? Open interest recently experienced a sharp reset, one of the largest since early 2024, wiping excessive leverage and reducing short-term speculative pressure. Analyst Darkfost notes this reset — particularly on major derivatives venues — left the market in cleaner condition. At the same time, a whale accumulated approximately $235.7 million in ETH this week and currently shows roughly $19.4 million in unrealized losses.

If ETH fails at $4,841, selling pressure may escalate and push price toward the next major support near $2,750. Traders should watch stop-flow and leverage removal as these can accelerate declines. How should traders interpret the current whale activity? Whale accumulation of $235.7M in ETH, despite showing $19.4M in paper losses, indicates larger participants may be positioning for longer-term upside while retail decides on near-term profit-taking. Key Takeaways Critical level: Reclaiming $4,841 is necessary to confirm a bullish reversal toward $5,864. Momentum signal: RSI at 14.5 suggests a potential short-term bounce but needs volume confirmation. On-chain context: Open interest reset and whale accumulation indicate reduced leverage and strategic dip buying. Conclusion In summary, the Ethereum price outlook is balanced between a potential bounce from oversold conditions and the risk of a deeper correction if $4,841 remains out of reach.

These zones often act as magnets where leveraged positions are triggered, producing rapid directional moves. A breach of these clusters could accelerate both downside liquidations and upside short-squeezes. Buyers within the wedge structure view $260 and $300 as key upside objectives. Conversely, failure to hold the $200 support could expose SOL to a test of $190, increasing selling pressure. Source: TradingView How does market positioning affect near‑term bias? Binance market positioning shows long accounts at 72.91% and shorts at 27.09%, reinforcing a bullish bias.

Volatility zones $205–$215 : Liquidation clusters can spark rapid swings in either direction. Targets and risk management : If $200 holds, aim for $260 and $300; otherwise, expect pressure toward $190 and increased liquidations. Conclusion Solana’s breakout consolidation above the wedge trendline, backed by exchange outflows and bullish positioning, creates a constructive setup for further gains. Traders should monitor $200 support and $205–$215 liquidity clusters closely.

The CSI 300 Index is now forecast to close out 2025 at just 4,675 points, a tiny 1.2% gain from this Monday, according to 16 analysts reportedly surveyed by Bloomberg. That’s after the index already rose 17% this year. And it gets worse. By next June, those same analysts expect a mere 5.5% rise. What began as an AI-fueled breakout is now looking like a stall. This year’s rally has done a little work to wash off the “uninvestable” tag China earned, but global investors still don’t trust it. Geopolitical tensions, old Trump-era policies, and a weak economy are still blocking serious capital from returning. “2025 is about holding ground,” said Haris Khurshid of Karobaar Capital. “Policy support is there, but it’s inconsistent, and global funds are reluctant to re-risk until the geopolitical tone stabilizes.” Tech stocks lead but valuations flash warning signs China’s market jump this year was driven by AI and tech stocks. The Hang Seng Tech Index exploded 42%, with chipmakers Hua Hong Semiconductor and SMIC rising more than 233% and 140%. In September alone, Alibaba jumped almost 50% after throwing out some big AI investment plans. Everyone’s riding the tech wave, but analysts are getting nervous. Twelve of the Bloomberg survey participants called AI the most crowded trade in China right now. “Every yuan of AI capex is being rewarded with a higher stock price, but at some point investors will want to see cash flows and not just announcements,” said Khurshid. Almost all 21 analysts surveyed said foreign capital is crucial if this rally wants to keep moving. Without it, domestic enthusiasm can’t carry the load. But the money is hesitating. Policy shifts, weak macro numbers, and US-China uncertainty still spook long-term investors. Zijin Gold lands record IPO as Hong Kong regains IPO momentum While the broader market cools, Zijin Gold has pulled off a monster move. The mining giant raised $3.2 billion ahead of its Hong Kong debut, making it the largest IPO globally since May. Shares were priced at HK$71.59, valuing the firm at HK$187.9 billion ($24 billion). It’s now bigger than Teck Resources in Canada. The listing had been set for Monday, but Super Typhoon Ragasa delayed trading to Tuesday. Hong Kong now claims the two biggest IPOs of 2025 so far, with Zijin Gold second only to CATL’s $5.3 billion mega-deal. Michelle Leung said Zijin “picked the best time” to go public. She added that gold’s price boom has pumped up valuations across miners. As of Sept. 28, Zijin’s IPO was priced at a 26% discount to its global peers. The IPO attracted a heavy lineup of buyers. GIC, Hillhouse, BlackRock, Fidelity, and Millennium were among cornerstone investors who agreed to hold shares for at least six months. Together, they took about half the float. Zijin plans to use the IPO cash to buy a mine in Kazakhstan and upgrade sites globally. The company manages its parent group’s gold assets outside China, with mines from Central Asia to Africa, Australia, and South America. The firm has become one of the fastest-growing gold miners in the world. Other miners have cashed in too. PT Merdeka Gold Resources raised $280 million in Jakarta this month, Indonesia’s largest IPO this year. Shandong Gold Mining also raised $500 million selling shares. Traders are now watching a long list of possible triggers for the last quarter: the Golden Week holiday, Fourth Plenum in October, a Trump-Xi meeting at APEC, the Central Economic Work Conference in December, and possible action from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). About half of the analysts surveyed expect the PBOC to roll out some form of stimulus by year-end, especially if the Federal Reserve cuts rates first. But don’t expect fireworks. “The PBOC has hinted it’s ready to step in if growth shows more strain,” said Khurshid. “I’d look for small, targeted steps, rather than a big, broad stimulus package.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",News|China,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|BUSINESS|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-30 00:12:54

This event aimed to coordinate policy projects with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Notably, the CFTC and the SEC are two of the primary financial regulatory bodies in the US. Regarding the rules governing the digital asset markets in the US, both agencies have been assigned important roles in regulating this critical sector. To break this down, the SEC will oversee crypto securities, and the CFTC is expected to receive more authority from Congress to oversee most digital asset transactions. The SEC and the CFTC aim to join forces to enhance crypto regulations Paul Atkins and Acting Chairman Caroline Pham of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission demonstrated their commitment to clear boundaries between securities and commodities . According to them, this will ease the operation of firms or apps across both areas without encountering problems. For this goal to succeed, Atkins needed the two financial regulators to join forces. In a statement, he argued that the two agencies must work together. The chairman made these remarks while speaking to financial compliance lawyers and industry spokespersons at the SEC headquarters in Washington. However, for both agencies to work together smoothly, the SEC’s leader further emphasized the importance of establishing a strong system. On the other hand, Caroline Pham remarked, “It’s a new day, and the turf war is over.” In the meantime, it is worth noting that, although it is rare for these two agencies, which usually display differing opinions, to showcase such strong emotions, the CFTC still lacks a permanent leader. Concerning the CFTC’s permanent leader, sources have emphasized the importance of their presence, arguing that this will ensure the agency’s strategic choices remain stable even in the face of possible management changes. To address these concerns, Pham mentioned that individuals need not be afraid, uncertain, or doubtful about what the CFTC is doing. This is because the agency is progressing very well, she added. This statement was in reference to the popular acronym from the crypto community. Atkins praised Pham’s leadership skills at CFTC, noting that with these skills, their alliance on crypto-related initiatives is moving full-speed ahead. Atkins sparks hope for a new turn in the crypto space with significant development Earlier, reporters had questioned Atkins about President Donald Trump’s intentions in the crypto ecosystem. Respondingly, the commissioner stated that Trump got things in motion and pointed out his recent plan to sign a market structure bill by the end of 2025. He concluded that they would see how that turned out. Atkins added that the SEC will pay attention to asset tokenization, but warned it may take a “year or two” to implement the appropriate regulations around this area. Based on his argument, the possibilities are almost limitless. The commissioner also quashed speculation of an SEC-CFTC merger, referring to such talk as “imaginative.” Monday’s roundtable discussion was a follow-up SEC event about the cryptocurrency world, and this time it showcased more cooperation between agencies, featuring digital assets and blockchain experts from companies like Kraken and Crypto.

BlackRock moved 49,607.8 ETH and 340.5 BTC (~$244M) to Coinbase Prime within an hour. Market prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum showed modest daily gains despite the transfer. On-chain analysis (Lookonchain) and industry experts suggest the transfer is likely operational—custody, rebalancing, or liquidity—rather than a strategic exit. BlackRock transfers Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime, sparking market attention; read analysis and implications for institutional crypto flows — learn more. BlackRock transfers $244 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime, raising speculation over potential shifts in its crypto strategy. BlackRock transferred $244 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime, sparking speculation about a potential sell-off. Despite large transactions, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to show positive daily gains, unaffected by BlackRock’s move. Some experts believe BlackRock’s move is operational rather than indicative of a strategy change, focusing on liquidity needs. Despite a slight uptick in the broader cryptocurrency market, institutional interest remains volatile, prompting major firms to adjust settlement and custody processes. On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that BlackRock transferred a significant portion of its Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings to a Coinbase Prime wallet, prompting market attention and analyst commentary. What happened when BlackRock transferred $244 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum? BlackRock transferred 49,607.8 ETH and 340.5 BTC (about $244 million) to a Coinbase Prime wallet in under an hour. The transaction triggered speculation about a potential sell-off, but immediate market reaction was muted as both assets posted modest daily gains. How large were the transfers and what do the numbers show? The on-chain move comprised 49,607.8 ETH and 340.5 BTC , totaling roughly $244 million at the time of transfer. Transfers of this scale are notable for institutional portfolios but do not automatically imply liquidation; they can indicate custody migration, internal rebalancing, or liquidity provisioning. Why analysts think this is likely operational, not a strategic exit? Several market analysts and custody specialists note that Coinbase Prime functions as a prime broker and custodian for institutions. Operational reasons for transfers include settlement, liquidity management, regulatory compliance, and internal accounting. Historical patterns show BlackRock has continued to accumulate crypto assets over longer timeframes, supporting the view that this transfer may be procedural. Market context supports a cautious reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum recorded daily gains of roughly 4% and 4.24% respectively on the day of the transfer, indicating broader demand counterbalanced the move. Official statements from asset managers are the most definitive source; no public BlackRock confirmation on intent was available at publication. How could this move affect market liquidity and prices? Short-term liquidity can be impacted if transferred assets are moved to exchange custody and subsequently offered for sale. However, the reported transfer did not coincide with sharp downward price moves. Institutional flows often create temporary order-book pressure but require follow-through to alter longer-term price direction. What should traders and investors watch next? Watch for additional on-chain movements from the same wallet, exchange outflows, and any official updates from BlackRock. Market depth and trading volumes around key support levels will determine whether this transfer becomes a catalyst for further volatility or remains an operational adjustment. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/blackrock-coinbase-transfer"" }, ""headline"": ""BlackRock transfers $244M in Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime — Analysis"", ""description"": ""BlackRock transferred 49,607.8 ETH and 340.5 BTC (~$244M) to Coinbase Prime.

There is no direct evidence of a sale following the transfer. On-chain activity showed the assets moved to Coinbase Prime, and market prices remained resilient, which suggests no immediate liquidation occurred. How can I track institutional crypto transfers? Use on-chain analytics platforms and monitor public wallet flows for large transfers. Look for repeated transfers from the same address, exchange inflows, and timing relative to market orders for clearer signals. Key Takeaways Transfer scale : BlackRock moved ~49,607.8 ETH and 340.5 BTC (~$244M) to Coinbase Prime. Market reaction : Bitcoin and Ethereum posted modest daily gains, indicating limited immediate price disruption. Likely interpretation : Analysts view the move as operational custody or liquidity management rather than a strategic exit; monitor follow-up on-chain activity and official statements. Conclusion BlackRock’s transfer of Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime is a significant institutional event, but available evidence points toward operational reasons rather than a wholesale strategy change.

The Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation unfolded at sunrise and zeroed in on the contractor that keeps Antminer rigs running at the 30 MW site, recently sold by Poolin. Witnesses allegedly said the raid looked like a war scene. “Helicopters, snipers, armed men,” one source told Blockspace while describing an ICE helicopter circling above before “a cavalcade of black Tahoes arrived at the scene.” He added agents asked “leading questions… ‘who does this, who does that.’” Multiple agencies were present: ICE, the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) all took part, according to a person on site. Agents detain ADW Tech staff and seize documents Law enforcement removed 12 or 13 workers, roughly half the repair shop staff, from the Pyote facility after they failed to show proper credentials. The same source said ICE targeted Chinese nationals and took everyone with expired visas. The raid did not affect other local operators such as Genesis Digital Assets, which runs a 195 MW bitcoin mine in Pyote but was not a subject of this action. ADW Tech is a Bitmain contractor and certified Antminer repair shop embedded within Lonestar Dream. The company’s presence highlights how West Texas has become a hub for mining, drawing big names with cheap power and wide land. Poolin’s recent sale of the site still left ADW Tech doing the repair work, and that is where federal scrutiny landed. The action comes as Bitmain-linked repair centers in the U.S. face rising government attention. This raid connects with a longer story involving the Trump administration’s handling of mining hardware imports. At the end of 2024, CBP began sporadically holding and seizing ASIC miner shipments at U.S. ports, sometimes keeping them for months and charging holding fees without explaining the flags. Several shipments stayed detained into 2025 after Trump took office and only began to be released by late Q1 and early Q2. Officials said they were looking for restricted AI chips on ASIC miners’ control boards from Sophgo, a semiconductor company that shares Bitmain CEO Micree Zhan. The U.S. Department of Commerce is actively investigating possible sanctions violations by Sophgo, which ties directly to why these miners and repair hubs are now under heavy federal focus.

Market Weakness Targets ETH, But 1 DeFi Altcoin Could Save Portfolios",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-ethereum-eth-bulls-defend-4000-market-weakness-targets-eth-but-1-defi-altcoin-could-save-portfolios/,"With Ethereum (ETH) facing pressure at the $4,000 level, investors are holding their breath to see if bulls can keep holding on against mounting market vulnerability. While ETH remains the pillar of the crypto market, shrewd traders are looking at alternatives to save and build up their portfolios. One top choice is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a fast-rising DeFi altcoin that costs only $0.035. The project is still in presale phase 6 which is over 50% sold out. It has already raised over $16.52 million in presale, with over 16,640 holders. With its dual lending system, staking rewards that can be adjusted, and real-world utility of decentralized borrowing and lending, Mutuum Finance offers both stability and the opportunity for high growth, which makes it a strategic holding asset for diversification and consolidation of crypto assets during turbulent times. Ethereum at a Turning Point Ethereum (ETH) fell below $4,060, with fear of the bulls being able to maintain the crucial $4,000 support. A bear cross is bright warning lights, the analysts eyeing $3,750 as the next important support, and a potential fall to $3,350 should that be broken. But with the asset appearing oversold, a strong bounce can be in the cards if buying momentum is re-established. While investors weigh the pro and con of the next ETH move, others are also starting to explore newer possibilities in decentralized finance that can add to their strategies, with one such newer project, Mutuum Finance, gaining increasing interest. MUTM Presale Momentum Accelerates MUTM tokens are currently valued at $0.035 in presale phase 6, a 16.17% raise from the previous round. Interest among investors remains remarkably robust with more than 16,640 investors pumping in more than $16.52 million of invested capital thus far. To enhance the security of the platform even more, Mutuum Finance has introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program where they invite white-hat researchers and developers to identify bugs. These will be categorized into four levels of severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, for sensitive identification and immediate patching of possible vulnerabilities. Mutuum protocol is founded on good collateral management as a measure to protect the users and the ecosystem. Some of the most important safety features include infinite collateral ratios, loan limits, and deposit limits. Undercollateralized positions are quickly closed, and penalties and remediation fees stabilize the platform and minimize systemic risk. The most important concept at Mutuum Finance is efficiency. Through the optimization of Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and, in particular, overcollateralized positions, the protocol makes the most out of capital while providing great protection. Reserve requirements act as a market shock absorber, and excess reserves can be invested profitably in riskier assets to hedge volatility. Mutuum Finance seeks to redefine DeFi in three dimensions: long-term viability, trustworthiness, and usability. Through a scalable and secure borrowing and lending platform, the platform is democratizing decentralized finance for retail and institutional customers. As an appreciation for its growing community, the team has also started a $100,000 giveaway where 10 winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The action is one of the means of showing that Mutuum values rewarding the project’s first adopters and raising awareness about the cause. Where to Look as ETH Weakens Ethereum’s inability to hold above the $4,000 level is an indication of the angst which has the broader crypto universe in its thrall but also the rising trend towards diversification into high-growth DeFi plays. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast emerging as one of the most promising alternatives, with strong security, good collateral management, and real-world practical utility to provide impressive growth potential. At over $16.52 million raised, with over 16,640 investors participating, and tokens yet available for purchase at a cheap rate of $0.035, momentum is clearly building. The moment to invest in the Mutuum Finance presale and diversify your portfolio ahead of the next market cycle beginning is now.

The collection launched strongly with a floor near $68,700 and about $45 million in first-day volume. One rare piece, Hypurr #21, sold for 9,999 HYPE ($467,000), stressing strong demand among NFT traders and Hyperliquid’s early community. Most NFTs were allocated to participants from the November 2024 Genesis Event, with some allocations also made to the Hyper Foundation and core contributors. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Trading Volume Surges Hyperliquid’s network excitement coincides with increased derivatives activity: daily spot trading rose, futures volume increased approximately 13.9% to $1.8 billion, and open interest grew to $2.28 billion, indicating active short-term trading interest even if longer-term confidence remains cautious. Technically, $50 is the immediate resistance to surpass; $44 serves as a strong support level. With RSI near 46, MACD negative, and Bollinger Bands tightening, traders are watching for volatility to expand, which could shape the next move. Institutional Nods and New Infrastructure Strengthen the Narrative Institutional chatter fuels optimism: ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood recently compared Hyperliquid’s growth to that of early Solana, placing the DEX firmly on the radar of big money. Behind the scenes, the team continues to broaden its defenses. Hyperliquid launched permissionless spot quote assets on mainnet, with USDH (backed by cash and U.S. Treasuries) serving as the first quote. This move enables community-driven listings through Dutch auctions and introduces HYPE/USDH pairs, expanding liquidity while lowering barriers. Launched in February 2025, the HyperEVM programmability layer connects smart contracts with the chain’s HyperBFT consensus and HyperCore liquidity, allowing developers to create lending markets, vault tokenization, and liquid staking. Risks: Unlock Overhang, Security Alerts, Rising Competition Tailwinds aside, investors face genuine risks. A rival perpetuals platform, Aster, briefly surpassed Hyperliquid’s weekly volume after the token launch, highlighting intense competition in the DEX space. Security concerns arose when researcher ZachXBT reported the theft of eight Hypurr NFTs worth $400K shortly after launch, another reminder to improve wallet security. Most importantly, a pending $12B HYPE unlock threatens price discovery; additional supply might pressure prices if not absorbed by demand. To sum this up, if HYPE exceeds $50 on high volume, bulls could target a retest of the $59 all-time high from Sept. 18 and might move into the $55–$65 range next. Falling below $44 could cause a drop into the high-$30s.

Treasury wallets now hold over 20.9 million SOL, roughly 3.64% of the total supply, indicating that large investors are increasingly viewing SOL alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum as part of diversified crypto portfolios. Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Incoming As Axelar And Flare Target 8 Billion Tokens Companies like Forward Industries and Brera Holdings have disclosed their asset exposure, while ARK has added Solana-related equities and continues to emphasize the network’s expansion. Meanwhile, speculation about a potential Solana staking ETF has gained momentum; if approved, it could reduce circulating supply and provide yield access, potentially attracting significant new capital into SOL. Mid-cycle analyst targets of $300–$500 reflect this institutional interest along with rising on-chain activity. SOL's price trends to the upside but with some losses on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD chart on Tradingview Firedancer + Alpenglow: Leap in Performance vs. Decentralization Risk Solana’s technology roadmap provides another boost. Jump Crypto’s Firedancer client proposes SIMD-0370 to remove the fixed compute block limit, allowing higher-performance validators to process more complex blocks and increasing overall throughput. At the same time, the Alpenglow upgrade (testnet scheduled for December) aims to drastically reduce transaction finality, from approximately 12.8 seconds to 150 milliseconds, making Solana the fastest major chain. These changes could strengthen Solana’s leadership in high-volume DeFi and payments. However, critics warn that increasing centralization may occur if smaller validators cannot afford the necessary hardware upgrades. The primary challenge is striking a balance between raw speed and validator diversity, which is crucial for evaluating the network’s long-term resilience. Price Levels: Can Solana (SOL) Bulls Defend $207? Currently, SOL hovers near $208–$210, up modestly on the day as momentum rebuilds. The market now focuses on $207 as the first support level; a sustained hold preserves the uptrend and keeps a retest of $230–$253 possible, with $257 (the 52-week high) remaining above. Losing $207 opens the door to $190–$185 as the next demand zone, and a deeper shakeout could test $165–$167. Short-term sentiment is supported by improving tape dynamics, higher spot volumes, and active addresses, although macro factors remain a swing factor. For traders, the constructive setup is to hold $207, reclaim $223–$230, and then challenge $253–$257. For investors, the thesis relies on three pillars: increasing treasury ownership and potential ETF catalysts, throughput leadership from Firedancer and Alpenglow, and expanding real-world utility across DeFi and commerce.

This on-chain demand contrasts with ETF outflows and could support a renewed bullish trend in ETH if buying persists and $4,000 holds. Whales added 252,441 ETH in three days, lifting Bitmine’s treasury to ~2.2M ETH. ETF products suffered $795.56M in outflows this week, pulling AUM back to ~$26B. On-chain momentum and seasonal Q4 history point to upside if the $4,000 floor holds. Ethereum whales drive market moves — major wallets piled in 252,441 ETH in three days. Read the full analysis and outlook for ETH; learn the key levels to watch. What are Ethereum whales doing right now? Ethereum whales are actively buying: treasury buyer Bitmine accumulated 252,441 ETH in three days, taking its holding to about 2.2 million ETH (~$8.84 billion at recent prices). Large wallet activity and selective re-entries suggest stronger on-chain demand while ETFs experienced notable outflows. How are ETH ETFs affecting market flows? ETH ETFs registered heavy outflows this week, totaling $795.56 million — the largest weekly loss since launch. That pulled assets under management from above $30 billion back toward $26 billion, reducing a visible retail and institutional demand channel despite whale accumulation on-chain. Data cited: SoSoValue (ETF flows) and reported AUM figures. Ethereum [ETH] whales are making a notable move this week. Institutional-grade treasury buyer Bitmine added 252,441 ETH in three days, lifting its total to roughly 2.2 million ETH, valued at about $8.84 billion at the time of reporting. Other on-chain actors followed suit. Whale wallet 0xE37F, which sold 1,857 ETH five months ago at ~$2,251, re-entered the market and purchased 1,501 ETH (~$6.17 million) at roughly $4,114 per ETH today. These re-entry signals indicate renewed conviction from some long-term holders. Source: X While on-chain whale accumulation is clear, broader market indicators show mixed signals. ETF outflows removed nearly $800 million in a single week, reversing much of the inflow momentum seen in August and early September. Source: X ETF product outflows this week totaled $795.56 million — the largest weekly withdrawal on record for ETH funds. Net assets under management retraced from earlier highs above $30 billion to near $26 billion at the time of writing. Source: X Can Q4 push ETH higher? Historical seasonality and recent strength suggest Q4 could amplify gains if current patterns persist. Analyst TedPillows notes ETH is undergoing a healthy correction after rallying nearly 250% from lows, and past cycles show Q4 gains often outpace Q3 performance. Source: Coinglass If the correction completes and macro conditions remain supportive, a move above $10,000 is within the scenario set being discussed by several technical analysts. That path depends on sustained demand, continued whale accumulation, and ETF flows stabilizing. Source: X What is the short-term outlook for ETH? Short-term, ETH appears to be consolidating after the recent dip and has recovered above ~$4,100. Technical indicators show the RSI near 45, suggesting neither oversold nor overbought conditions, while trading volumes remain subdued — limiting immediate momentum. Source: TradingView Key levels to watch: bulls need to defend $4,000 to maintain a bullish bias; a decisive break below that could open the door to further downside. Conversely, renewed buying above recent highs would point to continuation of the uptrend and increased probability of Q4 outperformance. Frequently Asked Questions Are Ethereum whales buying more ETH right now? Yes. Large on-chain buyers including Bitmine added 252,441 ETH in three days, raising its treasury to ~2.2M ETH (~$8.84B). Several large wallets also re-entered positions during this period, signaling concentrated accumulation. Why did ETH ETFs see such large outflows? ETF outflows of $795.56M this week reflect a mix of profit-taking and rotation. The drawdown reduced ETF AUM from earlier highs above $30B back toward $26B, weakening an important liquidity channel for ETH. What price levels should traders monitor? Short-term support: $4,000. Key resistance: recent highs above $4,500 and psychological levels that align with seasonal strength in Q4. Confirming volume and hold of support will be critical. Key Takeaways Whale accumulation : Bitmine added 252,441 ETH in three days, bringing its treasury to roughly 2.2M ETH. ETF reversal : ETH ETFs saw $795.56M in outflows this week; AUM fell to about $26B. Outlook : If $4,000 holds and on-chain buying continues, seasonal Q4 dynamics and technical setup could favor a renewed rally. Conclusion Ethereum whales are currently increasing holdings while ETFs experienced large outflows, creating a mixed but actionable market picture. On-chain accumulation from large wallets provides underlying support, yet ETF outflows and light volume keep the near-term outlook conditional. Monitor $4,000 support and ETF flows; stronger buying would increase the probability of a decisive Q4 move.

Today, a single whale reportedly sold $31.59 million in $SOL, highlighting significant profit-taking on minor price pumps, according to analyst TedPillows. Despite this selling pressure, the market shows potential for continued upside if key technical levels hold. Weekly Chart Hints at Bullish Continuation According to CryptoJelleNL, Solana’s weekly chart shows a prominent cup-and-handle pattern forming above $180 support. The recent bounce near $206 confirms a successful retest of the breakout zone. The $250 mark remains the last hurdle for buyers, and clearing this resistance could trigger a sustained rally toward $300–$340 by year-end. Source: X Conversely, a failure to overcome $250 may result in a brief pullback toward $190–$200 before another attempt. Consequently, the current setup signals bullish continuation if buyers can defend the retest and push decisively through this key resistance. Daily Chart Insights and Liquidity Sweeps On the daily timeframe, Solana has reclaimed the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) after a brief dip, signaling renewed bullish interest, according to Umair Crypto. The recent sweep below the SMA likely gathered liquidity, setting up a potential move toward resistance around $229–$232. Source: X Nevertheless, traders remain cautious, as weekend closes often spark debates about the validity of short-term movements. A confirmed close above $210 would strengthen the bullish outlook, while slipping back under the SMA could target support levels at $185 and $161. The RSI has recovered from oversold conditions but remains mid-range, suggesting measured buying interest. With the current price around $214 , $SOL has gained 3.56% in the past 24 hours, despite a 1.24% decline over the last week. Trading volumes remain robust, with $7.31 billion exchanged in the last 24 hours, reflecting active investor engagement. Regulatory Updates Add Another Layer Beyond technical factors, regulatory news continues to influence sentiment. Journalist Eleanor Terrett reports that the SEC has asked issuers of $SOL, $LTC, $XRP, $ADA, and $DOGE ETFs to withdraw their 19b-4 filings following the approval of generic listing standards.

The breakout reached its projected target zone and maintained bullish momentum. What is the Bitcoin breakout structure and why does it matter? Bitcoin breakout refers to BTC moving decisively above the resistance line of a descending broadening wedge, signaling a potential trend reversal. This breakout matters because it can shift short-term sentiment, attract liquidity, and trigger short-covering that amplifies upward movement. How strong is the breakout and what on-chain data supports it? Strength is supported by multiple metrics. DeFi value locked rose to $8.343 billion, active Bitcoin addresses exceeded 652,000, and decentralized exchange volume reached $795 million in 24 hours. These indicators show increased participation and capital flow into the market. $BTC #Bitcoin Descending Broadening Wedge Upside breakout is Confirmed.. pic.twitter.com/nbka0VF7nd — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) September 29, 2025 Price then moved sharply upward, breaking the wedge resistance line. Captain Faibik noted the breakout achieved its measured projection highlighted on the chart. A minor retracement followed but stayed above the broken resistance, confirming strength in the breakout. How do technical levels and liquidity clusters affect the next moves? Immediate resistance sits at $113,200–$113,500, with $115,000 as a decisive threshold. Coinglass data showed nearly $1.58 billion in shorts clustered near that zone, and such concentration increases the chance of rapid liquidations if BTC pushes through. Source: AltcoinSherpa (X) Altcoin Sherpa highlighted $113,000 and $116,000 as next watch zones; BTC is in a recovery after rebounding near $108,000. Short-term moving averages show the 20 EMA crossing upward with the 50 EMA close behind, indicating improving momentum. Support is between $111,600–$111,800 and the 200-day EMA sits near $106,336. When could the breakout fail and what are the risk signals? A failed breakout may occur if BTC falls back below the broken resistance and closes under key support at $111,600–$111,800. Risk signals include rising net outflows, weakening DEX volume, and failure of follow-through on volume after breakout. Coinglass reported net outflows of $71 million on September 29, which can reflect accumulation or short-term repositioning. Traders should watch liquidity clusters and orderbook heatmaps for early warning signs. Frequently Asked Questions Is this breakout likely to lead to a sustained rally? If Bitcoin sustains closes above $113K and clears $115K with supporting volume and on-chain metrics, the breakout has higher odds of developing into a sustained rally. Monitor DeFi value locked, active addresses, and short concentration for confirmation. What immediate support levels should traders use for risk management? Use $111,600–$111,800 as near-term support and the 200-day EMA near $106,336 as a longer-term support reference for position sizing and stop placement. Key Takeaways Breakout confirmed : BTC cleared a descending broadening wedge and held gains near $112K. Key resistance : $113,200–$115,000 — clearing $115K could trigger short squeezes. Market support : $8.34B DeFi value locked, 652K active addresses, and $795M DEX volume reinforce the move. Conclusion Bitcoin’s confirmed breakout from a descending wedge positions BTC price for further upside if it sustains above $113K and decisively clears $115K. Monitor liquidity clusters, DeFi value locked, and active address growth for confirmation. COINOTAG will continue to track updates and market signals as the situation develops.

This reduces enforcement risk and clarifies a pathway for launch without securities registration. SEC issued a no-action letter for DoubleZero’s planned 2Z token. DePIN tokens that compensate contributors for physical infrastructure work can be treated as functional tokens, not securities. Market reaction was muted: DePIN-related tokens fell ~2% in the past day per CoinGecko market data. DePIN tokens: SEC no-action clears uncertainty for DoubleZero’s 2Z token. Read COINOTAG analysis, implications, and actionable next steps. Get guidance. The SEC backed off from DePIN tokens in a rare no-action letter, as the agency’s top brass says it’s not meant to “regulate all economic activity.” The US Securities and Exchange Commission has signalled it will not recommend enforcement action against tokens tied to Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) in a specific no-action response to DoubleZero’s token plan. What are DePIN tokens and why did the SEC issue a no-action letter? DePIN tokens are blockchain tokens designed to incentivize contributors to distributed physical infrastructure (for example, private fiber or hardware). The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance issued a no-action indication for DoubleZero’s planned 2Z programmatic transfers after concluding the described token mechanics and compensatory model fall outside securities registration requirements. How did the SEC define DoubleZero’s 2Z token in its response? The SEC’s chief counsel for the Division of Corporation Finance indicated the described programmatic transfers and the token’s utility characteristics mean the 2Z token is not being presented as a class of equity securities. Key points from the agency and stakeholders: Programmatic transfers to contributors were central to the SEC’s assessment. DoubleZero stated its protocol enables access to underutilized private fiber links managed by contributors; tokens are compensation for services. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce emphasized the economic reality of DePIN differs from capital-raising securities. Source: Austin Federa How does this decision affect market and developer behavior? Front-loaded for clarity: the no-action indication reduces near-term enforcement risk for similar DePIN projects that design tokens as functional incentives rather than investment contracts. Practically, teams can prioritize infrastructure deployment over securities compliance in initial token designs—if token economics truly tie value to contributor activity. Market response was modest: DePIN-related tokens showed a roughly 2% decline in the last day, per CoinGecko data. That muted movement suggests the decision clarified regulatory exposure but did not dramatically change short-term trading sentiment. How can projects determine if a token is a security? Use this checklist to evaluate token classification. Document function: Show tokens compensate work or grant access to services, not shares of profit. Programmatic transfers: Prefer automated, non-discretionary mechanisms to distribute tokens. Economic reality: Keep token utility independent from managerial efforts promising profit. Legal review: Obtain counsel opinions and seek regulatory clarity (e.g., no-action letters) where feasible. Transparent governance: Publish protocols, contributor roles, and distribution mechanics clearly. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to assess whether a DePIN token is a security"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step checklist for teams to evaluate token classification and prepare for regulatory review."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/01999835-02f2-7ac0-aada-3af21d76658b.webp"", ""totalTime"": ""PT72H"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Document token utility"", ""text"": ""Define how tokens are used to compensate contributors or enable access to infrastructure."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Describe transfer mechanics"", ""text"": ""Show transfers are programmatic and not linked to investment returns from others' efforts."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Seek written regulatory clarity"", ""text"": ""Consider submitting documentation to regulators for a no-action indication or written response."" } ], ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""SEC No-Action Letter Clears Path for DePIN Tokens: DoubleZero’s 2Z Not Treated as Security"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/01999835-02f2-7ac0-aada-3af21d76658b.webp""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-09-29T12:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-09-29T12:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/01999835-02f2-7ac0-aada-3af21d76658b.webp"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""description"": ""The SEC issued a no-action indication for DoubleZero's 2Z DePIN token, signaling functional infrastructure tokens can be outside securities registration when transfers reward contributors programmatically.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are DePIN tokens now exempt from securities laws?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Not categorically.

The SEC’s response is specific to the facts presented. DePIN tokens can be treated as non-securities when they function as compensation for infrastructure contributions and feature programmatic, non-investment transfer mechanics. What immediate steps should DePIN teams take after this ruling? Teams should document token utility and distribution mechanisms, seek legal review, and maintain transparent technical and economic disclosures to support similar regulatory assessments. Key Takeaways Regulatory clarity: A no-action indication can reduce enforcement risk for well-designed DePIN tokens. Design matters: Tokens intended as compensation for contributor work and distributed programmatically are more likely to be treated as functional. Do the work: Document mechanics, obtain legal review, and prepare disclosures to demonstrate non-security characteristics. Conclusion The SEC’s no-action letter for DoubleZero provides a practical precedent for DePIN tokens when token value arises from contributors’ infrastructure work and transfers occur programmatically.

Published: 2025-09-28 | Updated: 2025-09-28 | By COINOTAG What is the XRP breakout outlook? XRP breakout outlook centers on a low-volume URPD gap at $2.66–$2.80 and a deep accumulation band at $0.25–$0.75. If selling above the gap is absorbed, price may accelerate quickly toward recent highs; if not, a sweep toward the $2.50–$2.45 liquidity zone could follow. How does URPD support XRP’s price dynamics? URPD (UTXO Realized Price Distribution) highlights where tokens were accumulated and reveals price voids. The $2.66–$2.80 gap is low realized volume, often allowing fast moves due to limited overhead resistance. Billions accumulated near $0.25–$0.75 create a durable support base, reducing downside risk for long-term holders. $XRP has a price gap sitting between $2.73 and $2.51. pic.twitter.com/T1100MsSBc — Ali (@ali_charts) September 27, 2025 Why could ETF filings influence institutional XRP flows? ETF filings build a regulatory and market-access pathway for institutions. Multiple firms have submitted proposals, and futures-based products set precedents that may lower the uncertainty barrier. A sizable AUM proposal cited in filings positions XRP as a candidate for renewed institutional allocation if approvals progress. When might technical patterns force a decisive move? XRP is trading near the lower boundary of a descending triangle, a pattern that can resolve abruptly. If the triangle breaks upward with volume and clears the URPD gap, price could surge rapidly. Conversely, intensified selling may target the $2.50–$2.45 zone aligned with daily Fair Value Gap (FVG) and the 0.50–0.618 Fibonacci retracement. Frequently Asked Questions What levels indicate strong XRP support? Strong support zones are concentrated at $0.25–$0.75 (high accumulation) and secondary support at $2.50–$2.45, which aligns with daily FVG and mid-range Fibonacci retracement levels. How should traders use the URPD gap in strategy? Use the URPD gap as an acceleration target: plan entries below or above the gap with tight risk management. If price enters the gap, expect reduced resistance and potential for rapid moves; if rejected, watch the $2.50–$2.45 liquidity sweep area. Key Takeaways URPD gap: $2.66–$2.80 is an acceleration zone that can lead to quick upside. Support base: Heavy accumulation at $0.25–$0.75 offers long-term support for XRP holders. ETF impact: Multiple filings and futures precedents may increase institutional demand if regulatory signals improve. Conclusion Front-loaded indicators — URPD gap, deep accumulation, and ETF filings — align to create a plausible path for an XRP breakout. Traders should watch absorption of overhead supply and the $2.50–$2.45 liquidity area as decisive scenarios unfold.

52456721,591842,1759197611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52456721.jpeg,Solana Could Get A Turbo Boost As Firedancer Targets Block Restrictions,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-turbo-boost-firedancer/,"Solana’s performance push picked up fresh momentum this week as engineers behind Firedancer, the alternative high-performance validator client spearheaded by Jump, filed a new Solana Improvement Document (SIMD-0370) to remove the network’s block-level compute unit (CU) limit—a change they argue is now redundant after Alpenglow and would immediately translate into higher throughput and lower latency when demand spikes. Next Turbo Boost For Solana The pull request , authored by the “Firedancer Team” and opened on September 24, 2025, is explicitly framed as a “post-Alpenglow” proposal. In Alpenglow, voter nodes broadcast a SkipVote if they cannot execute a proposed block within the allotted time. Because slow blocks are automatically skipped, the authors contend that a separate protocol-enforced CU ceiling per block is unnecessary. “In Alpenglow , voter nodes broadcast a SkipVote if they do not manage to execute a block in time… This SIMD therefore removes the block compute unit limit enforcement,” the document states, describing the limit as superfluous under the upgraded scheduling rules. Beyond technical cleanliness, the authors pitch a sharper economic alignment. The current block-level CU cap, they argue, breaks incentives by capping capacity via protocol rather than hardware and software improvements. Removing it would let producers fill blocks up to what their machines can safely process and propagate, pushing client and hardware competition to the forefront. “The capacity of the network is determined not by the capabilities of the hardware but by the arbitrary block compute unit limit,” they write, before outlining why lifting that lid would realign incentives for both validator clients and program developers. Early code-review comments from core contributors and client teams underline both the near-term user impact and the boundaries of the change. One reviewer summarized the practical upside: “Removing the limit today has tangible benefits for the ecosystem and end users… without waiting for the future architecture of the network to be fleshed out.” Another emphasized that some block constraints would remain, citing a “maximum shred limit,” while others suggested the network should likely retain per-transaction CU limits for now and treat any change there as a separate, more far-reaching discussion. Security and liveness considerations feature prominently. Reviewers asked the proposal to explicitly spell out why safety is preserved even if a block is too heavy to propagate in time; the Alpenglow answer is that such blocks are simply not voted in, i.e., they get skipped—maintaining forward progress without penalizing the network. The Firedancer authors concur that the decisive guardrail is the clock and propagation budget, not a static CU ceiling. The proposal also addresses a frequent concern in throughput debates: coordination. If one block producer upgrades hardware aggressively while others lag, does the network risk churn from skipped blocks? One reviewer notes that overly ambitious producers already self-calibrate because missed blocks mean missed rewards, naturally limiting block size to what peers can accept in time. The document further argues that, with the CU limit gone, market forces govern capacity: producers and client teams that optimize execution, networking, and scheduling will win more blocks and fees, pushing the frontier outward as demand warrants. Crucially, SIMD-0370 is future-compatible. Ongoing designs for multiple concurrent proposers—a long-term roadmap item for Solana—sometimes assume a block limit and sometimes do not. Reviewers stress that removing the current limit does not preclude concurrent-proposer architectures later; it simply unblocks improvements that “can be realized today.” While the GitHub discussion supplies the technical meat, Anza—the Solana client team behind Agave —has also amplified the proposal on social channels, signaling broad client-team attention to the change and its user-facing implications. What would change for users and developers if SIMD-0370 ships? In peak periods—airdrops, mints, market volatility—blocks could carry more compute as long as they can be executed and propagated within slot time, potentially raising sustained throughput and smoothing fee spikes. For Solana developers, higher headroom and stronger incentives for client/hardware optimization could reduce tail latency for demanding workloads, albeit with the continuing need to optimize programs for parallelism and locality. For validators, the competitive edge would tilt even more toward execution efficiency, networking performance, and smart block-building policies that balance fee revenue against the risk of producing a block so heavy it gets skipped. As with all SIMDs, the change is subject to community review, implementation, and deployment coordination across validator clients. But the direction is clear. Post-Alpenglow, Solana’s designers believe the slot-time budget is the real limiter. At press time, Solana traded at $205.38.",Solana|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana news|Solana price,EN,0,0,SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-30 02:00:11

Related Reading: When Will XRP Reach $25? Bitcoin Investor Shares A Bold Prediction Based on reports using CryptoQuant data and commentary by Axel Adler, demand cooled after the market failed to hold above $115,000, leaving traders watching a narrow corridor for the next move. The mood is neither euphoric nor panicked — it is cautious. Mounting Pressure At Descending Highs Over the past week Bitcoin swung between a local high near $115,550 and a low around $108,400. For the last sessions it settled into an even tighter $108,750–109,740 band. Sellers stepped in at lower highs, keeping the price from climbing back to the prior range. According to Adler, those descending highs are a warning sign because they show buyers are losing early ground. Immediate resistance sits around $111,000–112,000, based on on-chain flows and exchange behavior. Move past that and bulls could try to retake $114,000–115,400. Fail to defend $108,750 and the path down may quicken toward $106,000–105,000. Momentum Has Turned Cautious CryptoQuant’s 30-day momentum index finished the week near -2%, down from +1% at the start, a swing of three percentage points. Momentum readings this period ranged from -6% to +1%, and only two of seven sessions closed above zero. Those figures underline how the loss of the $114,000–115,000 support coincided with falling buying pressure. Traders often look for sustained positive momentum to confirm a rally. According to Adler, a clear recovery would need a return above $112K and several days of positive momentum to shift the tone back toward an uptrend. Market Structure And What It Means The current pattern is a classic consolidation after a failed breakout. Buyers tried and failed to keep prices north of $115,000, and that shortfall left the market in a neutral-to-bearish stance. Reports have disclosed that the week’s range and the momentum slide make an immediate strong advance unlikely without fresh demand. At the same time, there is no sign of a full-scale sell-off. Liquidity remains present near established supports.

The $108,600 base remains a key level. A break below it without a swift rebound could open the way toward stronger support between $106,000 and $105,000. Shifts in on-chain demand and exchange flows are expected to provide clearer signals, as price action alone may appear steady while underlying activity changes.

Here’s why gold-backed tokens won’t work for XRP’s utility function. Published: 2025-09-30 • Updated: 2025-09-30 What is the XRP gold-backing theory? XRP gold-backed theory claims XRP could be pegged or collateralized by physical gold, but the token’s protocol and utility function contradict that idea. XRP was built as a ledger-native liquidity and settlement asset, not as a redeemable claim on vault-held gold or other physical reserves. How does XRP differ from gold-backed tokens? XRP is a native ledger token used for settlement and liquidity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Gold-backed tokens—such as PAX Gold or Tether Gold in market discussion—are separate issued assets that represent ownership of physical gold held by custodians. These gold tokens include redemption and custody mechanisms that XRP lacks by design. Gold-backed tokens introduce counterparty risk tied to custodians, audits, and vault systems. XRP’s protocol does not include a built-in redemption mechanism linking units of XRP to specific grams of gold. That structural difference prevents a true pegging of XRP to physical gold without an entirely new issuance and legal framework. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/xrp-gold-backing-explained"" }, ""headline"": ""Why XRP Cannot Be Gold-Backed — How XRP and Gold Tokens Differ"", ""description"": ""XRP gold-backed claims debunked: XRP cannot be pegged to gold.

XRP gold peg is infeasible because XRP lacks a protocol-level redemption and custody model that ties each token to a physical asset. Pegging requires enforceable claims, audited reserves, and custodial infrastructure that operate outside XRPL’s native utility role. Attempting to retrofit XRP with gold collateral would introduce counterparty risk, regulatory complexity, and functional conflicts with the token’s role as a neutral settlement and liquidity asset. Can XRP facilitate gold-backed tokens on the XRPL? Yes. XRP can be used as a bridge or liquidity layer to transfer value between accounts and tokenized gold assets issued on the XRPL. Projects like Meld Gold (mentioned as a market initiative) plan gold-backed tokens on XRPL, where XRP serves transactional and liquidity functions without becoming the underlying collateral itself. In those flows, gold-backed tokens remain separate issued assets with custodial claims; XRP simply enables fast transfers and liquidity provisioning. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is XRP backed by gold?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No. XRP is not backed by gold; it is a native utility token on the XRP Ledger and lacks a protocol mechanism linking it to physical gold reserves."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Can gold-backed tokens be issued on XRPL?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Retrofitting XRP to be gold-backed would require creating an external custodian-backed issuance and a legal redemption mechanism. That would effectively create a new issued token, not change native XRP, and would introduce counterparty and regulatory complexity. How does token custody affect gold-backed assets? Custody determines redeemability. Gold-backed tokens rely on verified custodians and audits to guarantee holders can exchange tokens for physical gold. Failures in custody or audit reduce token credibility and increase counterparty risk. Key Takeaways XRP is a utility asset : XRP’s design prioritizes liquidity and settlement, not reserve-backed redeemability. Gold tokens are separate : Gold-backed tokens operate with custodian-backed reserves and legal redemption pathways. XRP can bridge gold : XRP facilitates transfers and liquidity for gold tokens on the XRPL without becoming tied to gold itself. Conclusion Claims that XRP is or can be directly gold-backed are inconsistent with the token’s technical design and the mechanics of reserve-backed assets. XRP gold-backed narratives often conflate bridge utility with collateralization. Moving forward, watch for approved gold token issuances on the XRPL and regulatory developments that clarify how tokenized commodities interact with native ledger assets.

""We are willing to work with people who want to tokenize, we urge them to come talk to us,"" Peirce said while speaking at the Digital Assets Summit in Singapore. A tokenized security is a blockchain-based digital representation of ownership or rights in an underlying asset, such as stocks or bonds. It means the same security can exist in both traditional paper certificates and electronic certificates, as well as in blockchain-based tokens. The key issue Peirce pointed to is understanding how these different forms of the same security relate to and interact with one another. ""Some of the questions are how does a tokenized security interact with other iterations of the security and other forms of that security,"" Peirce explained, while calling for a nuanced approach to regulating tokenization, saying, ""Depending on how things are tokenized, it could be one of many different things,"" she noted. Tokenization stands out as one of the few cryptocurrency sub-sectors, alongside stablecoins, with significant real-world applications. Financial institutions worldwide are adopting tokenization to improve market liquidity and operational efficiency, driving a transformative shift in how assets are issued, traded, and managed in the global financial system. As of Tuesday, the total on-chain tokenisation market was valued at $31 billion, according to RWA.xyz , with $714 million of that being tokenized stocks.

Learn next steps. A new bill in Wisconsin could exempt local crypto users and businesses from money transmitter licenses, boosting mining, staking, and blockchain development. Wisconsin lawmakers introduced Assembly Bill 471 on Monday to carve out explicit exemptions from state money transmitter licensing for a range of blockchain activities. The bill text from the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau clarifies that individuals and businesses would not need Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) money transmitter licenses for activities such as crypto mining, staking, node operation and blockchain software development. Under AB471, exchanging digital assets is exempt when the transaction does not involve conversion to legal tender or deposits to deposit accounts. The proposal aims to reduce regulatory uncertainty for local developers and service providers. Progress of AB471 Bill. Source: Bitcoin Laws What is Wisconsin crypto bill AB471? Wisconsin crypto bill AB471 is proposed state legislation that exempts certain blockchain activities from state money transmitter licensing. The bill specifically lists activities such as operating a node, developing blockchain software, transferring digital assets and participating in staking as non‑licensable when they don’t convert to legal tender. How does AB471 change money-transmitter licensing rules? The bill narrows the DFI’s licensing scope by defining explicit exemptions. It states that neither a state agency nor political subdivision may prohibit accepting digital assets as payment or custodying them in self‑hosted wallets or hardware wallets. Key provisions include: 1) permission to operate nodes and participate in protocol operations; 2) allowance for blockchain software development; 3) clarity on peer transfers of digital assets; and 4) protected activity for staking on blockchain protocols. Source: Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau. Who sponsors the bill and what is its legislative status? AB471 is sponsored by seven Republican members in the Assembly with two Republican Senate co-sponsors. The measure is currently referred to the Committee on Financial Institutions and recorded at approximately 25% progression in Legiscan tracking. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wisconsin-crypto-bill-ab471"" }, ""headline"": ""Wisconsin Bill AB471 Would Exempt Mining, Staking and Certain Exchanges From Money-Transmitter Licenses"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/01999855-50fb-7b83-80b3-245eea44d53f.webp"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-09-30T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-09-30T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""A new Wisconsin bill proposes exemptions to state money-transmitter licensing for mining, staking, node operation and some digital-asset exchanges, aiming to reduce regulatory uncertainty.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does AB471 remove all licensing requirements for crypto businesses?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No. AB471 exempts specific activities such as mining, staking, node operation and certain transfers that do not convert to legal tender, but other activities involving conversion to fiat or deposit accounts may still require licensing."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""When could AB471 become law?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The bill must pass both legislative chambers and committee reviews; as of the latest update it is in committee with a reported progression of 25% (source: Legiscan).

Yes. AB471 explicitly allows developing software on blockchain protocols without a DFI money-transmitter license, reducing regulatory friction for local developers and startups. How will AB471 affect exchanges operating in Wisconsin? Exchanges that do not convert digital assets to legal tender or accept deposits may fall under the exemption. Exchanges performing fiat conversions or deposit services would still face licensing requirements. Key Takeaways Regulatory clarity : AB471 aims to clearly exempt specific blockchain activities from money-transmitter licensing. Limited scope : Exemptions apply only when transactions avoid conversion to legal tender or bank deposits. Next steps : The bill is in committee with a 25% progression; stakeholders should monitor legislative movement and prepare compliance plans. Conclusion Assembly Bill 471 could materially reduce licensing burdens for mining, staking, node operation and blockchain development in Wisconsin, while keeping conversion-to-fiat activity regulated. Watch committee actions and legislative calendars for updates and prepare operational governance that respects the exemption’s scope. Publication: 2025-09-30.

Institutional holdings now exceed 11.8M ETH, pushing institutional demand as a major price driver for ETH. BitMine leads with 2.65M ETH, over $11B in holdings. Bit Digital is raising $100M (plus $15M option) to increase its Ether treasury. Institutions and ETFs hold ~11.8M ETH — close to 10% of supply, signaling material institutional demand. Meta description: Ether treasury growth: BitMine leads with 2.65M ETH; Bit Digital seeks $100M to expand holdings. Read implications and next steps now. BitMine chairman Tom Lee thinks Ether is trading at a discount because future adoption of the blockchain by Wall Street and AI companies will drive it higher. Digital asset company Bit Digital plans to raise $100 million through a convertible senior note offering to grow its Ether treasury, while BitMine Immersion Technologies has extended its lead as the largest Ether treasury company. Bit Digital said in a statement on Monday it’s also offering an option for an extra $15 million in notes, with all net proceeds earmarked for more Ether (ETH) purchases, plus general corporate purposes, “including potential investments, acquisitions and other business opportunities relating to digital assets.” Bit Digital currently holds more than 120,000 Ether and is the seventh-largest Ether treasury company tracked by StrategicEtherReserve. If successful in its raise, the company could purchase another 23,714 tokens, which would bump it up the list to sixth, ahead of crypto exchange Coinbase. Source: Bit Digital What is the current state of institutional Ether treasuries? Institutional Ether treasury holdings have grown materially in 2025, totaling roughly 11.8 million ETH — just under 10% of supply. Large treasury companies and ETFs have been accumulating, with BitMine and SharpLink among the largest holders tracked by StrategicEtherReserve. This concentration increases institutional demand pressure on ETH markets. How is Bit Digital planning to expand its Ether treasury? Bit Digital announced a convertible senior note offering targeting $100 million, with a $15 million option. Proceeds are designated primarily for Ether purchases alongside corporate purposes. Current holdings exceed 120,000 ETH; a full raise could add ~23,714 ETH, moving Bit Digital up the institutional ranking. Why has BitMine extended its lead in Ether holdings? BitMine reported an expanded treasury of 2.65 million Ether (estimated value > $11 billion), surpassing second-place SharpLink Gaming at ~838,000 ETH. StrategicEtherReserve lists BitMine’s most recent large purchase on Sept. 26, when it acquired 234,000 ETH as part of a plan to hold ~5% of total supply. BitMine’s average purchase price is reported at $4,141 per ETH; market pricing at the time was approximately $4,221 per CoinGecko data. Large, coordinated purchases amplify market visibility and may influence price discovery. How do executive views shape the narrative around Ether demand? BitMine Chairman Tom Lee called ETH “a discount to the future,” citing two converging supercycles — crypto and AI — that he believes will favor neutral public blockchains like Ethereum. Jan van Eck of VanEck made similar remarks, forecasting financial-services adoption of blockchain rails and predicting Ethereum as the preferred platform. These expert statements underscore a broader institutional thesis: Ether’s long-term demand may be driven by stablecoin flows, DeFi growth, and on-chain infrastructure needs for AI and traditional finance. How could institutional holdings affect ETH price action? Supply concentration: Institutions holding >11.8M ETH reduces liquid market supply. Demand tailwinds: Convertible-note purchases and ETF accumulation create predictable buy pressure.

Institutions, treasury companies, and ETFs collectively hold about 11.8 million ETH in 2025, representing just under 10% of total supply according to industry trackers and public filings. Will institutional buying push Ether prices higher? Institutional accumulation reduces available float and can create sustained buying pressure. Historical analogs and expert commentary suggest meaningful treasury purchases can influence price discovery over time. Key Takeaways Concentration: BitMine leads with 2.65M ETH; institutional holdings are a material share of supply. Fundraising-led demand: Bit Digital’s $100M convertible notes aim to accelerate treasury accumulation. Long-term thesis: Executives cite blockchain adoption by Wall Street and AI as structural demand drivers for Ethereum. Conclusion Institutional Ether treasuries are consolidating, with BitMine at the forefront and Bit Digital pursuing a sizable capital raise to expand its holdings. These moves, combined with executive views from industry leaders, reinforce a narrative of growing institutional demand for ETH.

Governor Kathy Hochul announced on Monday that Harris will be succeeded by Kaitlin Asrow, who becomes acting superintendent on Oct. 18. Asrow has spent the past four years leading licensing and supervision of digital asset companies as executive deputy superintendent of research and innovation at the agency. During her time at the regulator, Asrow helped build one of the largest digital asset supervisory teams in the world. She previously worked at the Federal Reserve and the Center for Financial Services Innovation, now called the Financial Health Network. After four transformative years of leadership, Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris has made the decision to leave NYDFS. As the longest-serving Superintendent in DFS history, she leaves behind a stronger, more resilient DFS redefined by bold vision, modern policy, and real impact. pic.twitter.com/d75NRT6HAV — NYDFS (@NYDFS) September 29, 2025 Harris Took Charge Of NYDFS In 2021 Amid Crypto Growth The NYDFS, established in 2011, oversees a wide range of entities including global banks, insurers, mortgage lenders, money transmitters and crypto companies operating under New York’s BitLicense framework. Its reach covers giants such as JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and Deutsche Bank, as well as digital asset providers including Coinbase, Circle and Paxos. Harris took over as superintendent in 2021 and quickly became one of the most prominent crypto regulators. She expanded the department’s virtual currency unit from three staff to more than 60 specialists, building what is considered the world’s largest crypto supervisory division. NYDFS Issued First US Standards For Dollar-Backed Stablecoins Her approach combined consumer protection with clear guidance for companies. Under her leadership, the NYDFS issued eight regulatory guidelines. These included the first US standards for dollar-backed stablecoins . They also covered rules for handling customer assets during crypto insolvencies and practices for using blockchain analytics to combat financial crime. In addition, Harris worked to update the BitLicense regime, first introduced in 2015. She refined policies on coin listings and delistings. She also clarified the rules for “greenlisted” tokens. Further, she extended the framework to stablecoins issued on blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana. These changes went on to influence federal proposals and international debates on digital asset regulation. Supporters say her leadership positioned New York as a global benchmark in regulating digital assets. Critics, however, pointed to the burden of compliance for startups, which often view New York as one of the toughest markets to enter. Global Coordination On Market Structure Adds To Regulatory Demands Harris’ exit comes at a time of mounting pressure on financial regulators. They must balance innovation with systemic safeguards. Moreover, the rise of stablecoins, debates over central bank digital currencies and global talks on market structure all highlight the importance of state-level leadership in shaping US policy. Meanwhile, Asrow’s appointment signals continuity, especially in digital assets. Her experience in building supervisory capacity for crypto firms will be crucial. In addition, she is expected to guide the agency through its next stage as the industry faces both rapid growth and growing scrutiny.

52456723,591941,1759201245,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52456723.jpeg,Crypto ETFs Suffer Worst Streak Since Launch as Bitcoin and Ethereum Record Heavy Outflows,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-etfs-suffer-worst-streak-bitcoin-outflows/,"Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs experienced their worst weekly stretch since debut, as risk appetite declined and investors de-risked heading into quarter-end. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw approximately $902.5 million in net outflows for the week of Sept. 22–26, ending a four-week inflow streak. Ethereum ETFs lost about $795.6 million, marking their largest weekly redemptions since launch. The outflows were uneven: Fidelity’s FBTC led BTC outflows, while BlackRock’s IBIT and Invesco’s BTCO defied the trend with $173.8 million and $10 million of inflows, respectively. On the ETH side, several issuers experienced large single-day withdrawals, showing how quickly flows can reverse when macro risk increases. Macro Headwinds Keep Buyers Cautious The reversal came as traders weighed new U.S. tariff announcements and lingering uncertainty about the Fed’s rate cuts ahead of key inflation data. Those headlines revived fears of a growth and liquidity squeeze, driving a quick reset across risk assets. Bitcoin briefly slipped below pivotal support intraday before rebounding, while Ethereum mirrored the move with a shallow bounce. Despite the week’s pain, September still shows net inflows for Bitcoin ETFs ($2.57B), a notable improvement from August’s outflows, evidence that institutional adoption remains intact. For now, the market’s message is clear: without a more dovish macro backdrop or cleaner inflation prints, allocators may remain selective, trimming core BTC/ETH exposure when it is strong and adding only on clear confirmations. Alternative Crypto ETFs Take Spotlight Over Bitcoin and Ethereum Beneath the headline of redemptions, some desks report rotations toward thematic or alternative crypto ETFs (e.g., Solana, XRP) as allocators seek uncorrelated catalysts. That discussion overlaps with speculation about a potential BlackRock XRP spot ETF , with market models suggesting $4–$8B of first-year inflows if such a product were filed and approved. Although no filing has been confirmed, XRP’s quick settlement times and low fees keep it on institutions’ radar. Nevertheless, the week’s outflows serve as a reminder: macro factors outweigh micro in the short term. As October progresses, focus on whether BTC funds resume steady inflows, if ETH redemptions decrease, and how upcoming inflation data influences Fed expectations. Until these factors align positively, volatility will remain high, and ETF flow reports will continue to be the best real-time indicators of institutional confidence.

Analyst Targets $3–$3.15 After Support Holds,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-bounce-analyst-targets-3-3-15-support-holds/,"A cryptocurrency analyst has explained how XRP could see a bounce to $3 or even $3.15 based on this technical support level holding. XRP Has Found Support At The Lower Level Of A Parallel Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where XRP could be heading next based on a technical analysis (TA) pattern forming in its 4-hour price chart. The pattern in question is a Parallel Channel, which forms whenever an asset observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. The upper level of the pattern provides resistance, while the lower one supports. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers Nearly $1 Billion In Liquidations As Bitcoin Extends Decline A breakout of either of these trendlines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. That is, a surge above the channel can be a bullish signal, while a drop under it is a bearish one. There are a few different types of Parallel Channels, but the one that XRP has been traveling inside recently is the simplest variant: a Parallel Channel that’s parallel to the time-axis. Below is the chart shared by Martinez that shows how XRP’s 4-hour price has been moving relative to the pattern during the last couple of months. From the graph, it’s visible that XRP fell slightly below the support level of the Parallel Channel during last week’s price dip. The asset has since recovered back above the line, however, indicating that support may not have been lost just yet. This is a pattern that the cryptocurrency has shown with this Parallel Channel a few times already. Each time, successfully reclaiming the level was followed by a surge in the asset’s price. XRP has been on the way up since re-entering the channel, so it’s possible that the same script could be in play once more. As for where the coin may be heading next, the analyst has suggested that the bounce could lead to $3, around one-fourth of the way into the channel, or even $3.15, situated at about the halfway point. It now remains to be seen whether the renewed bullish momentum will continue for the cryptocurrency and a rally to one of these targets will happen, or if another setback will take place. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Triangle Setup Points To $100, Says Analyst XRP isn’t the only altcoin that has found support at the lower boundary of a Parallel Channel recently. As Martinez has pointed out in another X post, Stellar (XLM) may also be traveling up the channel following a bounce off the support line. As displayed in the above chart, the eventual target for Stellar may be $0.41, corresponding to the resistance line of the Parallel Channel. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $0.285, up 2.5% over the last 24 hours.

ETH is now consolidating and might aim for more gains if it clears the $4,220 resistance. Ethereum remained stable above $4,020 and started a recovery wave. The price is trading above $4,150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $4,100 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above $4,220 and $4,250. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price remained supported above the $4,020 level and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to recover above the $4,050 and $4,120 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $4,275 swing high to the $3,826 low. The bulls even pushed the price above $4,200. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $4,100 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $4,150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . It is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $4,275 swing high to the $3,826 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,220 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,250 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,275 level. A clear move above the $4,275 resistance might send the price toward the $4,320 resistance. An upside break above the $4,320 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,450 resistance zone or even $4,500 in the near term. Pullback In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,250 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,150 level. The first major support sits near the $4,100 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $4,100 support might push the price toward the $4,050 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,000 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,880.

Key resistance bands at $4,158–$4,505 must be cleared to retest the $4,950 high and sustain a longer-term move toward $6,000+ ETH nears highest-ever quarterly close above $3,700 — breakout targets $6,400. Immediate resistance clusters: $4,158, $4,307, $4,505; clearing them opens all-time high retest. 24h volume ~$27.2B; market cap ~$497.8B; circulating supply ~120.7M ETH — supportive liquidity. Ethereum price update: ETH nears record Q3 close above $3,700 — read the resistance levels, targets, and trading outlook. Stay informed with COINOTAG analysis. What is Ethereum’s Q3 outlook? Ethereum price is approaching a potential record quarterly close above $3,700, which would confirm a multi-month breakout and point to aggressive upside targets of $6,000–$6,400 if momentum continues. Short-term resistance near $4,158–$4,505 must be overcome to validate the next leg higher. How do resistance levels influence Ethereum’s next move? Ethereum faces stacked resistance at $4,158, $4,307 and $4,505, identified by realized-price distributions and past heavy buying. Overcoming these zones would remove selling pressure and allow ETH to challenge the all-time high near $4,950. Volume, RSI divergence, and trendline breakout increase the probability of a decisive move. Ethereum approaches record Q3 close above $3,700, with breakout patterns targeting $6,400 and resistance levels near $4,158–$4,505. Ethereum nears record quarterly close above $3,700, with breakout patterns signaling a $6,400 target. Key resistance zones remain at $4,158, $4,307, and $4,505 before price can retest the $4,950 high. Ethereum shows signs of entering an expansion phase, with long-term projections pointing toward $6,000. If ETH closes above $3,700 this quarter, it would mark the highest quarterly close on record. Only two days remained before the Q3 candle closed in the referenced analysis. Chart patterns indicate that a confirmed breakout of the classic “W” structure points toward a longer-term target near $6,400. Why does the price structure matter for Ethereum? Longer timeframe chart structure shows Ethereum cleared long-term resistance near $3,000 after multiple failed attempts in 2022. The stronger momentum and sustained breakout increase the odds of a multi-quarter expansion phase. Technical confirmation on volume and momentum indicators supports this view. #Ethereum Highest Quarter in History? If #ETH closes above $3,700, this would mark the highest quarterly close ever. Only 2 days left until the Q3 candle closes. If confirmed, the W structure breakout points to a target around $6,400. — Titan of Crypto (Twitter), September 28, 2025 Ethereum traded at $4,124.29, recording a 3.1 percent gain within 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. The intraday range ran between $3,971.15 and $4,141.84, reflecting steady upside momentum. Market capitalization reached approximately $497.8 billion, with circulating supply around 120.7 million ETH. Source: AliCharts (X) Additional resistance levels were identified using realized-price distribution and on-chain liquidity heatmaps (Glassnode, plain text reference). These zones reflect prior heavy buying where sellers may look to exit at breakeven. Clearing these levels is a prerequisite for an all-time high retest near $4,950. How is trading activity supporting the move? Trading volume remains robust, with a reported 24-hour volume of about $27.2 billion, indicating strong market participation. ETH also strengthened versus BTC, trading near 0.03678 BTC per ETH. The combination of volume and momentum suggests market participants are accumulating into the breakout. Source: ZYN (X) ZYN’s pattern analysis indicates Ethereum has moved through accumulation and manipulation phases and is now in expansion. ZYN’s projection places a plausible $6,000 target by November 2025 if the expansion sustains. Technical indicators—bullish RSI divergence and trendline break—support a continuation scenario. Frequently Asked Questions What are the immediate resistance levels for Ethereum? Immediate resistance levels are $4,158, $4,307 and $4,505. These bands correspond to prior high-volume buy zones where selling pressure could emerge; clearing them is key to challenging $4,950. When would a long-term target of $6,400 become realistic? If Ethereum confirms a quarterly close above $3,700 and sustains higher-volume rallies while holding trendline support, the technical “W” breakout would make $6,400 a realistic long-term target over subsequent quarters. Key Takeaways Quarterly close matters : A close above $3,700 would be the highest quarterly finish for ETH and validate the breakout. Major resistance bands : $4,158–$4,505 must be cleared to retest highs; volume will confirm strength. Targets and timeline : Short-term targets range to $4,950; extended patterns point toward $6,000–$6,400 if momentum holds. Conclusion Ethereum’s near-term outlook is bullish conditional on a confirmed quarterly close above $3,700 and successive break of resistance bands at $4,158–$4,505. Technical and on-chain signals support an expansion phase, with possible targets from $4,950 up to $6,400 over the next quarters.

Keel is structured as being part of the Sky ecosystem, the long-running DeFi protocol formerly known as MakerDAO, as one of its autonomous units called ""stars."" That's part of Sky's major overhaul dubbed Endgame that includes creating smaller units, each of which is responsible for its own governance and innovation at the edge of the ecosystem. Sky is centered around issuing the USDS (USDS) and DAI (DAI) decentralized stablecoins, which have a combined supply of over $7 billion. Spark , the first of Sky's stars, has grown to more than $10 billion in total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum while allocating funds to over $1 billion in tokenized assets. Grove , the second unit launched earlier this year, is focused on collateralized loan obligations. Keel's mandate is acting as an on-chain capital allocator that sits between Solana DeFi protocols and the broader stablecoin economy. It receives a dedicated balance sheet from the USDS stablecoin reserves to deploy and support Solana-native protocols to generate yield. Early integrations include Kamino, Jupiter and Raydium, Solana-hosted marketplaces where liquidity can serve as a foundation for lending markets, routing and liquidity pools. ""Keel was founded on the belief that the next phase of on-chain finance growth needs more than new assets alone; it needs liquidity that can be accessed at speed and scale,"" said Cian Breathnach, CEO of Matariki Labs and a contributor to Keel. ""Keel is the first to provide these enablers on Solana, delivering the capital and catalyzing force for the next stage of growth in on-chain lending, borrowing, tokenization and more."" Keel's plan could also help attract more tokenized real-world assets (RWA) to the Solana space, a fast-growing sector that aims to use blockchain rails to move and settle traditional financial assets like bonds, commodities and stocks. Lily Liu, president of the Solana Foundation, called Keel ""a key step"" in positioning the blockchain as a leading marketplace for internet-scale capital markets. Rune Christensen, co-founder of Sky, added that Keel is set to become the largest capital allocator on Solana and will play a key role in shaping the DeFi and RWA landscape.

On September 14, HTX DAO hosted its first-ever Developer Ecosystem Meetup in Shanghai. Titled “Coding Season: Practical Paths for On-Chain Finance and Crypto Technology,” the event was a great success, bringing together developers and industry professionals. The meetup brought together key figures for talks and discussions, including HTX DAO core builders Molly and Helium, HTX on-chain data analyst Carl.W, Conflux engineer Darwin, GeekWeb3 cofounder Baidin, and Sui Ambassador Pika.. They shared insights on the future of DAOs, new developments in on-chain finance, and strategies for building a strong ecosystem. HTX DAO is committed to build a global ecosystem that is open to all developers. The primary focus is to create new applications for the $HTX token on the blockchain by integrating CeFi (Centralized Finance) with DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and exploring Real-World Assets (RWAs). This meetup was a significant step forward, providing a platform for developers to exchange ideas and helping HTX DAO expand its ecosystem and realize its vision of a “Free Finance Port.” Advancing Innovation through CeFi × DeFi Integration At the event, HTX DAO’s Molly announced that the organization has grown into a global community of more than 800,000 token holders across over 180 countries in just two years. She highlighted the revolutionary “X Fusion Paradigm”, which blends decentralized governance with powerful platform capabilities to create a true “Free Finance Port.” This platform operates on two distinct levels. HTX DAO is built on the TRON blockchain, which offers low gas fees, high TPS, and a vibrant stablecoin ecosystem for cross-border settlements. This foundation provides an efficient environment for creating innovative applications such as high-frequency trading protocols and cross-chain settlements. TRON’s mature DeFi protocols, including USDD, JustLend, and SunSwap, provide all the necessary tools for diverse development needs. If TRON is the infrastructure of a financial port, HTX DAO is the “financial free trade zone” built on top of it. Through on-chain governance and a suite of innovative protocols, HTX DAO integrates the liquidity of HTX (CeFi) with its own decentralized autonomy (DeFi). This marks the rise of a new financial model under the “X Fusion Paradigm.” Fostering the Next Generation of DeFi Giants HTX DAO positions itself as an incubator for new decentralized applications, not merely as an extension of the current financial system. It encourages developers to explore and innovate across key areas, aiming to nurture the next generation of DeFi leaders. ● Infrastructure Protocols: Foundational technologies such as synthetic asset frameworks, oracles, clearing layers, and cross-chain bridges form the core infrastructure supporting derivatives and multi-asset trading. ● Yield Protocols: Examples include aggregated yield and RWA protocols, enabling $HTX holders to earn more stable and modular returns. ● Asset Liquidity Protocols: Protocols such as $HTX-collateralized lending enable $HTX holders to borrow stablecoins against their assets, freeing up capital for greater flexibility. ● Governance and Incentive Tools: This category includes systems like the PoW + veHTX framework, designed to convert contributions in development, governance, and content creation into dividends and returns. Helium, a core builder at HTX DAO, explained that the platform recognizes developers as the key drivers of ecosystem innovation. To that end, HTX DAO is designing an innovative Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism to identify and reward true contributors. ● Grants Proposals : Early-stage projects can receive funding, with approval determined by the community. ● Task Contribution Points and SBT Mark : Developers are awarded points for their contributions to the platform in development, governance, and content creation. Additionally, a non-transferable Soul-Bound Token (SBT) mark is issued to record each contributor’s identity. ● Future Governance and Incentives : Over the long term, PoW contributions will determine the allocation of rights such as governance power, airdrop shares, and priority access. Helium stated that HTX DAO will not prescribe a single solution. Instead, it aims to leverage these open incentive mechanisms and ecosystem advantages to nurture the next generation of leading DeFi projects. Three Core Values Shaping a New Financial Order During the event, as speakers shared ideas and technical insights, the core values of HTX DAO became increasingly clear: Security First : Security is the absolute foundation. From Sui ambassador Pika’s insights comparing the security of Move and Rust languages to HTX DAO’s full-chain approach to protecting transactions and assets, security stands at the core of its Free Finance Port and the foundation of trust. Made for Developers : The platform is designed to be developer-friendly. From HTX on-chain data analyst Carl.W’s exploration of modular trading architecture to GeekWeb3 cofounder Baiding and Conflux engineer Darwin’s discussions on DeFi and EIP protocols, the focus was on making development more accessible. This approach allows more innovators to understand Web3 and build freely on HTX DAO’s open platform. Ecosystem and Compliance : HTX DAO and its partners, including Conflux, are exploring compliance possibilities in Hong Kong and the broader global ecosystem. This forward-looking approach brings new opportunities to cross-regional, multi-scenario financial practices. These values are rooted in HTX DAO’s commitment to long-term industry growth: security serves as the foundation, innovation as the path, and compliance as the bridge. Together, they form the blueprint for a “Free Finance Port”—a secure, trustworthy, open, and forward-looking financial ecosystem. By collaborating with developers worldwide, HTX DAO is actively exploring the deep integration of CeFi and DeFi, continually pushing the boundaries of finance. It is well-positioned to become a driving force in shaping a new, open financial order.

The video features Garlinghouse explaining how he views the future of tokens and what ultimately gives them sustainable value. His remarks provide insight into Ripple’s strategy and XRP’s position in solving real financial problems . Garlinghouse stressed that digital assets must be tied to practical use cases. He asked a series of questions to illustrate his point: “What problem is it solving? How big is that problem? How many customers do you have?” He made it clear that long-term growth cannot rely only on speculation, noting that “there’s a lot of hype in this system” and adding that he does not believe such hype benefits the industry. $XRP ARMY! Have you seen this? Ripple’s CEO said it loud: XRP settles money in seconds When trillions start moving on-chain, they won’t wait for slow rails They’ll use the one that’s already proven, scalable, and battle-tested: XRPL Wall Street knows. The banks know. You? pic.twitter.com/e43c72V5Qz — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) September 28, 2025 Focus on Global Payments and Liquidity The CEO explained that the company leverages XRP as part of its efforts to modernize cross-border transactions . He described XRP as the digital asset Ripple uses to address liquidity requirements between banks. According to Garlinghouse, “today there’s $27 trillion parked at different banks around the world so they can make payments between each other.” Ripple’s position is that XRP can streamline this process by allowing institutions to move funds instantly without holding vast sums in dormant accounts. This approach directly ties XRP’s value to its capacity to improve efficiency in the global financial system. By enabling real-time settlement, Ripple believes XRP can help reduce costs and unlock capital that is otherwise idle. Efficiency Compared to Other Assets Garlinghouse also compared XRP’s performance with other well-known cryptocurrencies. He highlighted XRP’s settlement speed, stating that it completes transactions in 3 seconds, unlike Bitcoin, which can take up to an hour or more . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 His comments suggest that if large institutions begin moving substantial sums using blockchain technology, they will prioritize networks capable of handling transactions quickly and at scale. In Garlinghouse’s view, XRP already meets these requirements, making it a viable solution for banks and financial players. Market Direction and Institutional Interest The video reinforces the perspective that once financial institutions adopt blockchain solutions for liquidity management, they will look to assets that have already proven themselves in real-world environments. According to X Finance Bull, Wall Street and the banks can already see the value of XRP. Garlinghouse’s remarks align with Ripple’s long-standing position that adoption depends on solving real challenges, not hype. XRP’s speed, scalability, and focus on financial utility continue to position it as a serious contender in the evolving digital asset landscape.

He framed the issue as mainstream, not niche, pointing to consumer adoption and polling that shows broad support for stronger guardrails. Alderoty cited several data points to make the case. A National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA) survey with Harris Poll found roughly one in five U.S. adults owns crypto. Pew Research reported that a majority of Americans lack confidence that current ways to invest, trade or use crypto are reliable and safe. And a YouGov poll showed more Americans favor tighter crypto regulation than looser rules. He also referenced Chainalysis estimates that Americans transacted more than $1 trillion in digital assets in 2024, spanning uses from payments to savings. “The absence of clear, consistent rules doesn’t make crypto go away,” Alderoty wrote, warning it pushes activity to jurisdictions moving faster. He argued that clarity would both protect consumers and give responsible firms certainty to build in the U.S. Alderoty is also president of the National Cryptocurrency Association , a crypto education nonprofit launched on March 5 with a $50 million grant from Ripple. The NCA says it aims to boost literacy and safe adoption through explainers and user stories, and its polling finds most current users want to learn more about the technology. With Congress weighing market-structure legislation after this summer’s stablecoin law, Alderoty cast the fall session as a pivotal moment. “The opportunity is in front of us. The mandate is already there,” he wrote, adding that lawmakers can “prove to Americans that Washington can, in fact, deliver clarity where it’s needed most.” He concluded that finishing the rules would keep innovation onshore and ensure the U.S. leads in shaping future financial infrastructure.",Policy|crypto regulation|Ripple|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|RESEARCH|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-30 03:41:06

OKX SG, which received a major payment institution license from the country's central bank just over a year ago , will work with crypto infrastructure provider StraitsX to allow customers to pay for everyday expenses using the two largest U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, USDT, issued by Tether, and USDC, issued by Circle Internet (CRCL). The launch of OKX Pay is a sign of the increasing adoption of stablecoins in commercial networks across Asia and beyond. StraitsX’s XSGD stablecoin is already integrated with Alipay+ and Grab, which enables wallets like GCash, KakaoPay and Touch ’n Go e-wallets. In some emerging markets, stablecoins are already widely used for remittances and day-to-day commerce , often preferred for their lower transaction fees and faster settlement times than conventional money transfers through traditional banking channels. ""OKX Pay addresses real needs for customers by expanding DPTs’ use beyond trading and investing to everyday payments — from a morning coffee to dining out with friends,"" Gracie Lin, CEO at OKX SG, said in a press release shared with CoinDesk. The system allows users to scan GrabPay SGQR codes at participating merchants and converts their USDT or USDC into XSGD, StraitsX's Singapore dollar-pegged stablecoin . The XSGD is then converted in the fiat currency and passed to merchant. Stablecoins are tokens whose values are pegged to an external reference , typically a fiat currency. This pegging mechanism minimizes the price volatility typically seen in other cryptocurrencies, providing users with a digital asset that functions similarly to traditional money while offering the benefits of blockchain technology such as faster cross-border transactions and payment modes. According to JPMorgan , stablecoin transaction volumes have zoomed to over $800 billion a month from less than $100 billion in five years. The overall use of stablecoins in real world transaction is slowly picking up. According to a BCG white paper on stablecoins released in May 2025, stablecoins' payments-related uses such as cross-border remittances, merchant transactions and on-chain settlements now make up approximately 4%–6% of total activity. Meanwhile, trading related activities make up for 88% of the total. The OKX Pay's three-step conversion ensures that merchants benefit from a simple, compliant way to accept stablecoin payments without having to handle digital payment tokens (DPTs) themselves. Every OKX Pay transaction is executed as a blockchain transfer using the Monetary Authority of Singapore's purpose bound money (PBM) framework, which applies programmable logic to ensure compliant and conditional settlement. “The future of payments will be defined by trust, speed, and interoperability – and stablecoins are at the heart of this shift,"" Tianwei Liu, StraitsX CEO & co-founder, said in the statement. ""The launch of OKX Pay is more than a new service but a blueprint for how stablecoins will underpin global commerce in the years ahead.""",Markets|OKX|Stablecoins|Payment Systems|grab|Singapore|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|USDT|USDC|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-30 04:00:00

Expert Forecasts Potential 20% Price Crash Ahead,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/whats-next-for-the-bitcoin-price-expert-forecasts-potential-20-price-crash-ahead/,"The Bitcoin price opened Monday with a slight recovery, reclaiming the $113,000 mark after a dip that brought the price down to $109,000—a level that has proven to be significant support for the top cryptocurrency. Despite this temporary bounce, one expert warns of further challenges ahead for bullish investors. Warns Of Further Bitcoin Price Drops In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit expressed confidence in his market analysis, indicating that BTC is on track to reach his projected target range between $90,000 to $94,000, meaning an additional 20% drop for the Bitcoin price. He posited that the cryptocurrency is poised to move toward a new short-term downside target at approximately $106,000. According to his assessment, a minor bounce in this area could attract additional liquidity before the market potentially moves lower. Related Reading: Everyone’s Wrong About XRP: Here’s Why, Says Top Analyst Doctor Profit also paints a bleak picture of the broader economic landscape, highlighting troubling signs such as Japan’s 10-Year Bond Yield reaching its highest level since the Global Financial Crisis. He notes that the repo-to-reserves ratio is approaching 99%, a metric that hints at funding stress and margin strain, leading to forced selling. While he acknowledges that a surge in liquidity from central banks could provide a bullish pivot, he remains skeptical given the current market conditions. The analyst also referenced a range of indicators and charts he has shared since August, emphasizing that many key market charts, including the Dow Jones, are at significant resistance levels, some of which have formed over a century. He pointed out the record levels of alleged insider selling witnessed in recent weeks, alongside a surge in retail investor inflows, suggesting a disconnect between retail enthusiasm and the actions of larger players in the market. October Could Signal Recovery In contrast to Doctor Profit’s cautious stance, market expert Timothy Peterson offers a more optimistic outlook for the Bitcoin price trajectory in the months to come. Peterson believes that October could bring a positive shift for Bitcoin, drawing on historical trends and current market dynamics. Related Reading: Ethereum Outflows Hit Spot Exchanges Again: Bullish Signal Or Neutral Flows? As recently reported by NewsBTC, Peterson has outlined two potential bullish scenarios that he believes remain for the cryptocurrency: one forecasting a rise to as high as $240,000, while another more conservative estimate suggests a surge to $160,000. As the month of September draws to a close, Doctor Profit’s prediction that Bitcoin would trade below $100,000 could still play out. With only a 9% decline needed to breach the $100,000 threshold, the outlook remains uncertain.

SWIFT Is Working With 30+ Global Financial Institutions On A Blockchain Ledger As revealed in a press release , SWIFT is planning to add a blockchain-based ledger to its infrastructure stack, in collaboration with a group of more than 30 major financial institutions. SWIFT, short for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is a Belgium-based cooperative that connects banks around the world with a secure messaging network for initiating international payments. SWIFT covers more than 11,500 institutions across over 220 countries and territories, and facilitates an estimated $150 trillion in cross-border transactions every year. The payments messaging giant is now taking its infrastructure a step further with the integration of a ledger system based on the blockchain, the same underlying technology that powers cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The goal behind the system is to provide real-time 24/7 cross-border payments. The press release noted that SWIFT has already begun working with major global banks to design and build the ledger, starting with a conceptual prototype by Consensys . Consensys, a blockchain software company founded by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, is best known as the developer of Metamask and a contributor to major ETH network upgrades. SWIFT CEO Javier Pérez-Tasso said: Through this initial ledger concept we are paving the way for financial institutions to take the payments experience to the next level with Swift’s proven and trusted platform at the centre of the industry’s digital transformation. Currently, banks from 16 countries are providing feedback on the ledger system. Following successful development, SWIFT plans to work with its global community on implementation. Among the major institutions already on board are several Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs), including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup. Gayathri Vasudev, Global Head of Core Payment Rails at JP Morgan, the bank considered the most critical to global economic stability by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), said: We look forward to engaging with this coalition to help evaluate a shared ledger designed for the next generation of global payments, leveraging our expertise to help advance instant, secure and efficient cross-border payments. According to the press release, SWIFT will also add interoperability capabilities, allowing banks to seamlessly move between existing fiat rails and emerging systems. The payments messaging platform added: These developments are part of Swift’s overall strategy to power a best-in-class payments experience however value moves, with parallel tracks of innovation to upgrade the experience over existing ‘fiat’ rails, as well as to ready the industry for digital finance. Bitcoin Price Has Made Some Recovery Bitcoin ended last week with a plummet to lows, but the cryptocurrency appears to have kicked off Monday with another shift as its price has bounced back to $112,300.

Trendline bounce near $200 suggests a potential short-term pivot for SOL. Price sits below the 9-day EMA and 50-day SMA; oversold signals hint at a possible relief rally. Several institutional S-1 filings for spot Solana ETFs are increasing market attention and volume. Solana price dropped under $200 then bounced off a trendline; monitor $200–$210 holds for a rally. Read analysis and trade levels on COINOTAG. What is happening with Solana price right now? Solana price recently slipped below $200 before bouncing off an ascending trendline, signaling a potential short-term turning point. Daily closes under $200 could open deeper downside toward $150, while a sustained reclaim of $200–$210 would improve the outlook toward $250. How did the trendline affect SOL’s recent move? Solana’s ascending trendline, visible since June, provided dynamic support after a breakdown through the horizontal $203–$210 zone. Data cited by market observers shows SOL traded as low as $190.88 before the bounce. The trendline held intraday, but traders emphasize daily closing levels to confirm validity. Solana breaks below $200 but snaps back hard from trendline support—can ETF buzz spark a rally from here? Solana rebounds from a critical trendline to the $200 level, a sign of a potential turning point. SOL is traded below key moving averages, but oversold indicators hint at a possible short-term recovery. ETF speculation and rising trading volume add fuel to the fire as Solana awaits confirmation of its next big move. Solana is back above $200 after a sharp drop shook the bulls. A key trendline bounce and rising ETF attention have reignited hopes of a rally. Bears remain active; the next decisive move depends on daily closing price action around the $200 mark. Why does the $200 level matter for SOL? The $200 level is both psychological and technical. SOL currently trades around $200.64 after a weekly low near $190.88. It sits below the 9‑day EMA (~$213.93) and the 50‑day SMA (~$207.99), which shows short-term momentum is bearish. If SOL cannot hold daily closes above $200, analysts point to support zones near $177–$188 and a deeper target near $150. #SOL Update: Currently $SOL has slipped below the horizontal support, yet the trendline support zone stepped in and provided an instant bounce.

Multiple institutions — including VanEck, Fidelity, Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and CoinShares — have submitted updated S-1 forms for spot Solana ETFs with staking features. These filings, combined with the earlier REX‑Osprey Solana Staking ETF launch (which recorded $33 million in day‑one volume), mean approvals or guidance from regulators could act as a near‑term catalyst. What technical signals should traders watch? Key indicators to monitor: Daily close above $200–$210 to invalidate the breakdown. Reclaiming the 9‑day EMA (~$214) and 50‑day SMA (~$208) for a momentum reset. Volume profile: increasing buying volume on recoveries supports continuation; heavy sell-side volume on declines warns of deeper correction. Frequently Asked Questions Is Solana likely to rebound after breaking below $200? Short-term rebounds are possible due to the trendline bounce and oversold indicators, but confirmation requires daily closes above $200–$210 and rising volume. Failure to hold $200 could lead to deeper declines toward $150. Will ETF approvals drive SOL higher? ETF approvals or constructive regulatory guidance can be bullish by attracting institutional flows. Recent S-1 activity from multiple firms suggests growing interest, but the market impact depends on approval timing and macro conditions. Key Takeaways Trendline support: The ascending trendline halted the decline and produced a bounce near $200. Momentum still bearish: SOL trades below short-term moving averages; daily closes matter most. ETF filings are a catalyst: Multiple institutional S-1 filings raise the probability of a liquidity-driven move if approvals or clear guidance follow. Conclusion Solana’s recent dip and trendline rebound place it at a technical crossroads. Traders should front-load risk management around the $200–$210 zone and watch ETF filing developments for potential catalysts. COINOTAG will continue monitoring price action, regulatory updates, and volume to report confirmed shifts in SOL’s outlook. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Solana dips below $200 then rebounds from trendline as ETF filings heat up"", ""alternativeHeadline"": ""SOL bounces off trendline; ETF S-1 activity may influence next move"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/images/solana-article-image.jpg""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-09-27T14:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-09-27T18:30:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/images/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/solana-price-trendline-etf-analysis"" }, ""description"": ""Solana slipped below $200 and rebounded from an ascending trendline; watch $200–$210 daily closes and ETF S-1 activity for the next directional cue.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Solana likely to rebound after breaking below $200?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Short-term rebounds are possible due to trendline support and oversold indicators, but confirmation requires daily closes above $200–$210 and rising buying volume."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will ETF approvals drive SOL higher?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""ETF approvals or clear regulatory guidance could attract institutional flows and act as a bullish catalyst, but timing and market context will determine the magnitude of any move."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Solana price action after a trendline bounce"", ""description"": ""A short how-to for traders to gauge whether SOL's rebound is sustainable."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/images/solana-article-image.jpg"", ""totalTime"": ""PT30M"", ""tool"": [ ""Price chart with daily timeframe"", ""9-day EMA and 50-day SMA"", ""Volume indicator"", ""Stochastic RSI"" ], ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check daily close above $200"", ""text"": ""Confirm a daily close above $200–$210 to consider the breakdown a false move."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor moving averages"", ""text"": ""Watch for reclaiming the 9-day EMA (~$214) and 50-day SMA (~$208) as momentum confirmation."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess volume"", ""text"": ""Look for rising buy-side volume on recovery candles; heavy sell volume increases downside risk."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Track regulatory developments"", ""text"": ""Follow institutional S-1 filings and SEC guidance regarding spot Solana ETFs for potential catalysts."" } ], ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }} Published: 2025-09-27 · Updated: 2025-09-27 · Author: COINOTAG",Analysis|News|AUCTION|SOL,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-09-30 04:04:47

According to Binance’s founder and former CEO, the Alem Crypto Fund debuted by accumulating Binance Coin. Most importantly, the nation plans to hold BNB for the long term. Changpeng Zhao confirmed : Kazakhstan national crypto reserve – Alem Crypto Fund – buys BNB for long-term holding. Coin Bureau @coinbureau · Follow 🔥 HUGE: KAZAKHSTAN GOVERNMENT’S CRPTO RESERVE OFFICIALLY BUYS $BNB 1:45 AM · Sep 30, 2025 212 Reply Copy link Read 80 replies BNB remains on the crypto community’s radar after its recent performance, which saw it surpass the closely watched $1,000 milestone . The native token serves various roles within the Binance ecosystem. These include governance processes, gas fees, and completing transactions. BNB boasts a market cap of around $142 billion, with over $3 billion in daily trading volumes (Coinmarketcap data). Meanwhile, Kazakhstan has joined the list of a few countries that have officially adopted cryptocurrencies as reserve assets, including Bitcoin holders El Salvador, Bhutan, and the US. Kazakhstan steps into digital reserves The country’s Ministry of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Investment (which is under Qazaqstan Venture Group management) established the Alem Crypto Fund. Moreover, the initiative is registered under AIFIC (Astana International Financial Center). Officials bet big on the crypto reserve, with long-term goals to adopt crypto for investment and an asset for nation-level savings as the financial landscape transforms. Commenting on the move, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of AI and Digital Investment, Zhaslan Madiyev, says: The creation of the Alem Crypto Fund is a step toward advancing digital finance in Kazakhstan. Our goal is to make it a reliable instrument for major investors and a key foundation for digital state reserves. Collaborating with Binance Kazakhstan A licensed local firm, Binance Kazakhstan, is at the center of the new crypto reserve initiative. The country tapped the exchange to ensure security and transparency while aligning with global financial standards. Binance Kazakhstan’s General Manager Nurkhat Kushimov cheered the decision as key to promoting institutional crypto adoption in the region. He said : We are proud that Binance Kazakhstan has become the strategic partner of the Alem Crypto Fund. The fund’s choice of BNB as its first digital asset highlights the trust in the Binance ecosystem and marks a new chapter for institutional recognition of cryptocurrencies in Kazakhstan. BNB price outlook Binance Coin has recorded impressive price actions lately, surging from around $840 in early this month to all-time highs above $1,075 on September 21. BNB has remained resilient even as most digital assets underperformed in September. It is trading at $1,025 after gaining nearly 3% on the daily timeframe. Chart by Coinmarketcap The altcoin appears ready for further breakouts in the expected Q4 rallies. Meanwhile, CZ expects another 10,000x growth from Binance Coin in the coming years.

The price now faces a couple of key hurdles near $2.920 and $2.950. XRP price is slowly moving higher above the $2.850 support zone. The price is now trading above $2.850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.8320 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above $2.920. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price started a recovery wave after it found support above $2.720 and $2.770, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to surpass the $2.80 and $2.850 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.995 swing high to the $2.70 low. The bulls even pushed the price toward $2.920 before they faced resistance. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.8320 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.925 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.995 swing high to the $2.70 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.950 level. A clear move above the $2.950 resistance might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.050 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.120. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.920 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.850 level. The next major support is near the $2.8320 level and the trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.8320 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.770. The next major support sits near the $2.720 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.650. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

Prices increased by 1.4% in September, according to industry figures, up from 0.9% in August. The increase was driven by DIY and gardening products, which posted the biggest gains. There were some back-to-school items, such as laptops, that saw a price decrease, but it wasn’t enough to offset larger cost pressures. The BRC stated that the spike reflects increased costs associated with running shops. Retailers are battling changes to payroll taxes, a national insurance increase, and bigger wage bills. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said households were already struggling and warned that further tax rises in next month’s budget would keep shop prices higher for longer. Government decisions push prices higher Next month, retailers will face a new packaging tax , which many believe will only exacerbate inflation in stores. Businesses argue that the tax is in addition to existing obligations, and families will ultimately end up paying more. Last month, in an open letter, more than 60 retailers, including Tesco and John Lewis, called on the government not to raise taxes further through an autumn budget. They insisted that soaring costs are squeezing profits and jacking up prices for ordinary households. Some businesses are already beginning to feel the pinch. John Lewis reported deepening losses earlier this month, citing tens of millions of pounds in added costs from packaging rules and employment taxes. Next Plc has also cautioned that sales will ease in the second half of the year, as shoppers tighten their purse strings. The new numbers arrive at a sensitive time for the Bank of England (BoE). Policymakers are debating whether, or when, to reduce interest rates again. It’s that sticky inflation that makes this decision more difficult. Food inflation stabilized in September at 4.2% after climbing for seven months. While there is a glimmer of stability after the rollercoaster year, prices remain high for many producers, with energy bills, feed, and labor all contributing to increased production costs. Dairy and beef are still some of the priciest staples. Prices of non-food items, which had been on a downward slide for over a year, have started to stabilize. They fell by only 0.1% in September compared to the same period a year earlier, significantly less than in past months. Analysts say it suggests the era of falling non-food prices is over. BoE policymakers are concerned that sustained price pressure may also lead to higher wage demands, pushing up inflation more strongly. This could prompt the central bank to maintain higher interest rates for a longer period, which may put further pressure on mortgage holders and businesses. Uncertainty clouds golden quarter Retailers are entering the crucial golden quarter, from October to December, when many earn most of their yearly profits. Holiday shopping, Black Friday deals, and festive spending usually give the retail sector a big boost. Yet for the first time in three years, confidence is cracking. Families are still faced with food bills, energy prices, and mortgage repayments that are far higher than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower-income households will also have less to spend on things they don’t need. Industry analysts have warned that shoppers could trade down to cheaper labels or hold off on making big-ticket purchases. Some are expected to cut back on gifts and splurge on essentials, even over the holidays. Retailers are concerned that it will leave them with unsold inventory and reduced profits at a time of year when they rely on robust sales. The autumn budget is a formative occasion. If the government levies new taxes on retailers — or leaves old ones in place — prices here will likely remain high until Christmas. That, in turn, may further erode consumer confidence at a moment when stores are poised to kick off sales and promotions.

Caroline Pham, Interim Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), stated that the inter-institutional tensions with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have ended, saying, “A new day has begun and the turf war is over.” The CFTC and SEC have been voicing differing opinions for years regarding the status of cryptocurrencies. Former CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam argued that most digital assets fall under the definition of commodities, while former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler argued that most cryptocurrencies should be considered securities. In Washington, the Clarity Act, a bill aimed at comprehensively regulating the crypto industry, is on the agenda. The bill would provide new frameworks for market structure and grant the CFTC broader authority over digital assets. Therefore, joint action by the two institutions is considered crucial. Pham acknowledged that regulatory boundaries are not always clear, saying, “At times, these ambiguities have led to unnecessary friction between the two institutions and avoidable difficulties for market participants.” Related News: Government Shutdown Crisis Looms in the US - Here's What You Need to Know and the Latest Updates Meanwhile, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins once again dismissed rumors of a merger, saying, “Our focus is on harmonization, not merger. That can only happen with the approval of Congress and the President. Fanciful talk of reorganizing the government risks obscuring the great opportunities before us.” The roundtable discussion, co-hosted by the CFTC and SEC, continues on Monday with panels featuring representatives from institutions such as Kalshi, Kraken, Polymarket, Robinhood Markets, Bank of America and JP Morgan. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-to-xrp-holders-you-have-one-chance-heres-why/,"Analysts have long observed the relationship between money supply growth and asset prices, but Levi Rietveld, creator of Crypto Crusaders, recently emphasized just how direct this link can be. He stated that there is a “95% price correlation between the global money supply and the price of stocks and digital assets.” According to him, this connection is not theoretical but has repeatedly shown up in market behavior. He pointed out that when central banks expand liquidity, the effects take time to filter into markets. He explained that there is typically “about a three-month lag until the price is starting to be seen inside of the markets.” This delay means that investors must be mindful of policy decisions. You Have One Chance! #XRP #BTC #ETH #Crypto #cryptocurrency pic.twitter.com/6PuZ6uh5rl — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) September 28, 2025 Federal Reserve Decisions Loom Large One of the central points Rietveld raised involves current U.S. monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has already begun loosening policy. The Fed cut rates in mid-September , and he expects two more rate cuts before the end of the year. Rate cuts generally lead to cheaper borrowing and an influx of liquidity into financial systems. Rate cuts in September 2024 contributed to the crypto market’s rapid growth at the end of the year. With his focus on the historical correlation, Rietveld views these cuts as a clear signal for what may come next for equities and digital assets. For him, the timing is critical. If monetary easing feeds into the system on a three-month lag, then markets could see notable upward movements toward the end of the year or in early 2026. Rietveld sees this economic window as an opportunity, not just for traditional stocks but also for leading digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and especially XRP, positioned to benefit strongly from the liquidity shift. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Case for Action Rietveld urged investors not to ignore the upcoming changes. He warned that failing to position early could lead to missed gains, saying that when the liquidity enters, “our prices are going to go up.” XRP’s utility in real-time cross-border settlement gives it a unique place among digital assets. With institutional adoption continuing to expand , the additional liquidity expected from monetary policy shifts could amplify XRP’s use case and market value. Rietveld closed with a direct message to investors, saying that those who fail to act “will be regretting it in a few months time.” The alignment of Federal Reserve policy, global money supply expansion, and the historical strength of the correlation between liquidity and asset prices present a unique setup that XRP could benefit from significantly.

The platform was acquired by Coinbase in August for about $2.9b, reflecting its continued value. Still, the loss of its leadership in options signals how quickly traditional finance has seized ground in Bitcoin markets. Launched by BlackRock in Jan. 2024 , IBIT was designed to give investors direct Bitcoin exposure without the hurdles of custody or wallets. Coinbase Prime manages custody for the ETF, with reporting structures tailored for mainstream investors. IBIT $70B Milestone Shows Unprecedented Investor Demand The fund’s cost structure has also played a role. With a 0.25% expense ratio, temporarily lowered to 0.12% for early inflows, IBIT quickly became the fastest-growing ETF in history. It reached $70b in assets in just 341 trading days. Market analysts say this growth has reshaped the ecosystem. Offshore venues still attract speculative activity, but regulated products now anchor the bulk of institutional interest. The split could create two parallel systems, one rooted in traditional finance and another in decentralized trading. The rise of IBIT’s options market has added another layer to its influence. For treasurers and asset managers, the ability to hedge exposure through a regulated venue is proving a powerful draw. By comparison, Deribit’s dominance had been built on high-risk leverage and global traders seeking less oversight. Its appeal remains strong, but its grip is weakening as more capital gravitates toward US-listed structures.

Project Mirror, a first-of-its-kind study into the factors that shape Ethereum perception and momentum, found that psychology and narrative play as large a role as technical fundamentals. The study was commissioned by Optimism and Espresso and shared by the Ethereum Foundation (EF) on Monday. Researchers Valeria Salazar and Jill Gunter led the work for WE3.co. They concluded that while Ethereum remains technically strong, it suffers from unclear public messaging, limited market engagement, and uneven developer support — all of which affect where builders choose to invest effort. The qualitative research included interviews with 60 people across the Ethereum ecosystem and broader crypto community conducted from March to June 2025. Researchers described that period as Ethereum’s “worst crisis” due to weak price action and leadership strain. The researchers tapped the community to identify tensions and narratives. Source: Ethereum Foundation What five core tensions did Project Mirror identify? Project Mirror isolated five tensions that shape public perception of Ethereum. Each tension links narrative clarity to practical outcomes for builders, users, and markets. Core Tension Impact Narrative vs. Technical Depth Brilliant technical vision feels unreadable without a simple story. Neutral Leadership vs. Decisive Guidance Too much neutrality can be perceived as lack of leadership. Layer-1 Role vs. Layer-2 Activity Layer-2s capture users and activity, blurring Ethereum’s role. Price Momentum vs. Fundamentals Flat ETH price is read as stagnation despite strong fundamentals. Builder Support vs. Market Signaling Perceived gaps in developer support reduce platform choice appeal. How does price continue to drive Ethereum’s narrative? Researchers found that market price remains the most visible narrative signal. ETH’s flat price conveys stagnation even as protocol upgrades progress. When alternative ecosystems show token price surges, they attract capital, talent, and attention, creating a feedback loop that boosts momentum independent of technical fundamentals. Why did researchers call March–June 2025 Ethereum’s “worst crisis”? During that period, ETH traded between $1,600 and $2,500 and hit a three-year low in April. Interviewees reported leadership uncertainty and waning public confidence, prompting the researchers to use the term “worst crisis.” { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How Ethereum can strengthen its public narrative"", ""description"": ""Practical steps suggested by Project Mirror themes to rebuild narrative clarity and support."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Clarify public messaging"", ""text"": ""Develop a concise, non-technical narrative that communicates Ethereum’s value to builders, investors, and users."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Support builders visibly"", ""text"": ""Increase and publicize developer grants, mentorship programs, and tooling to attract and retain talent."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Measure success beyond price"", ""text"": ""Track developer activity, user growth, and application outcomes as primary success metrics."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 4, ""name"": ""Balance neutrality with leadership"", ""text"": ""Redefine roles so the Ethereum Foundation and ecosystem leaders can provide confident guidance without compromising openness."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What did Project Mirror study?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Project Mirror surveyed 60 community members to understand how different audiences view Ethereum, focusing on narrative, leadership, developer support, and market perception."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does price determine Ethereum’s perceived strength?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Project Mirror used qualitative interviews with 60 participants across the Ethereum ecosystem and broader crypto community from March to June 2025, capturing perceptions during a period of weak price action. What immediate effects did the study highlight? The study highlights that unclear messaging and limited visible builder support reduce momentum and can deter investment and talent, even when fundamentals remain strong. Key Takeaways Narrative matters : Clear public messaging is essential to translate technical excellence into momentum. Price signals drive perception : Flat ETH price is widely read as stagnation despite roadmap progress. Action items : Redefine leadership roles, visibly support builders, and measure success beyond price. Conclusion Project Mirror shows that Ethereum’s technical strengths alone are insufficient without narrative clarity and active market engagement. Strengthening communication, supporting builders publicly, and tracking broader success metrics can restore momentum and confidence across the ecosystem.

Use RSI to confirm entries: buy near channel support when RSI is oversold and volume rises. Exit or scale back when RSI reaches overbought near the upper channel. Combine RSI with support/resistance for clearer risk management. How much does developer activity impact SOL’s outlook? High developer activity supports long-term adoption, fueling demand for network services and token utility. Current developer figures (10,700+ active on Solana) are a positive structural indicator for SOL. Key Takeaways RSI–Channel Correlation : RSI oversold readings have reliably aligned with lower-channel rebounds. Price Targets : Watch $216, $225 and $252 on a confirmed breakout; protect positions below $195 on failure. Fundamental Support : Developer growth and rising on-chain activity underpin medium-term demand for SOL. Conclusion Solana price is supported by a repeatable RSI-to-channel pattern and robust developer activity, creating a favorable backdrop for tactical long entries around $207–$210.

In the short term, momentum has improved slightly, with early bullish divergence forming. FLOKI on the daily timeframe As seen on the daily chart for September 30, Floki is trading at $0.00008234, consolidating near recent lows after a sharp decline. The daily candles indicate reduced volatility, but the price remains capped below the 20-day SMA at $0.00009229, allowing bears to maintain control. The Bollinger Bands are widening, suggesting volatility could return, but the price is currently hugging the lower band at $0.00007457, indicating weak demand. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Momentum indicators remain bearish but are flattening. The MACD remains in negative territory, with a slight narrowing of the histogram, indicating reduced selling pressure. If FLOKI breaks below $0.0000745, it risks sliding further, but if bulls defend this zone, a rebound towards $0.000092 becomes likely. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour timeframe, Floki shows signs of short-term stabilization. Price is currently at $0.00008229, moving close to the Alligator’s resistance lines, suggesting an ongoing tug-of-war between buyers and sellers.

A bounce is possible if support at $0.0000745 holds, giving room for a rally toward $0.000092–$0.000110. However, failure to hold above $0.0000819 could drag the price lower. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need up to $95 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 110x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

52460732,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=823171,1759207954,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52460732.jpeg,Alibaba is in talks to acquire the top 13 floors of One Causeway Bay for approximately $900 million,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/alibaba-targets-900m-hong-kong-tower-deal/,"Chinese technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is near a deal to buy the top 13 floors of One Causeway Bay, an upscale Hong Kong office tower. The deal is reportedly worth $900 million, according to the Hong Kong Economic Times. If consummated, the transaction would mark one of the largest property plays by a technology company into Hong Kong’s high-end real estate market in recent years. It also underscores how Alibaba is positioning itself for long-term expansion within the city even as its commercial property market grapples with high vacancy and falling rents. This comes as the Chinese e-commerce leader plans to raise $3.2 billion through the sale of a zero-coupon convertible bond to fund international expansion and enhance its cloud computing capabilities. As recently reported by Cryptopolitan , this is now the most significant convertible bond deal of the year, smashing DoorDash’s $2.75 billion deal from May. Around 80% of the funds will be allocated to expand data centers, enhance technology, and enhance cloud services to meet increasing demand. The remaining funds are expected to be allocated to enhancing the firm’s e-commerce operations and strengthening its market presence. Alibaba expands into Hong Kong real estate Alibaba already leases 10 floors at Times Square, one of the most prominent towers in Causeway Bay. Its lease there is sealed until 2028. However, renting has its limits, as the company relies on lease renewals and faces higher rental costs. Such a purchase of floors at One Causeway Bay would transform Alibaba from a tenant to an owner, and provide it with long-term stability in the city. The timing of this purchase is strategic, as Hong Kong’s office market is currently in a slump. Vacancy rates have soared to nearly 17%, nearing a historical peak. Multinational firms have been cutting back or deferring expansions, and many landlords are struggling to fill their available space. That has caused valuations to fall, and prices for prime property have slumped. For companies like Alibaba, with cash to spend, the slowdown presented an opportunity to acquire prime real estate at a discount. Analysts say Alibaba is capitalizing on this opportunity. Ownership would also enable the company to manage costs more effectively in the long term and mitigate the risks associated with rental increases. It would also give the group the ability to customize its office design and control it, ensuring the space is right for changing business needs, from traditional office use to innovation labs or co-working hubs for its affiliates. One Causeway Bay is an appealing property in its own right. Constructed by Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, the 29-story tower combines office and retail space in one of Hong Kong’s most hectic commercial districts. Alibaba looks to secure its footprint Alibaba has been increasing its presence in Hong Kong over the last several years. Its fintech arm, Ant Group, has also been expanding its operations in the city, as both enterprises seek growth beyond mainland China. The prospective purchase is viewed as plain evidence of long-term commitment. Purchases of the building would create a steadying base over an uncertain time as the group continues to advance its international business strategy. It would also deepen its foothold in one of Asia’s biggest financial hubs. If successful, the 900 million dollar deal would represent a bright spot in a listless property market that has left many investors wary. It would signal that elite tech companies are still willing to take big steps despite the city’s economic setbacks. Alibaba and the sellers have not publicly acknowledged the deal yet, either. Negotiations are continuing, and industry watchers anticipate that details could emerge in the coming weeks.

An exchange-traded fund proposed by Tuttle Capital Management aims to mirror trading activity disclosed under the STOCK Act and to invest in companies with documented presidential influence. The fund, called the Tuttle Government Grift ETF (GRFT) , was filed earlier this year and may list once procedural regulatory steps conclude. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted the SEC set an effectiveness date for Tuttle’s S‑1, making a launch possible as soon as the prospective listing window opens. The ETF’s rules specify that holdings will reflect both the scale of congressional trading and the perceived influence of presidential backing. Source: Eric Balchunas What does GRFT track and how are holdings selected? GRFT tracks STOCK Act transaction reports and companies tied to presidential influence. The fund will select 10–30 stocks and ETFs, weighting positions based on congressional trading activity and indicators of presidential backing described in the prospectus. How does the fund use STOCK Act disclosures? The ETF scans public STOCK Act filings to identify trades by members of Congress and their spouses. Short, systematic scans convert those disclosures into candidate securities, which are then filtered for liquidity and evidence of presidential influence. Could GRFT include crypto firms or ETPs? Tuttle already manages several leveraged crypto exchange-traded products and the prospectus leaves room for companies with documented presidential ties. As a result, crypto-linked names such as publicly traded Bitcoin miners or corporate holders of crypto assets could appear if they meet selection criteria. Frequently Asked Questions Will GRFT let retail investors copy congressional trades? GRFT seeks to provide exposure to trades identified in STOCK Act reports, but it replicates a rules-based portfolio rather than executing the exact timing or sizes of individual congressional orders. It offers a proxy for political trading patterns. How many positions will GRFT hold? The fund will hold between 10 and 30 securities, with position sizes reflecting both the frequency of congressional trading and an assessment of presidential influence on those companies. Key Takeaways Regulatory progress : SEC action on the S‑1 opens the path for a GRFT launch. Strategy : GRFT combines STOCK Act disclosure data with corporate ties to presidential influence to build a 10–30 security portfolio. Crypto exposure : Tuttle’s existing crypto ETPs make crypto-linked holdings possible if they meet selection criteria. Conclusion The Tuttle Government Grift ETF (GRFT) is positioned to offer retail investors a rules-based vehicle that reflects congressional trading signals and presidential influence. With the SEC marking the S‑1 effective date, investors should review the prospectus and monitor official listing notices to assess holdings and risks before considering allocation.

According to Henley & Partners and surveys compiled by industry trackers, Singapore holds the number one spot in some indexes, while the UAE posts some of the highest ownership rates recorded. Based on reports , about 24.4% of Singapore’s population is estimated to own crypto, and the UAE shows about 25.3% ownership — figures that are far above the global average. Singapore’s Position And Policy Mix Singapore’s lead is tied to its mix of clear rules and strong finance infrastructure. Regulatory sandboxes, licensing for exchanges, and a banking system that works with digital currency firms are often cited as factors. Meanwhile, the ApeX Protocol study shows that nearly a quarter of Singaporeans—24.4%—own digital assets, a figure that has more than doubled from 11% the year before. This surge is also mirrored online, with the country generating about 2,000 crypto searches per 100,000 people, the highest level seen anywhere in the world. UAE’s Tax Edge And Rapid Uptake The UAE is pushing hard to attract users and companies. Based on reports, the country scored a perfect 10/10 on tax-friendliness in one index, and its zero-tax stance on trading, staking, mining, or selling bitcoin across many emirates is a major draw. Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and other local initiatives have created licensing paths and special zones for digital asset firms. Henley & Partners lists the UAE among the top jurisdictions for crypto wealth, often placing it in the top five for investor-friendly climates. Those policies appear to help explain why roughly a quarter of people in the UAE are reported to hold crypto assets. Ownership Numbers And What They Mean Reports place the global number of crypto users in the hundreds of millions — around 562 million by some counts — but that figure hides big differences. Some countries show high ownership because many people treat crypto as an investment. In others, crypto is used more for payments or savings. Methodologies differ: some studies count any wallet with activity, others rely on surveys asking people if they own crypto.

Bitcoin’s 600,000 Transactions Threshold Takes Center Stage According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Ibrahim Cosar, an important correlation between BTC price and the total number of transactions over time stands out. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Confluence Hints No Bottom Before October – What This Means The analyst shared the following chart to highlight the relationship between Bitcoin’s price and the total number of transactions. Notably, whenever the total transaction count surges above the 600,000 level – or even approaches it – BTC’s price tends to initiate an upward move. The above chart shows three previous instances in 2025 when BTC’s total transaction count climbed beyond 600,000, with an ensuing price appreciation. In May, there was a sharp price increase shortly following Bitcoin’s transaction count jump. Similar combinations of transaction count increase and price action surge were witnessed in August and early September. The CryptoQuant analyst remarked that this pattern has become particularly evident since Q4 2024. Cosar added: I’ve been studying on-chain data for a long time, but it’s rare to see such a clear pattern. The 600K transaction threshold seems to act almost like a signal that triggers Bitcoin’s “price engine.” This is my personal discovery, and the chart confirms it quite clearly. The analyst stated that rising transaction activity on the network is a leading indicator of Bitcoin’s underlying usage and demand. As the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network rises, the network becomes more vibrant and active. The growing usage of the Bitcoin network creates a natural buying pressure on Bitcoin’s price, adding fuel to the cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum. According to Cosar, the 600,000 transaction level is an “activity explosion” threshold that leads to a “price explosion.” That said, the analyst cautioned that no single factor can completely influence BTC’s price, as it is dependent on a mix of various factors, including macroeconomic backdrop, regulations, and trading activity. Still, the significance of an on-chain indicator with such a strong correlation with BTC’s price should not be ignored. If the total transaction count rises past the 600,000 level again, expect BTC to hit a new record high. Will BTC Fall Below $100,000? Bitcoin’s inability to decisively break through its current ATH of $124,128, recorded on August 14, has bulls worried about the digital asset’s fading momentum. The cryptocurrency is currently at its most oversold level since April 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tipped To Peak In 2026 – Here’s Why From a technical standpoint, BTC has formed a bearish evening star pattern on the weekly chart, raising the possibilities of a price dip below $100,000.

Solana ETF refers to a U.S. spot exchange-traded fund tracking SOL. The SEC’s adoption of generic listing standards removed the automatic 19b-4 review clock, meaning ETF listings now hinge on S-1 registration approval from the Division of Corporation Finance, which recent S-1 amendments suggest may be imminent. How did SEC procedural changes affect the 19b-4 timeline? Previously, 19b-4 filings triggered a statutory review period of up to 240 days. The SEC’s new generic listing standards have effectively rendered that clock less meaningful, shifting the approval bottleneck to S-1 registration statements that require Corp Finance sign-off. Analyst Eric Balchunas (public commentary) has noted that with generic listing standards in place, the 19b-4 process is largely symbolic for these filings, and recent S-1 amendment submissions for a Solana ETF indicate Corp Finance review is the remaining step. How might markets react if a Solana ETF is approved? Experts warn of a likely speculative run-up before approval, followed by potential ‘sell the news’ pressure upon listing. Jeffery Ding, chief analyst at HashKey Group (quoted in public commentary), described the trade as speculative and pointed to precedent in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF flows. Contextual data: spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded roughly $12.13 billion in cumulative flows in the first ten weeks (SoSoValue in plain text). Ethereum ETFs initially showed $522.97 million in outflows before later totaling $3.56 billion in inflows. Solana price snapshots from CoinGecko show limited intraday movement around the announcement. Frequently Asked Questions When could the SEC formally approve a Solana ETF? Approval depends on the Division of Corporation Finance clearing the S-1 registration. With amendment #4 reportedly submitted, a formal green light could arrive within days to weeks, subject to Corp Finance review timelines and any requested amendments. Will institutional investors favor Solana ETFs over Ethereum? In the short term, institutional preference is likely to remain with Ethereum due to established asset characteristics and real-world asset integrations. Solana may attract retail and speculative flows initially but faces an uphill institutional adoption curve. Key Takeaways Regulatory shift : Generic listing standards reduced the practical effect of the 19b-4 clock, moving final approval to S-1 reviews. Approval timing : Recent S-1 amendments for a Solana ETF suggest the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance is the remaining gatekeeper. Market impact : Expect speculative buying ahead of approval and possible sell-the-news volatility after launch; use risk controls. Conclusion Solana ETF approval now appears more likely after SEC procedural changes that downplayed 19b-4 timelines and focused attention on S-1 sign-off. Industry commentary and recent S-1 amendments point to a near-term decision window. Market participants should prepare with measured risk controls and follow official filings for confirmation.",News|SOL,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|REGULATION|MARKET|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-09-30 05:00:51

The bill is designed to curb money laundering, fraud, and “rented” accounts used for illegal betting, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing anonymous sources. Intergovernmental watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), has issued anti-money laundering standards, which saw Turkey removed from its “grey list” in June 2024. Crypto Accounts Targeted If passed, the legislation would enable Masak to close bank accounts, impose transaction limits, suspend mobile banking, and blacklist crypto addresses that it deems linked to crime. The new law is also focused on “rented accounts” or “mule accounts,” which are accounts that criminals pay individuals to use for activities such as illegal gambling, financial fraud, or scams. Crypto trading remains legal in Turkey, but the government is tightening regulations and control. In July, Turkish financial regulators blocked access to several crypto platforms offering “unauthorized” digital asset services, including the PancakeSwap decentralized exchange. Turkey is not the only country tightening up its control over bank accounts. In November, Indian authorities froze 450,000 mule accounts that they suspected were linked to money laundering and cyber fraud. In April, Nigeria froze hundreds of bank accounts that it suspected were involved in “suspicious forex flows.” Ethiopian authorities have also been recently targeting bank accounts linked to alleged illegal foreign exchange activities. Asia’s Big Banking Crackdown Banks in Thailand and Vietnam have been freezing innocent people’s accounts recently as they become victims of a massive mule account dragnet. Thailand has frozen as many as 3 million bank accounts this year, many of which were innocent citizens or businesses, as the country grapples with a scam call center endemic. The country has also imposed stringent transfer limits, in-person KYC for all mobile banking apps, and has been debanking foreigners. The Bank of Thailand just froze 3 million bank accounts overnight & capped transfers at $1.3k–$5.5k/day to fight scams. You can’t freeze bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/J4PzTyd6CC — Sasha Hodder (@sashahodler) September 14, 2025 Thailand also blamed crypto for its abnormally strong currency, but this couldn’t be further from the truth, as trade volumes in the Kingdom are tiny and crypto has been outlawed for payments.

The central premise of his projection is that the cross-border payments market, already enormous, continues to expand at a rapid pace. In 2024, global payment flows are estimated at $1 quadrillion. Looking ahead, business-to-business payments alone could reach $62 trillion by 2035. X Finance Bull argued that if XRP captures even a small share of this volume, the token could support trillions in daily usage, making current valuations appear negligible. $XRP will go over $1,000 and beyond in the coming years, whether you like it or not It’s not just a cryptocurrency. It’s the internet of value! Built to transform the global financial system from the ground up. Not convinced? Here’s why $XRP will explode pic.twitter.com/WopU37uqBD — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) September 28, 2025 Tokenization, Liquidity, and Institutional Demand Another area emphasized is tokenization , where real-world assets are expected to be increasingly represented on blockchain platforms. Forecasts suggest that by 2030, tokenized assets could exceed $7 trillion. If XRP Ledger captures even one percent of this market , it would equate to $70 billion in tokenized value. Combined with the growth of stablecoins such as RLUSD and the expansion of decentralized finance on the XRP Ledger, he suggested this could create substantial supply shocks due to reduced circulating XRP. Liquidity was also a key theme. Institutions handling trillions in value require assets that can provide rapid settlement. X Finance Bull asserted that XRP, with its low-cost, high-speed settlement system , is engineered to meet this demand. With XRP burned on every transaction, the asset’s supply is gradually reduced, creating deflationary pressure as usage rises. This dynamic, he argued, would support long-term price appreciation. Regulatory Milestones and Banking Integration The analysis further indicates regulatory clarity as a pivotal driver of adoption. He noted that exchange-traded funds are already live, Japan is on track for 80 percent of its banks to adopt XRP by 2025, and Ripple’s escrow system provides transparency and stability. With the conclusion of the SEC case , he stated that XRP is entering an era of institutional-grade utility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A major development highlighted was Ripple’s application in July 2025 for a U.S. national bank charter and direct access to a Federal Reserve master account. If approved, this would enable Ripple to integrate directly with Fedwire and FedNow, two critical components of U.S. financial infrastructure. X Finance Bull argued that such integration would establish XRP as more than just a participant in the financial system, positioning it as a central element of settlement processes. Outlook on Price Projections Based on these trends, X Finance Bull maintained that a valuation of $100 per XRP is realistic, with $1,000 or more achievable over time. He acknowledged that many observers dismiss such projections, but contended that the underlying math of global money flows supports the possibility of XRP reaching a $100 trillion market capitalization. Unlike speculative tokens, he characterized XRP as a utility-driven asset with regulation, infrastructure, and adoption momentum in its favor. He concluded by noting that most people will remain skeptical until adoption becomes fully visible, but XRP is steadily establishing itself as the global standard for moving value. In his words, the transformation will not be immediate but inevitable. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

However, he added that future generations will bear the brunt of the country's financial problems, saying, “Maybe my generation won't see these problems, but theirs will have to live with them.” Cramer also shared his assessment of Bitmine. He stated that he viewed the company's latest announcement with caution, reminding everyone that similar situations in the past have posed risks to investors.

SOL price is now attempting to recover from above $200 and faces hurdles near $215. SOL price started a recovery wave above $200 and $202 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $202 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $204 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start another decline if it stays below $215 and $220. Solana Price Eyes Recovery Solana price extended losses below $200 before the bulls took a stand, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL tested the $192 zone and recently started a recovery wave. The price was able to surpass the $200 and $202 resistance levels. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $242 swing high to the $191 low. Besides, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $204 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. However, the price faces many hurdles near $215. Solana is now trading above $205 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there are more gains, the price could face resistance near the $215 level. The next major resistance is near the $216 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $242 swing high to the $191 low. The main resistance could be $220. A successful close above the $220 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $230. Any more gains might send the price toward the $242 level. Another Drop In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $216 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $204 zone and the trend line. The first major support is near the $202 level. A break below the $202 level might send the price toward the $200 support zone. If there is a close below the $200 support, the price could decline toward the $192 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.

Bitcoin delegation now secures Starknet and earns STRK rewards. StarkWare and Starknet Foundation are funding Bitcoin activity with STRK incentives. Starknet uses zero-knowledge proofs to bring Bitcoin programmability without custody tradeoffs; STRK market cap was $498M as reported by CoinGecko. Bitcoin on Starknet: stake BTC to secure the layer-2 and earn STRK rewards — learn how to participate, protocol design, and what it means for Bitcoin DeFi. What is Bitcoin on Starknet? Bitcoin on Starknet is a feature that lets users delegate Bitcoin to help secure the Starknet Ethereum layer-2 and receive STRK rewards. The system enables Bitcoin to participate in Starknet validation without losing custody, aiming to expand Bitcoin use in DeFi while leveraging Starknet’s zero-knowledge cryptography. How does Bitcoin staking on Starknet work? Starknet users can delegate BTC to the network and earn rewards paid in STRK, Starknet’s native token. StarkWare describes the approach as non-custodial: delegators retain control of their assets while participating in validation activities. This design emphasizes security and composability within Starknet’s existing architecture. StarkWare said RE7, a London-based investment firm, is building a Bitcoin-denominated yield product on Starknet. The Starknet Foundation plans to allocate 100 million STRK to stimulate Bitcoin-related activity on the network, per StarkWare’s announcement. Why is this important for Bitcoin and DeFi? Bringing Bitcoin into Starknet aims to unlock broader financialization of Bitcoin by combining BTC liquidity with Starknet’s execution and programmability. Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, noted Bitcoin is “pristine capital” whose DeFi use has been limited by centralized exchange dynamics. Starknet intends to make Bitcoin more usable in borrowing and lending on-chain. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin becomes a core part of Starknet as network enables Bitcoin staking"", ""description"": ""Bitcoin on Starknet: stake BTC to secure the layer-2 and earn STRK rewards — learn how to participate, protocol design, and implications for Bitcoin DeFi."", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""datePublished"": ""2025-09-30T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-09-30T08:00:00Z"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-on-starknet-staking"" }} When did Starknet add Bitcoin staking? Starknet announced Bitcoin delegation and staking on a recent Tuesday via a press release from StarkWare. Implementation details and incentive programs were outlined alongside partnerships and foundation allocations to accelerate Bitcoin activity on Starknet. What are the rewards and token economics? Participants who stake Bitcoin on Starknet receive STRK as rewards. As of the latest available data, STRK had a market capitalization of $498 million and was trading around $0.122 after a 74% decline year-over-year; STRK had previously hit an all-time high of $4.41 in 2024.

Some Bitcoin maximalists may object because rewards are paid in STRK rather than exclusively in BTC. Projects that add programmability to Bitcoin often mix BTC payouts with native-token incentives; Starknet’s design follows this industry pattern while emphasizing non-custodial security. How does zero-knowledge technology factor into this? Starknet leverages a zero-knowledge proof system introduced by Eli Ben-Sasson in 2018. Zero-knowledge proofs enable scalability and privacy-preserving operations, and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has highlighted advanced cryptography as a tool to balance privacy with compliance. StarkWare sees ZK proofs as a route to extend such benefits to Bitcoin use cases. Key Takeaways Bitcoin on Starknet: Allows BTC delegation to secure Starknet and earn STRK rewards. Non-custodial design: StarkWare emphasizes users retain custody while participating. Strategic incentives: Starknet Foundation plans to use 100M STRK to drive Bitcoin activity and products like the RE7 yield offering. How to participate in Bitcoin staking on Starknet (overview) 1. Prepare a non-custodial wallet that supports Starknet interactions. 2. Follow Starknet’s on-chain flow to delegate BTC (protocol-specific steps provided in official Starknet documentation). 3. Monitor rewards in STRK and track any foundation incentive programs for additional yield. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to stake Bitcoin on Starknet (overview)"", ""description"": ""High-level steps to participate in Bitcoin delegation on Starknet while retaining custody."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Prepare wallet"", ""text"": ""Use a non-custodial wallet compatible with Starknet."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Delegate BTC"", ""text"": ""Follow protocol instructions on Starknet to delegate BTC for staking."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Receive STRK rewards"", ""text"": ""Monitor STRK rewards and any additional Starknet Foundation incentives."" } ]} Conclusion Starknet’s addition of Bitcoin delegation integrates BTC into a layer-2 execution environment, aiming to expand Bitcoin’s role in DeFi while keeping user custody intact. With STRK incentives and zero-knowledge technology, Starknet seeks to position itself as a key financialization and execution layer for Bitcoin in the coming years.

Commissioner Hester Peirce argued that such tokens are functional incentives rather than securities. Crypto in Focus at SEC and CFTC Roundtable The United States’ top financial regulators convened for their first joint roundtable in roughly 14 years. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) discussed ways to harmonize their approaches to financial oversight, particularly when it comes to digital assets. Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham, who is currently the only serving commissioner at the agency after a wave of resignations in 2025, said during her opening statement that better cooperation between the SEC and CFTC could reshape how the cryptocurrency industry is regulated. She also wanted to counter speculation over the CFTC’s capabilities by pointing out that the agency remained active with 18 non-enforcement actions and 13 enforcement cases since January, many tied to digital asset firms, and an additional 14 actions since early September. “I think you will see that the CFTC is alive and well, and there needs to be no more FUD about what’s going on on the other side of town,” Pham said. SEC Chair Paul Atkins explained that discussions of cooperation should not be mistaken for efforts to merge the agencies, as such a move would require approval by Congress and the White House. Instead, Atkins talked about the importance of “collaboration, not consolidation,” at a time when the federal government faces the possibility of a shutdown. Statement from Paul Atkins The roundtable included panels featuring executives from major cryptocurrency platforms like Kraken and Crypto.com, and was moderated in part by former CFTC leaders J. Christopher Giancarlo and Jill Sommers. The event took place against a backdrop of political uncertainty. A looming government shutdown, triggered by disputes over healthcare cuts in a July budget bill, threatens to stall legislative progress, including a Senate market structure bill that could finally provide clarity on the respective roles of the SEC and CFTC in crypto oversight. The leadership situation at the CFTC is also still unsettled. Although former commissioner Brian Quintenz was nominated by President Trump in February to succeed Pham, his confirmation process stalled. Reports surfaced that Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss influenced the White House to delay the Senate Agriculture Committee’s vote on Quintenz. Texts that were later released by Quintenz suggested the twins asked for assurances on how the agency would handle enforcement. For now, Quintenz’s confirmation hearing does not appear on the Senate calendar, and Trump is reportedly weighing other candidates. SEC Signals Softer Stance on Blockchain Infrastructure In other regulatory news, the US SEC recently took a rare step in signaling that it will not pursue enforcement action against tokens tied to blockchain-based Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, or DePIN. In a no-action letter that was issued Monday, SEC Division of Corporation Finance chief counsel Michael Seaman said he will not recommend action against DoubleZero’s planned 2Z token launch. According to the agency, the programmatic transfers outlined by the DoubleZero Foundation did not meet the requirements for securities registration, and the 2Z token is not considered a class of equity securities. The no-action letter that was issued Monday The decision is one of the clearest signs yet of a softer approach to crypto oversight under the Trump administration, which promised to ease regulatory hurdles for blockchain innovators. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said the economic reality of DePIN projects is fundamentally different from the capital-raising transactions the SEC was designed to regulate. She pointed out that treating DePIN tokens as securities would not only mischaracterize their function but also risk stifling the development of decentralized infrastructure. DoubleZero co-founder Austin Federa , formerly of the Solana Foundation, called the no-action letter proof that US projects can achieve clarity while also keeping up speed in innovation. The company’s general counsel, Mari Tomunen, argued that the decision creates a regulatory path for launching tokens whose value derives from the work of network participants, rather than fitting into the traditional Howey test for securities. Peirce also explained that the SEC should not try to regulate all economic activity and that Congress designed the agency to focus specifically on securities markets. She explained that DePIN tokens act as functional incentives for infrastructure buildout and compensate contributors for services rendered, rather than serving as speculative investments. According to her, shoehorning these kinds of tokens into securities laws will suppress the growth of distributed networks and limit blockchain’s potential. Despite the importance of the SEC’s stance, tokens tied to the DePIN market showed little reaction. CoinGecko data even indicated a 2% decline in the sector’s prices over the past day.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-30 05:30:00

SEC suspended QMMM trading for 10 trading days to probe potential stock manipulation. QMMM shares rallied over 1,700% in a month after announcing plans to buy Bitcoin, Ether and Solana. Regulators are examining unusually high volume and pre-announcement trading in multiple crypto-treasury companies. QMMM Holdings trading halt: SEC suspends QMMM stock for suspected manipulation; read our concise analysis and investor guidance. Shares in QMMM Holdings will be off the market until Monday, Oct. 13, after the SEC suspended trading to investigate alleged stock promotion and potential manipulation tied to social-media recommendations. What is the QMMM Holdings trading halt? QMMM Holdings trading halt is a temporary suspension of QMMM stock ordered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for 10 trading days to investigate suspected market manipulation linked to social-media-driven purchase recommendations. The pause is designed to preserve the market while the SEC evaluates trading patterns and potential illegal promotion. Why did the SEC suspend QMMM trading? The SEC said the alleged manipulation was “effectuated through recommendations, made to investors by unknown persons via social media to purchase” QMMM shares, which appear designed to artificially inflate price and volume. The agency’s notice cites unusual volume spikes and coordinated buying ahead of public announcements. Market analysts note that if regulators can link promotions to company insiders or management, penalties can be significant, including fines or criminal referrals. Expert commentary was provided by Carl Capolingua of Market Index and analyst Tony Sycamore of IG Australia, both flagging the legal and market risks. How did QMMM stock surge before the halt? QMMM posted spectacular gains after announcing a crypto-treasury strategy on Sept. 9, saying it would buy and hold Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Shares rose from roughly $6.50 to close at $119.40 on Friday, a monthly increase of over 1,700%. Shares in QMMM over the past month saw significant gains on the announcement of its crypto plans. Source: Google Finance The stock even spiked from $11 to an intraday high of $207 after QMMM said it would initially allocate $100 million to acquire cryptocurrencies and build a crypto analytics platform. Are regulators probing other crypto-treasury companies? Yes. The SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have reportedly contacted several companies that announced crypto-treasury strategies to review trading activity ahead of public disclosures. Plain-text reporting referenced: The Wall Street Journal and coverage from industry sources indicate more than 200 companies have announced plans to buy and hold crypto.

Trading in QMMM is suspended for 10 trading days; the suspension was announced to preserve market integrity while the SEC investigates suspected manipulation tied to social-media promotions. Can company announcements cause such a rapid stock rally? Yes. Material corporate actions—like a pivot to a crypto treasury and a stated $100 million allocation to cryptocurrencies—can trigger dramatic investor interest and heavy buying, which may be amplified by social-media promotion. Key Takeaways Immediate action : The SEC suspended QMMM for 10 trading days to probe suspected social-media-driven manipulation. Rapid gains : QMMM rose over 1,700% in a month after announcing crypto purchases and a $100M allocation plan. Regulatory trend : The SEC and FINRA are scrutinizing similar crypto-treasury announcements and atypical pre-announcement trading. Conclusion This SEC suspension of QMMM Holdings highlights regulators’ heightened focus on market integrity amid a surge of crypto-treasury announcements. Investors should treat social-media-driven rallies with caution and watch for official disclosures and regulatory updates.

52462213,592215,1759212016,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52462213.jpeg,Chainlink’s (LINK) Latest Plan With TradFi Giants To Tackle $50 Billion Corporate Challenges,https://bitcoinist.com/chainlinks-link-latest-plan-with-tradfi-giants/,"Chainlink (LINK) has unveiled a new initiative aimed at transforming the corporate actions processing system, collaborating with 24 of the world’s largest organizations of the broader financial sector. This partnership, announced on Monday, seeks to leverage Chainlink’s oracle technology, blockchain capabilities, and artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline the often cumbersome and costly processes associated with corporate actions. Chainlink Partners With Financial Giants To Save Billions According to the press release , the Chainlink-powered solution will allow financial institutions to receive structured and validated corporate actions data in multiple languages directly into their systems within minutes, rather than the days currently required. This is expected to save the global financial industry billions of dollars annually by minimizing processing disruptions, reducing settlement errors, expediting reconciliations, and lowering operational risks faced by financial institutions. Among the key participants in this initiative are major financial market infrastructures such as SWIFT, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), Euroclear, and SIX, alongside asset managers and banks like UBS, DBS Bank, and BNP Paribas. Corporate actions processing currently costs the financial industry an estimated $58 billion each year, with costs increasing by 10% annually and automation rates lagging below 40%. A recent report by Citi highlighted that the average corporate action event involves over 110,000 firm interactions and costs approximately $34 million to process, with a significant portion of market participants still relying on manual data validation . Future Plans In the first phase of the initiative, Chainlink, SWIFT, Euroclear, and several financial institutions showcased how large language models (LLMs) — including OpenAI’s GPT and Google’s Gemini — could effectively extract structured data from unstructured corporate action announcements. The second phase introduced a new deployment, enhancing the speed and accessibility of corporate actions data. Through the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE), multiple AI model outputs were validated and transformed into ISO 20022-compliant messages, which were then disseminated via the SWIFT Network. Additionally, the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) enabled the distribution of these records across both DTCC’s blockchain ecosystem and various public and private blockchain platforms. This initiative not only achieved nearly 100% data consensus among the AI models assessed but also demonstrated multilingual processing capabilities, accommodating disclosures in languages such as Spanish and Chinese. Looking ahead, the team plans to expand this workflow to accommodate more complex corporate actions, such as stock splits, while increasing global coverage through additional jurisdictions and currencies. Enhanced privacy and governance controls will also be introduced to meet the operational and compliance needs of financial institutions worldwide. Sergey Nazarov, Co-Founder of Chainlink, stated: Addressing the data validation challenges of corporate actions through AI Oracle Networks represents a significant advancement, demonstrating that multiple AIs can achieve consensus on critical information within a Decentralized Oracle Network.

Analyst Forecasts Early October Rally Amid $4,200 Retest",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-ready-for-round-2-analyst-forecasts-early-october-rally-amid-4200-retest/,"As the crypto market recovers from the end-of-September correction, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to reclaim the crucial $4,200 area. Some analysts affirmed that the altcoin’s bounce signals that a new leg up could be coming in the next few weeks. Related Reading: XRP Price May Not See An Explosive Rally In October As Expected, Here’s Why Ethereum Reclaims $4,000 On Monday, Ethereum continued to recover from the recent market pullback, surging nearly 6% from Sunday’s Lows toward a crucial barrier. Last week, the King of Altcoins recorded a sharp drop below the $4,000 level for the first time since early August, recording an eight-week low of $3,815 on Thursday afternoon. Over the weekend, the cryptocurrency reclaimed the $4,000 barrier before surging to the crucial $4,100 mark on Sunday afternoon. This level served as a strong resistance throughout the past two years, as it represents the cycle’s previous high and a key bounce area during the Q3 rally. It also marks the lower boundary of its local $4,100-$4,800 range. Market Watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that the weekly candle on ETH’s chart closed above this level after “a solid effort by the bulls and a late Sunday push.” He added that it remains important to hold this area on the higher timeframes to target the range highs. In the daily timeframe, the trader considers Ethereum has “not the worst look” as the recent reclaim shows a clear invalidation of the range breakdown and a potential recovery continuation. Daan also suggested that the cryptocurrency could be “taking one out of BTC’s playbook,” and be preparing for a massive new leg up following the range consolidation and deviation. Similarly, Bluntz affirmed that ETH’s wave 4 on the daily timeframe “looks like it’s over with a leg higher into ath yet to come.” However, the analyst considers that the next all-time high (ATH) breakout won’t be as “sensational” as many believe, suggesting the $5,500 area as the main target. ETH’s Next Leg Up Two Weeks Away? Multiple market watchers highlighted a potential Power of Three (Po3) setup on Ethereum’s chart, signaling that the recent pullback was part of the second stage, manipulation, and the cryptocurrency is ready for the third phase, expansion. Meanwhile, Merlijn the Trader affirmed that Ethereum is displaying a similar setup that preceded the May and July rallies. At the time, ETH broke down from its local range during a liquidity grab, sending the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator to oversold territory. “This is the exact setup that birthed every violent reversal. Strong hands know it. Weak hands fold,” the trader affirmed. Additionally, he noted that the cryptocurrency could be repeating the late Q2 script’s timeline. Per the post, Ethereum saw a 66-day consolidation between the May breakout and the next pump in July. During this period, the second-largest cryptocurrency saw a price fakeout below the range around the 45-day mark before breaking out 20 days later. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Go To Zero, Hedge Fund CEO Warns Last week’s correction below the local range occurred 46 days into the accumulation period, suggesting that a new breakout and leg up could come in the first half of October. “We’re at day 51. The longer the squeeze… The harder the detonation,” Merlijn stated. Nonetheless, analyst Ted Pillows added that for more upside, ETH must recover the $4,250 area, where a strong sell wall is located, until the $4,320 level. If it fails to reclaim this area, the cryptocurrency risks retesting he $3,600-$3,800 support once again. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $4,172, a 3.5% increase in the daily timeframe.

This change renews debate over Bitcoin’s immutability versus expanded utility, with implications for node policy, miner inclusion, and legal liability for stored arbitrary data. Core v30 raises OP_RETURN limits to allow larger non-payment data in Bitcoin transactions. Supporters say it enables secure on-chain data uses; critics warn of spam, illegal content, and mission drift. Historical debate dates to 2010; legal questions about liability and content moderation remain unresolved. Core v30: Bitcoin’s October 2025 update raises OP_RETURN limits, igniting immutability vs. utility debate — read expert analysis and practical steps for node operators. What is Core v30 and why does it matter? Core v30 is the October 2025 Bitcoin Core release that increases the OP_RETURN data capacity, enabling transactions to carry much larger non-payment data. The change matters because it affects node relay policy, miner acceptance decisions, and long-standing debates about Bitcoin’s role as a currency versus a data carrier. How does OP_RETURN expansion affect Bitcoin’s technical and social design? Raising the OP_RETURN limit permits larger payloads—messages, proofs, or files—to be included in transactions without making outputs spendable. Technically, this keeps data provably unspendable but increases on-chain data volume relayed and stored by nodes. Socially, the expansion reopens a decade-long debate: some developers and node operators favor stricter relay rules to limit non-financial data. Others, including privacy and decentralization advocates, warn that filtering risks censorship and weakens trustless design. Historical discussions on BitcoinTalk and BitMEX Research document the dispute dating back to 2010. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Core v30 and OP_RETURN: What Bitcoin's October 2025 Update Means"", ""description"": ""Core v30 raises OP_RETURN limits, reigniting debates over Bitcoin's immutability vs. utility and raising legal and policy questions for node operators."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-09-30T00:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-09-30T00:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/core-v30-opreturn-2025"" }, ""keywords"": ""Core v30, OP_RETURN, Bitcoin, immutability, node policy""} Why do developers disagree about filtering non-payment data? Disagreement stems from differing priorities: preserving Bitcoin’s immutability and censorship-resistance versus limiting block-space abuse. Some maintainers, like lead developers of alternative clients, advocate stricter default relay policies to reduce perceived “spam.” Others—citing decentralization and resistance to human moderation—oppose selective filtering as a slippery slope toward censorship. What are the legal and liability concerns? Legal experts note unresolved questions about whether node operators could face liability for hosting illicit data. Existing protections, such as intermediary liability doctrines in some jurisdictions, may not clearly apply to blockchain nodes. Academic commentary highlights ambiguities in how laws like Section 230 might map to decentralized systems. How should node operators and miners prepare? Node operators and miners should assess policy defaults, storage needs, and local legal exposure. Practical steps include: Review and test Core v30 relay policy changes in a controlled environment. Update node storage planning for increased relayed data and consider pruning strategies. Document operator policy choices publicly to improve transparency and trust. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""Prepare a Bitcoin node for Core v30 OP_RETURN changes"", ""description"": ""Steps for node operators to evaluate and prepare for the OP_RETURN limit increase in Core v30."", ""totalTime"": ""PT1H"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review release notes"", ""text"": ""Read Core v30 release notes and relay policy documentation to understand exact OP_RETURN changes."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Test in sandbox"", ""text"": ""Deploy a test node running Core v30 to measure relay, mempool, and storage behavior with larger OP_RETURN payloads."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Set policy and pruning"", ""text"": ""Decide on relay policy defaults and implement pruning or other storage controls as needed."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Document and communicate"", ""text"": ""Publish your node policy choices and update operators and dependent services to ensure predictable behavior."" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions Will Core v30 make Bitcoin a data-storage network? The OP_RETURN increase allows more on-chain arbitrary data but does not change Bitcoin’s consensus rules for spendability. Whether Bitcoin becomes a data-storage network depends on adoption and miner inclusion decisions, not solely on the client change. Can existing data be removed from Bitcoin’s blockchain? Data already included in confirmed blocks is effectively immutable. Miners can choose future inclusions, but they cannot remove historical on-chain data from the blockchain. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will Core v30 make Bitcoin a data-storage network?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The OP_RETURN increase permits larger arbitrary data but does not alter consensus rules.

Technical impact : Keeps data unspendable but increases relayed/stored data for nodes. Operational steps : Test, set relay/pruning policies, and document choices to maintain trust. Conclusion Core v30 and the OP_RETURN expansion refocus long-standing debates about Bitcoin’s purpose and design. Stakeholders should prioritize transparent node policies, measured technical testing, and legal review.

The transfer was validated in ledger #99149205 at 07:44:41 UTC, carrying a destination tag of 1234. The transaction was confirmed as successful, with a ledger fee of 0.006 XRP, which equates to less than one cent. The delivered amount, when converted using the price reference at the time, reflects an approximate valuation of $48.8 million. The sheer size of the transfer places it firmly in the category of whale activity, underscoring its significance within the current trading environment. Valuation and exchange connection Based on a per-token estimate of around $2.78, the transfer equates to roughly $48.8 million. This aligns with the approximate value displayed in the record itself, where the figure was rounded to $48.9 million. The origin point listed in the screenshot is Kraken, a major cryptocurrency exchange, indicating that the transfer could either represent a large-scale purchase, a withdrawal, or an internal allocation. The movement of such a substantial amount from an exchange address naturally draws attention, as it suggests the involvement of a major market participant or institutional-grade allocation.

It is worth noting that exchange-linked addresses can represent a range of possibilities, from a single entity purchasing and withdrawing tokens to internal restructuring within the exchange’s wallets. While the market commentary presented with the transaction leans toward viewing the event as an accumulation, a cautious approach acknowledges that further data would be required to determine its precise nature. What can be stated with certainty is that the magnitude of the transfer, the exchange-linked source, and the low cost of execution are clear on-chain facts that demonstrate the scale at which the XRP Ledger is currently operating.

The run-up to Tucker’s exit has been marked by uncertainty, with HSBC scrambling to find a successor. Its search for a suitable replacement kicked off in May, but with Brendan Nelson set to take over on an interim basis from October 1, the bank appears far from finalizing a permanent appointment. MWM Consulting is assisting HSBC in the search for potential successors Executives past and present have described the leadership vacuum at HSBC as “highly unusual.” UK regulators, too, have been pushing the bank to settle on a permanent successor, according to insiders. One person even remarked, “You can’t have an interim chair for very long. It’s a stick of dynamite underneath everyone.” The 2017 appointment of Mark Tucker marked a historic break for HSBC, which had always chosen chairs from within since its founding in 1865. The decision was influenced by non-executive directors seeking to align with the Cadbury Report’s call for independent chairs, according to a person familiar with the lender’s situation. Tucker made his presence felt at HSBC almost immediately, despite being its first outsider chair and working remotely from New York. His decision to depart sooner than expected and join AIA Group, without naming a successor, however, came as a surprise to his colleagues. One close associate said the decision was out of character for someone who has made succession planning a top priority, having appointed three chief executives in fewer than ten years. Currently, the lender is working with MWM Consulting, a London headhunting firm, to identify potential successors. The challenge for HSBC is to find a chair who understands Asia, where the bulk of its earnings are generated, but can also operate effectively in Washington’s charged political climate. The bank has offered little detail about the search so far. In a filing last week, it described the process as “ongoing,” and told the Financial Times it was “underway” and that further news would come later. One person familiar with the search described it as “underwhelming,” noting that recruiters initially presented only a few credible options. Kevin Sneader and Richard Gnodde of Goldman Sachs were on the shortlist at one point, but are no longer being considered. Zurich Insurance CEO Mario Greco also turned down the offer, according to the Financial Times. Nonetheless, the bank resumed its search during the summer to find additional candidates. Baroness Shriti Vadera, chair of Prudential and a former Labour minister, gained strong backing internally but declined to take the job. Two people familiar with the matter said HSBC has also approached Naguib Kheraj, the chair of Petershill Partners, who last week announced plans to quit the London Stock Exchange after its market value fell by a third over the past four years. Should the search fail, insiders believe Ann Godbehere or interim chair Brendan Nelson could step in permanently. HSBC Asset Management unveiled a private credit strategy Recently, HSBC Asset Management introduced a new private credit strategy, providing investors with exposure to a portfolio of trade finance assets and leveraging the bank’s existing deal pipeline. The bank said it expects the initiative to offer resilience, providing stable yields amid ongoing changes in global commerce and corporate supply chains. Vivek Ramachandran, head of Global Trade Solutions at HSBC, remarked, “Trade assets represent a growing asset class that institutional investors want access to. This new strategy brings together our global reach, origination strength, and innovation to deliver robust trade finance solutions to clients and economies worldwide.” The bank also introduced a working capital finance product in May to support American customers dealing with rising import duties. Not all recent headlines have been positive, though. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , at the end of August, HSBC was fined over $537k by regulators in Hong Kong for disclosure lapses after an investigation by Hong Kong regulators. According to a joint investigation by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the financial company failed to disclose investment-banking ties with firms listed in Hong Kong in over 4,200 research notes issued between 2013 and 2021.

Key Takeaways: Zhimin Qian pleaded guilty in London to orchestrating a multi-billion-dollar crypto fraud that led to the seizure of 61,000 BTC. The scam targeted over 128,000 victims in China, with funds laundered through property purchases and aided by accomplice Jian Wen. UK authorities called the seven-year investigation a major milestone in cracking down on crypto-based financial crime. Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, appeared at London’s Southwark Crown Court on Monday, where she admitted to illegally acquiring and possessing tens of thousands of Bitcoins linked to a massive fraud operation in China. According to the Metropolitan Police , Qian masterminded a large-scale investment scam in China between 2014 and 2017, targeting over 128,000 victims. UK Authorities Seize 61,000 BTC Linked to Massive Fraud Scheme The stolen funds were funneled into Bitcoin, eventually amounting to 61,000 BTC seized by UK authorities. The Met launched an investigation in 2018 following a tip-off about suspicious transfers of digital assets. After evading capture for years, Qian was eventually apprehended in the UK, where she had been living under a false identity. Police said she had tried to launder the proceeds by purchasing high-value property. “This was a painstaking, multi-jurisdictional investigation spanning seven years,” said Detective Sergeant Isabella Grotto, who led the case. “Qian’s arrest and conviction mark a major breakthrough in targeting the illicit use of crypto assets.” Qian was not acting alone. She was aided by Jian Wen, a former Chinese takeaway worker who helped launder the stolen funds. Wen, 44, was sentenced last year to six years and eight months in prison after moving from modest living conditions above a restaurant to a luxury North London residence. It follows a seven-year ongoing investigation by the Met’s Economic Crime team into international money laundering, which today has seen the leading figure convicted for her crimes.

The Met seized over £300 million in Bitcoin from Wen. Court documents reveal that many victims of Qian’s scam were lured by promises of daily dividends and high returns, part of a fraudulent scheme that played on China’s enthusiasm for crypto assets at the time. The victims reportedly included professionals and retirees, many persuaded to invest by friends or family. Qian’s company projected itself as a tech-forward financial firm and claimed to support China’s ambition to become a global fintech hub. In reality, prosecutors say it was a front for a vast crypto fraud. Qian is currently in custody pending sentencing. Crypto-Related Physical Attacks Surge 169% in Six Months As reported, physical attacks targeting Bitcoin and crypto holders are rising at an alarming rate, according to new data tracked by CASA co-founder Jameson Lopp. Since late February, 35 new violent incidents have been reported globally, a 169% increase in just six and a half months. The uptick adds to an already troubling trend, as cryptocurrency markets continue their bullish run. In total, 48 attacks have occurred so far in 2025, marking a 33% increase over all of 2024. France alone has accounted for 14 of this year’s reported incidents. One of the most disturbing cases took place on September 6 in Cambridge, Canada, where a young man was abducted at gunpoint and forced to transfer funds into a cryptocurrency wallet.

This meant that bearish sentiment may lack conviction and could prove short-lived. Crypto Funds Shed $812M Across the broader digital asset market, outflows reached $812 million, driven by fading expectations for two US interest rate cuts in 2025 after stronger-than-expected economic indicators, including revised GDP and durable goods data. Despite the weekly setback, inflows remain strong. According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, the funds’ month-to-date inflows stand at $4 billion while recording $39.6 billion year-to-date, keeping the market on track to potentially challenge 2024’s record inflow of $48.6 billion if momentum continues. Ethereum joined Bitcoin in facing heavy pressure, as it saw $409 million in weekly outflows, which sharply slowed its once-strong inflow momentum. Its year-to-date (YTD) inflows of $12 billion have nearly stalled, as September’s inflows barely reach $86.2 million. Meanwhile, multi-asset funds lost $82.5 million over the past week, while Chainlink and Litecoin recorded small outflows of $0.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively. On the other hand, Solana emerged as the week’s star after attracting a hefty $291 million, while XRP followed with $93.1 million, amidst increased excitement ahead of US ETF launches. Sui and Cardano posted more modest gains, and both drew $2.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The United States saw the steepest decline as it logged $1 billion in outflows, while other regions fared better. Switzerland, for one, topped inflows with $126.8 million, while Canada and Germany recorded $58.6 million and $35.5 million, respectively, close behind. Modest contributions were also reported from Brazil at $8.9 million, Hong Kong at $2.5 million, and Australia at $1.7 million during the same period. Confidence Returns Crypto markets are showing early signs of stabilization after last week’s sharp selloff. On Monday, the two top assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, reclaimed $113,000 and $4,100, respectively, and are holding near levels seen a week ago. Despite significant ETF redemptions, particularly on Friday, QCP Capital noted that the spot prices remained steady over the weekend, which indicates that quarter-end basis unwinds were the main driver of outflows rather than selling pressure. The firm also said that volatility is easing and is expected to drift lower as markets consolidate ahead of Friday’s US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, even as a potential US government shutdown raises timing questions. Perpetual futures markets also show renewed optimism, as open interest rose to $43.6 billion. Wall Street’s strength has further boosted sentiment, and traders are cautiously positioning for a seasonally bullish “Uptober,” though Bitcoin must still break $115,000 to confirm an uptrend. Options data reflects a market regaining confidence, as seen with put skew and open interest in BTC and ETH gradually normalizing as traders rebuild exposure.

A 780M volume burst fueled the midday push; late in the session, supply re-emerged and price reset to the $0.23 shelf. News Background Large-holder flows turned net negative for the day, with whales offloading an estimated 40M DOGE, trimming aggregate balances from ~11.0B to 10.75B coins. That distribution helped cap the $0.24 test despite heavy spot volume. Despite supply overhang, DOGE continues to trade above the 200-day moving average (~$0.22). Trend bias remains constructive, and a potential golden-cross setup is being monitored if shorter moving averages curl higher. Liquidity was dominated by spot flow and intraday momentum accounts. No new catalysts hit during the window; positioning and order-flow mechanics drove price action more than external news. Price Action & Volume Over 29 Sep 03:00 – 30 Sep 02:00, DOGE traversed a $0.01 range (~4%), tagging a high near $0.24 and low near $0.23 before closing in the lower half of the band. The 13:00–14:00 breakout sequence generated more than 780M in turnover, the session’s heaviest flow. Price moved from the low-$0.23s into the $0.24 handle before stalling as supply absorbed the bid. Into the final 60 minutes (01:10–02:09), DOGE spiked to ~$0.24 at 01:26 before quickly reversing to ~$0.23 by 01:30 on 12.96M in volume. Renewed offers confirmed resistance and locked price back inside the intraday box. Net result: a failed push through $0.24, followed by orderly mean reversion to the $0.23 support zone where dip demand remains consistent. Technical Analysis & Key Levels Support: $0.23 is the active defense; repeated intraday bids and stabilization suggest short-term accumulation. Below that, the 200DMA at ~$0.22 is the structural line for trend followers. Resistance: $0.24 remains the cap. Multiple rejections and a quick fade after the late-session pop flag heavy supply. A clean daily close >$0.24 would open $0.245–$0.25, then $0.255. Trend/Structure: Post-rally consolidation is boxed between $0.23–$0.24. Break/close out of this zone sets the next directional leg. Moving Averages: DOGE remains above its 200DMA, preserving medium-term bias. Shorter MAs curling higher would confirm the golden-cross watch. Flows: Whale net outflows of ~40M DOGE explain the failure through $0.24. If that supply abates and spot demand persists, upside odds improve. What Traders Are Watching Daily close through $0.24 with expanding volume: Converts resistance into support and validates an extension to $0.245–$0.25, with follow-through risk toward $0.255 if momentum accounts chase. Defense of $0.23 on dips: Consistent absorption keeps skew long within the range. A clean break below puts $0.225–$0.22 (200DMA) in play and flips the structure into a distribution top. Whale netflows and order-book supply at $0.24–$0.245: If large-lot offers thin out while demand persists, the path of least resistance shifts higher. Persistent supply walls extend the chop. Volatility and breadth into the next push: Rising realized vol without breadth = false breaks. Traders need volume plus breadth on any breakout for durability. MA alignment: A short-MA cross higher while price holds >$0.23 would be the cleaner technical trigger for systematic strategies to re-enter long.",Markets|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-30 06:14:45

Alicia reiterated KuCoin’s longstanding commitment to building with trust and compliance at the core and shared investment strategy and local market commitment. KuCoin is reinforcing its commitment to trust and innovation by applying AI to strengthen compliance and anti–money laundering monitoring while offering users intelligent trading tools. At the same time, the exchange is returning to blockchain fundamentals with the relaunch of its KuMining product, where a recent 1,500,000TH/s BTC Hashrate sold out quickly, reflecting strong market demand. Looking ahead, KuCoin is also driving real-world utility through payment solutions across multiple countries, bringing digital assets into everyday life as global regulatory clarity continues to improve. Alicia also shared KuCoin’s approach to investment and local market development, emphasizing that the company is committed to unlocking industry-wide value through KuCoin Ventures by investing, like the recent investment in Stable, the world’s first high-throughput Layer1 blockchain powered by USDT. Beyond trading, KuCoin supports startups addressing fundamental challenges in finance, payments, and local adoption, rather than short-term token launches. At the same time, the exchange is actively investing in local markets by pursuing licenses and working closely with regulators, with Kao noting that “getting a license is just the first step—the real challenge is protecting users, just like the regulators do.” While KuCoin does not operate a massive fund, it remains open to supporting responsible teams and entrepreneurs who bring blockchain into real life with long-term vision. By speaking at CoinFerenceX, Alicia Kao reaffirmed KuCoin’s mission as “the exchange of trust for global users.” She highlighted innovation, compliance, and responsible investment as the key drivers that will shape the next phase of the digital asset economy.

The investments in the gaming industry are being touted as avenues to diversify the economy, create jobs and attract international tourism. Saudi Arabia has agreed to acquire Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) in a $55B leveraged buyout . The deal is a major milestone in the kingdom’s ambitions of becoming a gaming hub and works as a way to diversify the country’s economy away from oil. Saudi Arabia has finalized a record $55B deal for Electronic Arts Electronic Arts, known for its blockbuster franchises such as EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Battlefield, and The Sims, will go private under the deal, which is backed by the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), along with Silver Lake Management and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners. The consortium agreed to pay $210 per share in cash, representing a 25% premium over EA’s share price before reports of the negotiations surfaced. The deal represents the largest leveraged buyout in history, surpassing the 2007 acquisition of TXU Corp. for $48.4B. To finance the deal, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is providing $20B in debt, the largest such commitment ever for a buyout. The PIF, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, is rolling over its nearly 10% stake in EA which is valued at around $5B and will provide the majority of the $36B in equity funding. EA’s Madden NFL and EA Sports FC franchises consistently rank among the top sellers in the gaming industry.This strong pipeline, including the highly anticipated Battlefield 6 launch on October 10, alongside the steady revenue from sports titles like Madden and EA Sports FC, was a strong enough rationale to target EA for private ownership. Andrew Wilson, EA’s chief executive officer, praised the decision, calling it “a powerful recognition of our teams’ creativity and the iconic experiences they’ve built for millions of players worldwide.” Saudi Arabia continues to spend big on gaming expansion Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is a self-professed gaming enthusiast who intends to transform Saudi Arabia into a gaming hub. The prince himself appeared at the closing ceremonies when Saudi Arabia hosted the Esports World Cup in Riyadh earlier this year, awarding a record $70M in prize money. The Public Investment Fund (PIF) has already committed $30B to the gaming sector, picking up stakes in Nintendo, Take-Two Interactive, and Nexon, along the way. Savvy Games Group has also emerged as its primary vehicle for global gaming investments. Savvy bought Scopely for $4.9B in 2023 just as it launched the global hit Monopoly Go!. Then it acquired stakes in Niantic’s gaming division , including Pokémon Go, for $3.5B. While these deals gave Saudi Arabia influence in mobile gaming, the EA acquisition provides a major foothold in the console and PC markets, which remain crucial parts of the $178B global gaming industry. Both sides of the deal are under contrasting financial pressures. EA has endured layoffs and controversies around failed titles and acquisitions due to slowing global video game sales after a pandemic-era surge. On the other hand, the PIF is increasingly reliant on debt markets to fund its diversification drive as lower oil prices put pressure on Saudi Arabia’s finances. Industry analysts have pointed out that the unity of EA’s sports portfolio and Saudi Arabia’s heavy investment in global soccer, including the Saudi Pro League, may create new opportunities for both gaming and sports broadcasting ventures.

A clear weekly close above $120,000 would suggest extension toward $150K–$160K, while a break below $100K would turn focus to $90K–$100K support. Bitcoin’s September green close increases odds of a strong October move. Key levels: $120,000 resistance; $100,000 support—watch weekly closes for confirmation. On-chain flow: Binance netflow at -311 BTC suggests reduced exchange supply and potential accumulation. Meta description: Bitcoin October breakout outlook: $120K resistance vs $100K support. Watch Binance netflow and weekly closes. Read COINOTAG analysis and trade plan. What is Bitcoin’s October breakout outlook? Bitcoin October breakout outlook shows elevated probability of an upward extension after a 5.65% September gain, with resistance near $120,000 and support around $100,000. Traders should watch exchange flows and weekly candle closes for confirmation of a breakout or a range breakdown. How do on-chain flows and historical cycles support this view? On-chain indicators and cycle history provide context for the October range. Binance netflow reported at -311 BTC signals net withdrawals from exchange custody, which historically reduces available sell-side liquidity. IncomeSharks’ historical observation—green Septembers often precede strong Octobers—adds cyclical weight to the technical setup. Bitcoin’s 5.65% September gain places focus on October’s breakout potential as analysts predict key levels. Bitcoin’s green September historically precedes double digit October gains, according to IncomeSharks. Price stability between $100K support and $120K resistance defines the key decision zone for October. Binance netflow of -311 BTC, noted by Umair Crypto, aligns with past accumulation phases before upward moves. Bitcoin’s latest monthly performance closed September up 5.65%, renewing attention on whether October will deliver a sustained breakout or a continuation of consolidation. IncomeSharks highlighted a recurring pattern: when September closes green, October has often produced double-digit monthly gains. That historical observation is not a guarantee, but it frames elevated expectations. Why do historical cycles matter for Bitcoin now? Historical cycles show repeated expansions followed by deep retracements, which help set realistic upside and downside targets. Past rallies—2016–2017’s run to nearly $20,000 and the 2020–2021 rise to around $69,000—were followed by large corrections. Since early 2023, structure shows higher highs and higher lows, supporting a constructive macro trend. Source: IncomeSharks on X Recent price action shows a contained monthly range: the October monthly open was $108,268, with an intra-month low near $107,270 and a high close to $117,968 before finishing near the upper band. That pattern points to buyer control inside a six-figure range rather than immediate exhaustion. What on-chain signals are traders watching? Exchange flows, supply distribution and large-holder behavior matter for near-term directional bias. Umair Crypto reported a Binance netflow of -311 BTC, which implies net withdrawals from the exchange. Reduced exchange balances can precede upward pressure if demand persists, because less supply is available for market sellers. Complementary metrics—such as realized volatility and derivatives funding—should be monitored alongside netflow to avoid false signals. Netflow alone is a supportive but not definitive indicator. When will a breakout or breakdown be confirmed? Confirmation hinges on weekly and monthly closes relative to key levels. A decisive weekly close above $120,000 would favor continuation toward $150,000–$160,000 on measured extensions. Conversely, a weekly close below $100,000 would shift the focus to the $90,000–$100,000 support band and increase the probability of a deeper pullback. Frequently Asked Questions Does a green September guarantee a strong October for Bitcoin? No. Historical patterns show green Septembers have often preceded strong Octobers, but this is a probabilistic relationship. Traders should combine history with present on-chain flows, liquidity and macro conditions before making decisions. How should traders use Binance netflow data? Use netflow as a liquidity signal: negative netflow (withdrawals) can indicate reduced available supply and potential accumulation. Confirm with volume, funding rates and price structure to reduce false positives. Key Takeaways September momentum: A 5.65% September close raises the probability of an active October, per historical patterns. Critical levels: $120,000 resistance and $100,000 support define the current decision zone. On-chain support: Binance netflow at -311 BTC suggests reduced exchange supply, aligning with accumulation phases. Conclusion Bitcoin’s October outlook balances historical precedent, on-chain signals and clear technical levels. Watch weekly closes around $120,000 and $100,000, monitor exchange netflows and maintain risk controls.

The BOJ, at its meeting on Sept. 18-19, left its official rate unchanged at 0.5%. However, the summary released on Tuesday of the discussions that took place at the meeting stated that two of the nine board members favored a hike. One argued that it may be appropriate to raise the policy interest rate again. Others pushed back, cautioning that the U.S. economy could suddenly slow down even more than anticipated, with spillover effects on Japan. For now, the board has consented to proceed with caution. Dissent shakes up expectations Markets responded almost immediately to the release of the meeting’s record. The yen weakened against the dollar, highlighting investors’ jitters about Japan’s policy direction. Yields on government bonds ticked higher as traders priced in the probability of tighter monetary conditions to come. Market bets shifted quickly, with the overnight swap index now implying a 70% chance of a BOJ rate hike on the date of the Oct. 30 deal. Just weeks ago, the odds of such a move were likely closer to 40%, indicating how quickly things have turned on a dime. The surprise wasn’t only the dissent itself but its source. One of the most dovish policymakers at the BOJ, board member Asahi Noguchi, said this week that the desirability of a rate rise was “more than ever.” Noguchi had resisted the pressure for years, as he warned against crimping growth. His move reflects a growing anxiety within the board about the perils of leaving policy too loose in an environment of persistent high inflation. This opposition is a turning point, analysts say. Amid inflation that is running faster than the BOJ’s 2% target and wage settlements showing momentum, the case for normalization is building. But the board is hardly united. Others remain wary, citing soft household spending and global risks that could hinder Japan’s fragile recovery. The move means that Governor Kazuo Ueda, the first academic to head the BOJ when he took charge last year, is facing his sternest test yet. His style so far has been one of gradualism, indicating that Japan is moving away from ultra-loose policy, but doing so carefully, with small steps. The division among the board, though, underscores just how fragile that consensus has grown. Investors and economists now view October as a pivotal time. And if the BOJ doesn’t do something by then, pressure will mount. It’s not a matter of whether Japan raises rates again, but when it will do so. BOJ keeps rate unchanged for now, door ‘open’ The BOJ has left its rate unchanged since July, when it raised it for the first time in 17 years. Inflation has persistently exceeded its 2% target, primarily driven by increases in the prices of food and energy. The bank has stated that wage growth would need to be well underway before it could feel confident committing itself to higher rates. The bank also signaled at the September meeting that it would gradually unwind its holdings of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and real estate investment trusts (REITs). Markets interpreted that as another signal that the BOJ is inching closer to normalisation. Still, uncertainty dominates. The global outlook is also shaky, with China slowing and the U.S. economy sending mixed signals. Many BOJ policymakers want to see the figures before making a decision. The Tankan survey of business sentiment, out next week, and regional economic reports could guide the October decision. So far, the BOJ is holding still while leaning forward. With inflation stubborn and dissent growing, October may mark a turning point in Japan’s nearly 10-year experiment with near-zero rates. Get seen where it counts.

Analysts from The Motley Fool have highlighted that while Solana is sprinting ahead, Ethereum seems to be trotting along in comparison. Ethereum’s Market Lead May Be At Risk A particularly telling metric in this competition is the total value locked (TVL) within each ecosystem. TVL serves as an indicator of the capital deposited in a blockchain’s decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. A higher total value locked often signifies greater value within the ecosystem, reflecting growing user engagement and investment. Over the past year, Solana has seen its total value locked soar by approximately 198%, reaching around $38.5 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Go To Zero, Hedge Fund CEO Warns Meanwhile, Ethereum has also doubled its total value locked, which now stands at approximately $362.7 billion. However, the growth rate of Solana’s ecosystem outpaces that of Ethereum, signaling a shift in user activity and interest. Despite Ethereum’s substantial lead in TVL, particularly in the stablecoin sector where it hosts around $161.1 billion compared to Solana’s $12.9 billion, the rapid growth of Solana’s ecosystem raises questions about its long-term market share. The Motley Fool analysts suggest that if this trend continues, Solana could capture a significant portion of the market currently dominated by the Ethereum blockchain. Solana To Dominate The Tokenized Stock Market? One of the key factors contributing to Solana’s growth is its advantage in transaction speed and cost. As the market and interest for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization expands, Solana is said to be positioned as a preferred platform for issuing and trading tokenized stocks. This segment of the tokenization market is continuously gaining traction, and Solana has already accumulated $69.2 million in tokenized stock value within just the last three months. In contrast, Ethereum holds $274.8 million in tokenized stocks, but much of that flow occurred only recently. Related Reading: XRP Explosion Ahead? Analysts Outline Longevity And Bold $200 Target Moreover, Solana’s total tokenized assets grew by 35% to reach $671.4 million in just 30 days ending on September 24, while Ethereum’s tokenized asset value saw only a modest 2% increase, reaching $9 billion. The analysts concluded by stressing that the asset tokenization market is still in its early stages, and Solana appears well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. When it comes to price growth, Ethereum is in the lead, having risen by over 50% year-to-date, compared to Solana’s 33% increase in the same period. At the time of writing, the price of SOL hovers just above the $209 mark, representing a 28% gap between current valuations and its record high of $293.

The company also plans to adopt “Bitcoin Japan Corporation” as its English name and said it will focus on crypto treasury operations. Some of these moves were announced in a company release this week. Company Rebrands To Signal New Focus Bakkt’s June agreement to buy a controlling stake in the business helped trigger the shift. Reports have disclosed that Phillip Lord, president of Bakkt International, will take the CEO job at the newly named firm, and Akshay Naheta, co-chief executive officer of Bakkt Holdings, will become chairman of the board. The company stated the new leadership will better align directors and shareholders and said it aims at medium- to long-term improvement in corporate value.

Founded in 1861, it opened one of Japan’s first kimono wholesale stores in 1894 and listed on the Tokyo Exchange in 1974. Yet the company has struggled in recent years. Based on reports, Marusho Hotta logged a net income of minus 407 million yen ($2,724,400) for its most recent fiscal period. Other textile players have also reported losses: Kitabo recorded a net loss of $785,000 for FY2024, even as it plans to buy about $5.4 million worth of Bitcoin as it moves into crypto and real-world asset ventures. Textile Firms Shift Into Bitcoin A number of Japanese companies in the fashion and textile sectors have announced plans to buy Bitcoin or offer crypto-related services. Reports note that Metaplanet has amassed enough Bitcoin to rank among the global top five corporate Bitcoin treasuries. Loyalty firm Remixpoint, game maker Gumi, and retailer ANAP are other recent examples that have said they will add Bitcoin to their corporate strategies. A Company Reinventing Its Identity This is more than a name swap. For an organization founded in 1861 to become Bitcoin Japan signals a striking corporate pivot. Whether the plan restores profitability or simply changes the company’s public image remains to be seen. The market will watch how shareholders react on November 11 and whether other traditional firms follow with larger Bitcoin treasuries.

Guilty plea: former deputy confessed to conspiracy to commit extortion and conspiracy against rights. Allegations include staged arrests, armed coercion to force transfers (one reported $127,000), and monthly payouts to the deputy. Fraud linked to Zort and Adam Iza reportedly moved $16 million in crypto; sentencing dates run through 2026. Meta description: LA County deputy crypto extortion: former deputy pleads guilty to conspiring with a ‘crypto godfather’ to stage arrests and extort victims. Read the facts now. What did the former LA County deputy admit to? The former deputy admitted to conspiracy to commit extortion and conspiracy against rights after working with Adam Iza, a self‑described “crypto godfather” linked to the fraudulent trading platform Zort. Federal charging documents and a U.S. Attorney’s Office statement lay out staged arrests, victim intimidation, and coerced transfers. How did the scheme work and who was involved? The admitted scheme paired off‑duty law enforcement muscle with a fraudulent crypto entrepreneur. The deputy used his badge while off duty to interrogate victims, orchestrate false arrests, and help force victims to transfer funds. Prosecutors allege one victim was forced at gunpoint to hand over $127,000. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""LA County deputy pleads guilty in crypto extortion scheme"", ""alternativeHeadline"": ""Former deputy admits role in extortion tied to Zort and 'crypto godfather' Adam Iza"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-09-30T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-09-30T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": """", ""width"": 600, ""height"": 60 } }, ""description"": ""A former Los Angeles County deputy pleaded guilty to conspiring with a self‑styled 'crypto godfather' to extort victims through staged arrests and intimidation related to the Zort platform."", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }} Why is this case significant for crypto fraud and law enforcement oversight? Front-loading the significance: this case demonstrates how criminal misuse of official authority can amplify crypto fraud. Experts describe the combination of fraudulent crypto platforms and law enforcement intimidation as a heightened public‑safety concern that weak oversight of off‑duty work can enable. What evidence and outcomes have prosecutors presented? According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California, plea agreements and charging papers detail coordinated intimidation tactics from 2021, direct coercion of victims, and financial flows tied to Adam Iza’s operations. The deputy faces up to 20 years on the extortion count and up to 10 years on the conspiracy against rights count. Frequently Asked Questions Who was the “crypto godfather” in this case? Adam Iza is identified in federal filings as the central fraudster behind Zort; he has been in federal custody since September 2024 and is alleged to have acquired $16 million in crypto through fraudulent means. What penalties does the former deputy face? The deputy faces statutory maximums of 20 years in prison on the extortion count and 10 years on the conspiracy against rights count; sentencing is scheduled for February 17, 2026. Were other law enforcement officers involved? Yes. Other former deputies — Christopher Michael Cadman and David Anthony Rodriguez — have pleaded guilty for related roles; sentencing dates for those individuals are scheduled through 2026. Another former deputy, Eric Chase Saavedra, also admitted guilt earlier this year. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Who was the 'crypto godfather' in this case?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Adam Iza is identified in federal filings as the central fraudster behind Zort; he has been in federal custody since September 2024 and is alleged to have acquired $16 million in crypto through fraudulent means."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What penalties does the former deputy face?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The deputy faces statutory maximums of 20 years in prison on the extortion count and 10 years on the conspiracy against rights count; sentencing is scheduled for February 17, 2026."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to identify potential law‑enforcement–enabled crypto extortion"", ""description"": ""Simple steps to spot signs that law enforcement authority may be abused to facilitate crypto fraud."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Verify claims of authority"", ""text"": ""Confirm whether an individual claiming official authority is acting in an official capacity and check public records or court filings where available."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Document coercive demands"", ""text"": ""Collect timestamps, messages, and witness statements when asked to transfer funds or surrender assets under threat."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Report to federal authorities"", ""text"": ""Provide documented evidence to appropriate federal or local prosecutors and retain legal counsel; do not confront alleged perpetrators directly."" } ]} Key Takeaways Guilty plea: The former deputy pleaded guilty to extortion and conspiracy against rights in a scheme tied to Adam Iza and the Zort platform.

Broader risk: This case highlights oversight gaps for off‑duty conduct and the risk of combining official coercion with crypto fraud; victims should document and report abuse. Conclusion This prosecution shows a rare but severe intersection of law enforcement abuse and crypto fraud: a former LA County deputy admitted using his position to help extort victims for a fraudulent crypto operation linked to Adam Iza and Zort. Ongoing sentences and further prosecutions through 2026 aim to hold participants accountable; readers should remain vigilant and report suspicious coercion to prosecutors. Published by COINOTAG.

52464065,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84853,1759215723,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: XRP Will Likely Hit Around $33 This Time. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-will-likely-hit-around-33-this-time-heres-why/,"XRP’s historical price behavior continues to be a point of interest for many analysts and enthusiasts who track long-term cycles. A recent post from Cryptobilbuwoo0 on X highlighted a striking comparison between the 2017 rally and the current 2025 setup. The chart presented in the post places the 2017 surge to around $3.3 side by side with XRP’s present movement, where a similar breakout structure appears to be forming. The comparison shows that in 2017, XRP consolidated within a narrowing triangle before breaking upward at the end of the year. Once this breakout occurred, the price escalated sharply to its peak near $3.3. In 2025, the same pattern is visible, with XRP again consolidating before breaking higher. This technical resemblance has led to growing confidence among observers that the token could follow the same trajectory on a much larger scale. Coincidentally, the 2018 high was around $3.3. So, it'll likely hit around $33 this time, too. https://t.co/TgS7mNwYNj pic.twitter.com/VYBLhWFwUb — (X)=chi (R)esurrected (P)=rho (@Cryptobilbuwoo0) September 28, 2025 Target Projection Based on Historical Move The highlighted levels on the chart are important for understanding the projection. In 2017, XRP rose from around $0.21 to $3.30, an increase of more than 15x. The updated 2025 chart places the consolidation range between $2.40 and $3. If the same kind of expansion occurs, the projection extends to around $33. The use of repeating patterns in technical analysis is common among traders, as XRP tends to mirror past movements . When past price structures show a near-identical setup, many view it as a strong indicator of possible outcomes, and repeating its performance on the current scale will send it to a level much higher than many analysts have predicted. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Key Levels to Watch The chart highlights levels that may serve as checkpoints if XRP continues upward. $8.41 and $11.33 are marked as interim targets. Both represent unprecedented levels for XRP. Beyond that, the projection extends toward $19.49 and $26.32 before ultimately reaching the $33 target. These levels mirror how XRP behaved in 2017 , pausing at several points before reaching the peak. The resemblance between the two cycles strengthens the case that XRP’s movement this time could follow the same rhythm. However, on a larger scale, due to increased market maturity and institutional presence . XRP has long been viewed as one of the few digital assets with direct use in global payments. The possibility of it rising to $33 in this cycle would represent more than just a technical breakout, as it shows a strong market conviction in XRP’s role within the financial system.

Bitcoin Dominance has repeatedly rejected a long-term descending resistance, signaling growing altcoin market share. Historical BTC.D patterns (2020–2021) preceded major altseason rallies for Ethereum, Solana and Cardano. Analyst scenarios project BTC.D could fall to 40–35%, reallocating billions to altcoins and favoring ETH/BTC, SOL/BTC and AVAX/BTC. Meta description: Bitcoin Dominance downtrend signals growing altcoins market share; prepare for altseason opportunities in ETH, SOL, AVAX — read analysis and trade implications now. What is Bitcoin Dominance telling the market? Bitcoin Dominance shows a persistent downward trajectory, meaning altcoins are capturing a larger share of total crypto market capitalization. Short-term BTC price moves can be positive, but BTC.D’s failure to break descending resistance suggests relative outperformance by altcoins as capital rotates. How has BTC.D behaved historically and why does it matter? Historically, BTC.D topping near long-term resistance has preceded sharp declines that coincide with broad altcoin rallies. The 2020–2021 cycle saw BTC.D drop while Ethereum, Solana and a range of DeFi tokens delivered outsized gains. Analysts reference on-chain and market-cap data to support these parallels (source: Mister Crypto, aggregated market-cap charts). Bitcoin Dominance declines, signaling altcoins gaining market share. Altseason may drive ETH, SOL, and AVAX to outperform Bitcoin. Bitcoin Dominance is in a long-term downward trend that is continuously rejecting resistance indicating that altcoins are gaining more and more market capitalization. Similar BTC.D patterns in the 2020-2021 period have caused significant increases in altcoin rallies in Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and DeFi tokens. BTC.D might fall to 40-35% and liquidity and retail focus will be directed to altcoins, making ETH/BTC, SOL/BTC, and AVAX/BTC perform better than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Dominance remains in a clear long-term downtrend, which means altcoins are gaining market share. Analysts note that replicating the 2020–2021 pattern would historically align with significant altcoin performance, based on market-cap rotation mechanics and liquidity flows. Why is BTC.D rejecting resistance and what does that imply? BTC.D has consistently failed to close above a descending resistance line, capping rallies near ~64% in the most recent attempt. Rejections at key trendlines indicate relative strength is shifting away from Bitcoin and toward alternative tokens. This is a structural signal: even if BTC price rises, its share of the total market can fall. Source: Mister Crypto When could altseason accelerate and which pairs perform best? If BTC.D trends toward the 40–35% range, expect a reallocation of capital and liquidity into altcoins. Historically, ETH/BTC, SOL/BTC and AVAX/BTC have outperformed Bitcoin during these rotations. Retail inflows and concentrated liquidity events often amplify moves in layer-1 tokens and DeFi projects during altseason. How should traders interpret this market structure? Traders should view BTC.D declines as a signal to monitor relative-performance charts (alt/BTC pairs) rather than price alone. Risk management remains essential; altcoins carry higher volatility. Use position sizing and stop rules while tracking on-chain indicators and exchange liquidity. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Bitcoin Dominance falling?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes. Bitcoin Dominance is in a long-term downtrend with repeated resistance rejections, indicating increasing altcoin market share and the possibility of an altseason if the trend continues."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which assets benefit when BTC.D falls?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Layer-1 tokens and major altcoins typically benefit; historically, ETH/BTC, SOL/BTC and AVAX/BTC have outperformed Bitcoin during altseasons."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How low could Bitcoin Dominance fall during altseason? Analysts project BTC.D could decline to the 40%–35% range if the current downtrend continues. Such a move would shift billions in market capitalization toward altcoins, increasing their relative liquidity and potential upside. What signals should voice searches look for to identify altseason? Listen for mentions of a sustained BTC.D downtrend, increased trading volume in alt/BTC pairs, and amplification of layer-1 token gains. These natural-language cues align with historical altseason conditions and signal rotation into altcoins. Key Takeaways BTC.D downtrend : A persistent descending resistance suggests altcoins are capturing market share. Historical precedent : 2020–2021 patterns preceded major altcoin rallies, especially in ETH, SOL and DeFi tokens. Actionable insight : Monitor ETH/BTC, SOL/BTC and AVAX/BTC and apply strict risk controls if reallocating into altcoins. Conclusion Bitcoin Dominance’s continued rejection at long-term resistance indicates growing altcoin market share and a heightened probability of altseason. Traders and investors should monitor relative-strength metrics and major alt/BTC pair performance.

According to crypto observer SMQKE, the discussion this time centers squarely on crypto assets, reflecting the growing importance and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies in global financial markets. The joint roundtable unites regulators, industry leaders, and market participants to tackle the unique regulatory challenges of digital assets, spanning DeFi platforms, stablecoins, and tokenized securities, marking a shift from past discussions centered on traditional securities and derivatives. SMQKE sees the roundtable as a pivotal move toward harmonizing crypto regulation. By uniting the SEC, which safeguards investors, and the CFTC, which oversees derivatives, the agencies aim to streamline oversight, reduce regulatory ambiguity, and provide clearer guidance for crypto innovators, without compromising investor protection. The crypto observer notes that the roundtable could shape key regulatory developments, offering stakeholders a platform to address gaps in existing rules or propose new frameworks for emerging technologies. It signals government recognition of digital assets as central to modern finance and could influence upcoming decisions on crypto ETFs, custody rules, and reporting standards, potentially accelerating the maturation of the U.S. crypto market. Therefore, SMQKE highlights that the first joint SEC–CFTC meeting in 15 years marks a pivotal moment. As digital assets grow in complexity and adoption, clear regulation is essential, making this roundtable a potential landmark in shaping the future of U.S. crypto oversight. XRP Shows Steady Bullish Momentum as Price Climbs to $2.90 According to market analyst Voice Of Web3, XRP has demonstrated notable bullish momentum, climbing from $2.78 to $2.86 in recent trading sessions. This upward movement, with the present price standing at $2.90, reflects growing investor confidence in the digital asset amid favorable technical and market conditions. The price surge from $2.78 to $2.90 is modest but meaningful, highlighting a disciplined and sustainable trend rather than a short-lived spike. Market watchers note that XRP’s movement aligns with a classic bullish setup, often seen when support levels hold strong and resistance zones are approached gradually. The consolidation around $2.78 served as a stable foundation, allowing XRP to gather momentum before advancing toward its next resistance targets. Therefore, XRP is showing strong upward potential as long as key support holds. A break above $2.90 could trigger a stronger bullish phase, boosting buying pressure and volume, with traders also watching Bitcoin and Ethereum for broader market cues. Conclusion The SEC–CFTC joint roundtable marks a pivotal shift in U.S. crypto regulation, fostering collaboration that could deliver clearer rules, boost innovation, protect investors, and strengthen America’s leadership in the global digital asset market. Meanwhile, XRP’s climb from $2.78 to $2.90 reflects measured bullish momentum backed by technical consolidation, market sentiment, and regulatory optimism. As the market watches closely, the next resistance levels could determine whether XRP is set for a sustained rally or a brief pause in its upward journey.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|REGULATION|XRP|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-30 07:07:50
52464213,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=829180,1759216206,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52464213.jpeg,BlackRock Dethrones Coinbase in Bitcoin Options – Why Bitcoin Hyper Presale Could Be the Next Big Winner,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/blackrock-leads-bitcoin-options-bitcoin-hyper-presale/,"BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has surpassed Coinbase’s Deribit platform, becoming the largest venue for Bitcoin options globally. Open interest in options tied to IBIT recently reached nearly $38B, compared to $32B on Deribit, according to a Bloomberg report. Deribit was founded in 2016 and has been the market leader for Bitcoin derivatives for the longest time. In contrast, launched only in November 2024, IBIT is relatively new to the options trading market. Its early and rapid adoption has turned heads in the crypto world. IBIT has had a remarkable growth since its inception. For starters, the firm crossed $80B in assets under management (AUM) in just 374 trading days – the fastest for an ETF to reach that milestone. With IBIT now holding 57.5% of all Bitcoin ETF assets under management , Wall Street’s message is clear: institutional conviction in $BTC has never been stronger. As Bitcoin’s momentum builds, hot new crypto presales such as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are riding the wave of success. Why Now Might Be a Defining Moment for Bitcoin and Its Ecosystem IBIT overtaking Derbit suggests that the center of gravity in crypto derivatives is shifting toward regulated US-based venues. Additionally, IBIT’s increasing options liquidity enhances its credibility, which attracts more capital, creating a cycle of deeper liquidity and market presence. While IBIT may have overtaken Deribit in volume, Deribit continues to retain a strong following among crypto-native traders as a top crypto exchange for speculative and high-leverage trades, particularly in offshore or less-regulated contexts. The major curveball is how a regulated instrument like IBIT could become the largest options venue in under a year, indicating just how much and how fast institutional capital is now flowing into Bitcoin-linked products. As more capital enters, it helps support price and deepens liquidity, making the coin less vulnerable to extreme volatility or flash crashes. Together, these trends indicate that the market is pulling in two directions — crypto natives are sticking with Deribit, while institutions are pouring into IBIT. What’s more, as open interest in Bitcoin-linked options increases, the derivatives market plays a more important role in price discovery. IBIT’s dominance means its options could increasingly influence Bitcoin’s implied volatility, hedging flows, and directional pressures. This deeper market structure feeds directly into broader momentum. Sustained inflows via ETFs and derivatives in a bullish cycle can generate ‘flywheel effects,’ meaning that more capital will attract more liquidity, which in turn brings in even more capital. With macroeconomic factors like inflation, monetary easing, and geopolitical risks prompting investors to seek alternative stores of value, $BTC is well-positioned to capture demand. Additionally, Bitcoin-based projects (layer-2s, decentralized finance, tokenization, cross-chain bridges) stand to benefit significantly from increased adoption, as it translates to more capital, more experiments, and more integrations. Bitcoin Hyper Redefines Efficiency with Ultra-Low Transaction Costs Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the latest crypto project attempting to turbocharge Bitcoin with Solana-like speed, scalability, and Web3 support. The project is developing a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that will integrate with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), enabling the execution of thousands of unrelated transactions in parallel. Bitcoin Hyper rises to modern blockchain standards by processing the transactions off-chain, but without compromising Bitcoin Layer 1 security. That’s because it batches the transaction results and submits a summary to the Bitcoin main chain, ensuring instantaneous execution. Here are a few other features that make $HYPER worth watching: SVM integration allows developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications on the network Layer 2 enables high-speed DeFi trading, NFTs, DAOs and governance, lending, staking, swapping, and blockchain gaming Seamless user interaction with this SVM-powered Web3 environment. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale and be part of Bitcoin’s next chapter. Now that we have an idea of what the project aims to achieve, let’s get into how to buy $HYPER and why participating in the Bitcoin Hyper presale can deliver value to early investors. The project is already making waves in its presale phase, raising over $19.2M. Whales have been spotted, stacking their bags with $HYPER worth $113.8K , $109.9K , $105.4K , totaling $329K over the past weekend. One Hyper now sits at $0.013005 with dynamic staking rewards of 61% APY. If analysts are correct, $HYPER’s price could rise to $0.02595 by the end of 2025 and to $0.08625 by 2026. To put this into perspective, if you invest $500 into Hyper today, you could stand to gain around $1,606 in just one year — that’s price appreciation plus staking rewards. In other words, a 3.2x return. Remember, the staking APY decreases as more participants join, and the next expected price jump is scheduled for tomorrow. Secure your $HYPER today for the highest potential gains. This is not financial advice. The markets can be volatile and speculative.

BTC closed near $113,985 after briefly touching $114,309 , and traders are now eyeing $108K as support and $114,309 as immediate resistance, with a stronger ceiling sitting near $117K. XRP and Ethereum are also up by 0.89% and 2.44% respectively. In other news, the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and gold are in the green, with the US Treasury’s gold holdings crossing $1T in value . A likely contributor to this is the Fed’s 25-basis-point rate cut, which has significantly lowered the hurdle rate for risky bets, bleeding into high-beta assets like altcoins and new meme coins on presale . And Maxi Doge ($MAXI) stands out among them, having already raised $ 2.6M in presale. BTC Consolidates as Risk Appetite Grows – The Perfect Backdrop for Altcoins Bitcoin’s RSI is holding neutral, the ADX is below 20 (indicating no clear trend), and the EMA50 is still above the EMA200 but with a closing gap (death-cross risk). These all suggest a consolidating market with choppy ranges and volatility spikes. If $BTC breaks above nearby resistance, it can ignite a more substantial rally. However, if it slides below the support level, traders may shift to safer assets, triggering profit-taking in altcoins. Many users have placed the odds at 53% that $BTC will hit $125K before dropping to $105K. The Fed’s recent rate cut is also a clear signal of easier monetary conditions, which will make borrowing cheaper, pushing investors toward riskier, higher-return assets. The S&P 500 is up by 0.26% and Nasdaq by 0.48% , led by tech giants like Nvidia, AppLovin, and Microsoft. Big tech rallies also lift the overall market sentiment, increasing investor risk appetite. This creates a liquidity-rich environment where money isn’t just flowing into Bitcoin, but also into smaller, high-beta plays. Against this backdrop, Maxi Doge’s presale is thriving with whales flexing their entries early. Gym-Bro Energy Meets High-Risk Trading: Inside the Maxi Doge Presale Dogecoin’s the family golden boy, the meme coin everyone knows. Fame, glory, mainstream headlines, he has got it all. But lurking in the shadows at every family gathering was his jacked cousin- Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . A Doge Bro forged in rejection, built in rage, and fueled by pure gym-bro discipline. Maxi Doge didn’t get the spotlight; he got the Iron Paradise. With protein shakes in his veins and MaxiTren 9000 pumping through his system, he turned every rep, every set, into fuel for revenge. His eyes burn with charts, candlesticks reflecting off his shades at 3 am, because his motto is simple: ‘The crypto market never sleeps, so why should I?’ Maxi Doge is the degen’s dream — a no-stop-loss, 1000x leverage, retire-at-22 kind of play. He doesn’t hedge; he doesn’t fold. He goes all-in, flexing harder than a double scoop of pre-workout at 5 am leg day. That’s the kind of mad energy Maxi Doge embodies. Maxi Doge has already raised $2.6M in presale, making serious waves in the market. Whale purchases of $37.3K and $12.9K into $MAXI reflects the strong conviction in the project. Today, one $MAXI sits at $0.00026, with dynamic staking rewards offering a massive 129% APY. That means a $500 investment today could grow to around $1,145 in just one year, a profit of $645 from staking alone, without even factoring in potential price appreciation. As more traders join the project, staking rewards will gradually decrease, making now the perfect opportunity to lock in presale gains. With the next price jump expected tomorrow, the clock is ticking for early entrants. Join the Maxi Doge presale to secure your tokens . This is not financial advice. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. Always do your own research before making any investments.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $4,094.79 and a minimum price of $3,582.95. By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $6,654.04 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. In September 2020, Binance introduced BNB Smart Chain, which was initially designed for trading and transferring tokens and runs parallel to Binance Chain and What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond?

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased $1026.9 after finding resistance at $1035 in the past 24 hours. If traders continue selling assets, the BNB price might see a further dip, and the next target could be below $1000. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $6,654.04 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found resistance, and the price moved toward $1026.9, as bears target $1000. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 0.78 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? BNB price has already touched $1000 in 2025 and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2027, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $6,654.04 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. Heading into September, BNB is trading at approximately $854.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-30 07:20:16

While Cardano news signals pressure, attention is shifting to Remittix (RTX) . The payments-focused token has already raised over $26.8 million, and experts now tip it for a potential 7,000% surge as adoption grows. Cardano Price Prediction Faces Tough Q4 Outlook Cardano (ADA) is back in the spotlight, but not for the reasons holders may hope. ADA price today sits near $0.77, slipping under fresh selling pressure after a failed breakout attempt. Analysts warn that the $0.75 support level is critical, as a breakdown here could see ADA tumble deeper. The current ADA price prediction suggests choppy conditions ahead, with fake breakouts and repeated trendline retests keeping traders uneasy. Despite ADA news around governance upgrades and ecosystem expansion, price action tells a different story. The ADA price has failed to sustain upward momentum, leaving Cardano holders facing a tough road in Q4. Many market watchers fear the Cardano price prediction could dip below $0.50 if bearish pressure persists. Still, ADA news about liquidity injections and new projects provides some hope for long-term stability. As Cardano struggles with weak sentiment, analysts point to Remittix as a standout. With $26.8 million already raised, some projections call for RTX to surge as much as 7,000% once major listings roll out. Remittix Offers Real Solutions For A $190 Trillion Market Remittix continues to stand out in a market where many top tokens face uncertainty. With over $26.8 million raised and more than 672 million tokens sold at $0.1130, RTX is proving its strength. Unlike projects that lean on hype, Remittix solves a real $190 trillion remittance market problem with instant crypto-to-fiat transfers and low fees. This clear utility is why analysts tip RTX for gains as high as 7,000% post-launch.

According to a press statement viewed by Cryptopolitan on Tuesday, the service, dubbed OKX Pay, enables payments on GrabPay through the two largest US dollar-pegged stablecoins: Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. The initiative builds on OKX SG’s presence in the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, following its acquisition of a payment institution license from the Singaporean financial regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), just over a year ago. OKX Pay to use XSGD stablecoin service provider StraitsX Under the new product, customers using USDT or USDC can scan GrabPay’s SGQR codes at selected outlets to settle transactions. Payments are routed through crypto infrastructure provider StraitsX, which converts the stablecoins into its Singapore dollar-backed token XSGD. Once converted, the XSGD is then exchanged into Singapore dollars and transferred to the merchant. Every transaction is processed as a blockchain transfer under Singapore’s p urpose-bound money (PBM) framework, which applies programmable logic for compliant and conditional remittances. StraitsX, a regulated payments provider, will oversee compliance checks and real-time transaction validation under the PBM system. The company’s XSGD stablecoin already integrates with Alipay+ and Grab, connecting to wallets such as GCash, KakaoPay, and Touch ’N Go. Gracie Lin, CEO of OKX SG, said the launch would bring digital payment tokens, or DPTs, into “everything-everyday” consumer use. “OKX Pay addresses real needs for customers by expanding DPTs’ use beyond trading and investing to everyday payments, including a morning coffee, and even dining out with friends,” Lin’s statement read. Through the new platform, Singapore could bite into a share of the global stablecoin market, which has now reached a total valuation of $297 billion, around 7% of the crypto market cap, according to DeFiLlama data. “The launch of OKX Pay is a blueprint for how stablecoins will underpin global commerce in the years ahead,” said Tianwei Liu, StraitsX CEO and co-founder. The partners said they plan to add more retail, beverage, and merchant options and expand the service to include more stablecoins and digital currencies, alongside USDT and USDC, in several regions within Singapore. GrabPay integration could add to regional expansion roadmap Grab is one of the most widely used payment platforms in Southeast Asia, but it had only started integrating digital assets into its ecosystem in March 2024. At the time, the service allowed Singapore users to top up their GrabPay wallets with Bitcoin, Ether, USDT, USDC, and XSGD following a deal with payments company Triple-A. That offering was extended to the Philippines in July this year, with the exception of XSGD. According to anonymous sources speaking to The Straits Times, Grab has also partnered with OKX rival Coinbase to test a Web 3 Wallet that “holds digital assets in a pilot.” Moreover, on the same day as OKX’s launch, rival exchange Coinbase began trading XSGD. “We have been conducting pilots to explore the potential benefits of digital payment tokens, through collaborative efforts with industry partners including Amazon, Circle, StraitsX, Triple-A, and UOB,” a spokesperson for the company said when the news of the pilot program broke. OKX President addresses regulatory hurdles OKX may be looking to build its legitimacy in Singapore, but the exchange was fined €2.3 million (S$3.5 million) by the Dutch central bank in early September for operating without the required registration between July 2023 and August 2024. The fine was preceded by a $504 million penalty in February for processing more than US $1 trillion in transactions from US customers without proper licensing. Speaking recently to Cryptopolitan, OKX president Hong Fang said stricter regulations like the MiCA rules had pushed the company to prioritize openness and traceability. “We see it as validation of our own approach,” Fang said. “Robust standards and open verification are how we and our customers can feel confident as crypto keeps scaling up.” She added that OKX was ready for Europe’s MiCA framework years in advance and had invested in developing compliance processes, audit systems, and infrastructure to meet its strict requirements. “We saw the direction regulation was heading early and have spent years developing compliance processes, audit systems, and robust infrastructure. That means as reporting requirements step up, users and partners get consistent and reliable service, no matter how the rulebook changes,” the president remarked.

Key Takeaways: The SEC has suspended trading of QMMM Holdings over concerns of stock manipulation tied to its crypto pivot. QMMM’s share price surged nearly 1,800% following announcements of crypto holdings and a $100M-backed platform. Regulators are expanding probes into firms using crypto treasury strategies amid growing fears of hype-driven market abuse. The trading halt, which took effect Monday , is set to last 10 trading days. In its notice, the SEC said QMMM stock was potentially manipulated through “recommendations made to investors by unknown persons via social media,” allegedly aimed at inflating both the share price and trading volume. QMMM Soars Nearly 1,800% in a Day Following $100M Crypto Platform Reveal Shares of QMMM Holdings had surged more than 1,700% in the past month after the company disclosed on September 9 that it would begin purchasing and holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana as part of a broader crypto treasury strategy. The stock soared from $11 to an all-time high of $207 in a single day following a related announcement to launch a crypto analytics platform backed by $100 million in crypto assets. QMMM last traded at $119.40 on Friday, up from roughly $6.50 a month earlier. The suspension arrives just days after a Wall Street Journal report revealed that the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) had begun probing several companies over similar crypto-linked stock surges. $QMMM trading suspended 11:59 PM ET on October 10.

Crypto treasury moves have exploded in popularity, with more than 200 companies announcing plans to hold digital assets in recent months. While such strategies often spark stock rallies, analysts warn the trend is becoming overcrowded and risky, especially if falling crypto prices wipe out balance sheet gains. Crypto Treasury Craze Unravels as Firms Turn to Debt-Fueled Buybacks The crypto treasury strategy that gained traction among small-cap firms in 2024 is beginning to unravel, with several companies now launching debt-funded share buybacks to counter plunging stock prices. At least seven firms, including those in gaming, biotech, and EV sectors, are now trading below the value of their crypto holdings, raising red flags among investors and analysts. Critics say the tactic signals desperation and a departure from the original idea that crypto appreciation alone would drive shareholder value. Notable cases include ETHZilla (formerly 180 Life Sciences), which saw its stock drop 76% despite accumulating ether and rebranding. The company recently secured $80 million in debt to finance a $250 million buyback. Meanwhile, Empery Digital (formerly Volcon) holds $476 million in BTC but has a market cap of just $378 million, prompting it to expand its debt facility for similar repurchases. A recent report from K33 Research reveals that 25% of public companies holding Bitcoin now trade at market values below the worth of their BTC holdings, highlighting a sharp drop in investor confidence. The growing discount, known as the NAV gap, is limiting firms’ ability to raise capital, particularly hurting smaller players like NAKA, which has seen a 96% collapse in its market value.

Bearish Signals Suggest Further Downside Testing,https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-breakout-delayed-bearish-signals-suggest-further-downside-testing/,"Ripple (XRP) saw a minor uptick of 1.58% over the past day alongside the rest of the crypto market following last week’s bloodbath. However, the crypto asset is still facing bearish divergences that could delay the anticipated Wave 3 breakout. XRP on the Edge XRP is showing early signs of potential weakness despite a recent rebound from the trendline highlighted last week, according to technical analysis shared by crypto market expert ‘CasiTrades.’ While the respect of this level offers some encouragement, XRP has yet to break above the critical $3 resistance, which remains an important threshold for confirming a new bullish trend. Until that breakthrough occurs, the analyst explained that the downside tests are still valid, and immediate support levels have been identified at $2.79 (50% retracement) and $2.58 (61.8% retracement). The latest price action, however, raises caution. For one, the upward move from the trendline appears more like a corrective ABC pattern than a five-wave impulsive rally, with the C-wave targets being sharply rejected and bearish divergences now evident on the 4-hour chart. On the shorter-term 1-hour RSI, XRP is testing the lower support trendline. This level is being closely monitored to track the next move. As such, a drop below $2.69 would force a reassessment of the current wave count, though a test of $2.58 could still align with a broader bullish scenario if maintained. Breaking $2.58, however, would undermine the bullish market structure and put the macro outlook at risk. For now, supports remain largely intact, and traders are waiting for one of these critical levels to provide the momentum necessary to challenge resistance. A true Wave 3 breakout would require clean and decisive breaks above $2.79, $3.00, and $3.25. Continued hesitation or rejection at these levels, the analyst warned, would likely indicate further downside testing before any consistent upward movement. “Watch Bitcoin closely for alignment, and watch for bullish divergence to show up in this next wave down. Once that momentum appears, XRP has everything in place to push for the breakout we’ve been waiting for.” Quarterly Milestone Despite near-term bearish signals, some analysts see a longer-term bullish setup that could mirror XRP’s historic 2017 rally. As flagged by analyst Milkybull Crypto, XRP is edging closer to recording its highest quarterly close, a move that may set the stage for a broader uptrend toward $15. The analyst observed that if the crypto asset holds at or above its current level until the quarter ends, bullish momentum is likely to continue in the coming weeks or months. MilkybullCrypto drew parallels to 2017, when XRP’s quarterly close above $0.02 triggered a massive rally of nearly 37,800%, eventually reaching an all-time high of $3.31 within a year. In 2025, XRP appears to be following a similar trajectory. A quarterly candle has turned green after years of consolidation, and the token has decisively broken through a major resistance zone around $2.20-$2.30. MilkybullCrypto noted that history may rhyme with another significant rally. The post Ripple (XRP) Breakout Delayed?

SEC Halts Trading After QMMM Holdings Shares Rise The regulator claims that intense promotion via anonymous social media accounts is behind this extraordinary rise. The sharp rise in QMMM Holdings' shares is linked to a new plan the company recently announced. The company announced plans to establish a $100 million diversified crypto treasury that will invest in leading crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). This development has increased investor interest and led to unusual volatility in its share price. The SEC cited market manipulation risks and the need to protect investors as the basis for its decision. The agency noted that anonymous referrals, particularly via social media, could influence investor behavior. Therefore, trading in QMMM shares was suspended to ensure the smooth functioning of the market. Experts interpret the SEC's move as a warning about the growing speculative risks faced by companies diversifying into crypto-focused projects. They also emphasize that investors should carefully assess the risks before being lured by promises of high returns. *This is not investment advice.

On Morpho, users can now lend and borrow EURCV and USDCV against cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and tokenized money market funds such as USTBL and EUTBL, which are regulated by the French Financial Markets Authority and invest in US T-Bills and Eurozone T-Bills. Asset manager MEV Capital will oversee the vaults, setting rules for eligible collateral and stepping in to manage defaults if needed. More collateral types are expected over time, SG-FORGE said. In addition, Uniswap listings will create a spot market for the bank-issued stablecoins. Market maker Flowdesk will provide liquidity, helping traders swap in and out of EURCV and USDCV without relying on traditional intermediaries. The two are relatively small compared with market leaders. EURCV has a market cap of $66 million, according to CoinMarketCap data, compared with Circle Internet's EURC at $260 million. USDCV has a market cap of $32.2 million, while Tether's USDT leads with $174.8 billion.

Watch This Key Pattern,https://cryptopotato.com/dogecoins-doge-bullish-reversal-watch-this-key-pattern/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing early signs of a possible trend change on multiple charts. Traders are watching as new technical setups form, futures data shifts, and speculation grows around a potential ETF approval. Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening across key areas. Bullish Pattern Emerges on the 4-Hour Chart Dogecoin is trading around $0.23 and showing early signs of a possible reversal. According to technical analyst Trader Tardigrade, a pattern has formed on the 4-hour chart that traders often associate with a shift in direction — an Inverse Head and Shoulders. $Doge /4-hour #Dogecoin has formed a small Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern. pic.twitter.com/bYQLDwW7jM — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) September 29, 2025 Notably, this setup includes three key points: a left shoulder formed on September 22–23, a lower dip that marks the head on September 26, and a right shoulder taking shape around September 29–30. The neckline, which connects the highs between these points, falls between $0.234 and $0.236. Price is testing that zone now. A strong move above the neckline, especially on higher volume, may confirm the pattern. If it plays out as expected, the projected target could be around $0.255 to $0.26. At the same time, recent price data shows that DOGE is still down slightly over the last 24 hours and 3% over the past week, suggesting that buyers haven’t taken full control yet. Falling Wedge Breakout on DOGE/BTC Another setup has appeared on the DOGE/BTC pair. Trader Tardigrade shared a chart showing two falling wedge formations. These patterns tend to lead to upside breakouts when the price squeezes into a tighter range. The first breakout happened in early September. A second wedge has just broken out again, which could set up another leg higher. On the chart, both wedges are marked clearly, with breakout points highlighted in green. This repeated setup has caught attention because of how similar the price structure looks in both cases. $Doge /$BTC 4-hour #Dogecoin pump could happen imminently pic.twitter.com/NAE4cK0W68 — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) September 29, 2025 These breakouts usually suggest that selling pressure is fading. If buyers step in with stronger volume, the asset could continue to climb in the short term. Past Price Action Adds Context In January 2021, Dogecoin jumped more than 400% in one day. It moved from about $0.007 to over $0.03 after trading flat for several days. Analyst Ali Martinez pointed out this spike, noting that sharp rallies in DOGE have followed quiet periods in the past. Data from CryptoQuant shows that periods dominated by taker sell volume in futures often line up with these sharp rallies. That was the case in both early 2021 and early 2025. In more recent months, that trend has shifted. Taker buy volume has taken over, especially from March through mid-2025. During that time, the price has moved from under $0.10 to above $0.25. Source: CryptoQuant Market Expects Dogecoin ETF Approval Traders on Polymarket placed the chances of a Dogecoin ETF being approved in 2025 at more than 99%. Source: Polymarket Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, commented on the timing of upcoming ETF decisions. He wrote : “Honestly the odds are really 100% now.” Consequently, this type of ETF news often attracts interest from both institutional and retail traders. Combined with pattern formations on charts and futures positioning, it may explain why more eyes are now on DOGE. The post Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Bullish Reversal?

The move follows the launch of a Solana treasury by the neurotech company in mid-September, which raised $500 million with the support of major players such as Summer Capital and Pantera Capital. In a press release issued on September 29, 2025, Helius Medical Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: HSDT) had filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State and amended the Second Amended and Restated Bylaws to reflect a change in the company name from Helius Medical Technologies, Inc. to Solana Company after receiving approval from its Board of Directors. The ticker symbol for the company’s Class A common stock, HSDT, will remain unchanged. Helius rebrands and collaborates strategically to enhance Solana’s growth Helius changed its name to better represent its goal of optimizing SOL per share on the Solana blockchain.

The vehicle includes $750M in stapled warrants, with potential to scale above $1.25B. pic.twitter.com/VxAXgDp44d — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) September 15, 2025 The report revealed that Helius and some of its investors signed a non-binding letter of intent with the Solana Foundation, outlining the main conditions of HSDT’s pledge to adhere to the Solana By Design terms. The conditions included conducting all on-chain activities exclusively on Solana (SOL), referring institutional partnerships, and collaborating to promote Solana’s capabilities through co-hosted events, institutional roundtables, and participation in Solana Foundation events. Helius Medical Technologies plans to implement its SOL token accumulation as part of its digital asset treasury strategy. It plans to utilize a portion of its $500 million PIPE fundraising to advance its digital asset treasury strategy. Solana Company uses SOL investments to strengthen its market position According to Dan Morehead, a strategic advisor at HSDT and the founder and managing partner of Pantera Capital, DATs will give a new type of investor access to the blockchain market. He stated that by presenting Solana to an expanding audience, Solana Company is well-positioned to become the leading SOL DAT. Cosmo Jiang, General Partner at Pantera Capital and Board Observer at HSDT, stated that the name Solana Company represents HSDT’s commitment to establishing a resilient organization that supports Solana’s growth. Solana DAT from HSDT will be a strong supporter of Solana’s growth.

Solana has processed over 23 billion transactions to date and has an average of roughly 3.7 million active wallets per day. The network is also the most widely used. In contrast to assets like Bitcoin (BTC), which are typically non-yield-bearing, SOL is designed to be financially productive, providing a native staking yield of ~7%. According to Solana Floor, Helius Medical Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: HSDT) announced an oversubscribed $500 million PIPE led by PanteraCapital and Summer Capital to form a Solana treasury business on September 15. With the potential to grow to over $1.25 billion, it was valued at $750 million, with attached warrants.

The Solana Company now holds over 760,190 SOL, with an average cost basis of $231. The Solana Company also holds in excess of $335 million of cash, which it intends to use to further the digital asset treasury strategy. Today, Solana’s native coin experienced a positive trade due to wider market recoveries. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by more than 2.7% over the last day to reach $3.9 trillion. SOL’s daily chart shows a 0.46% gain, and it is currently trading at $210.35. The 24-hour trading volume increased by 42.6%, indicating sentiment is rising as the altcoin attempts to recover from its decline from mid-September highs of over $250.

52465665,592309,1759219223,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52465665.jpeg,Bitcoin And Ethereum Funds Shed $1.1 Billion While Solana Investment Products Gain $291 Million – Report,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ethereum-1-1-billion-solana-291-million/,"According to a CoinShares report published earlier today, global crypto investment products related to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) experienced total outflows of $1.1 billion over the past week. In contrast, Solana (SOL) investment products attracted $291 million in inflows. Bitcoin, Ethereum Products Bleed While Solana Shines Crypto investment products experienced a total net outflow of $812 million over the past week, primarily driven by Bitcoin products, which incurred $719 million in weekly outflows. Ethereum followed with its investment products, losing funds worth $409.4 million. The report attributes the outflow in BTC and ETH investment products to the lower expectations of interest rate cuts this year, following the stronger-than-anticipated macroeconomic data in the US. Notably, the GDP and durable goods figures were revised to the upside, showing resilience in the economy. That said, cumulative month-to-date (MTD) inflows remain strong, hovering around the $4 billion mark. Similarly, the cumulative year-to-date (YTD) inflows stand at $39.6 billion, inching closer to last year’s record $48.6 billion inflows. Notably, BlackRock’s iShares spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) lost $68 million in funds. Meanwhile, Grayscale Investments’ GBTC ETF saw $300 million in outflows, while Fidelity’s FBTC witnessed outflows to the tune of $738 million. The report adds: Importantly, there was no commensurate increase in short-bitcoin investment product demand, suggesting that the negative sentiment was likely low-conviction and likely to prove temporary. In terms of countries, the US saw outflows to the tune of $1.03 billion, while Sweden-based crypto investment products lost $13.4 million in funds. On the contrary, Swiss products gained $126 million, while Canadian investment products attracted $58.6 million in inflows. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum investment products, Solana investment products shone as they attracted inflows worth $291 million. Even more impressive, Solana products have pulled in $1.8 billion worth of funds on a YTD basis. Besides the positive momentum in investment products, SOL is also seeing bullish price action as it steadily moves toward its all-time high (ATH) value of $293, recorded earlier this year in January. Analysts say that SOL’s recent positive price action can be attributed to the rising likelihood of spot SOL ETFs getting approved in the near term. A recent report remarked that SOL-based ETFs could be approved in as little as two weeks. Will Macroeconomic Factors Benefit Cryptocurrencies? Latest data from FedWatch gives an 68% probability of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) lowering interest rates by 50 basis points (bps) during its December 10 meeting. The rate cut is expected to benefit risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL. In addition, future lower-than-expected inflation readings may further encourage the Fed to slash interest rates on an even larger scale. At press time, BTC trades at $113,628, up 3.1% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto News|Altcoin|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto investment products|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|Ethereum|exchange-traded funds|SOL|solana,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|BTC|ETH|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-30 08:00:23

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Exactly In The Balance Right Now The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that measures the average sentiment present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: XRP Bounce Incoming? Analyst Targets $3–$3.15 After Support Holds The index uses the data of the following five factors to determine the investor mentality: volatility, trading volume, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. The metric represents the sentiment as a score lying between zero and hundred, where all values above 53 correspond to a sentiment of greed and those below 47 to one of fear. Its value being between these two thresholds implies a net neutral mentality. Besides these three regions, there are also two “extreme” zones called the extreme fear (below 25) and extreme greed (above 75). Historically, these two regions have held significance for Bitcoin and other digital assets, as tops and bottoms have occurred while the investors have held these sentiments. The relationship has been an inverse one, however, meaning extreme fear has been where bottoms have taken place, while extreme greed has facilitated top formations. Now, here is how the sentiment in the cryptocurrency sector is like at the moment, according to the Fear & Greed Index: As displayed above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has a value of 50 right now, which suggests the average trader sentiment is exactly in the balance. This is a change from how it was in the last few days, when the investors were fearful. From the chart, it’s visible that the indicator fell to a low of 28 just a few days ago, implying investor sentiment was deep in the fear zone, just shy from turning into extreme fear. The fearful mentality was a result of the crash in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers Nearly $1 Billion In Liquidations As Bitcoin Extends Decline Interestingly, since this peak in fear, BTC has regained footing and made some recovery. This could be an indication that the contrary effect of crowd sentiment may have once again come into play, despite the index not quite reaching extreme fear. With the market rebound, sentiment has quickly improved. But with it still being at neutral levels, the crowd is uncertain about where the asset would head next. It now remains to be seen how the investors will respond if the price recovery continues in the coming days. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $114,300, up more than 3% over the last seven days.

His analysis shows that while XRP has been recording higher highs in recent months, the sentiment index has been moving in the opposite direction, setting lower highs. This divergence was also in the 2020–2021 cycle, when XRP’s upward trend eventually reversed, triggering a sharp decline of over 70% from its peak. WARNING: #XRP FEAR & GREED INDEX IS DROPPING AS PRICE CLIMBS. THIS DIVERGENCE SIGNALLED THE TOP IN THE LAST BULL CYCLE. pic.twitter.com/rp3SkxuLRw — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 28, 2025 Technical Comparison of Past and Present In the shared charts, two periods are compared side by side. The 2020–2021 segment illustrates how XRP reached higher levels before falling by more than 71%, with the Fear and Greed Index clearly showing a weakening sentiment ahead of the decline. The current 2024–2025 chart reflects a nearly identical setup, with XRP’s price climbing to new highs while the sentiment index points downward. This resemblance to the earlier cycle is the central reason the analyst warns of potential risk. Fear and Greed Index Signals The Crypto Fear and Greed Index aggregates various factors to reflect overall market sentiment. According to the analyst’s chart, the index has been dropping even as XRP’s price has advanced, forming what technical analysts call a negative divergence. Historically, these divergences can indicate that momentum is fading beneath the surface of a rally. During the last cycle, such a signal preceded a reversal, and the concern now is whether the same outcome could follow. Market Reactions to the Analysis Some observers have echoed the warning. One user commenting on the analysis stated that price climbing while the Fear and Greed Index drops could serve as a cautionary sign. This perspective reflects the importance many traders place on sentiment indicators as confirmation of price moves. When sentiment does not align with rising valuations, confidence in the sustainability of the trend may weaken. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Broader Implications The analyst’s comparison does not imply certainty that XRP will repeat its 2021 collapse, but it underlines the need for careful monitoring of the market. Divergences between sentiment and price often precede periods of volatility, consolidation, or correction, though the exact outcome depends on multiple factors. Liquidity conditions, trading volume, macroeconomic influences, and regulatory developments can help shape how this setup unfolds. StephIsCrypto’s analysis presents a structured warning by indicating repeating signals in XRP’s chart history. The similarity between the current 2024–2025 pattern and the one that led to a sharp decline in 2021 is a factor traders are now considering. While not definitive on its own, the divergence between XRP’s higher highs and the Fear and Greed Index’s lower highs signals that caution may be warranted.

One trade here, a swap there, then suddenly you’ve got 200 transactions. Exhausting. And let’s be honest, nobody really wants to calculate all that by hand. By the way, governments are watching now. The United States, the United Kingdom, India, Canada, Australia, and Japan, among others, all treat crypto like a taxable asset. So what does that mean? Well, even if you got a “free” airdrop, or some staking income, or just swapped ETH for another token, it’s all taxable. Indeed, even minor transactions are subject to taxation. Ignore it? Risk audits, fines, or worse. Here’s the kicker: people aren’t just holding coins anymore. They’re staking, farming, diving into decentralized finance (DeFi), or flipping NFTs. All that adds extra layers of chaos to finances. Cool tech, messy taxes. Let’s pause for a second. How do you even track this across five wallets and three exchanges? Each move needs the price, cost, and local currency value. Sounds boring, feels impossible. That’s where crypto tax software sneaks in like a lifesaver. Connect your wallets, let it import your transactions, and it crunches the numbers for you. Instead of endless spreadsheets, you get neat reports that actually fit your country’s rules. Bottom line? In today’s regulated world, you can’t just shrug off taxes. But with the right tool, it doesn’t have to be a headache. Enter crypto tax software. Main Takeaways: Governments worldwide treat crypto as taxable. The rules differ by country, but they generally cover sales, swaps, staking, mining, and airdrops. Tracking transactions manually is very challenging and can result in errors. Crypto tax software automates data collection, applies rules specific to a jurisdiction, and generates ready-to-file reports. Key features to look include support for DeFi, multi-exchange integration, local tax compliance, strong data security, and more. Leading tools like Koinly, CoinLedger, and others, help users save time, reduce mistakes, and stay compliant. What is a Crypto Tax Software? Think of crypto tax software as a helper that makes crypto taxes less stressful. Instead of crunching numbers yourself, the software does the heavy lifting. You just link your wallets or exchanges and let it pull in your data. It grabs everything: your trades, swaps, staking activity, and even NFT sales. No digging through spreadsheets. Each transaction gets converted into your local currency using past exchange rates. Then comes the tax part. Every country has its own rules. Some refer to it as capital gains, others consider it income. The software figures that out and shows what you might owe. The best part? Reports. In the U.S., it lines up with IRS forms like 8949. In the U.K., it works with HMRC’s capital gains rules. Elsewhere, you can still export clean summaries for your accountant. Honestly, crypto tax software just saves time, cuts errors, and makes the whole tax thing less painful.

But really, it just means you might owe tax on your crypto moves. Governments usually treat crypto like property, not money. Strange, I know, but that’s how the rules work. When does tax apply? The quick answer is selling, swapping, mining, or even getting an airdrop. Think about it: have you ever sold Bitcoin for more than you bought it for? That’s a taxable profit. For example, if you buy BTC at $20k and sell it at $30k, the $10k counts as taxable. Additionally, mining, staking, and airdrops typically constitute taxable income. And yes, even gifting or transferring can trigger tax in some countries. Feels like a lot to track, doesn’t it? Missing details can make tax season way tougher. How Different Regions Tax Crypto Crypto taxes don’t look the same everywhere. Some places treat it like property, others treat it as income. Your country pretty much decides what counts as taxable, and the rules can be wildly different. Let’s check a few examples. The United States In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) doesn’t see crypto as money. It treats it like property. If you sell or swap, that’s a taxable event. The rate depends on how long you hold it. Mining, staking, or airdrops? Those count as income. People usually report them on Form 8949 and Schedule D. Additionally, there is a crypto question on the yearly tax return. The United Kingdom The United Kingdom is pretty similar. His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) charges Capital Gains Tax once your sales pass a certain allowance. If you mine, stake, or receive airdrops, some of that might be income too. Reporting happens through the Self Assessment system. Keeping neat records of your transactions is a must. The European Union Europe is a bit messy. Each country does its own thing. Germany, for example, doesn’t tax long-term holdings. Others use capital gains rules. But the EU wants more unity. Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations and the Directive on Administrative Cooperation 8 (DAC8) reporting laws are steps toward standardization. Canada Canada keeps things split. Occasional selling usually means capital gains tax. However, if you buy and sell frequently, it may be considered business income. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) expects clear records, dates, costs, and fair value of each transaction. Australia In Australia, crypto is property too. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) applies Capital Gains Tax on sales and swaps. If you’re mining, staking, or yield farming, the government sees that as income. Not just a side hustle, it counts. Some personal exemptions or small business relief can reduce the tax bill. Japan Japan takes a tougher approach. The National Tax Agency (NTA) treats crypto as miscellaneous income. The rates can climb above forty percent. Even crypto-to-crypto swaps and NFT sales are taxed. India India keeps it simple but strict. A flat thirty percent tax on all sales. Plus, a one percent deduction at source on transfers. And here’s the catch: you can’t offset one asset’s losses with another’s gains. So yeah, the rules are all over the place. That’s why tracking taxes by hand gets messy fast. Crypto tax software can save a lot of stress. Why You Might Need Crypto Tax Software Crypto is everywhere now, but tax rules are getting stricter all over the world. Mistakes can cost you fines or worse. That’s why some people turn to crypto tax software. It makes reporting way easier. Here are but a few reasons why you might want to consider using it. Less Mistakes I think, and I hope you will agree, that keeping track of every crypto transaction manually is just a pain . Exchanges don’t always give full info. Decentralized transactions make it even worse. Tax software pulls everything together and calculates taxes correctly, cutting down errors. Save Time Going through wallets and crypto exchanges manually can take hours. Software does it in minutes. You can finally breathe, or do something else useful. Follow the Rules Different countries, different rules. The software knows what each tax office wants. IRS, HMRC, CRA, ATO, it covers them. See Your Portfolio Clearly Some platforms show gains, losses, and income in real time. This makes it easier to see if you’re on track or messing up somewhere. Less Stress During Tax Season Taxes stress people out. Software spits out ready-to-file forms. Some even link to TurboTax or government sites directly. Keep Up with New Crypto Uses Staking, NFTs, and liquidity pools can be confusing, but software keeps up, so your numbers stay correct. Handle Multiple Countries If you live in one country but work in another, taxes get tricky. The right software handles it, so you don’t have to guess. Plan Ahead Knowing what you owe early helps you budget. It also stops nasty surprises at year-end. Ultimately, crypto taxes are changing fast. Using software isn’t just convenient, it’s almost necessary for peace of mind and smart wealth management. How Crypto Tax Software Actually Works? Well, think of it as a data collection and aggregation tool, which can also do complex calculations based on predetermined information. For instance, if you choose the right crypto tax software, it will pull the information from your exchange account (or whatever other account API you connect), make the necessary calculations to determine the net outcome of your trading activities, and then turn this into an actionable, accountable report. Some even go a step further and tell you exactly how much taxes you owe, although I would stay on the side of caution and consult with a local accountant on that. But to summarize, crypto tax software: Tracks everything automatically : Swaps, trades, NFT sales, staking, and transfers, all your transactions get pulled together. Links your wallets and exchanges : Just use API keys or CSV files. The software imports your data so you don’t have to. Detects internal transfers : Moving crypto between your own wallets? It spots them to avoid double-counting or errors. Applies the right tax rules : Countries use methods like FIFO, LIFO, or average cost. The software uses the method your country requires. Generates ready-to-file reports : Reports follow rules from authorities like the IRS or HMRC, so you’re compliant. Key Features to Look For in Crypto Tax Software Here are the key features to look out for when choosing a crypto tax software: Multi-Exchange and Wallet Integration Most users have crypto assets in various wallets and crypto exchanges. So, using a tax software that allows users to integrate APIs and upload CSV files. This way, the user saves themselves hours of manually uploading and sorting this data. Support for Different Transaction Types Crypto isn’t just about trading. The crypto market supports swaps, staking, NFTs, and DeFi, all of which require tracking. A good crypto tax software should enable support for taxation on these different services. Jurisdiction-Specific Reporting Each country has its tax rules. A good crypto tax software should produce reports that align with the local tax authorities, be it the IRS, HMRC, or others. Clear Income and Capital Gains Classification According to the tax rules of various countries, crypto income is taxed differently from capital gains. For this reason, anyone looking for crypto tax software needs to select one that makes the necessary demarcation. This way, they ensure that staking rewards, airdrops, and sales are handled correctly. Data Security and Privacy You can connect sensitive accounts to these platforms. Encryption, read-only API keys, and robust privacy measures safeguard your financial data. Easy Export and Filing Options Reports should be easily exportable for accountants or direct filing. Using tax software with this feature makes the process easy. Intuitive Design and Support An intuitive dashboard makes navigation easy. Helpful tutorials, documentation, and customer support reduce filing mistakes.

Still, it is evident that clearer regulations and smarter tools will play key roles in determining how various countries approach the matter. Presently, government authorities in various countries are defining how taxes apply to gains, income, and transfers. This helps to reduce confusion for retail and institutional users. International efforts, such as the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework, aim to standardize tax rules across borders. This will potentially make compliance easier for people with crypto holdings in various countries. Undoubtedly, these tax regulations will take time because the crypto market features broad sectors like DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. Existing and future tax software tools will need to employ the technology required to automatically track these on-chain activities and apply local rules accurately. As a result, real-time tax tracking may become more common, enabling users to prepare for liabilities well before filing deadlines. While at it, these software tools should prioritize their users’ security and privacy. This way, users are assured of encrypted usage and strict protection of sensitive financial data. At the same time, they benefit from the transparency common to the crypto market when managing their portfolios. Will crypto tax software tools ever integrate with banks and accounting systems? If they do, such collaboration will benefit all parties involved (that is, individuals and businesses). Frequently Asked Questions What is crypto tax software? A crypto tax software is a tool that collects all your transaction data, produces the net outcome of the result, and calculates how much tax you have to pay on it. Some tools generate a report that you can file directly with your tax authorities, while others produce one that you can submit to your accountants. What is the best software for crypto taxes? The best software for crypto taxes would largely depend on what you need. For example, if you want a tool that calculates your taxes based on your jurisdiction, Koinly might be a very good option. Can I file my own crypto taxes? Yes, you absolutely can file your own crypto taxes. In fact, most people do. Depending on which country you live, this could be a bit more challenging as there might be more documents to file, but overall – it is pretty straightforward. Do you have to pay taxes on crypto if you reinvest? What you reinvest in isn’t relevant, but it’s important whether you make gains or losses on the sale of crypto – that’s what’s taxable. On order to know how much tax you will have to pay, you need to calculate your capital gains or losses. If you sell Bitcoin to buy Ethereum, you might still need to pay taxes if you’ve sold it at higher prices than you bought it. Do I need to report crypto if I lost money? Depending on the jurisdiction, you might have to report allsales and disposals of crypto. In the US, if you neglect to report the losses you’ve realized, you will not be able to use them to offset capital gains or income. Conclusion Crypto tax software gives users the opportunity to enjoy their crypto adventure while ensuring compliance with the appropriate tax authority. This article discussed seven tools that offer diverse features. With these tools, users can save their time, reduce human mistakes, and stay relaxed and coordinated during tax season.

Bitcoin has now returned to the middle of a range-bound channel that formed in early July. However, it must break above $117,500 before there is any chance of a real ‘Uptober’ liftoff. Ethereum Recovers Well Ether is also in recovery mode, reclaiming $4,200 during late Monday trading, though it had dipped below that level at the time of writing. ETH is also back in its channel and is eyeing higher levels following last week’s flushout. The massive news that Ethereum software firm Consensys is supporting SWIFT with early-stage blockchain prototyping will also be bullish for the asset. “If ETH wants to make its way back to the range high, I want to see $4,350 flipped.

The industry has matured into two distinct paths: industrial-scale mining farms powered by renewable energy and automation, and do-it-yourself (DIY) setups at home where enthusiasts build rigs from scratch. Each approach comes with unique challenges, costs, and profit potential. Understanding the trade-offs is crucial for anyone entering the space this year. At the center of this debate stands ETNCrypto , a leader in cloud-based industrial mining that offers everyday investors access to professional rigs without requiring massive upfront capital. With transparent contracts and renewable-powered operations, ETNCrypto bridges the gap between industrial efficiency and DIY flexibility. Let’s break down the pros, cons, and outlook of both strategies—while examining how ETNCrypto compares to today’s top competitors. ETNCrypto: Industrial Power Made Accessible ETNCrypto takes the strengths of industrial mining—high efficiency, advanced hardware, and renewable energy—and makes them accessible through easy-to-buy mining contracts. Instead of spending thousands on hardware and electricity, users can buy contracts starting as low as $100. This model provides short-term, predictable ROI while avoiding the headaches of setup, noise, and maintenance. For 2025, ETNCrypto has positioned itself as the #1 mining choice for investors seeking profitability without risk. With flexible contract durations and ASIC rigs located in optimized facilities, it ensures consistent income regardless of Bitcoin’s volatility. 👉 Begin your industrial-powered journey with ETNCrypto today. DIY Bitcoin Mining: The Enthusiast’s Choice DIY mining still appeals to hobbyists who want full control over their rigs. It allows miners to choose their hardware, manage electricity sources, and even switch coins if conditions change. The downside is complexity—configuring software, cooling systems, and managing electricity bills is not simple. Moreover, the post-halving profitability window is narrow, and beginners may struggle to achieve ROI. Cleanspark Cleanspark is one of the largest publicly traded industrial miners in the U.S., with major investments in renewable energy. While powerful, it is primarily structured for institutional and stock market investors. Retail users don’t get the same direct benefits as with ETNCrypto’s contracts. Quantumcloud Quantumcloud focuses on decentralized cloud mining by turning idle GPU power into hashing potential. While creative, GPU mining is far less profitable after Ethereum’s merge, making its model weaker than ETNCrypto’s ASIC-driven system. Easyminer.net Easyminer offers open-source software for hobbyist miners who want to set up rigs on their own. It’s free and customizable, but it lacks the scale, professional-grade efficiency, and guaranteed daily ROI that ETNCrypto delivers. Braiins Braiins, the team behind Slush Pool, provides advanced mining firmware and management tools. It’s ideal for industrial miners who already own hardware, but it doesn’t help everyday investors without rigs. ETNCrypto fills that gap by offering direct profit participation. BitFuFu BitFuFu partners with Bitmain to provide large-scale cloud mining. While credible, it tends to focus on long-term contracts, which may not be flexible enough for investors wanting quick ROI. ETNCrypto’s short-term contracts make it more adaptable. StormGain StormGain integrates crypto trading and mining via a mobile-first app. It’s beginner-friendly, but its free mining option is limited and far less profitable compared to ETNCrypto’s transparent rig-based plans. Industrial Mining: Pros and Cons Pros: Massive scale with lower energy costs. Access to advanced ASIC rigs like the Antminer S21 series. Professional management and uptime optimization. Better resilience to Bitcoin halving. Cons: Requires millions in infrastructure if done independently. Higher centralization risk, as power is concentrated in large farms. Usually inaccessible to retail investors—except through services like ETNCrypto. DIY Mining: Pros and Cons Pros: Full control over hardware, software, and pool choice. Ability to repurpose rigs for altcoins if Bitcoin mining slows. Community-driven learning experience. Cons: High upfront hardware costs ($5,000–$15,000 per rig). Expensive electricity bills, especially outside renewable-friendly regions. Noise, heat, and technical complexity. Slower ROI compared to industrial-scale setups. ETNCrypto Mining Rig Plans Here’s what makes ETNCrypto especially appealing: transparent, short-term contracts using professional ASIC rigs. Mining Rig Contract Price Contract Period Daily Profit Total Net Profit Daily ROI Antminer S19 XP【Free】 $100 1 Day $1.50 $1.50 1.50% Antminer T21 $200 2 Days $6.00 $12.00 3.00% Antminer Z15 Pro $600 3 Days $19.20 $57.60 3.20% Antminer S21 Pro $1,300 5 Days $45.50 $227.50 3.50% VolcMiner D1 Lite $3,500 6 Days $133.00 $798.00 3.80% Antminer S21+ Hyd $8,000 3 Days $336.00 $1,008.00 4.20% VolcMiner D1 $17,800 5 Days $854.40 $4,272.00 4.80% Antminer L9 $36,000 6 Days $2,088.00 $12,528.00 5.80% Antminer S21e XP Hyd 3U $68,000 5 Days $5,440.00 $27,200.00 8.00% These plans combine the industrial strength of ASIC mining with the accessibility of cloud contracts—something neither DIY rigs nor most industrial players can provide at scale. Profit Outlook for 2025 As Bitcoin adoption grows, the demand for mining remains strong. Industrial farms will thrive due to efficiency, but smaller players will face challenges unless they optimize costs. DIY miners will find it increasingly difficult to compete against industrial-scale farms, especially after the 2025 halving reduces block rewards. That said, investors who want exposure without running their own rigs have a clear winner: ETNCrypto. By leveraging short-term contracts, renewable energy, and industrial-grade ASICs, it provides steady ROI while avoiding the pitfalls of both DIY and traditional large-scale mining. Final Thoughts The mining landscape of 2025 is all about efficiency and adaptability. Industrial mining offers power but demands scale, while DIY rigs offer independence but come with high risks and costs. For everyday investors, the best option is neither extreme—it’s cloud-based contracts that merge industrial strength with accessibility. ETNCrypto has established itself as the #1 mining solution for this new era, giving investors the chance to enjoy professional-level profits without the burdens of setup, maintenance, or energy bills. As halvings reduce rewards and competition grows, ETNCrypto remains the most reliable path to passive income from Bitcoin mining.
