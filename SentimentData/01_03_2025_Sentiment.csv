This represented a 57% drop from its highest value this year. However, the cryptocurrency rebounded to $145 following a major purchase by SOL whales. Solana Price Stabilizes After Crash – Is a Rally to $180 Possible? Solana price saw a major decline, falling from its yearly peak of $295 to $126.15. This drop marked its lowest level since September 6. The decline also led to a breakdown below the $170 support level. Meanwhile, a Solana whale purchased $14 million worth of SOL, withdrawing it from Binance and staking the tokens. The accumulation occurred before a $1.75 billion token unlock, a typically bearish event. The purchase helped ease sell pressure and contributed to the slight SOL price recovery. Despite the rebound, Solana price remains below key resistance levels. If the bullish momentum continues, traders target the $170 level as a short-term target. A breakout beyond this level could push SOL toward the $180 mark. Meanwhile, according to a recent report, CME Group announced plans to introduce Solana (SOL) futures on March 17, subject to regulatory approval. This move positions Solana alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum as one of the few cryptocurrencies with futures trading on the platform. Market analysts suggest that the launch could strengthen the case for a potential Solana ETF in the future. Solana’s Total Value Locked Declines by Nearly 50% Solana’s total value locked (TVL) has dropped significantly in recent weeks. The TVL, which peaked at $12.19 billion, has now declined to $6.94 billion. The drop reflects lower investor confidence and reduced capital inflow into Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The decline in TVL has been linked to the crash of top Solana-based meme coins . The market cap of Solana meme coins fell from $25 billion in January to $8.9 billion. This shift in capital has negatively affected the Solana network’s liquidity and overall market position. While TVL remains under pressure, some Solana-based meme coins have started to recover. The overall DeFi activity on the network will be a key factor in determining the future movement of Solana price. Key Resistance Levels to Watch Solana price is approaching a critical resistance zone between $147.09 and $166.42. This area represents a fair value gap in the market. If SOL breaks above this range, it could signal a stronger recovery toward the $180 resistance level. Supporting the bullish move by SOL whales, technical indicators suggest increasing momentum in favor of buyers. The Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) indicator, displayed as dots above and below the price action, has shifted below the recent candles. This shift indicates a potential reversal from the previous downtrend. As long as the dots remain below the price, it suggests that buyers are in control, and the uptrend may persist. Source: TradingView Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator and its histogram reinforce this bullish outlook by SOL whales. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line, which is a classic bullish crossover indicating strengthening upward momentum. Additionally, the histogram bars have turned positive and are expanding, confirming buying pressure. If the momentum sustains, Solana price might break key resistance levels toward $180. More so, according to analysis, SOL price has shown signs of stabilization after crashing 40% and reaching extremely oversold levels. Historically, such deep RSI drops have often preceded price reversals, hinting that Solana price could regain upward momentum.

This week, all eyes were on the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) as they released the January core PCE price index data. Did it bring any surprises? Let’s dive into what this report means, especially for those navigating the crypto landscape. What is the Core PCE Price Index and Why Does it Matter? For those new to economic jargon, the core PCE price index might sound like another complicated term. But in reality, it’s a vital tool for understanding inflation and the overall health of the U.S. economy. Think of it as the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) favorite inflation thermometer. Here’s a breakdown: Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE): This measures the prices that people living in the United States, or those visiting the country, pay for goods and services. It’s a broad gauge of consumer spending. Core PCE: To get a clearer picture of underlying inflation trends, economists often strip out volatile categories like food and energy prices. These sectors can fluctuate wildly due to temporary supply shocks or seasonal changes, potentially masking the true inflationary pressures. The resulting metric is the core PCE price index . Why the Fed Cares: The Federal Reserve uses the core PCE price index as a primary benchmark for inflation. The Fed has a target inflation rate of 2%. Monitoring this index helps them decide on monetary policy, like adjusting interest rates, to keep inflation in check and maintain price stability. In essence, when you hear about the core PCE price index , think of it as a key indicator influencing the Federal Reserve’s decisions, which in turn can ripple through all markets, including cryptocurrency. Decoding the January Core PCE Data: What are Inflation Expectations? Now, let’s get to the numbers that were just released. The BEA reported that in January, the core PCE price index : Rose 0.3% from the previous month: This means that prices, excluding food and energy, increased by 0.3% in January compared to December. Increased 2.6% year-over-year: Looking at a longer timeframe, the index is up 2.6% compared to January of the previous year. Matched Market Expectations: Crucially, both these figures were in line with what economists and analysts had predicted, according to Investing.com. So, what does matching expectations mean? In the short term, it can be interpreted as a sign of stability. Markets generally react more dramatically to surprises. When data aligns with forecasts, it reduces uncertainty and can prevent sharp price swings. However, it also means that inflation expectations remain anchored around these levels. The Fed, and market participants, are still watching closely to see if inflation will continue to moderate towards the 2% target. Federal Reserve’s Inflation Gauge: How Core PCE Influences Policy The Federal Reserve inflation measure , particularly the core PCE, is not just a number; it’s a compass guiding the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. When the core PCE shows persistent inflation above the 2% target, the Fed often responds by: Raising Interest Rates: Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can cool down economic activity and reduce inflationary pressures. This is a primary tool the Fed uses. Quantitative Tightening: This involves the Fed reducing its holdings of government bonds and other securities, further tightening financial conditions. Forward Guidance: The Fed communicates its intentions and outlook to the public, influencing market expectations and behavior. Conversely, if the core PCE price index were to show a significant and sustained decline below the 2% target, the Fed might consider lowering interest rates or implementing other measures to stimulate economic growth and push inflation back up. In the context of the latest 0.3% rise, which is in line with expectations, it suggests that the Fed is likely to maintain its current stance. They will likely continue to monitor incoming data closely, including future US inflation data releases, before making any significant policy shifts. The ‘wait-and-see’ approach seems to be the prevailing strategy. Impact of Core PCE on the US Economy and Crypto Markets The US inflation data , reflected by the core PCE and other indicators, has broad implications for the entire economy and, by extension, the cryptocurrency market. Here’s how: Broader Economic Health: The core PCE is a reflection of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy. Stable and moderate inflation is generally seen as healthy. High or volatile inflation can erode purchasing power, create economic instability, and lead to tighter monetary policy. Interest Rate Sensitivity: Cryptocurrencies, while often touted as inflation hedges, are not immune to broader macroeconomic conditions. Rising interest rates can make riskier assets, like crypto, less attractive compared to safer, yield-bearing investments like bonds. Market Sentiment: Inflation data influences market sentiment. If inflation remains stubbornly high, it could lead to concerns about more aggressive interest rate hikes from the Fed, potentially dampening investor enthusiasm for risk assets, including crypto. Dollar Strength: Inflation and interest rate expectations can impact the value of the US dollar. A stronger dollar can sometimes exert downward pressure on crypto prices, especially when paired against USD. For crypto investors, keeping an eye on economic indicators like the core PCE is not just about understanding economic theory; it’s about making informed decisions in a market that is increasingly intertwined with traditional finance. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what can crypto enthusiasts and investors take away from this latest core PCE report? Stay Informed: Regularly monitor economic data releases, especially inflation indicators like the core PCE, CPI, and PPI. Understand how these reports can influence market sentiment and Fed policy. Diversify and Manage Risk: Economic uncertainty and potential interest rate hikes can increase market volatility. Diversification across different asset classes and prudent risk management strategies are crucial. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, maintain a long-term perspective on your crypto investments. Focus on the fundamental value and adoption potential of the projects you believe in. Understand Macroeconomic Context: The crypto market doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Understanding the broader macroeconomic environment, including inflation, interest rates, and economic growth, is essential for navigating market cycles. Conclusion: Navigating the Economic Landscape The January core PCE price index data, while meeting expectations, underscores the ongoing focus on inflation and the Federal Reserve’s delicate balancing act. For cryptocurrency investors, this report serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of the crypto market with the broader economy. By staying informed, understanding key economic indicators , and adapting to the evolving macroeconomic landscape, you can better navigate the exciting, yet often unpredictable, world of digital assets.

Ripple (XRP) price moves to defend $2 support as ETF approval edges closer Ripple (XRP) experienced significant volatility this week, influenced by impending inflationary pressures from tariffs set to commence on March 1. Early Friday, XRP’s price dipped to $1.95 during European trading hours. However, the U.S. trading session brought renewed momentum following CME Group’s announcement to introduce Solana futures contracts on March 17, pending regulatory approval. This development has sparked optimism for altcoin ETFs, leading to increased buying interest in XRP and other altcoins with pending ETF applications. XRP price action, Feb 28, 2025 | TradingView As a result, Ripple price rebounded by 5% within the day, reaching $2.14 at press time. While Solana, the main subject CME’s announcement, had its potential gains constrained by recent controversy surrounding Libra memecoin rug pull and impending 11.2 million SOL payouts from FTX Estate on March 1, investors have shifted focus to XRP, Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin ( LTC ), all of which have ETF applications under review. XRP open interest holds firm above $3B as traders anticipate ETF decision XRP swift rebound to $2.14 after testing a three-week low of $1.95 highlights a strong market intent to maintain the $2 support level. Trends observed within XRP’s derivatives markets on Friday further support this narrative Coinglass ‘ Open Interest data indicates that, despite a 24.4% price decline over the past five days—from $2.58 on Monday to $1.95 on Friday—XRP’s open interest only decreased by 19.3%, from $3.73 billion to $3.01 billion in the same period. XRP Open Interest vs. Price | Coinglass When prices decline at quicker rate than Open Interest, it typically suggests that many bullish traders are opting to increase their margin requirements rather than liquidate their long positions. This behavior aligns with recent developments, as many XRP speculative traders appear to be holding out for a favorable ETF decision, with approval odds seemingly increasing. Should XRP’s open interest remain above the $3 billion threshold observed this week, bearish forces may find it challenging to drive the price decisively below the $2 mark. In summary, XRP’s resilience above the $2 support, coupled with steadfast open interest levels and positive ETF-related news, suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency in the near term. XRP Price Forecast: Consolidation above $2 keeps bears at bay XRP price forecast remains neutral as the token consolidates above the critical $2 support level, signaling market indecision. The Bollinger Bands indicate contracting volatility, with price action oscillating around the mid-line, suggesting a potential breakout. A move above $2.50 would confirm bullish momentum, while a close below $2.10 could expose XRP to further downside risks. The MACD indicator leans bearish, with the signal line maintaining its downward slope, reflecting waning bullish momentum. The histogram prints shallow red bars, indicating diminishing selling pressure. However, if MACD flips positive, it could signal an early trend reversal favoring bulls. XRP Price Forecast Trading volume remains steady, with notable buying interest emerging after XRP’s 29% drop over the last eight days. This suggests that buyers are accumulating near key support levels. Should bulls sustain price action above $2.15, a rebound toward $2.50 remains on the table. However, a breakdown below $2 could accelerate losses toward the lower Bollinger Band at $1.95, placing bears in control. The coming sessions will determine whether XRP stabilizes or faces another leg down.

This will allow market participants to obtain futures contracts whose micro contracts amount to 25 SOL and typical contracts amount to 500 SOL and are settled in cash. The rollout expands CME Group’s existing offering of cryptocurrency derivatives, including Bitcoin and Ether Futures, which has attracted demand among institutional and retail investors looking to hedge their risk in the highly volatile digital asset market. By launching Solana futures, CME Group is reinforcing its commitment to offering an extensive range of regulated crypto investment products that meet the changing needs of market participants. It provides an alternative route, similar to holding shares in blue-chip technology companies, for traditional finance investors to gain exposure to the asset class without directly holding any of the assets, which is one of the leading blockchain networks. The group expects this measure to help attract new capital to crypto markets, enhance liquidity, and stabilize prices. However, listing Solana futures suggests a growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies after institutional interest in digital assets. Cash-settled contracts enable traders to bet on the price of Solana or hedge open positions inside a regulated framework, which may help bridge the gap between traditional finance and the emerging digital economy. Solana’s price surges following CME Futures announcement The price of Solana (SOL) soared by around 17% on February 28, jumping from around $125 to approximately $146, after the announcement of Solana (SOL) futures slated to go live in March. This sharp increase reflects renewed investor interest and optimism surrounding regulated derivatives for the asset. Source:Tradingview Nevertheless, SOL has held a robust downtrend for the entire month of February. Its price has lost 46% since the beginning of the month after going up to $233. Broader market conditions, traders’ booking profits, and overall macroeconomic trends that have influenced the crypto industry have spurred this continued downside price action. Currently, the SOL price is trading significantly below its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), an essential dynamic support level indicating the general direction of the long-term trend. If an asset trades below the 200DMA, that generally provides sentiment that traders are bearish on the asset. Moreover, according to technical indicators, SOL looks close to a price bottom. The relative strength index (RSI) now stands at 33, just above the oversold level 30. This level of RSI indicates that selling momentum may be running out of steam and is primed for a reversal if the buy-side interest returns. As the market digests the implications of CME Group’s Solana futures launch, investors will be keen to see if this trend brings new upward momentum to SOL’s price action or if wider market patterns continue to limit SOL prices. Fresh liquidity required for crypto market rebound Liquidity is to financial markets what oxygen is to a diver; the lifeblood for its survival and growth. Still, the absence of livelier inflows of new capital crystallized the crypto rally that originally gained a broader footing when United States President Donald Trump won reelection there. New money needs to come in for the price to be driven higher, but when that doesn’t occur, it leads to digital asset stagnation or corrections. In crypto, liquidity has historically been a key driver of market cycles. Therefore, Bitcoin is the most dominant and widely adopted cryptocurrency and will be the first to bring in money. When Bitcoin’s price increases, it typically increases institutional and retail investor confidence. As the price of Bitcoin rises, money usually starts flowing into large-cap altcoins like Ethereum and Solana, which are considered more stable but still offer a much better risk-return ratio than Bitcoin. Over time, when market participants demand greater gains, capital rotates further up the risk curve into mid-cap and smaller-cap altcoins. More volatile than equities, these assets tend to have more outsized returns in strong bull cycles. But that cascading effect is halted without new liquidity, and market rotations slow down, preventing any broad altcoin run. Under these dynamics, the crypto market’s ability to regain bullish momentum will rely on the inflow of new capital, whether from institutional adoption, regulatory developments, or macroeconomic news that keeps investors in a risk-on mode. Until then, the market will likely trade in periods of consolidation and range-bound volatility, with Bitcoin’s moves still setting the overall trend. According to Master Ventures founder Kyle Chassé, Bitcoin prices are collapsing because hedge funds and institutional investors looking to profit from the difference between spot BTC prices and futures prices are being squeezed out of that trade as the price difference narrows. Bitcoin’s uptrend needs new, organic buyers who truly believe in the asset, and institutional investors chasing yield alone may not be enough, said Chassé. However, a new research report from Matrixport claims that Bitcoin’s ongoing correction may last through at least April, given persistent macroeconomic headwinds.

This decline is part of a broader correction that began on January 16, following a peak of $3.40. Several factors contribute to this downward trend, including ongoing legal challenges, significant liquidations in the derivatives market, and broader market volatility. Legal Challenges and Market Sentiment The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, alleging unregistered securities sales. In August 2024, a federal judge ruled partially in favor of Ripple, imposing a $125 million fine—substantially less than the SEC’s initial $2 billion demand—and affirming that XRP is not a security for retail sales. Despite this, the SEC appealed the decision in October 2024, prolonging legal uncertainties that continue to impact investor confidence and XRP’s market performance. Derivatives Market Liquidations The recent price drop has been accompanied by significant liquidations in the derivatives market. Over the past 24 hours, approximately $25.5 million worth of XRP futures positions were liquidated, with long positions accounting for $22.2 million. This wave of liquidations indicates strong bearish pressure, as leveraged traders are compelled to exit their positions, further intensifying the downward momentum. Technical Analysis and Support Levels From a technical perspective, XRP’s price is approaching a critical support level at $2.00. This psychological threshold coincides with the lower boundary of a descending parallel channel. A decisive break below this support could trigger further declines, potentially targeting the recent low of $1.76 observed on February 3, and the $1.50 level, which aligns with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Conversely, maintaining support above $2.00 could provide a foundation for a potential recovery, contingent on improved market sentiment and resolution of legal uncertainties. Broader Market Context The overall cryptocurrency market has experienced heightened volatility, influenced by macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments. The global crypto market capitalization has decreased by 6.6%, reaching $2.66 trillion. Events such as significant security breaches and geopolitical tensions have contributed to a risk-averse environment, prompting investors to reassess their positions across various digital assets, including XRP. Conclusion XRP’s recent price decline is the result of a confluence of factors, including ongoing legal challenges with the SEC, substantial liquidations in the derivatives market, and broader market volatility. The critical support level at $2.00 serves as a pivotal point for traders and investors. A breach below this threshold could lead to further losses, while successful defense may pave the way for stabilization and potential recovery. Market participants are advised to monitor legal developments and market dynamics closely when making investment decisions related to XRP.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-28 23:55:00

This guide highlights four cryptocurrencies—Web3Bay (3BAY), Avalanche (AVAX), Polkadot (DOT), and Litecoin (LTC)—that stand out for their solid foundations, growing ecosystems, and practical applications, presenting them as the top bullish cryptos to buy for 100x returns. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY) – Pioneering Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay ’s 3BAY token is at the forefront of decentralized e-commerce, built for sustained value growth. It incorporates deflationary tactics, staking incentives, and governance participation, appealing strongly to investors. 3BAY’s deflationary approach gradually reduces token supply, enhancing scarcity and long-term appeal, a strategy that has benefited coins like Binance Coin (BNB) with substantial growth. Staking offers additional value, rewarding holders with passive earnings while bolstering network security. This encourages longer-term investment and stabilizes the token price. Governance voting allows token holders to shape Web3Bay’s strategic decisions, promoting a user-led platform ethos. Web3Bay is transforming online shopping by cutting out excessive transaction fees. Unlike traditional platforms such as eBay and Amazon, where sellers lose much to various fees, Web3Bay leverages smart contracts for direct transactions, minimizing disputes and eliminating chargebacks, creating a more equitable marketplace for both sellers and buyers. The presale of Web3Bay has already raised $1.57 million and is now in Stage 4, with 3BAY priced at $0.005247 and over 390 million tokens sold. As the presale progresses, the token price is set to rise, positioning early investors for potential significant gains. With a robust ecosystem and a compelling use case, Web3Bay is among the top bullish cryptos to buy for achieving 100x returns. 2. Polkadot (DOT) – Bridging Blockchains for Enhanced Interoperability Polkadot is engineered to connect various blockchains into a single network, facilitating smooth interactions and data sharing—a distinct edge over other cryptocurrencies. The strength of Polkadot stems from its parachain auction system, which drives competition and innovation by allowing projects to secure network slots. Its scalable nature makes it a preferred choice for developers keen on crafting cutting-edge applications. As blockchain integration deepens, Polkadot’s role in fostering inter-chain collaboration will become ever more vital. With robust technical foundations and ongoing ecosystem growth, DOT is poised for significant value appreciation, making it one of the top bullish cryptos to buy for 100x gains. 3. Avalanche (AVAX) – A Leader in High-Speed Smart Contract Execution Avalanche is renowned as one of the quickest and most scalable blockchains, with a distinctive consensus method and specialized subnets catering to various applications, attracting both developers and big businesses. Its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second affordably makes it a go-to for decentralized apps and DeFi initiatives. Its expanding network, reinforced by significant institutional partnerships, underscores its potential for long-term growth. AVAX’s pricing trends indicate strong future growth, particularly as its network continues to be adopted widely. If this demand persists, Avalanche could well be among the top bullish cryptos to buy for 100x returns in the near future. 4. Litecoin (LTC) – A Proven, Secure Digital Payment Method For over a decade, Litecoin has been a reliable cryptocurrency, facilitating quick and secure transactions. Often considered the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, LTC has demonstrated enduring value and continues to draw investors seeking dependable, yet potentially lucrative assets. Recent enhancements, such as the MimbleWimble privacy protocol, have boosted Litecoin’s security and utility. These developments enhance LTC’s appeal for those valuing quick, private transactions. With a growing number of merchants accepting Litecoin, its potential for price increases is substantial. Given its proven track record and ongoing improvements, Litecoin stands out as one of the top bullish cryptos to buy for investors aiming for 100x returns. Key Highlights! Identifying top bullish cryptos to buy with the potential for 100x returns involves a thorough examination of their applications, adoption rates, and technological advancements. Web3Bay (3BAY), Avalanche (AVAX), Polkadot (DOT), and Litecoin (LTC) each bring unique strengths that set them up for exponential growth. Whether through Web3Bay’s e-commerce innovations, Avalanche’s swift processing capabilities, Polkadot’s blockchain unification, or Litecoin’s reliable payment solutions, these projects possess the foundational qualities necessary for substantial returns. Investors considering cryptocurrencies for major gains should weigh these assets as key components of their portfolios.

He’s alerting his massive fanbase about fraudulent memecoins popping up using his name. But here’s the kicker: Ronaldinho himself is teasing the launch of his official token ! Crypto enthusiasts and football fans alike are buzzing – is this the next big celebrity memecoin sensation? Let’s dive into what we know and what to watch out for in this exciting, yet risky, crypto space. Ronaldinho’s Crypto Warning: Fake Memecoins Alert! In a direct message to his followers on X, Ronaldinho didn’t mince words. He clearly stated that while he appreciates the enthusiasm, he hasn’t launched any official token yet. This is crucial news because, as the popularity of celebrity-backed cryptocurrencies explodes, so does the prevalence of scams and fake tokens trying to capitalize on the hype. Here’s what Ronaldinho had to say: [blockquote] Stay tuned, big news coming soon… but be careful with fake tokens! [/blockquote] This statement serves as both a warning and a tantalizing hint. Ronaldinho is acknowledging the existing fake tokens bearing his name, protecting his fans from potential scams, and simultaneously building anticipation for his legitimate entry into the crypto market. The Allure of Celebrity Memecoins: Why the Hype? Why are celebrity memecoins such a hot trend right now? The answer lies in a potent mix of factors: Instant Brand Recognition: Celebrities like Ronaldinho come with built-in global recognition and massive fan bases. This instantly translates to potential users and investors for a memecoin. Community Engagement: Fans are eager to connect with their idols in new and innovative ways. A celebrity memecoin offers a sense of ownership and participation in their favorite star’s ventures. Viral Potential: The internet thrives on trends and memes. Combining a celebrity with a memecoin creates a recipe for virality, driving rapid adoption and price surges (at least initially). Financial Gains (Potential): Early investors in successful memecoins have seen astronomical returns. This ‘get-rich-quick’ allure is a significant driver, although highly risky. However, the celebrity memecoin space is also fraught with peril. The very factors that make them attractive – hype and virality – can also lead to dramatic crashes and rug pulls. This is why Ronaldinho’s warning is so timely and essential. Navigating the Risks: Spotting Crypto Scams and Fake Tokens Ronaldinho’s caution about fake tokens is a vital reminder of the risks involved in the crypto world, especially with memecoins. Here’s how you can protect yourself from crypto scams and identify fake tokens: Red Flag Actionable Insight Unofficial Channels: Token announcements only on unofficial social media or Telegram groups. Verify Information: Always check the celebrity’s official social media accounts and website for announcements. Cross-reference with reputable crypto news sources. Lack of Transparency: No whitepaper, roadmap, or team information available. Do Your Research (DYOR): Legitimate crypto projects provide detailed information about their project, goals, and team. If it’s missing, be extremely cautious. Unrealistic Promises: Guarantees of massive returns or instant wealth. Skepticism is Key: Crypto investments are inherently risky. Promises that sound too good to be true usually are. Pressure to Buy Quickly: Urgent calls to action and fear of missing out (FOMO) tactics. Take Your Time: Never rush into an investment decision. Scammers often use urgency to pressure victims. Suspicious Contract Address: Contract address doesn’t match official announcements or is from an unknown source. Verify Contract: If a contract address is provided, double-check its authenticity on blockchain explorers like Etherscan or BscScan and compare it to official sources. Ronaldinho Memecoin Launch: What Could It Look Like? While details are still scarce, Ronaldinho hinting at an official memecoin launch opens up exciting possibilities. What could we expect from a Ronaldinho-backed crypto project? Here are some speculative, yet plausible, features: Fan Engagement Platform: The memecoin could be integrated into a platform that offers exclusive content, NFTs, or experiences for Ronaldinho fans. Charitable Initiatives: A portion of the token’s transactions or proceeds could be directed towards Ronaldinho’s charitable foundations, adding a layer of social impact. Gaming and Metaverse Integration: Given Ronaldinho’s background, the memecoin could be linked to sports-related games or metaverse experiences. Community Governance: Token holders might get a say in certain aspects of the project, fostering a sense of community ownership. Of course, these are just speculations. The actual utility and features of Ronaldinho’s memecoin will depend on the project’s specifics, which are yet to be revealed. However, the potential for innovation and fan engagement is definitely there. Stay Tuned and Stay Safe: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts Ronaldinho’s announcement is a potent reminder to approach the crypto space with both excitement and caution. Here are some actionable insights to keep in mind: Follow Official Channels: Keep a close eye on Ronaldinho’s verified social media accounts for official announcements about his crypto project. DYOR (Do Your Own Research): Before investing in any cryptocurrency, especially memecoins, conduct thorough research. Understand the project, its team, and its risks. Start Small: If you decide to invest in Ronaldinho’s memecoin (or any memecoin), start with a small amount you can afford to lose. Security First: Use secure crypto wallets and be wary of phishing scams and fake websites. Patience is a Virtue: Wait for official launch details and avoid rushing into buying tokens based on rumors or hype. Conclusion: The Ronaldinho Memecoin Saga – A Thrilling Chapter in Crypto? Ronaldinho’s entry into the crypto world with a teased official token launch is undoubtedly a significant event. His warning about fake memecoins underscores the importance of vigilance in this volatile market. As we await further details, the crypto community is on the edge of its seat, wondering what ‘big news’ Ronaldinho has in store. Will his memecoin be a game-changer, or just another flash in the pan? Only time will tell. But one thing is certain: Ronaldinho’s foray into crypto adds another layer of excitement and intrigue to the ever-evolving world of digital currencies.

The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is known for its volatility, but the latest news surrounding Virtual Protocol is sending shockwaves. This innovative AI agent platform, designed to revolutionize blockchain-based AI monetization, has experienced a breathtaking Virtual Protocol Revenue plunge. Daily earnings have plummeted a staggering 96.8% from a peak of over $1 million in early January to less than $35,000 by late February. Let’s dive deep into what’s fueling this dramatic downturn and what it means for the future of AI in crypto. The Alarming DeFi Revenue Decline: Numbers Don’t Lie The data, sourced from Dune Analytics and highlighted by Cointelegraph, paints a stark picture of DeFi Revenue Decline for Virtual Protocol. Let’s break down the key figures: Peak Revenue (Jan 2nd): Over $1 million daily Current Revenue (Feb 27th): Below $35,000 daily Percentage Decline: 96.8% This isn’t just a minor dip; it’s a cliff dive. The sheer scale of the revenue reduction raises serious questions about the platform’s sustainability and the broader market sentiment towards AI and crypto integrations. The decline is especially pronounced on Ethereum layer-2 Base, a network that was expected to be a growth engine for Virtual Protocol. Metric Jan 2nd (Peak) Feb 27th (Current) Change Daily Revenue >$1,000,000 -96.8% The table above clearly illustrates the severity of the DeFi Revenue Decline . For ten consecutive days leading up to February 27th, revenue on Base has languished below $1,000. This consistent underperformance on a key network is a major red flag. Base Network Crypto Struggles: What Went Wrong? Why is Base Network Crypto experiencing such a sharp downturn for Virtual Protocol? Base, an Ethereum layer-2 solution, was designed to offer lower transaction fees and faster speeds, making it attractive for DeFi applications. Several factors could be contributing to this disappointing performance: Reduced User Activity: A significant drop in user engagement on the Virtual Protocol platform on Base. Shifting Market Trends: Changing investor preferences or a move away from AI-focused crypto projects. Increased Competition: The emergence of rival platforms offering similar AI and blockchain monetization solutions on Base or other networks. Tokenomics Issues: Potential flaws in the Virtual Protocol tokenomics that are disincentivizing user participation or revenue generation on Base. It’s crucial to analyze these potential causes to understand if the issues are specific to Virtual Protocol’s implementation on Base Network Crypto , or if they reflect broader challenges within the Base ecosystem or the AI crypto niche itself. Blockchain AI Monetization: Solana Expansion – A Lifeline? In an attempt to mitigate the revenue slump, Virtual Protocol expanded its reach to Solana, another prominent blockchain known for its speed and scalability. The hope was that the Solana ecosystem could provide a fresh stream of users and revenue, offsetting the losses on Base. However, the initial results of this Blockchain AI Monetization strategy on Solana appear underwhelming. While expansion to new networks is generally a positive step, the numbers reveal a significant disparity in adoption: Solana Wallets Holding Virtuals Tokens: 11,000 Base Wallets Holding Virtuals Tokens: 170,000 The stark contrast in wallet numbers indicates that the Solana community has been slower to embrace Virtual Protocol compared to the Base community. This limited adoption on Solana means that, at least in the short term, it is unlikely to compensate for the substantial DeFi Revenue Decline experienced on Base. The Future of AI Crypto Platform Revenue: Is There Hope for Recovery? The dramatic revenue plunge raises critical questions about the sustainability of the AI Crypto Platform model and Virtual Protocol’s future. While the current situation looks bleak, it’s important to consider potential paths to recovery and growth: Platform Enhancements: Virtual Protocol could introduce new features, improve user experience, or refine its AI agent functionalities to attract more users and revenue. Community Engagement: Actively engaging with the community, addressing concerns, and building stronger relationships with users and developers could revitalize interest. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with other projects or platforms within the AI and crypto space could unlock new opportunities and revenue streams. Market Recovery: A broader market upturn in the crypto sector could lift all boats, including Virtual Protocol, and potentially boost revenue. However, without significant changes or a major shift in market sentiment, the current trajectory suggests a challenging road ahead for Virtual Protocol. The 96.8% revenue drop is a stark reminder of the risks and volatility inherent in the crypto world, especially for projects in emerging niches like AI Crypto Platform development. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for AI and DeFi Virtual Protocol’s staggering revenue decline serves as a potent wake-up call for both the AI and DeFi sectors. It highlights the challenges of building sustainable revenue models in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape and underscores the importance of user adoption, community engagement, and continuous innovation. While the future remains uncertain for Virtual Protocol, its story offers valuable lessons for other projects navigating the complexities of blockchain-based AI monetization. The dramatic Virtual Protocol Revenue plunge is a stark reminder that even promising projects can face sudden and severe downturns in the volatile crypto market. Investors and developers alike should heed this warning and prioritize robust strategies for long-term sustainability and growth.

40981249,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135503,1740787885,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent Warning: Bitcoin ETF Sales Could Trigger Terrifying BTC Crash, Says Peter Schiff",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-sales-crash-warning/,"Is the Bitcoin dream turning into a nightmare? Just when the crypto world was celebrating the Bitcoin ETF approvals, a chilling voice of caution has emerged. Peter Schiff, the CEO of Euro Pacific Capital and a notorious Bitcoin skeptic, has dropped a bombshell, suggesting that the very ETFs that were hailed as Bitcoin’s saviors might just trigger its downfall. Let’s dive deep into Schiff’s alarming prediction and understand what it could mean for your crypto portfolio. Decoding Peter Schiff’s Dire Bitcoin Crash Prediction Peter Schiff, known for his bearish stance on Bitcoin and preference for gold, didn’t mince words in his recent X (formerly Twitter) post. He argues that Bitcoin speculators, possibly caught up in the recent hype and going “all-in” above the $100,000 mark (a hypothetical future price point mentioned in his commentary), may have exhausted their funds. This leaves them vulnerable and unable to “buy the dip” if prices fall. His tweet essentially suggests: Speculator Exhaustion: Schiff believes many Bitcoin investors are overextended, having invested heavily at higher price levels, anticipating further gains fueled by ETF inflows. ETF Sales as Catalyst: He posits that if Bitcoin ETFs experience significant outflows or sales, it could initiate a downward spiral in BTC price. These sales would add selling pressure in the market. Deeper Crash Risk: The combination of exhausted buyers and ETF-driven selling pressure, according to Schiff, could lead to a more substantial and painful Bitcoin crash than many anticipate. Here’s the tweet that set the crypto community abuzz: While Schiff’s skepticism towards Bitcoin is well-documented, his warnings often resonate with a segment of the market that fears a potential crypto bubble burst. But is there any merit to his latest prediction? Let’s analyze the factors at play. The Double-Edged Sword of Bitcoin ETFs: Benefits and Risks Bitcoin ETFs were celebrated as a landmark achievement for the crypto industry, promising to open Bitcoin investment to a wider audience, particularly institutional investors who prefer regulated and traditional investment vehicles. And they have indeed brought significant inflows into the Bitcoin market. However, like any financial instrument, they come with their own set of potential risks: Benefits of Bitcoin ETFs Potential Risks of Bitcoin ETFs Increased Accessibility for Retail and Institutional Investors Market Volatility Amplification due to ETF trading Legitimization of Bitcoin as an Asset Class Potential for large outflows to exacerbate price drops Improved Liquidity in the Bitcoin Market Dependence on ETF market sentiment; influenced by broader financial markets Simplified Investment Process through Traditional Brokerage Accounts Regulatory scrutiny and potential changes in ETF rules As you can see, while Bitcoin ETFs offer numerous advantages, the risk of ETF sales triggering price declines is a valid concern. If investors, especially large institutional holders, decide to reduce their Bitcoin ETF holdings, it could inject significant selling pressure into the market, potentially leading to a BTC price correction. Could ETF Sales Really Trigger a Bitcoin Crash? Examining the Scenarios To understand if ETF sales could indeed lead to a Bitcoin crash , let’s consider a few scenarios: Profit Taking: Investors who bought into Bitcoin ETFs early might decide to take profits after a price surge. Large-scale profit-taking could lead to ETF outflows and downward pressure on the BTC price . Broader Market Downturn: If traditional financial markets experience a correction or recession, investors might reduce risk across their portfolios, including selling off Bitcoin ETFs . This correlation with traditional markets is a newly introduced factor with the advent of ETFs. Regulatory Concerns: Unexpected negative regulatory news or actions related to cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin ETFs could spook investors and trigger ETF sales, leading to a Bitcoin crash . Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events or economic shocks could trigger widespread panic selling across all asset classes, including Bitcoin and related ETFs. It’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs , while bringing in new capital, also introduces new dynamics and potential vulnerabilities. The extent to which ETF sales can impact the BTC price is still being observed and analyzed. Peter Schiff’s Perspective: A Contrarian View or a Valid Warning? Peter Schiff has consistently been a vocal critic of Bitcoin, arguing that it is a speculative bubble and lacks intrinsic value. His warnings should be viewed in the context of his long-held beliefs. However, even if we disagree with his overall stance, it’s prudent to consider the potential risks he highlights. Schiff’s perspective serves as a valuable contrarian viewpoint in a market often dominated by bullish narratives. His emphasis on the potential for ETF sales to trigger a Bitcoin crash encourages investors to consider the downside risks and not just focus on the potential for continued price appreciation. Navigating the Volatility: Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Investors So, what should Bitcoin investors do in light of Peter Schiff’s warning and the inherent volatility of the crypto market? Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk. Manage Your Risk: Invest only what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrencies are high-risk assets, and price corrections are a normal part of the market cycle. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and expert opinions, both bullish and bearish. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider DCA, which involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, reducing the impact of short-term price volatility. Have a Strategy: Define your investment goals and risk tolerance. Have a clear strategy for buying, selling, and holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: Heeding the Warning Signs in the Bitcoin Market Peter Schiff’s warning about Bitcoin ETF sales potentially triggering a Bitcoin crash is a stark reminder of the inherent risks in the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin ETFs have brought positive developments, they also introduce new dynamics and potential vulnerabilities. Whether Schiff’s specific prediction comes to pass remains to be seen, but his cautionary words serve as a valuable check against excessive optimism and encourage a more balanced and risk-aware approach to Bitcoin investment. The crypto market is known for its wild swings, and periods of exuberance are often followed by corrections. Staying informed, managing risk effectively, and considering diverse perspectives are crucial for navigating the volatile world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Don’t dismiss warnings outright; instead, use them as opportunities to re-evaluate your strategy and prepare for potential market shifts.

40981297,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135509,1740788091,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Revelation: Bitcoin Traders Face Steepest Unrealized Losses Since FTX Disaster,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-traders-face-losses-ftx/,"Are you holding Bitcoin and feeling a knot in your stomach? You’re not alone. Recent data reveals a potentially alarming trend for Bitcoin investors. CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno has dropped a bombshell on X, highlighting that Bitcoin traders are currently grappling with significant unrealized losses . In fact, these losses have plummeted to a staggering -18.86%, marking the most substantial downturn since the infamous FTX collapse in November 2022. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto landscape. Why are Bitcoin Traders Experiencing Such Heavy Unrealized Losses? To understand the gravity of the situation, it’s crucial to grasp what “unrealized losses” signify. Essentially, these are losses that exist on paper. If you bought Bitcoin at a higher price than its current market value, you’re sitting on an unrealized loss. It only becomes ‘realized’ when you sell your Bitcoin at a loss. So, why are Bitcoin traders facing such deep unrealized losses now? Several factors could be at play: Market Correction: The crypto market is known for its volatility. After periods of upward momentum, corrections are natural. This could be a phase where the market is simply cooling off after a run-up. Broader Economic Concerns: Global economic uncertainties, inflation worries, and interest rate hikes often impact risk-on assets like Bitcoin. When traditional markets wobble, crypto markets often feel the tremors even more intensely. Negative News & Sentiment: Any negative news, regulatory concerns, or bearish predictions can quickly dampen market sentiment and trigger price drops, leading to increased unrealized losses . Whale Activity: Large Bitcoin holders (whales) making significant moves can also influence market prices, sometimes leading to sharp declines and increased losses for smaller traders. Unrealized Losses vs. The FTX Collapse: What’s the Connection? The comparison to the FTX collapse is particularly concerning. The FTX debacle was a catastrophic event that sent shockwaves through the entire crypto industry. It eroded trust, triggered massive sell-offs, and led to a significant crypto market downturn . The fact that unrealized losses are now mirroring levels seen during that period suggests a potentially serious situation. Let’s put this into perspective: Event Unrealized Losses (Bitcoin Traders) Market Sentiment Market Reaction Current Situation (Reported by CryptoQuant) -18.86% Cautious to Bearish Price Correction, Increased Volatility FTX Collapse (November 2022) Similar Levels (-18.86% or higher) Extreme Fear, Panic Massive Sell-offs, Market Crash As you can see, the current level of unrealized losses is a stark reminder of a period of extreme market stress. While it doesn’t necessarily mean we’re heading for another FTX-level event, it’s a red flag that demands attention. Is This a Crypto Market Downturn or Just a Temporary Dip? The million-dollar question on everyone’s mind is: are we entering a prolonged crypto market downturn , or is this just a temporary dip? Predicting the future of the crypto market is notoriously difficult, but we can analyze the indicators: On-Chain Data: Metrics like exchange flows, active addresses, and miner activity can provide clues about the overall health and direction of the market. Technical Analysis: Chart patterns, moving averages, and other technical indicators can help identify potential trend reversals or continuations. Fundamental Analysis: Evaluating the underlying technology, adoption rates, and real-world use cases of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offers a long-term perspective. Market Sentiment: Keeping an eye on news headlines, social media sentiment, and fear & greed indices can gauge the prevailing market mood. Currently, the -18.86% unrealized losses figure suggests caution. It indicates that a significant portion of Bitcoin traders are underwater on their investments. Whether this translates into a deeper downturn depends on how the market reacts in the coming days and weeks. Navigating Investment Risk in a Volatile Bitcoin Market For anyone involved in cryptocurrency, understanding and managing investment risk is paramount. The current situation with Bitcoin traders facing substantial unrealized losses underscores the inherent risks of this asset class. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate these turbulent waters: Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes to mitigate risk. Risk Management: Determine your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider DCA – investing a fixed amount at regular intervals. This can help smooth out volatility. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, analysis, and on-chain data. Knowledge is your best defense in a volatile market. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency markets are cyclical. Focusing on the long-term potential of Bitcoin and blockchain technology can help you weather short-term storms. The current level of unrealized losses for Bitcoin traders is undoubtedly a cause for concern, mirroring the market conditions seen during the FTX collapse. While it’s impossible to predict the future with certainty, this data point serves as a critical reminder of the volatility and investment risk inherent in the crypto market.

Will They Stage a March Recovery?,https://bitzo.com/2025/03/shina-inu-shib-and-dogecoin-doge-locate-vital-support-levels-will-they-stage-a-march-recovery,"The recent price action of Shina Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) shows that they are finding key support zones. These support levels could be crucial for determining their next moves. Coin enthusiasts and investors are keen to see if March will bring a turnaround. This article delves into whether these cryptos are poised for a comeback. Shiba Inu Price Volatility and Key Levels Shiba Inu experienced a sharp drop of about 26.6% in the past month, while the six-month decline is more subdued at nearly 4.7%. Price action appears turbulent in this short-term period, indicating increased selling pressure and a weaker market stance. Historical trends reflect a swing that contrasts rapid short-term drops with a milder longer-term sentiment. Current price moves between approximately 0.0000158 and 0.0000235 dollars, with immediate resistance around 0.0000281 dollars and support near 0.0000127 dollars. Bears dominate given the negative indicators and declining momentum, yet the price remains contained between these levels. Traders might consider trading within this range, looking for potential reversals close to the support level. Upward Momentum Amid Short-Term Setbacks in Dogecoin Last month, Dogecoin experienced a significant drop of nearly 42%. However, over the past six months, the coin has shown an impressive gain of 83%, indicating a long-term recovery trend despite recent fluctuations. The past half-year has been marked by volatility, with investors observing substantial price movements. This performance suggests a potential rebound phase, encouraging a closer examination of market conditions and sentiment surrounding Dogecoin. Current levels for Dogecoin are between $0.28 and $0.41, with immediate support at $0.23 and resistance around $0.49. Although bears are active after a 27% drop last week, indicators such as an oversold RSI suggest a possibility of buying interest. Traders may consider entering positions near support levels while monitoring resistance to assess any potential trend reversal. Conclusion SHIB and DOGE have identified key support levels. These points will be crucial in guiding potential price rebounds. If the current support holds, the coins might see a recovery in March. However, breaking below these supports could lead to further declines. Traders should watch these levels closely to gauge the next moves Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Are you ready for another sign that institutional adoption of Bitcoin is accelerating? Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently dropped a bombshell on X: BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has included its spot BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) in one of its model portfolios for the very first time. While the initial allocation might be modest, this move is a significant indicator of how traditional finance is increasingly embracing Bitcoin. Let’s dive into what this strategic decision by BlackRock could mean for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Why is BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Model Portfolio Inclusion a Big Deal? For those closely following the cryptocurrency space, the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States was a monumental event. However, the real game-changer is seeing these ETFs integrated into traditional investment frameworks. Model portfolios are pre-built investment strategies that financial advisors use to guide their clients. BlackRock, being a behemoth in asset management, offering a nod to Bitcoin through its IBIT ETF in these portfolios carries substantial weight. Here’s why this is noteworthy: Validation and Mainstream Acceptance: BlackRock’s decision signals a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class within mainstream finance. It’s no longer relegated to the fringes; it’s entering the portfolios of institutional giants. Increased Accessibility: Model portfolios influence investment decisions across a wide spectrum of advisors and clients. Including IBIT means more advisors will consider and potentially recommend Bitcoin allocation to their clients, broadening access to Bitcoin investment. Potential for Larger Allocations Down the Line: While the initial allocation in this particular model portfolio is described as ‘minimal’ within the alternative investment category, this is likely just the beginning. As institutions become more comfortable and confident with Bitcoin’s performance and regulatory landscape, we could see these allocations increase significantly over time. Ripple Effect on Other Institutions: BlackRock’s move can set a precedent for other major financial institutions. When a leader like BlackRock takes a step, others often follow, fearing being left behind in a potentially lucrative market. This could trigger a wave of institutional Bitcoin adoption . Understanding Model Portfolios and Their Significance for Bitcoin ETFs To truly grasp the impact of this news, it’s important to understand what model portfolios are and why their adoption of Bitcoin ETFs is crucial. Think of model portfolios as ready-made investment recipes. They are designed by investment experts to achieve specific financial goals with a certain level of risk. Financial advisors then use these models as starting points for building customized portfolios for their clients. Here’s a breakdown of their importance in this context: Aspect Significance for Bitcoin ETF Inclusion Guidance for Advisors Model portfolios provide advisors with a structured framework, making it easier to recommend Bitcoin ETFs to clients who might be new to crypto. Risk Management Framework Inclusion in a model portfolio suggests that BlackRock has assessed and incorporated the risk profile of Bitcoin within a broader portfolio context. Benchmarking and Performance Tracking Once IBIT is part of a model portfolio, its performance will be tracked and compared against benchmarks, further legitimizing it as a mainstream investment option. Scalability and Reach Model portfolios are used across vast networks of financial advisors, meaning the inclusion of IBIT has the potential to reach a massive investor base. IBIT: BlackRock’s Gateway to Bitcoin Exposure The specific Bitcoin ETF chosen by BlackRock for this initial foray into model portfolios is IBIT. Launched in January 2024, IBIT quickly became one of the most successful spot Bitcoin ETFs, attracting billions in assets under management. Its selection for model portfolios further solidifies its position as a leading vehicle for institutional Bitcoin investment. Key features of IBIT that likely contributed to its selection include: BlackRock’s Reputation and Expertise: BlackRock’s brand name and proven track record in asset management provide investors with a sense of security and trust. Liquidity and Trading Volume: IBIT has demonstrated robust liquidity and high trading volumes, making it easy for institutional investors to enter and exit positions. Competitive Fee Structure: IBIT’s competitive fee structure makes it an attractive option compared to other Bitcoin investment products. Efficient Bitcoin Exposure: As a spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT directly holds Bitcoin, providing investors with direct exposure to the underlying asset without the complexities of self-custody. What Does Minimal Allocation Mean and What to Expect Next? It’s crucial to acknowledge that the initial Bitcoin ETF model portfolio allocation is described as ‘minimal.’ This is not unexpected. Institutions typically take a cautious approach when incorporating new asset classes, especially volatile ones like Bitcoin. Think of this as a ‘toe in the water’ approach. BlackRock is testing the waters, observing performance, and gathering data. However, even a minimal allocation is a powerful signal. It suggests: Long-Term Vision: BlackRock is not just experimenting; they are strategically positioning themselves for the future of digital assets. This initial step lays the groundwork for potentially larger allocations as Bitcoin matures and market conditions evolve. Gradual Integration: Expect a phased approach. Institutions are likely to gradually increase their Bitcoin exposure over time as they gain confidence and see positive results. Focus on Risk-Adjusted Returns: The allocation size will likely be determined by risk-adjusted return considerations within the overall portfolio strategy. As Bitcoin’s volatility potentially decreases over time and its long-term growth narrative strengthens, allocations could rise. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin and Institutional Investment BlackRock adding IBIT to its model portfolio is more than just a minor portfolio adjustment; it’s a symbolic and practical step towards greater institutional involvement in Bitcoin. It signifies a shift in perception and a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a valuable asset class. While the journey of institutional Bitcoin adoption is still in its early stages, milestones like this pave the way for a future where Bitcoin is seamlessly integrated into mainstream investment portfolios. As we move forward, keep an eye on: Increasing Institutional Allocations: Watch for further announcements from BlackRock and other institutions regarding increased allocations to Bitcoin ETFs. Regulatory Developments: A clearer and more supportive regulatory environment will further encourage institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s Price Performance: Continued positive price performance and reduced volatility can build confidence and attract more institutional capital. This is a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. BlackRock’s strategic move underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market and the undeniable allure of Bitcoin for institutional investors. The inclusion of IBIT in model portfolios is a clear indicator that the walls between traditional finance and the digital asset world are continuing to come down, brick by brick.

40981499,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135511,1740788459,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Binance Unveils Truth: Denies Fueling Crypto Market Downturn Amidst Asset Sell-Off Rumors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-denies-market-downturn-rumors/,"The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to volatility, and with volatility comes speculation. Recently, whispers intensified, suggesting that Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, might have been a catalyst in the latest crypto market downturn. The rumor mill churned, fueled by Bitcoin’s price dip following events like the Bybit Exchange hack and significant Solana withdrawals. But has Binance truly been selling off assets, exacerbating the market’s woes? Let’s delve into the heart of the matter and uncover the truth behind these market rumors. Unpacking the Crypto Market Downturn Rumors When the crypto market experiences a dip, it’s natural for investors and enthusiasts to seek explanations. The recent market fluctuations, marked by Bitcoin’s decline, ignited discussions about potential triggers. Among the speculated reasons, a prominent rumor emerged pointing fingers at Binance, alleging that the exchange initiated a massive sell-off of its holdings, thereby deepening the market’s negative trajectory. This speculation gained traction after: Bitcoin’s Price Drop: Bitcoin, the bellwether of the crypto market, experienced a notable decrease in value. Bybit Exchange Hack: The $1.4 billion hack of Bybit Exchange injected uncertainty into the market. Large Solana Withdrawals: Market makers like Wintermute made substantial withdrawals of Solana, raising eyebrows and sparking concerns about potential sell-offs. These events, occurring in proximity, created a fertile ground for speculation, with some interpreting on-chain data and transaction patterns as evidence of Binance offloading assets. However, is there substance to these claims, or are they merely misinterpretations of complex market dynamics? Binance Denies Asset Selling: Setting the Record Straight In response to the swirling speculations, Binance Exchange swiftly and unequivocally denied the allegations. According to a report by Cointelegraph, Binance clarified its position, stating that it had not engaged in selling off its assets to trigger or worsen the recent market downturn. Binance emphasized its fundamental role as a platform that facilitates trades between users. Crucially, the exchange asserted that it does not exert control over the movement of user assets. This denial is critical because it directly addresses the core of the rumors. Binance’s statement aims to dispel the notion that the exchange was actively involved in pushing the market downwards through deliberate asset sales. Instead, Binance positions itself as a neutral intermediary, processing transactions initiated by its users, not as a market manipulator orchestrating sell-offs. Understanding Binance’s Role as a Cryptocurrency Exchange To fully grasp Binance’s denial, it’s essential to understand the operational mechanics of a cryptocurrency exchange like Binance. Binance functions primarily as a platform where buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies converge to execute trades. Here’s a breakdown of their role: Aspect Binance’s Function Trade Facilitation Binance provides the infrastructure and technology for users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. It matches buy and sell orders. Custodial Services Binance holds user assets in custody, ensuring their security and accessibility for trading. Marketplace Neutrality Binance, in its official statement, asserts it operates as a neutral marketplace, not directly controlling the direction of asset flows driven by user trading activities. Data Transparency Transaction data on blockchains is publicly accessible. Binance encourages the community to interpret this data accurately and avoid misconstruing ordinary trading activity as malicious sell-offs. Therefore, when large transactions are observed, they are typically reflective of user trading behavior on the platform, not necessarily actions initiated by Binance itself to deliberately impact market prices. Why Did Market Makers Like Wintermute Withdraw Solana? The large Solana withdrawals by market makers, such as Wintermute, contributed to the speculation surrounding market downturn triggers. But what could be the reasons behind such withdrawals? Market makers play a crucial role in providing liquidity to exchanges. Their withdrawal of assets could stem from various factors, including: Risk Management: In times of market uncertainty or increased volatility, market makers might reduce their exposure to certain assets to manage risk. Portfolio Rebalancing: Market makers regularly rebalance their portfolios based on market conditions, trading strategies, and risk assessments. Profit Taking: Withdrawals could be a result of profit-taking after periods of successful trading. External Factors: Broader economic conditions, regulatory changes, or specific news events related to Solana could also prompt withdrawals. Attributing these withdrawals solely to an impending sell-off orchestrated by Binance or as a direct cause of the market downturn is an oversimplification. Market dynamics are complex, influenced by a multitude of factors and participant behaviors. Actionable Insights: Navigating Crypto Market Rumors and Volatility The Binance rumor incident serves as a valuable lesson in navigating the often turbulent waters of the cryptocurrency market. Here are some actionable insights: Verify Information: Before reacting to market rumors, seek official statements and verify information from reputable sources like Cointelegraph and directly from exchanges like Binance. Understand Market Dynamics: Educate yourself on the factors that influence crypto market movements, including macroeconomics, regulatory news, technological developments, and investor sentiment. Exercise Caution with On-Chain Data: While on-chain data provides valuable insights, interpret it cautiously. Transaction patterns can be complex and require expert analysis to avoid misinterpretations. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of market uncertainty, refocus on the fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies you are invested in. Assess their long-term value proposition and resilience. Manage Risk: Implement robust risk management strategies, including diversification, setting stop-loss orders, and investing only what you can afford to lose. Dispelling Misinterpretations: The Path Forward Binance’s firm denial of asset selling to trigger the crypto market downturn is a crucial piece of information in clearing the fog of market speculation. It underscores the importance of critical thinking and due diligence in the crypto space. While market downturns are inherent to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, attributing them to unsubstantiated rumors can be misleading and detrimental to investor confidence. Binance has urged the community to avoid misinterpreting transaction data, advocating for a more informed and nuanced understanding of market events. In conclusion, the narrative that Binance deliberately sold off assets to cause a crypto market downturn appears to be unfounded. Binance has clarified its role as a trading platform and denied any manipulative actions. As the crypto market continues to evolve, staying informed, verifying information, and understanding market dynamics are paramount to navigating its inherent volatility and making sound investment decisions.

40981543,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135512,1740788534,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming SEC Decision: Crypto Regulation Faces Backlash After Coinbase Lawsuit Dismissal,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-coinbase-lawsuit-dismissal/,"The cryptocurrency world is once again buzzing with controversy, this time ignited by a dramatic turn in the ongoing saga between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and crypto exchange giant Coinbase. In an unprecedented move that has sent shockwaves through the digital asset space, the SEC decided to drop its lawsuit against Coinbase. This decision has drawn sharp criticism, most notably from within the SEC itself, with Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw leading the charge against her own agency’s action. But what does this dismissal truly mean for the future of crypto regulation and investor safety? Let’s delve into the heart of this contentious issue and unpack the implications. Why is the Coinbase Lawsuit Dismissal Causing Such a Stir? Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw didn’t mince words when expressing her disapproval of the SEC’s decision. She openly condemned the move, labeling it as a departure from established legal precedent and a dangerous precedent for future enforcement actions. Her core argument revolves around the belief that dropping the Coinbase lawsuit weakens the very foundation of securities law, potentially jeopardizing investor safeguards that have been meticulously built over decades. To fully grasp the gravity of Crenshaw’s dissent, let’s break down her key concerns: Erosion of 80 Years of Securities Law: Crenshaw argues that the SEC’s decision contradicts decades of established legal principles and enforcement practices related to securities. She suggests that this sudden shift creates uncertainty and casts doubt on the SEC’s commitment to consistently applying securities laws. Weakened Investor Protection: A central tenet of securities law is to protect investors from fraud and manipulation. By seemingly backing away from enforcing regulations in the crypto space, Crenshaw fears that the SEC is leaving investors vulnerable. This is particularly concerning in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies where risks are already amplified. Politicization of Enforcement Actions: Crenshaw raises a serious red flag by suggesting that dropping the Coinbase lawsuit could be perceived as a politicized decision. This implies external pressures might be influencing the SEC’s enforcement strategy, undermining its independence and credibility as a regulatory body. Regulatory Uncertainty: For businesses operating in the cryptocurrency sector, clear and consistent regulations are crucial. Dismissing the lawsuit, without a clear explanation or alternative approach, injects further ambiguity into the regulatory landscape. This uncertainty can stifle innovation and make it difficult for compliant businesses to thrive. Essentially, Crenshaw’s criticism paints a picture of an SEC seemingly abdicating its responsibility to oversee the crypto market effectively. Her dissent highlights the deep divisions and ongoing debate within regulatory bodies about how to approach the rapidly evolving world of digital assets. The SEC’s Evolving Stance on Crypto Regulation: A Source of Confusion? The SEC has been under immense pressure to provide clarity on how securities laws apply to cryptocurrencies. The challenge lies in the decentralized and novel nature of blockchain technology, which often blurs the lines of traditional financial definitions. While the SEC has maintained that many cryptocurrencies fall under its jurisdiction as securities, the application of these rules has been inconsistent and often criticized as unclear. Here’s a look at some key aspects of the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation that contribute to the current confusion: Aspect Description Impact on Crypto “Howey Test” Application The SEC uses the Howey Test to determine if an asset is an “investment contract” and thus a security. Applying this test to crypto tokens is complex and subjective. Creates uncertainty for crypto projects about whether their tokens are securities, impacting fundraising and operations. Enforcement Actions vs. Rulemaking The SEC has primarily relied on enforcement actions (lawsuits) to define crypto regulations, rather than proactive rulemaking. Leads to regulation by enforcement, which is criticized for lacking transparency and predictability. Businesses learn the rules through lawsuits, not clear guidelines. Differing Interpretations within SEC As evidenced by Commissioner Crenshaw’s dissent, there are varying opinions within the SEC itself on how to regulate crypto. Internal disagreements further contribute to regulatory ambiguity and inconsistent enforcement. Global Regulatory Landscape Different countries are adopting diverse approaches to crypto regulation. The lack of international coordination adds complexity. US crypto businesses face challenges in navigating a fragmented global regulatory environment, potentially hindering competitiveness. Commissioner Crenshaw’s criticism of the Coinbase lawsuit dismissal underscores the internal struggles and external pressures the SEC is facing in navigating the uncharted waters of crypto regulation. The agency is tasked with balancing investor protection with fostering innovation, a delicate act that requires clear, consistent, and well-reasoned policies. Investor Protection in the Crosshairs? Crenshaw’s Stark Warning At the heart of Commissioner Crenshaw’s passionate dissent is the concern for investor protection . Securities laws are fundamentally designed to safeguard individuals and institutions who invest their capital. These protections include requirements for disclosure, registration, and anti-fraud measures. Crenshaw fears that by stepping back in the Coinbase case, the SEC is signaling a weakening commitment to these crucial safeguards in the crypto market. Why is investor protection so critical in the crypto space? Consider these factors: Volatility and Risk: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods, exposing investors to significant risks. Strong investor protections are needed to mitigate these inherent risks and prevent manipulation. Information Asymmetry: Crypto markets often suffer from information asymmetry, where project developers and insiders possess far more information than public investors. Regulations are needed to ensure fair and transparent information disclosure. Prevalence of Scams and Fraud: Unfortunately, the crypto space has attracted its share of scams and fraudulent schemes. Robust enforcement is necessary to deter bad actors and protect investors from financial losses. Nascent Market: The crypto market is still relatively young and evolving. Many investors, particularly retail investors, may lack the experience and knowledge to navigate its complexities and risks without adequate regulatory oversight. Crenshaw’s warning is a stark reminder that effective investor protection is not just a regulatory ideal, but a practical necessity for a healthy and sustainable crypto market. Without it, confidence in the market can erode, and individual investors are left vulnerable to potentially devastating financial consequences. Caroline Crenshaw: A Lone Voice or Part of a Growing Chorus? Caroline Crenshaw ‘s vocal opposition to the Coinbase lawsuit dismissal positions her as a prominent voice within the SEC advocating for stricter crypto regulation and robust investor protection. But is she a lone voice in the wilderness, or does her dissent reflect a broader sentiment within the agency and among other regulators? While it’s difficult to gauge the exact internal dynamics of the SEC, several factors suggest that Crenshaw’s views may resonate with others: Past Dissents: Crenshaw has previously dissented on other SEC crypto-related actions, indicating a consistent stance on the need for stronger regulatory oversight. This suggests her current criticism is not an isolated incident but part of a pattern. Congressional Scrutiny: Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have expressed concerns about the lack of clarity and potential risks in the crypto market. This bipartisan pressure may be influencing the SEC’s internal debates and strategies. Investor Advocacy Groups: Investor protection organizations and consumer advocacy groups have consistently called for stronger regulations in the crypto space. Their voices add external pressure on the SEC to act decisively. Global Regulatory Trends: Many other jurisdictions are grappling with crypto regulation and are increasingly moving towards stricter frameworks. This global trend may be influencing the thinking of some within the SEC. While the SEC’s official decision to drop the Coinbase lawsuit might suggest a particular direction, Crenshaw’s outspoken dissent reveals that the debate within the agency is far from settled. Her perspective, focused on investor protection and adherence to established legal principles, likely represents a significant viewpoint within the broader regulatory landscape. The Future of Crypto Regulation: Navigating Uncertainty The dismissal of the Coinbase lawsuit , coupled with Commissioner Crenshaw’s sharp rebuke, has injected even more uncertainty into the future of crypto regulation in the United States. While the immediate implications of this specific case remain to be seen, the broader message is clear: the path forward for crypto regulation is far from smooth and consensus is elusive. Here are some potential future scenarios and challenges to consider: Continued Regulatory Ambiguity: The dismissal could embolden crypto exchanges and projects to push the boundaries of existing regulations, leading to prolonged legal battles and continued uncertainty. Increased Congressional Action: Frustration with the SEC’s approach could prompt Congress to take a more active role in defining crypto regulations through legislation. This could lead to a more prescriptive and potentially less flexible regulatory framework. Focus on Enforcement Priorities: The SEC might shift its enforcement focus to specific areas within the crypto market, such as stablecoins or decentralized finance (DeFi), while adopting a more cautious approach to exchanges. Global Regulatory Convergence (or Divergence): The US approach to crypto regulation will be closely watched globally. Depending on future actions, it could either contribute to greater international regulatory convergence or further fragmentation. Navigating this uncertainty requires a multi-faceted approach. For crypto businesses, proactive compliance and engagement with regulators are crucial. For investors, due diligence and a thorough understanding of risks are paramount. And for regulators, striking a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring investor protection remains the ultimate challenge. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto Regulation? Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s scathing critique of the Coinbase lawsuit dismissal is more than just an internal SEC disagreement. It’s a powerful signal that the debate over crypto regulation is intensifying, and the stakes for investor protection are higher than ever. This episode may well be remembered as a defining moment, one that shapes the future trajectory of how digital assets are governed in the US and potentially worldwide. The path forward is unclear, but one thing is certain: the conversation surrounding crypto regulation is far from over. The tension between innovation and investor protection will continue to drive policy decisions, legal battles, and market dynamics for years to come. Staying informed and engaged is crucial for anyone navigating this evolving landscape.

Technical indicators reveal that these two popular meme coins have recorded positive price movements, suggesting they are on the verge of parabolic breakouts. Shiba Inu coin aims to break its immediate resistance level at around $0.0000165, while Pepe has formed a falling wedge formation, a bullish reversal pattern. Amid this growing optimism, Remittix (RTX) has made headlines for its practical use in today’s economy. Its PayFi solution converts digital assets to local currencies, depositing funds directly into regular bank accounts. Some compare it to how XRP initially soared by simplifying cross-border transfers but argue its user-friendly design might reach a wider audience. Pepe Coin Battles To Halt Declines Recently, PEPE’s price has gained on its intraday time frame, which has triggered the formation of a falling wedge in the 4-hour chart. Typically, this is a bullish reversal pattern. However, an analysis of the crypto assets of this time frame reveals that PEPE is not yet ready to break out. This is because its Bull Bear Power (BBP) measures the strength of bulls (buyers) compared to bears (sellers). PEPE/USD 4-hour chart | Source: TradingView Bulls could have the upper hand when the BBP reading is positive and prices can increase. In this instance, the BBP on the PEPE price chart is negative, suggesting that the buying pressure is not dominant. Therefore, the meme coin could find it challenging to rise above the upper trendline of the wedge. If this is the case, Pepe Coin’s value could remain stagnant within the falling channel. Furthermore, it has also formed a rounding top pattern on the daily chart, which usually indicates a potential end to an uptrend. The meme coin has slipped below the $0.0000090 support as buying pressure remains weak. The PEPE token might continue to trade sideways if this remains the same. However, if the selling pressure increases, the token’s value could decline to $0.0000065. Shiba Inu Breaks The Resistance The most recent price action reveals that the Shiba Inu token has attempted to break the key resistance at $0.00000165. if it manages to close above this level with massive volume support, the meme coin could stage parabolic rallies toward more ambitious targets. If the breakout is confirmed, the SHIB coin could attract greater investor interest and record a massive increase in the short term. Shiba Inu price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap The recent attempt to break from the bearish trendline might signal a possible trend reversal. However, for the price of Shiba Inu to regain bullish momentum, its trading volume needs to skyrocket. An increase in demand could push SHIB tokens beyond critical levels and confirm the resumption of the bull trend. The next few weeks will be crucial to determine Shiba Inu's next big move. If the Shiba Inu surpasses the key resistance, it could stage the possibility of a bullish reversal . With a stable market capitalization and strong support community, SHIB could experience growth in the coming weeks, but trading volume and confirmation of the technical breakout will be determining factors. Remittix (RTX): A Practical Path to 1000x? While Pepe and Shiba Inu battle to halt declines, Remittix (RTX) has quickly gained ground in the market. Priced at just $0.0694, Remittix has already raised over $13 million in its presale, with more than 508 million tokens sold. Unlike speculative projects, Remittix addresses a multi-trillion-dollar remittance market. Its unique PayFi solution converts crypto-to-fiat instantly, depositing local currency in users’ bank accounts. Whether a freelancer in Mexico requires payment from a European client or a small business in Kenya ordering supplies in China, Remittix aims to lower hefty fees and longer processing times tied to traditional banking. By eliminating challenges for everyday people and businesses, the platform offers a direct, global utility that many crypto assets struggle to match. Since remittances are a massive, real-world market with consistent demand, RTX’s appeal grows beyond crypto enthusiasts. If adoption snowballs among e-commerce merchants, freelancers, or families sending money home, industry insiders believe Remittix might outpace other presales on sheer user volume. Security measures like an audited contract and locked liquidity also reassure buyers wary of scams. If the DeFi token secures widespread partnership, a 1000x run by 2025 may not be outlandish. After all, crypto assets that address real problems like XRP once did often see the most significant long-term gains. Remittix Takes The Crown Away From PEPE & SHIB for 1000x Potential Though Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin each hold promise since they are on the verge of a breakout, they face unfavorable market conditions that might cap their upside. Remittix (RTX), by contrast, offers real utility and dives straight into a daily financial challenge cross-border payments that affect billions worldwide.

For Solana, this means traders will be able to speculate on the future price of SOL without actually owning the underlying asset. This opens up a whole new world of trading strategies and risk management tools for both institutional and sophisticated retail investors. Think of it like betting on the future price of Solana. If you believe the price of SOL will go up, you can enter a long futures contract. If you anticipate a price decrease, you can go short. The beauty of futures contracts lies in their versatility and the leverage they offer. However, it’s crucial to remember that leverage amplifies both potential profits and losses, making it a tool best suited for experienced traders. CME Group and the Crypto Revolution: Why Solana Now? CME Group’s decision to introduce Solana futures is not a random one. As the world’s leading derivatives marketplace, CME Group has a track record of legitimizing and maturing asset classes. Their foray into Bitcoin and Ethereum futures was a pivotal moment for crypto, paving the way for increased institutional adoption. Now, they’re setting their sights on Solana, indicating a growing belief in SOL’s long-term potential and market maturity. Several factors likely contributed to this decision: Growing Market Demand: Solana has consistently ranked among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, boasting a vibrant ecosystem and strong community support. The demand for Solana-related investment products is undoubtedly on the rise. Institutional Appetite: Institutions are increasingly looking for regulated and established avenues to gain exposure to crypto assets. CME Group provides that trusted infrastructure, making Solana futures an attractive proposition for institutional investors. Diversification of Crypto Offerings: CME Group already offers Bitcoin and Ether futures. Adding Solana futures allows them to diversify their crypto derivatives portfolio and cater to a broader range of investor preferences. This move by CME Group can be seen as a powerful endorsement of Solana’s staying power in the crypto space. It’s a clear signal that Solana is graduating from being just another altcoin to a serious contender in the institutional crypto arena. Unpacking the Benefits: What Solana Futures Mean for the Crypto Market The launch of Solana futures on CME Group is not just about adding another trading product; it has far-reaching implications for the entire crypto ecosystem. Let’s explore some key benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: Futures markets typically bring in significant liquidity. Solana futures will likely attract a new wave of traders and investors, making the SOL market more liquid and efficient. Improved Price Discovery: Futures markets are known for their role in price discovery. The introduction of Solana futures can lead to more accurate and transparent price signals for SOL, benefiting all market participants. Hedging Opportunities: For institutional investors holding Solana in their portfolios, futures contracts provide a valuable tool for hedging against potential price downturns. This risk management aspect is crucial for attracting larger, more risk-averse investors. Increased Institutional Investment: The availability of Solana futures on a regulated exchange like CME Group lowers the barrier to entry for institutional investment . Pension funds, hedge funds, and other large institutions that were previously hesitant to invest directly in SOL may now find futures contracts a more palatable and compliant way to gain exposure. Mainstream Validation: CME Group’s backing further legitimizes Solana as a mainstream asset class. This validation can boost investor confidence and accelerate the adoption of SOL. To illustrate the potential impact, consider the example of Bitcoin futures. When CME Group launched Bitcoin futures in 2017, it marked a turning point for Bitcoin, contributing to its institutional acceptance and subsequent bull runs. Solana futures could potentially trigger a similar trajectory for SOL. Navigating the Challenges: Potential Downsides and Considerations While the launch of Solana futures is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Volatility Amplification: Futures trading, especially with leverage, can amplify price volatility. While volatility can create trading opportunities, it also carries increased risk, particularly for inexperienced traders. Regulatory Scrutiny: As crypto derivatives gain traction, regulatory scrutiny is likely to intensify. The crypto industry needs to work proactively with regulators to ensure responsible innovation and investor protection. Market Manipulation Concerns: While CME Group has robust surveillance mechanisms, concerns about market manipulation in crypto markets persist. Vigilance and strong regulatory oversight are essential to maintain market integrity. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do Now? The impending launch of Solana futures presents both opportunities and challenges. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on announcements from CME Group regarding the launch date and contract specifications for Solana futures. Educate Yourself: If you’re considering trading Solana futures, take the time to thoroughly understand futures contracts, leverage, and risk management strategies. Monitor Market Sentiment: Pay attention to market sentiment and analyst predictions regarding Solana’s price trajectory in light of this development. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Solana futures offer exciting possibilities, remember the importance of portfolio diversification and risk management. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider Long-Term Implications: Think about the long-term implications of institutional adoption of Solana and how it might impact the broader crypto market. The Future is Bright for Solana and Crypto Derivatives CME Group’s move to launch Solana futures is a landmark moment for both Solana and the broader crypto market. It signifies the increasing maturity of the crypto asset class and the growing acceptance of digital assets by traditional financial institutions. This development is poised to unlock new levels of liquidity, institutional investment, and market sophistication for Solana, potentially propelling it to even greater heights. As crypto derivatives continue to evolve and gain mainstream acceptance, we can expect to see further innovation and integration between traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies. The future is undeniably exciting, and Solana is firmly positioned at the forefront of this revolution.

The meme coin, which has consistently led most of the tokens in price performance in recent months, continues to face its toughest challenge amidst price slump and falling network activity. On the other hand, the Chainlink price movement has created interest among analysts and traders as the asset approaches a critical support and resistance zone, which might lead to prolonged consolidation or breakouts. Meanwhile, many investors are now betting on a PayFi token gearing up for even bigger returns in 2025. Remittix (RTX) has shown its real-world applicability as it will tackle the pricey mess of traditional remittances head-on. This has the RTX price rally by over 367% to hit $0.0694. Dogecoin Records 95% Dip In Network Activity According to Ali Martinez, Dogecoin recorded a massive 95% dip in active addresses on its network, suggesting a considerable decline in activity. Ali noted that the dip in DOGE network activity began three months ago. Meanwhile, the price of Dogecoin has declined substantially in the past few days, with a weekly dip of over 25%. Dogecoin records a dip in network activity | Source: X On February 23, it was noted that the Dogecoin network only recorded 30,815 new addresses, confirming the dip in network activity. The decrease in Dogecoin’s network activity was reflected in the DOGE price movement, which dipped from $0.4868 to around $0.1800. The bearish outlook on Dogecoin’s price and network activity has investors arguing that it is a sign of weak demand for Dogecoin. While the price of Dogecoin is currently down, a few investors expect a rebound soon. According to CryptoELITES, Dogecoin is set for a rebound, which could see the meme coin hit a new high. The analyst offered three unique price targets for the DOGE token, including $0.75, $1.5, and $5. Chainlink Price Shows TD Sequential Buy Signal Analyst Ali Martinez has identified a buying opportunity on the TD sequential indicator, which traders commonly employ to find potential reversal points. A rebound in Chainlink’s price might occur following a dipping trend based on this technical indicator. Chainlink TD sequential buy signal | Source: X The TD sequential indicator reveals selling and buying opportunities through numbered price chart signals. Currently, the indicator points to a “9,” a buying signal. The buy signal within the current crypto market conditions creates additional positivity that the Chainlink price could regain an uptrend movement. However, while the technical signal points toward a recovery, additional market factors must validate the upward trend. The Chainlink price trades above the $13 region and must also break past key resistance levels to record a significant rally, including the $15 and $16 levels. Remittix (RTX): Investors Smart Play for 2025 Remittix (RTX) is shaking up global payments with its unique PayFi system, turning crypto into cash fast and cheap. Remittix is built for real use, think of instant cross-border without the usual hassles. At just $0.0694, representing an over 362% rally, the RTX token has already raised over $13M in presale funding. Remittix also supports over 40-plus cryptos and 30-plus fiat currencies, making it the go-to for businesses and folks across the globe. Partnerships with payment providers boost its reach while tight security keeps the platform safe, making it a steady alternative to wild market swings. Its Pay API rollout allows businesses to embrace crypto payments, which can be converted into fiat currencies without volatility headaches. This is a practical edge that Dogecoin lacks. This has seen Dogecoin whales piling into the RTX’s presale. Security seals the deal for the project. BlockSAFU, SolidProof audits and a three-year team token lock encourage trust among investors. Remittix privacy is also an ace. Bank transfers hide the crypto roots, unlike Dogecoin’s loud trades. This attracts users seeking discretion, as Remittix seeks to tackle real-world finance, luring savvy Dogecoin holders. Can Remittix and LINK Outshine Dogecoin? Due to reduced investors' interest, the Dogecoin price continues to face a bearish outlook as Chainlink price movements showcase a recovery signal that could potentially lead to new highs. Meanwhile, investors continue to jump in, drawn by Remittix's practical edge and big plans, including listing on many centralized exchanges, which will improve exposure. With its presale well underway, traders still have a perfect chance to get the RTX tokens in anticipation of major returns post-listing.

40981791,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135528,1740788985,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Ethereum Price Could CRASH 30% If This Key Level Fails!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-price-crash-support-level/,"Is the Ethereum party coming to an abrupt end? The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), is flashing some serious red signals, leaving investors on edge. Whispers of a potential 30% price plunge are growing louder, and if you’re holding ETH, you need to pay close attention. Let’s dive into the critical factors that could trigger a significant Ethereum price correction and what it means for your crypto portfolio. Is a Devastating Ethereum Price Crash Imminent? According to recent analysis from Cointelegraph, Ethereum is at a precarious juncture. The dreaded double-top pattern has emerged on the weekly charts, a bearish technical indicator that often precedes significant price declines. This pattern, coupled with a sharp 24.5% drop in ETH price over the past week, paints a concerning picture for Ethereum bulls. If Ethereum fails to hold the crucial $2,000 support level, analysts predict a swift and painful 30% nosedive towards $1,500. The situation is undeniably tense. Ethereum is currently flirting with two-year lows, a stark contrast to the bullish fervor seen in previous months. A decisive close below $2,100 would unfortunately validate this bearish double-top setup, opening the floodgates for further downward pressure. Are we on the brink of a major crypto market crash , with Ethereum leading the charge? Decoding the Double-Top Pattern: A Recipe for Disaster? So, what exactly is this ominous double-top pattern, and why should Ethereum investors be worried? Formation: A double-top pattern forms when the price of an asset attempts to break through a resistance level twice but fails both times, creating two peaks at roughly the same price. Bearish Signal: This pattern is a classic bearish reversal signal, suggesting that the upward momentum is exhausted and sellers are taking control. Confirmation: The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks below the neckline, which is the support level between the two peaks. In Ethereum’s case, this neckline is currently around the $2,100 mark. Target Price: Technical analysts often project a price target for a double-top pattern by measuring the vertical distance between the peaks and the neckline and subtracting it from the neckline breakdown point. This is how the $1,500 target for Ethereum is being derived. Essentially, the double-top pattern suggests that buyers have repeatedly tried and failed to push Ethereum higher, indicating a weakening bullish sentiment. If this pattern plays out as anticipated, the Ethereum support level at $2,000 could crumble, triggering a cascade of sell orders. The $2,000 Support Level: Ethereum’s Last Stand? The $2,000 level is not just an arbitrary number; it represents a significant psychological and technical Ethereum support level . It has acted as a crucial buffer in the past, preventing steeper declines. However, the current market conditions are testing its strength like never before. Why is $2,000 so critical? Psychological Barrier: Round numbers often act as psychological support and resistance levels in trading. $2,000 is a significant round number that many traders and investors are watching. Technical Confluence: This level might coincide with previous price lows, moving averages, or Fibonacci retracement levels, further strengthening its significance as a support zone. Market Sentiment Indicator: If Ethereum decisively breaks below $2,000, it could trigger panic selling and further erode market confidence in ETH and potentially the broader crypto market. Losing this crucial Ethereum support level could indeed pave the way for the predicted 30% drop. However, it’s not all doom and gloom just yet. There are glimmers of hope on the horizon. Hope on the Horizon: Demand at Lower Levels While the technical charts paint a bearish picture, on-chain data from Glassnode offers a contrasting perspective. Glassnode’s data reveals robust demand for Ethereum around the $1,890 level. This suggests that there are still buyers eager to accumulate ETH at lower prices, which could potentially act as a strong Ethereum support level and prevent the anticipated Ethereum price crash to $1,500. Key Takeaways from Glassnode Data: Metric Data Point Implication Exchange Outflows Increased Suggests investors are moving ETH off exchanges, indicating accumulation rather than selling. Accumulation Addresses Rising More addresses are accumulating ETH, pointing to long-term holding sentiment. Strong Support Zone Around $1,890 Significant buying interest exists at this level, potentially limiting further downside. This data provides a crucial counter-narrative to the bearish technical outlook. If selling pressure eases and this demand at $1,890 proves strong enough, Ethereum could potentially bounce back and invalidate the double-top pattern altogether. The battle between bearish technicals and bullish on-chain data is currently underway. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Ethereum Holders So, what should Ethereum holders do amidst this uncertainty? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Monitor Key Levels: Keep a close watch on the $2,000 and $1,890 levels. A decisive break below $2,000 could signal further downside, while strong support at $1,890 could offer a potential buying opportunity. Manage Risk: Consider implementing risk management strategies such as setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the price drops further. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio to mitigate risks associated with individual asset volatility. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest market news, technical analysis, and on-chain data to make informed decisions. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in the long-term potential of Ethereum, consider DCA to gradually accumulate ETH over time, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. The current situation demands caution and vigilance. While the potential for a 30% Ethereum price drop is real, the strong demand at lower levels offers a glimmer of hope. The coming days and weeks will be crucial in determining Ethereum’s next move. Will the bears triumph, or will the bulls stage a comeback? Conclusion: The Fate of Ethereum Hangs in the Balance Ethereum is at a critical crossroads. The double-top pattern and recent price weakness are undeniable warning signs. The $2,000 Ethereum support level is under immense pressure, and a break below it could trigger a significant price correction. However, the underlying demand at lower levels, as indicated by Glassnode data, suggests that the story is far from over. Investors must remain vigilant, monitor key levels, and manage their risk wisely as the drama unfolds in the crypto market .

Analyst Issues Dire Warning,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/is-the-worst-yet-to-come-for-xrp-analyst-issues-dire-warning/,"While the XRP price is already down -42% since its peak at $3.40 on January 16, renowned technical trader Josh Olszewicz (@CarpeNoctom) warns that the next leg downward may be imminent. Sharing his daily chart analysis on X, Olszewicz writes, “1D XRP: H&S + bearish kumo breakout watch,” signaling that two significant technical developments could push XRP prices lower in the near future. Is XRP Poised To Crash Towards $1.24? The mention of an “H&S” refers to the Head and Shoulders pattern, a well-known reversal formation in technical analysis. The pattern typically emerges after a substantial upward rally and includes three successive peaks, with the middle peak (the “head”) higher than the flanking peaks (the “shoulders”). Related Reading: XRP Price Continuation After Crash Below $2.4? New Targets Emerge In the case of XRP, Olszewicz’s chart suggests that the central head formed around $3.40 in mid-January, while the shoulders appear to be topping out between $2.83–$2.90. Technical analysts pay close attention to the “neckline,” which generally runs along a key support level beneath the peaks. When the price decisively breaks below this neckline, it is viewed as confirmation that selling pressure has overwhelmed buying interest, often leading to further downside. Olszewicz’s comment also highlights the phrase “bearish kumo breakout,” referencing the Ichimoku Cloud system, another prominent tool for charting and forecasting price momentum. Ichimoku Cloud analysis projects multiple moving averages forward on the chart and creates a “cloud” of support or resistance levels. A bearish kumo breakout arises when the price action clearly drops below the Ichimoku Cloud and the future cloud itself shifts in a way that indicates weaker bullish momentum. The core idea is that once an asset’s price slips under the cloud, a further decline becomes more likely, since the cloud that previously acted as support is no longer providing a cushion. From the chart Olszewicz provided, the current price action around $2.18 sits just above a conspicuous support area in the $2.00 region, which he interprets as the neckline for the Head and Shoulders pattern. If that zone gives way, bears could potentially dominate the market, with Fibonacci levels marked on the chart pointing to a possible first stop near $1.94, followed by an even steeper target. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Down Below Key Demand – Analyst Expects A Drop To $1.65 The chart appears to highlight a 161.8% Fibonacci extension level at around $1.24, which could come into play if selling accelerates. The presence of these Fibonacci levels does not guarantee a breakdown to those lows, but notably, a typical breakdown from the h&s pattern could spell even more doom. The profit target for the pattern is generally the price difference between the head and the low point of either shoulder. This difference is then subtracted from the neckline which could position the XRP price even below $1.00. Despite the stark warning about an impending “massive” price crash, it is crucial to note that Olszewicz’s commentary, “1D XRP: H&S + bearish kumo breakout watch,” should be viewed as an alert for traders rather than an irreversible prediction. Technical setups can fail if bullish momentum returns or if broader market fundamentals shift, but for now the entire crypto market seems driven by extreme fear.

The fund, designed to offer investors exposure to the burgeoning world of smart contract platforms, is now supercharged with the inclusion of seven prominent cryptocurrencies. This update, revealed via Grayscale’s official X account, showcases a strategic diversification into a wider array of digital assets beyond Bitcoin and traditional cryptocurrencies. For crypto enthusiasts and investors alike, this news marks a pivotal moment, indicating growing institutional interest in the diverse landscape of smart contract technologies. Let’s dive deeper into what this exciting development means for the future of crypto investments. Grayscale Smart Contract Fund: A Powerhouse of Digital Assets The Grayscale Smart Contract Fund is engineered to provide investors with exposure to a portfolio of leading smart contract platforms, excluding Ethereum. However, the latest announcement brings a game-changing update: Ethereum (ETH) itself is now a cornerstone of this fund, alongside other heavy hitters like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Sui (SUI), Near (NEAR), and Polkadot (DOT). This strategic inclusion significantly broadens the fund’s scope and potential, tapping into a wider spectrum of innovative blockchain technologies. Here’s a breakdown of what makes this fund tick: Market Cap-Weighted: The fund’s composition is determined by the market capitalization of each included cryptocurrency. This means that assets with larger market caps will have a greater influence on the fund’s overall performance, reflecting the market’s current valuation of these digital assets. Quarterly Rebalancing: To maintain alignment with the dynamic crypto market, the fund undergoes rebalancing every quarter. This process ensures that the portfolio remains reflective of the current market cap weights and allows for adjustments based on market fluctuations and the emergence of new opportunities. 30% Cap Per Rebalance: To mitigate concentration risk and ensure diversification, Grayscale has implemented a 30% cap per asset during each rebalancing period. This rule prevents any single cryptocurrency from dominating the fund’s portfolio, promoting a more balanced and resilient investment strategy. This structured approach aims to offer investors a diversified and professionally managed avenue to participate in the growth of the smart contract ecosystem. The addition of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency and a foundational platform for countless decentralized applications (dApps), is a particularly noteworthy development, signaling a maturing perspective on the role of Ethereum within the broader crypto space. Ethereum and Altcoins: Diversifying the Smart Contract Landscape The inclusion of Ethereum and a selection of prominent altcoins in the Grayscale Smart Contract Fund represents a significant shift towards diversification within the digital asset realm. While Bitcoin has long been the dominant force in the cryptocurrency market, the rise of smart contract platforms has opened up a world of possibilities beyond simple digital currency. These platforms enable the creation of decentralized applications, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and a host of other innovative use cases. By incorporating Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Sui, Near, and Polkadot, Grayscale is acknowledging the multi-faceted nature of the smart contract ecosystem. Let’s take a closer look at why these specific altcoins are gaining traction: Cryptocurrency Key Features & Strengths Ethereum (ETH) The leading smart contract platform with the largest developer community, extensive dApp ecosystem, and strong network effects.

By strategically including these diverse altcoins , the Grayscale Smart Contract Fund offers investors a comprehensive and balanced exposure to the most promising platforms within the smart contract space. This approach mitigates the risk associated with investing in a single cryptocurrency and capitalizes on the collective growth potential of the broader ecosystem. Benefits of Investing in a Smart Contract Crypto Fund Why should investors consider a crypto fund focused on smart contracts? The advantages are manifold, particularly for those seeking exposure to the digital asset market without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership and management: Diversification: As highlighted by Grayscale’s fund, a smart contract fund inherently provides diversification across multiple digital assets. This reduces the risk associated with relying on the performance of a single cryptocurrency and spreads investments across a range of promising platforms. Professional Management: Funds like Grayscale’s are managed by experienced professionals who conduct in-depth research, monitor market trends, and handle the complexities of portfolio rebalancing and custody. This expertise can be invaluable for investors who may lack the time or knowledge to actively manage their own crypto portfolios. Ease of Access: Investing in a crypto fund often provides a more accessible and regulated pathway to the digital asset market, especially for institutional investors or those unfamiliar with the intricacies of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. It streamlines the investment process and reduces the technical barriers to entry. Exposure to Growth Sectors: Smart contract platforms are at the forefront of innovation in the blockchain space. Investing in a fund focused on these digital assets allows investors to gain exposure to sectors with significant growth potential, such as DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized applications. Risk Mitigation: While cryptocurrency investments inherently carry risks, a well-diversified and professionally managed fund can help mitigate some of these risks. The quarterly rebalancing and 30% cap implemented by Grayscale are examples of risk management strategies designed to protect investor capital. For investors looking to tap into the potential of the smart contract revolution, a dedicated crypto fund offers a compelling and structured approach. Navigating the Challenges and Risks of Altcoin Investments While the potential rewards of investing in altcoins and smart contract platforms are significant, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks associated with this asset class. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and altcoins , in particular, can experience dramatic price swings. Here are some key challenges and risks to consider: Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and altcoins tend to be even more volatile than established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

The recent steadiness of the dollar steady , as investors keenly analyze incoming inflation data and the potential resurgence of Trump’s tariff policies, presents a fascinating case study for crypto enthusiasts and seasoned traders alike. Why should you care about the dollar’s pulse when you’re invested in Bitcoin or Ethereum? Because the ripple effects of these macroeconomic factors can significantly influence the broader financial landscape, including the crypto market. Let’s delve into the currents shaping the dollar’s trajectory and what it means for your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Dollar’s Stability Amidst Economic Crosswinds The US dollar has shown remarkable resilience, maintaining its ground against a basket of major currencies. But what’s fueling this steadiness in the face of significant economic uncertainties? Several factors are at play, creating a complex scenario that investors are meticulously dissecting. Inflation Data : The cornerstone of current market sentiment is the incoming inflation data . Traders and economists are hanging on every CPI (Consumer Price Index) and PPI (Producer Price Index) release, seeking clues about the future direction of interest rates and the overall health of the economy. Stronger-than-expected inflation figures could signal persistent price pressures, potentially prompting the Federal Reserve to maintain or even increase its hawkish stance on monetary policy. Conversely, cooling inflation might suggest a pivot towards rate cuts, influencing the dollar’s appeal. Trump’s Tariff Plans : The specter of renewed trade tensions looms large with former President Trump’s potential return to the political stage and his stated intentions to impose significant tariffs. These trump tariff plans are not just theoretical; they carry the weight of past actions and could reshape global trade dynamics. The mere mention of widespread tariffs introduces uncertainty into the economic outlook, impacting currency valuations and investor confidence. Global Economic Uncertainty : Beyond inflation and tariffs, the global economic landscape remains fraught with uncertainties. Geopolitical tensions, varying growth rates across major economies, and ongoing supply chain adjustments all contribute to a volatile environment. In times of uncertainty, the US dollar often benefits from its safe-haven status, attracting investors seeking stability. To better understand the interplay of these factors, consider the following table: Factor Potential Impact on Dollar Relevance to Crypto Market Strong Inflation Data Potential for Dollar appreciation due to expectations of higher interest rates. May lead to a risk-off sentiment, potentially impacting crypto prices negatively in the short term. Weak Inflation Data Potential for Dollar depreciation as rate cut expectations increase. Could boost risk assets like crypto as investors seek higher returns in a lower-rate environment. Trump Tariffs Implementation Uncertain impact; could initially strengthen the dollar as safe-haven but could weaken it long-term due to economic disruption. Increased market volatility across all asset classes, including crypto. Trade tensions can create economic uncertainty, impacting investor sentiment. Global Economic Slowdown Dollar may strengthen as a safe-haven currency. Mixed impact; could see some flight to safety into dollar-pegged stablecoins, while broader crypto market might face headwinds due to reduced risk appetite. Why Are Investors Weighing Inflation Data So Heavily? You might be wondering, why is everyone so fixated on investors weigh ing every piece of inflation data? The answer lies in its direct influence on central bank policies, particularly the Federal Reserve in the US. Inflation is the rate at which prices for goods and services are rising, and it’s a critical gauge of economic health. Central banks aim to maintain price stability, often targeting a specific inflation rate (like 2% in the US). Here’s why inflation data is such a market mover: Interest Rate Expectations : Inflation data directly shapes expectations about future interest rate movements. High inflation typically prompts central banks to raise interest rates to cool down the economy and curb price increases. Lower inflation can lead to rate cuts to stimulate economic activity. Bond Yields : Interest rate expectations drive bond yields. Higher expected rates push bond yields up, making bonds more attractive to investors. This can impact the relative attractiveness of other asset classes, including equities and crypto. Currency Valuation : Interest rate differentials between countries influence currency exchange rates. Higher interest rates in the US compared to other nations can make the dollar more appealing to foreign investors, increasing demand and potentially strengthening its value. Economic Growth Outlook : Inflation can be a leading indicator of broader economic trends. Sustained high inflation can erode purchasing power, dampen consumer spending, and potentially lead to slower economic growth or even recession. Conversely, very low inflation or deflation can also be detrimental, signaling weak demand. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding the inflation narrative is paramount. Inflation can erode the value of fiat currencies over time, which is often cited as a bullish argument for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as potential inflation hedges. However, in the short-term, the market’s reaction to inflation data and the resulting impact on the dollar and risk sentiment can create significant trading opportunities and risks. Tariff Threats and the Economic Outlook: A Balancing Act The prospect of trump tariff plans adds another layer of complexity to the economic outlook. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, can have far-reaching consequences. While proponents argue they protect domestic industries and jobs, the economic reality is often more nuanced. Let’s consider the potential impacts of widespread tariffs: Increased Consumer Prices : Tariffs can lead to higher prices for imported goods, which can be passed on to consumers, contributing to inflationary pressures. Retaliatory Tariffs : One country imposing tariffs often leads to retaliatory measures from trading partners, sparking trade wars. These trade disputes can disrupt global supply chains, harm businesses, and increase economic uncertainty. Impact on Corporate Earnings : Companies that rely on imported goods or export products can see their profitability squeezed by tariffs. This can negatively impact stock markets and overall investor sentiment. Economic Slowdown : Trade wars and increased protectionism can hinder global trade and economic growth. Reduced trade flows can lead to inefficiencies and stifle innovation. For the dollar, the impact of tariffs is not straightforward. In the short-term, during periods of heightened trade tensions, the dollar might experience some safe-haven demand. However, prolonged trade wars and the resulting economic disruptions can ultimately weaken the dollar and the US economy. For the cryptocurrency market, tariffs introduce another source of volatility and uncertainty. While some might see crypto as a hedge against trade-war-induced economic instability, the immediate market reaction can be unpredictable. Navigating the Current Economic Landscape: Actionable Insights for Investors So, how should investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, navigate this intricate economic environment where the economic outlook is shaped by inflation data and tariff uncertainties? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed : Keep a close watch on economic data releases, especially inflation figures (CPI, PPI) and trade policy announcements. Understand how these data points are influencing market sentiment and the dollar’s movement. Diversify Your Portfolio : Diversification is key in times of uncertainty. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A well-diversified portfolio across different asset classes can help mitigate risk. Understand Dollar Dynamics : Pay attention to the dollar index (DXY) and its movements. A strengthening dollar can sometimes put pressure on risk assets like crypto, while a weakening dollar might provide a tailwind. Risk Management is Crucial : Volatility is likely to persist. Employ robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing your position sizes. Long-Term Perspective : While short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, maintain a long-term perspective on your investments, especially in the crypto space. Focus on the fundamental value and long-term potential of your chosen assets. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging : In volatile markets, dollar-cost averaging (DCA) can be a prudent strategy. Investing a fixed amount at regular intervals can help smooth out entry points and reduce the impact of short-term price swings. Conclusion: Dollar’s Steadiness as a Barometer for Broader Market Trends The dollar’s current steadiness amidst crucial inflation data and potential tariff upheavals is more than just a forex market story. It’s a reflection of the broader economic uncertainties and the delicate balancing act that investors weigh as they try to decipher the future. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these dynamics is not just about following traditional finance; it’s about recognizing the interconnectedness of global markets and making informed decisions in a rapidly evolving landscape. By staying informed, adapting strategies, and maintaining a long-term perspective, investors can navigate these economic crosswinds and position themselves for potential opportunities in both the traditional and cryptocurrency realms.

Institutions are allocating capital, and a significant portion is being channeled into Bitcoin. Potential Bullish Signal: Large inflows into Bitcoin ETFs can be seen as bullish indicators. Increased demand can potentially drive up Bitcoin’s price, benefiting the entire crypto market. Long-Term Investment Strategy: BlackRock isn’t known for short-term speculation. This deposit suggests a long-term strategic allocation to Bitcoin, reinforcing its role as a store of value and a diversifying asset in institutional portfolios. Market Confidence Boost: Actions speak louder than words. BlackRock’s substantial deposit can instill confidence in the market, attracting further investment from both institutional and retail investors. To put the numbers in perspective, 2,397 BTC at a price of approximately $79,000 per Bitcoin (at the time of deposit) totals around $190 million. This isn’t a trivial amount, even for an institution of BlackRock’s size. BlackRock, Bitcoin ETF, and Coinbase Prime: A Powerful Trio? The combination of BlackRock , their Bitcoin ETF , and Coinbase Prime creates a powerful synergy. Let’s explore why this trio is noteworthy: Entity Role in the Ecosystem Significance BlackRock World’s largest asset manager, ETF issuer Brings credibility and institutional capital to Bitcoin. Their ETF provides a regulated and accessible investment vehicle. Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) Investment product providing Bitcoin exposure Facilitates institutional and retail investment in Bitcoin without direct ownership complexities. Coinbase Prime Institutional-grade crypto platform Provides secure custody and trading infrastructure for large Bitcoin holdings, essential for institutional players like BlackRock. This ecosystem is designed to streamline institutional access to Bitcoin. It addresses concerns around security, regulation, and operational complexities that previously hindered larger institutions from fully embracing crypto. The institutional investment landscape is evolving, and this trio is at the forefront of that change. Navigating the Institutional Investment Wave: What Should You Watch For? While BlackRock’s BTC deposit is exciting, it’s essential to maintain a balanced perspective. Here are some key aspects to monitor moving forward: ETF Inflow Trends: Track the daily inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT. Consistent inflows will reinforce the narrative of growing institutional adoption. Coinbase Prime Activity: Keep an eye on Coinbase Prime’s reported assets under custody and trading volumes. Increased activity on this platform will further validate institutional engagement. Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape for crypto is constantly evolving. Positive regulatory clarity can further encourage institutional participation, while negative developments could create headwinds. Market Sentiment and Price Action: While institutional investment is a positive long-term driver, Bitcoin’s price can still be volatile in the short term. Monitor overall market sentiment and price action alongside institutional activity. Actionable Insights: Capitalizing on Institutional Bitcoin Adoption So, how can you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, potentially benefit from this trend of increasing institutional investment ? Diversification: Consider Bitcoin as part of a diversified investment portfolio. Institutional adoption strengthens the long-term investment case for Bitcoin. Education: Stay informed about the developments in the Bitcoin ETF space and institutional crypto adoption. Knowledge is power in navigating this evolving market. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional investment often signifies a long-term outlook.

On-chain data trends suggest retail traders’ panic selling this was behind the latest BTC price downturn. Bitcoin (BTC) Plunges to Lowest Since November 2024 Bitcoin (BTC) price extended its February losses further on Friday, weighed down by political and economic turbulence. The majority of the bearish momentum stemmed from developments within the Trump administration, shaking investor confidence in risk assets. In the last quarter of 2024, BTC price outperformed major financial assets as Trump’s pro-crypto stance fueled bullish sentiment. His inauguration-day launch of a memecoin further amplified gains, driving Bitcoin price to new all-time highs in January. However, after posting double-digit growth in Q4 2024, BTC price has faced intense sell pressure in February, with multiple macroeconomic and geopolitical factors fueling the downturn. Bitcoin price action, Feb 2025 | TradingView BTC price dropped 8% on Friday, briefly hitting $78,256 on Binance—its lowest level in over 120 days. Having opened February at $102,429, BTC price has now plunged 25%, as it closed the month just below the $84,000 mark, as depicted in the TradingView chart above Why Did Bitcoin Price Plunge 25% in February 2025? Beyond a “sell-the-news” event following Trump’s inauguration, several new bearish catalysts emerged throughout February, further weighing on Bitcoin price action. 1. DeepSeek’s Emergence Unsettles AI Markets, Triggering Sell-Offs The AI sector’s turmoil has sent shockwaves across financial markets, contributing to BTC price volatility. DeepSeek, a major Chinese AI player, has challenged U.S.-based firms like OpenAI, raising fears of a prolonged AI arms race. This uncertainty escalated following NVIDIA’s positive earnings report on February 27, which paradoxically triggered a rapid sell-off in tech stocks. The bearish sentiment rippled into crypto markets, playing a crucial role in BTC price sinking to fresh 120-day lows within 24 hours. 2. Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E. Oversight Clashes With U.S. Regulators Elon Musk’s new role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) has stirred significant controversy, contributing to market instability. Tensions between Musk and key agencies such as USAID, the U.S. Treasury , and the SEC have intensified, leading to investor uncertainty. Financial markets have overheated as regulatory battles escalate, further undermining confidence in risk assets. The evidently contributed to Bitcoin’s 25% price dip in February 2025. 3. Trump’s Tariffs on Canada and Mexico Trigger Panic Selling Trump’s surprise announcement of 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico sent shockwaves through financial markets, prompting investors to retreat from volatile assets. Following the hotter-than-expected February 13 CPI report, inflation fears surged, exacerbating risk-off sentiment. Investors, bracing for further inflationary pressures, have begun offloading BTC in favor of safer assets. Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor (GMI) also echoed this sentiment in a recent post on X. “Everything happening in markets right now, especially in crypto, is a direct consequence of the tightening of financial conditions in Q4 last year. When financial conditions tighten, liquidity gets drained, and economic surprises start to slow.” Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), Feb 28, 2025 While BTC’s 25% decline in February aligns with tightening trends in global financial markets, on-chain data suggests that retail traders were the primary sellers during the latest downturn. Santiment ’s Daily Active Addresses (DAA) metric, which tracks unique addresses engaging in transactions, confirms increased retail sell pressure. BTC recorded 515,000 active addresses on February 23, but following Trump’s tariff announcement, this number surged dramatically. Bitcoin Price vs. BTC Daily Active Addresses (DAA) | Source: Santiment For context, BTC’s DAA has exceeded 880,000 daily transactions since February 25, reaching a new 2025 peak of 882,000 on February 27, before settling at 875,000 on Friday. Such heightened activity during a downtrend strongly suggests that retail traders are driving the sell-off, applying downward pressure on Bitcoin price. With BTC price consolidating near 120-day lows, investors are closely watching key support levels. If selling pressure persists, Bitcoin price could test the $75,000 level in the coming days. However, a potential rebound could emerge if macroeconomic conditions stabilize or institutional inflows resume. For now, retail-driven selling, geopolitical uncertainty, and inflation fears remain dominant themes shaping BTC price action in early 2025. BTC Price Forecast: Bulls Risks Deeper Correction Below $80K as More Sell Signals Emerge Bitcoin price forecast charts show BTC struggling near $84,344 after an extended downtrend, with sell signals intensifying. The Bollinger Bands have widened, indicating increased volatility, while Bitcoin trades below the midline at $93,607. A rejection from this level could confirm bearish continuation toward the lower band at $83,478. The Top Bottom Indicator recently flashed a sell signal, mirroring the previous instance in January that led to a steep correction. If history repeats, Bitcoin could extend losses further. Volume Delta also reflects sustained negative momentum, with declining green bars and increasing red, suggesting persistent selling pressure. BTC Price Forecast However, Bitcoin’s price has yet to break decisively below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential for a relief bounce. In the near-term in BTC price holds above $83,500, bullish momentum could push it back toward $90,000. However, failure to reclaim $86,000 could trigger another decline toward $80,000, especially as bearish sentiment is expected to intensify as Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico take effect on March 1.

The DTCC listing indicates that Solana is evolving as an asset class while gaining increasing legitimacy within traditional financial circles. The Cardano ETF journey also received a boost after the US SEC officially recognized the ETF filing by a leading investment firm, Grayscale. Meanwhile, Remittix(RTX) is stepping in to offer a tangible use case. Currently priced at around $0.0694, this project focuses on cross-border transactions, a domain in which Cardano has shown potential but failed to deliver immediate solutions fully. With over $13M raised in presale funding, Remittix seems to have captured the eyes of investors seeking a project that might see explosive growth in 2025. Solana ETF Development: Futures Fund Listed on DTCC Two Solana futures exchange-traded funds from Volatility shares have appeared on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation list. The Volatility Shares Solana ETF and the Volatility Shares 2x Solana ETF mark the first SOL-based products to be added to the list. DTCC list two of Solana Future ETFs | Source: DTCC This is being hailed as a significant step that might pave the way for the more anticipated approval of spot Solana ETF, mirroring the unique journey taken by Ethereum and Bitcoin. Earlier this month, the SEC acknowledged spot Solana ETF filings from different issuers, including 21 Shares, Canray, Bitwise and VanEck. Despite the progress in Solana’s ETF offerings, it's important to remember that the ETF launch is still in its early stages. Solana’s price is also experiencing a market-wide dip, trading around the $130 level . The long-term implications of the ETF could, therefore, significantly impact the Solana price movement in the coming days. Cardano ETF Launch Set To Trigger Massive ADA Revival Following the successful integration of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2024, community members have increased their anticipation for Cardano ETFs, poised to strengthen the ADA’s price. A new advancement from the US SEC also fuels the possibility of a spot Cardano ETF in 2025, as the SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s ETF filing. US SEC acknowledges Grayscale ETF application | Source: US SEC The acknowledgment places Grayscale’s ETF application ahead of competitors while further demonstrating the regulator’s interest in accommodating altcoins-based ETFs. Cardano price movement could greatly benefit from the long-term integration of Cardano-based ETF. Bitcoin recorded a massive jump in its price value following several BTC-based ETFs' inception in the previous year's first quarter. Similarly, Cardano could also stage a major uptrend movement with the ETF approval despite its recent bearish outlook, which has seen the price of Cardano dip by over 22% in a week. Why Remittix Could Be More Than Just A Presale Token In addition to its achievement, Remittix (RTX) is creating a robust blockchain-driven financial ecosystem. Remittix focuses on real adoption by partnering with companies, payment networks and financial institutions, unlike most altcoins, which rely solely on price speculations. Remittix is also a top player when it comes to cross-border remittances, providing a fast yet cost-effective alternative to traditional money transfers. One of the key features is its merchant integration solution, which tackles volatility issues that have slowed the application of cryptos. This solution will allow businesses to convert crypto payments into fiat currency. As financial institutions tighten regulations and monitor transactions more aggressively, users have been looking for a more secure alternative to manage their funds. Remittix provides an alternative, ensuring that the recipient receives a standard bank deposit without any trace that the payment originated from crypto. The project also supports over 40-plus cryptos and 30-plus currencies, making it the go-to project for businesses and people across the globe. This has seen investors flock to the Remittix presale, leading to the RTX price surging by over 362% to sell at $0.0694. This accessible entry point only adds fuel to the fire as interest increases, making Remittix one of the presale projects promising high investment returns. Top Altcoins For 2025: Solana, Cardano And Remittix The SOL price movement could benefit greatly from the recent listing of two futures funds on DTCC, as Cardano also anticipates a 2025 ETF approval. In the meantime, as Remittix steps up to carve out a large piece of the $190 trillion global payment sector, its instant crypto-to-fiat conversion and direct bank transfers could see the token become a top altcoin investment option for 2025.

The debate is heating up, especially within the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has ignited a firestorm by publicly criticizing the SEC’s recent staff guidance on meme coins. Is this guidance a step in the right direction, or could it inadvertently create a regulatory loophole that crypto firms might exploit? Let’s dive deep into Crenshaw’s concerns and what this could mean for the future of crypto regulation . Why is Caroline Crenshaw Concerned About Meme Coin Guidance? Commissioner Crenshaw didn’t mince words when she voiced her disapproval. She argues that the SEC’s guidance, which essentially suggests meme coins might fall outside the agency’s regulatory purview, is fundamentally flawed. Her core argument is that this stance is incomplete and potentially dangerous for investors. Here’s a breakdown of her key concerns: Incomplete Assessment: Crenshaw believes the guidance presents an oversimplified view of meme coins . It fails to fully consider the economic realities and motivations behind these digital assets. Regulatory Loophole: Her biggest fear is that crypto firms could exploit this guidance. By simply labeling their tokens as “meme coins,” they might attempt to sidestep crucial SEC regulation and oversight. Profit Motive: Crenshaw stresses a critical point often missed in the meme coin frenzy: these coins, regardless of their playful branding, are created to generate profit. They are not just for laughs; they are financial products designed to make money for their issuers and early investors. Essentially, Crenshaw is urging the SEC to look beyond the meme label and focus on the substance. Are these assets functioning like securities? Are they being marketed and sold to raise capital? If the answer is yes, she believes they should fall under the SEC’s regulatory umbrella, regardless of whether they are called “meme coins” or anything else. The SEC’s Stance: A Closer Look at the Guidance To understand Crenshaw’s criticism, it’s important to grasp the SEC’s current position. While the exact details of the staff guidance haven’t been made fully public, the general understanding is that the SEC is considering whether some meme coins might lack the characteristics that would classify them as securities under existing securities laws. This could be due to factors such as: Decentralization Claims: Some meme coin projects may argue they are sufficiently decentralized, reducing the likelihood of centralized control and therefore, potentially falling outside the traditional securities framework. Utility vs. Investment Contract: The SEC often examines whether a digital asset represents an “investment contract,” meaning investors are pooling money with the expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others. Some meme coin proponents might argue their coins are more about community and less about this profit-seeking structure. Lack of Formal Organization: Certain meme coin projects may operate in a less structured manner compared to traditional companies, which could complicate applying securities laws designed for more conventional entities. However, Crenshaw’s critique highlights the potential dangers of focusing too narrowly on these factors without considering the broader economic context and investor protection. Is it truly sufficient to say a coin is “just a meme” and therefore exempt from basic investor safeguards? Crypto Oversight : Why Does It Matter for Meme Coins? The question of crypto oversight is particularly crucial in the context of meme coins due to their inherent volatility and often speculative nature. Here’s why robust oversight is essential: Aspect Why Oversight is Critical for Meme Coins Investor Protection Meme coins are often marketed to retail investors, many of whom may be less experienced and more vulnerable to scams and market manipulation. Oversight can help ensure fair markets and prevent fraudulent schemes. Market Integrity The meme coin market is notorious for its price swings and susceptibility to pump-and-dump schemes. Effective regulation can promote market stability and reduce the risk of manipulation. Financial Stability While individual meme coins may seem insignificant, the collective market capitalization of the crypto space is substantial. Lack of oversight in one area, like meme coins, could have ripple effects and potentially pose systemic risks. Innovation vs. Regulation Finding the right balance is key. Excessive regulation can stifle innovation, but insufficient oversight can lead to chaos and harm investors. Thoughtful regulation can foster a healthy and sustainable crypto ecosystem. Caroline Crenshaw’s stance underscores the need for a balanced approach – one that acknowledges the novelty of meme coins but doesn’t compromise on fundamental principles of investor protection and market integrity. Ignoring the financial realities of these assets simply because they are labeled as “memes” could be a recipe for disaster. The Potential Impact on Crypto Firms and the Market Crenshaw’s criticism could have significant ramifications for crypto firms operating in the meme coin space. If the SEC reconsiders its guidance and takes a more assertive regulatory approach, we could see: Increased Scrutiny: Meme coin projects might face heightened scrutiny from the SEC, potentially leading to investigations and enforcement actions. Compliance Costs: Crypto firms might need to invest more in compliance infrastructure to meet regulatory requirements, which could be costly, especially for smaller projects. Market Correction: A stricter regulatory environment could lead to a market correction in the meme coin sector, as some projects may struggle to adapt or be deemed non-compliant. Legitimacy and Maturity: In the long run, stronger regulation could actually benefit the crypto market by fostering greater legitimacy and maturity, attracting more institutional investment and mainstream adoption. The debate surrounding meme coin regulation is far from over. Caroline Crenshaw’s vocal dissent signals a potential shift in the SEC’s approach. Whether this leads to a more robust regulatory framework for meme coins remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the playful facade of meme coins cannot mask the serious regulatory questions they raise. What’s Next for Meme Coin Regulation? The future of meme coin regulation is uncertain, but here are some key developments to watch out for: SEC Response: How will the SEC respond to Commissioner Crenshaw’s criticism? Will they revise their staff guidance or double down on their current approach? Legislative Action: Could Congress step in to provide clearer guidelines for crypto regulation, including meme coins? Legislative clarity could be crucial for the long-term health of the crypto market. Court Cases: As the SEC takes enforcement actions in the crypto space, court cases will play a vital role in shaping the legal landscape and defining the boundaries of regulation. Industry Dialogue: Ongoing dialogue between regulators, industry participants, and legal experts is essential to develop practical and effective regulatory frameworks. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a regulatory environment that protects investors without stifling innovation. Finding this delicate balance will be the key challenge in navigating the evolving world of meme coins and the broader crypto market. Conclusion: The Urgent Need for Clarity in Meme Coin Regulation Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s critique of the SEC’s meme coin guidance serves as a powerful reminder that labels don’t define substance. Meme coins, despite their lighthearted origins, are part of the complex financial ecosystem and demand careful regulatory consideration. Ignoring the potential risks and regulatory loopholes would be a disservice to investors and could undermine the integrity of the broader crypto market. The call for clearer, more comprehensive crypto regulation is growing louder, and the SEC’s response to Crenshaw’s warning will be critical in shaping the future of digital asset oversight.

Elixir Network, the innovative force behind a modular blockchain solution, has just dropped a thrilling trailer video announcing its highly anticipated Token Generation Event (TGE). This is a major development for anyone tracking projects aiming to redefine decentralized finance, and especially for those interested in how blockchain technology can solve the persistent issue of liquidity in decentralized exchanges. Let’s dive into what this announcement means for the future of decentralized trading and the broader crypto ecosystem. Decoding the Hype: What is Elixir Network? Before we get into the specifics of the TGE trailer and what it signifies, it’s crucial to understand what Elixir Network is all about. In essence, Elixir Network is engineered to tackle a significant bottleneck in the current decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape: fragmented liquidity. Many decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and order book platforms suffer from a lack of deep, readily available liquidity, leading to slippage, higher transaction costs, and a less than ideal trading experience. Elixir Network steps in as a modular blockchain solution designed to aggregate and enhance liquidity across various platforms. Here’s a breakdown of what makes Elixir Network stand out: Modular Blockchain Architecture: Unlike monolithic blockchains, Elixir Network adopts a modular design. This means it’s built with specialized, interchangeable modules that can be optimized for specific functions. This architecture promises greater scalability, flexibility, and efficiency compared to traditional blockchain structures. Decentralized Order Book Liquidity: The core mission of Elixir Network is to provide robust decentralized liquidity for order book exchanges. By creating a network that aggregates liquidity from various sources, Elixir aims to make decentralized trading experiences as seamless and efficient as those on centralized exchanges. Focus on User Experience: Elixir Network is not just about technology; it’s about improving the user experience in DeFi. By enhancing liquidity, it aims to reduce slippage, offer better prices, and create a more reliable trading environment for users. Community-Centric Approach: While details are still emerging, modular blockchains like Elixir often prioritize community governance and participation. This suggests that the Elixir Network ecosystem will likely be shaped by its users and token holders. The Token Generation Event (TGE) Trailer: What We Know The recently released trailer video is the first concrete signal of Elixir Network’s upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) . While the trailer itself is likely designed to build anticipation and excitement rather than reveal all the details, it serves several key purposes: Official Announcement: The trailer formally announces to the crypto community that the TGE is on the horizon. This is a crucial step in building momentum and attracting early participants. Brand Building: A well-produced trailer can significantly boost Elixir Network’s brand visibility and recognition. It’s a way to make a strong first impression and stand out in a crowded crypto market. Community Engagement: Trailers are inherently engaging. They pique curiosity and encourage viewers to seek out more information, follow Elixir Network’s social channels, and join the community. Setting Expectations: The trailer likely hints at the vision and potential of Elixir Network, setting the stage for what the project aims to achieve post-TGE. While specific details about the TGE, such as the date, tokenomics, and participation process, are still awaited, the trailer is a strong indication that these details will be released soon. Keep an eye on Elixir Network’s official channels for further announcements. Why Decentralized Liquidity Matters The concept of decentralized liquidity is central to Elixir Network’s mission and to the broader vision of DeFi. But why is it so important? Here are a few key reasons: Reduced Reliance on Centralized Exchanges: Decentralized liquidity solutions lessen the dependency on centralized exchanges (CEXs). CEXs, while offering high liquidity, are centralized entities that pose risks like regulatory scrutiny, single points of failure, and potential for manipulation. Enhanced Security and Transparency: Decentralized systems inherently offer greater security and transparency. By distributing liquidity across a decentralized network, risks are spread out, and operations become more transparent and auditable on the blockchain. Empowerment of Users: Decentralized liquidity empowers users by giving them more control over their assets and trading activities. It aligns with the core principles of crypto – decentralization, self-custody, and financial sovereignty. Fueling DeFi Growth: Robust decentralized liquidity is fundamental for the continued growth and maturity of the DeFi ecosystem. It enables more complex financial instruments, smoother trading experiences, and broader adoption of decentralized finance. Potential Benefits of Elixir Network If Elixir Network successfully delivers on its promise, the benefits could be substantial for various stakeholders in the crypto ecosystem: Stakeholder Potential Benefits Traders and DeFi Users Lower slippage on trades Better prices and execution More efficient trading experience Increased access to liquidity Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) Enhanced liquidity depth Attraction of more users and trading volume Competitive edge against CEXs Reduced operational overhead related to liquidity provision Elixir Network Token Holders Potential for token appreciation Governance rights in the network Possible staking or yield opportunities (depending on tokenomics) Participation in the growth of a potentially transformative project Challenges and Considerations While the potential of Elixir Network and its approach to modular blockchain and decentralized liquidity is promising, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that lie ahead: Execution Complexity: Building a modular blockchain and a robust decentralized liquidity network is technically complex. The team will need to navigate numerous engineering and design challenges. Adoption and Network Effects: For Elixir Network to succeed, it needs widespread adoption by DEXs, liquidity providers, and traders. Building strong network effects is crucial. Competition: The DeFi space is highly competitive. Elixir Network will face competition from other projects tackling liquidity issues, as well as from established centralized exchanges. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for crypto and DeFi is constantly evolving. Elixir Network will need to navigate these complexities to ensure compliance and long-term sustainability. Security Audits and Reliability: As with any blockchain project, rigorous security audits and a proven track record of reliability are essential for user trust and confidence. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts So, what should crypto enthusiasts and potential participants do in light of this Token Generation Event trailer? Stay Informed: Follow Elixir Network’s official channels (website, Twitter, Telegram, etc.) for updates on the TGE, tokenomics, and project roadmap. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on hype. Conduct thorough research into Elixir Network, its team, technology, and whitepaper. Understand the risks and potential rewards. Assess the Problem it Solves: Evaluate the significance of decentralized liquidity and whether Elixir Network’s approach is a viable solution to the challenges in the DeFi space. Community Engagement: Join the Elixir Network community to ask questions, participate in discussions, and get a feel for the project’s ethos and vision. Prepare for Potential Participation: If you’re interested in participating in the TGE, understand the requirements and be prepared to act quickly when the details are announced. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of DeFi Elixir Network’s TGE trailer is more than just a promotional video; it’s a beacon signaling a potential shift towards more efficient and truly decentralized trading in the crypto world. By focusing on decentralized order book liquidity and leveraging a modular blockchain architecture, Elixir Network is positioning itself to be a key player in the ongoing evolution of DeFi. While challenges undoubtedly exist, the project’s vision and the unveiling of the TGE trailer offer a compelling reason for crypto enthusiasts to pay close attention.

For years, the cryptocurrency industry has operated under a cloud of uncertainty regarding how existing securities laws apply to digital assets. Now, it seems the SEC is directly addressing these concerns with a series of roundtables designed to foster dialogue and understanding. Is this the dawn of a new era of clear rules for crypto, or just another step in a long, complex journey? Let’s dive into what we know about these crucial upcoming events. Unpacking the SEC’s “Spring Sprint Towards Crypto Clarity” According to a recent announcement by Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett on X (formerly Twitter), the SEC Crypto Task Force is initiating a five-part roundtable series aptly named “Spring Sprint Towards Crypto Clarity.” This initiative signals a direct effort from the regulatory body to engage with the crypto industry and address the pressing need for definitive guidelines. The inaugural session is scheduled for March 21st at the SEC’s headquarters in Washington, D.C., and will zero in on a fundamental question that has plagued the crypto world: defining security status for digital assets. Here’s what we know so far about this significant development: Five-Part Series: The “Spring Sprint” indicates a comprehensive approach, suggesting the SEC intends to cover various aspects of crypto regulation over these five sessions. While the first is focused on security status, the topics of subsequent roundtables are eagerly awaited. Focus on Security Status: The initial session’s focus is incredibly pertinent. The classification of a cryptocurrency as a security or not dictates the regulatory framework it falls under, impacting everything from registration requirements to compliance obligations. SEC Crypto Task Force Led: The involvement of the SEC Crypto Task Force underscores the seriousness of this initiative. This task force is specifically dedicated to cryptocurrency matters within the SEC, suggesting a concentrated effort to tackle these issues. March 21st Kick-off: The date is set, adding a tangible timeline to this development. The crypto community will be keenly watching for insights and outcomes from this first session. Location: Washington D.C.: Holding the roundtables at the SEC offices in the nation’s capital emphasizes the official and governmental nature of these discussions. Why Does Regulatory Clarity Matter for Crypto’s Future? The absence of clear crypto regulation has been a double-edged sword for the industry. On one hand, it has allowed for rapid innovation and the emergence of a decentralized financial system. On the other, it has created significant hurdles and uncertainties that hinder mainstream adoption and institutional investment. Let’s consider why this clarity is so vital: Benefits of Regulatory Clarity: Attracting Institutional Investment: Major institutional investors often require a well-defined regulatory landscape before committing significant capital. Clarity can unlock massive inflows of institutional money into the crypto market. Fostering Innovation and Growth: Clear rules provide a framework for businesses to innovate and grow within defined boundaries, reducing the fear of inadvertently running afoul of regulations. Enhancing Investor Protection: Well-defined regulations are crucial for protecting investors from fraud and manipulation within the volatile crypto market. Promoting Market Stability: Clarity can contribute to a more stable and predictable market environment, reducing extreme volatility driven by regulatory uncertainty. Legitimizing the Industry: Clear and sensible regulations can help legitimize the crypto industry in the eyes of the public and traditional financial institutions. Challenges of Regulatory Uncertainty: Stifled Innovation: Fear of regulatory crackdowns can discourage innovation and development within the crypto space. Compliance Burdens: Uncertainty makes it difficult for crypto businesses to comply with regulations, leading to costly and potentially ineffective compliance efforts. Enforcement Actions: Lack of clarity can result in retroactive enforcement actions, catching businesses off guard and creating a chilling effect. Limited Mainstream Adoption: Regulatory ambiguity can deter mainstream users and businesses from fully embracing cryptocurrencies. Brain Drain: Talent and businesses may move to jurisdictions with clearer and more favorable regulatory environments. Crypto Roundtables: A Deep Dive into Defining Security Status The first roundtable’s focus on defining security status is arguably the most critical issue facing the crypto industry. The question of whether a digital asset should be classified as a security is not merely academic; it has profound legal and operational consequences. What is “Security Status” in Crypto? In traditional finance, securities are financial instruments like stocks and bonds that are regulated to protect investors. The SEC applies the Howey Test to determine if an asset is an “investment contract” and thus a security. The Howey Test, derived from a Supreme Court case, generally defines an investment contract as a contract, transaction, or scheme whereby a person invests money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. Applying this test to cryptocurrencies is complex. Many tokens were initially sold in token sales (ICOs) with promises of future profits based on the development efforts of the project team. This can arguably fit the Howey Test. However, many cryptocurrencies are also intended to function as utilities or currencies, blurring the lines. Why is Defining Security Status Important? Registration Requirements: If a crypto asset is deemed a security, it may need to be registered with the SEC, which involves significant compliance costs and disclosures. Broker-Dealer Regulations: Platforms trading security tokens may need to register as broker-dealers and comply with securities laws. Investor Protection Laws: Securities regulations provide various investor protections, such as disclosure requirements and anti-fraud provisions. Tax Implications: The tax treatment of securities can differ from that of other assets. Global Regulatory Landscape: Different jurisdictions have varying approaches to classifying crypto assets, creating a fragmented global regulatory landscape. The SEC’s efforts to clarify this definition through roundtables could significantly shape the future of crypto projects, exchanges, and investors in the U.S. and potentially globally. The SEC Crypto Task Force: Decoding the Regulators Understanding who is behind this “Spring Sprint Towards Regulatory Clarity ” is crucial. The SEC Crypto Task Force is the driving force. While specific members might not be publicly named for these roundtables, understanding the task force’s general mandate is insightful. Established in 2017, the SEC Enforcement Division created the Cyber Unit (later evolved into a task force with broader scope) to focus on: Cybersecurity Threats: Initially focused on cybersecurity issues related to market infrastructure and trading platforms. ICOs and Digital Assets: Expanded to include enforcement actions related to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and digital asset offerings. Crypto Fraud and Manipulation: Combating fraud and manipulation in the cryptocurrency markets. Enforcement of Securities Laws: Applying existing securities laws to the crypto space, often leading to enforcement actions against projects deemed to have offered unregistered securities. The task force’s work has been both praised for protecting investors and criticized for stifling innovation through enforcement-led regulation. These roundtables suggest a potential shift towards a more collaborative and clarity-focused approach, rather than solely relying on enforcement actions. Navigating Crypto Regulation: What Should Stakeholders Expect? These crypto roundtables are a significant development, but what should crypto businesses, investors, and enthusiasts expect? Here are some actionable insights: For Crypto Businesses: Monitor Roundtable Outcomes: Closely follow the announcements and outcomes from each roundtable session. Public summaries or reports may be released. Engage with Industry Groups: Industry associations and legal experts will likely analyze and interpret the roundtable discussions. Engage with these groups to understand the implications. Review Compliance Strategies: Be prepared to adjust compliance strategies based on any new clarity or guidelines emerging from the SEC’s initiative. Consider Legal Counsel: Seek legal advice to understand how your specific projects or businesses might be affected by evolving regulations. For Crypto Investors: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news and analysis related to the SEC roundtables and regulatory developments. Understand Security Status Risks: Be aware of the risks associated with investing in crypto assets that might be classified as securities and the implications for trading and holding those assets. Diversify Investments: As always, diversify your crypto portfolio and be mindful of regulatory risks when making investment decisions. The SEC’s “Spring Sprint Towards Crypto Clarity” roundtables represent a potentially pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Whether these discussions will truly lead to the desired regulatory clarity remains to be seen, but the initiative itself is a positive sign. By engaging directly with the industry and focusing on crucial issues like security status, the SEC is taking a necessary step towards creating a more stable, predictable, and ultimately, more innovative crypto ecosystem.

After an over 18% and 21% price drop, respectively, in the past month, market insiders are wondering if these two altcoins might recover from their ongoing woes. While XRP and SOL coins face extreme selling pressure, Remittix presale continues to hit new levels. Remittix (RTX) , on the other hand, has become the talk of the town, currently priced at $0.0694, and has raised more than $13 million. While countless tokens emerge each week, experts are pointing to Remittix as the next breakout contender. Let’s uncover XRP and Solana market trends and how projects like Remittix are the best crypto to buy right now. Solana Flashes Similar Setup to 2022 Bear Market For the first time since 2024, Solana's price dipped below $135 briefly before staging a recovery above $140. The sharp decline comes after the crypto asset failed to notch a new all-time high. Instead, the SOL coin slid by 43% in the past months. Based on historical patterns, Solana's price action reveals a deeper pullback that could be close. Its technical indicators appear similar to that of the 2022 bear market. During that period, Solana's price reached $260 in November 2021 and crashed below $10. It was during this time that the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossed above the 12 EMA, which validated the extended bearish phase. If the same thing happens, sustained crossover and negative MACD readings might suppress the SOL price. USD/SOL chart | Source: TradingView Another sign that SOL could be heading towards the 2022 bear market is the total value locked. In January, Solana’TVL neared $12 billion but has dropped to around $6 million. During the 2021 to 2022 period, the same metric collapsed. Amid this downturn, Solana investors have seen the current downturn as an opportunity to buy the dip in the hope that it might regain its bullish momentum in the coming months. XRP Price Loses Bullish Momentum The XRP token has made headlines after losing the bullish momentum it displayed in the fourth quarter and is now at a more profound risk of a deeper meltdown . The ongoing decline is primarily attributed to macroeconomic uncertainty in the United States as President Trump imposed new hefty tariffs . These tariffs have led to stagflation and forced the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates prematurely. XRP price chart| Source: CoinMarketCap Despite the decline, XRP’s fundamentals remain solid. The odds of the U.S SEC withdrawing its lawsuit against the Ripple network have improved now that the regulatory watchdog has dropped its cases against Coinbase and Uniswap. Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger ecosystem has continued to draw more developers, and speculation regarding a potential spot XRP ETF has increased. If approved, an XRP ETF could trigger billions in inflows, driving higher demand for the XRP token. Technical indicators reveal a strong bearish breakout in the coming days, as the XRP coinhas entered a danger zone. The token could crash below the $2.00 level if a bearish breakout is confirmed. Given these factors, the altcoin might decline further towards $1.6230, where it may experience a reversal. Remittix (RTX): Next Breakout Contender While Solana and Ripple carry strong brand recognition and market share, Remittix has shifted attention thanks to its disruptive PayFi platform that merges cryptocurrencies with everyday finance. By enabling users to convert crypto into fiat current and deposit funds directly to any bank account worldwide, Remittix addresses a multi-trillion-dollar industry, a sector where overhead costs, exclusion of unbanked populations, and transfer delays remain unsolved issues. For someone who works in Southeast Asia intending to send funds home to a family could experience steep fees from conventional remittance services. The transaction might even take days to process. Remittix aims to cut these costs drastically to offer a near-instant transfer at affordable rates. Users can convert over 40+ crypto pairs into 30+ fiat currencies. This tangible utility distinguishes Remittix from speculative tokens that are currently bleeding red due to market turbulence. While offering these tangible benefits to millions of unbanked individuals, Remittix promises real-world adoption. Its presale is a testament to the project’s growth potential. Remarkable, it has accumulated more than $13 million in funding as investors continue to be bullish about it. Meanwhile, early adopters have already enjoyed over 362% return after a price increase to $0.0694 from its starting price of $0.015. While no investment is without risk, market insiders believe Remittix could be the next big thing, potentially outperforming Ripple and Cardano in terms of returns. With both utility and potential for exponential gains, the RTX token has emerged as the best crypto to watch in 2025. Can Remittix Outpace XRP and Solana? While XRP and Solana continue to navigate market volatility, Remittix has quickly emerged as the next breakout contender. With strong fundamentals and high growth potential, this new PayFicoin could outshine Solana and Ripple in this cycle. For anyone seeking a better crypto investment alternative, Remittix looks promising.

Unlocking Perpetual Futures on Berachain DEXs The core announcement revolves around enabling perpetual futures trading on Berachain-based DEXs. But what are perpetual futures, and why are they important? Perpetual futures, often called ‘perps’ in the crypto world, are derivative contracts that mimic traditional futures contracts but without an expiry date. This means traders can hold positions indefinitely, speculating on the price movements of assets without the need to roll over contracts. Here’s a breakdown of why perpetual futures are a game-changer for DEXs and traders: Enhanced Trading Options: Perpetual futures expand the trading toolkit available on DEXs. Users can now not only spot trade but also engage in leveraged trading and hedging strategies using perps. Increased Liquidity: The introduction of perpetual futures can attract more liquidity to DEXs. Traders who prefer derivatives trading will find Berachain DEXs more appealing with this new offering. Sophisticated Trading Strategies: Perpetual futures enable more complex trading strategies, such as longing, shorting, and hedging, which are essential tools for experienced traders and institutions. 24/7 Markets: Like the broader crypto market, perpetual futures markets operate 24/7, offering continuous trading opportunities. By supporting perpetual futures , Orderly Network is essentially equipping Berachain DEXs with the firepower to compete with more established centralized exchanges (CEXs) and other advanced DeFi platforms in terms of trading product offerings. This is a major step in maturing the DeFi ecosystem on Berachain. Benefits of Orderly Perps for Berachain Users So, how does this integration directly benefit users within the Berachain ecosystem? The advantages are manifold and cater to various types of crypto participants: For Traders: More Trading Opportunities: Access to perpetual futures opens up new avenues for profit generation and risk management. Leverage Trading: Perps allow traders to amplify their trading positions through leverage, potentially increasing profits (and losses). Hedging Capabilities: Traders can use perps to hedge against price volatility in their spot holdings, protecting their portfolios. Deeper Liquidity: Orderly Network’s robust order book infrastructure contributes to deeper liquidity for perpetual futures on Berachain DEXs, leading to better execution and reduced slippage. For DEXs on Berachain: Attract More Users: Offering perpetual futures can attract a broader user base, including sophisticated traders and institutions seeking advanced trading tools in a decentralized environment. Increase Trading Volume: The addition of perps is likely to boost trading volume on Berachain DEXs, generating more fees and revenue for the platforms. Competitive Edge: DEXs that integrate Orderly perps gain a competitive advantage by offering a more comprehensive suite of trading products compared to those that only offer spot trading. For the Berachain Ecosystem as a Whole: Ecosystem Growth: The availability of advanced trading infrastructure strengthens the overall appeal of Berachain as a DeFi hub, attracting more projects and users. Increased TVL (Total Value Locked): As trading activity and user adoption grow, the Total Value Locked in Berachain’s DeFi ecosystem is expected to increase. Innovation Catalyst: This integration sets the stage for further innovation and development within the Berachain ecosystem, potentially leading to more sophisticated DeFi products and services. In essence, the integration of Orderly Network ‘s perpetual futures on Berachain is a synergistic move that benefits everyone involved – traders, DEXs, and the entire Berachain ecosystem. Omnichain Order Book: The Technology Behind Orderly A key aspect of Orderly Network ‘s offering is its ‘omnichain’ nature. But what does ‘omnichain order book’ really mean? It refers to an order book infrastructure that is designed to operate seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks. This is in contrast to traditional DEXs that are typically confined to a single blockchain. Here’s why the omnichain approach is crucial in today’s fragmented DeFi landscape: Cross-Chain Liquidity Aggregation: Omnichain order books can potentially aggregate liquidity from various blockchains, creating deeper and more robust markets. This addresses the issue of fragmented liquidity that often plagues DeFi. Interoperability: By being chain-agnostic, Orderly Network enhances interoperability within the DeFi space. It facilitates the flow of assets and information across different blockchains. Wider Reach: DEXs leveraging an omnichain order book can tap into a broader user base and asset pool, as they are not limited to a single blockchain’s ecosystem. Future-Proofing: The omnichain design positions Orderly Network and its integrated DEXs to adapt to the evolving multi-chain future of DeFi, where interoperability will be paramount. The technology underpinning Orderly’s omnichain capabilities is complex, involving cross-chain messaging protocols and sophisticated infrastructure to maintain order book consistency and efficiency across different chains. However, the end result is a more connected and efficient DeFi trading environment. The Future of DEX Trading with Orderly and Berachain Looking ahead, the integration of Orderly Network with Berachain marks a significant step in the evolution of decentralized exchange (DEX) trading. It’s not just about adding perpetual futures; it’s about building a more robust, versatile, and user-friendly DeFi ecosystem on Berachain. Here are some potential future implications: Expansion of Trading Products: Beyond perpetual futures, we can expect to see more sophisticated derivative products and trading instruments being introduced on Berachain DEXs, powered by Orderly Network. Increased Institutional Adoption: The availability of professional-grade trading infrastructure, like Orderly’s order book, can attract institutional investors to the Berachain DeFi ecosystem. Competition and Innovation: This integration is likely to spur further competition and innovation among DEXs, driving the development of even better trading platforms and user experiences. Broader DeFi Adoption: By making DeFi trading more accessible and feature-rich, initiatives like this contribute to the overall growth and mainstream adoption of decentralized finance. The partnership between Orderly Network and Berachain is a testament to the collaborative spirit of the crypto space. By combining their respective strengths – Orderly’s advanced trading infrastructure and Berachain’s innovative blockchain – they are paving the way for a more sophisticated and interconnected DeFi future. Conclusion: A New Era for Berachain DeFi The announcement of Orderly Network supporting Berachain is more than just a simple integration; it’s a strategic move that unlocks a new chapter for DeFi on Berachain. By enabling perpetual futures trading on Berachain DEXs, Orderly Network is empowering these platforms to offer a more comprehensive and competitive trading experience. This benefits traders with enhanced opportunities, DEXs with increased user engagement and volume, and the entire Berachain ecosystem with stronger foundations for growth and innovation.

40982634,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135564,1740790463,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking SEC Delay: Fidelity Ethereum ETF Options Approval Postponed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-fidelity-ethereum-etf/,"Just when crypto enthusiasts were gearing up for another leap in Ethereum investment accessibility, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has thrown a curveball. Solid Intel, a prominent voice in crypto news on X, has reported that the SEC has decided to delay its verdict on allowing options trading for the highly anticipated Fidelity Spot Ethereum ETF. This news has sent ripples through the crypto community, leaving many investors and market watchers wondering what’s next. Let’s dive into the details of this unexpected development and explore what it means for the future of Ethereum ETFs and the broader crypto market. Understanding the SEC ETF Delay and Its Implications The delay in approving options trading for the Fidelity Spot Ethereum ETF is a significant setback, especially considering the momentum behind spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. For those new to the ETF world, options trading adds another layer of sophistication and flexibility for investors. Essentially, options contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset (in this case, shares of the Fidelity ETH ETF) at a predetermined price within a specific timeframe. The introduction of options typically boosts trading volume and investor interest in ETFs. Here’s a breakdown of what this SEC ETF delay means: Reduced Investor Flexibility: Without options, investors are limited to simply buying and selling ETF shares. Options provide tools for hedging risk, generating income, and leveraging market movements in more complex ways. Potential Dampening of ETF Demand: While the spot Ethereum ETF itself is still a major step forward, the absence of options might make it less attractive to sophisticated traders and institutional investors who rely on options strategies. Uncertainty in Regulatory Landscape: This delay underscores the ongoing uncertainty surrounding crypto regulation in the US. It signals that the SEC is still proceeding cautiously with crypto-related investment products, even after approving spot Bitcoin ETFs. Impact on Market Sentiment: News of regulatory delays can sometimes create negative sentiment in the market, at least in the short term. Traders may interpret this as a sign of increased regulatory hurdles for crypto assets. Why the Delay? Decoding the SEC’s Crypto Regulation Stance The SEC hasn’t explicitly stated the reasons for this specific delay concerning options for the Fidelity ETH ETF. However, we can infer some potential factors based on the SEC’s general approach to crypto regulation and previous statements: Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC has consistently voiced concerns about potential market manipulation in the crypto space. Options markets, with their leverage and complexity, could be seen as adding another layer of risk in this regard. The SEC might be taking extra time to ensure sufficient safeguards are in place to prevent manipulation in Ethereum ETF options trading. Novelty of Crypto ETFs: While spot Bitcoin ETFs are now approved, the SEC is still navigating the relatively new territory of crypto-based investment products. Ethereum, while similar to Bitcoin, has its own unique characteristics and technological nuances. The SEC may be conducting further due diligence specific to Ethereum ETFs and their associated options. Broader Regulatory Framework: The SEC, along with other regulatory bodies, is likely working towards establishing a more comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Delays in specific product approvals could be part of a broader strategy to ensure that new crypto investment vehicles fit within this evolving framework. Political and Public Pressure: Regulatory decisions are often influenced by political and public sentiment. The SEC might be facing internal and external pressures to proceed cautiously with crypto approvals, especially given ongoing debates about investor protection and market stability. Fidelity ETH ETF and the Promise of Options: What’s at Stake? Fidelity’s Spot Ethereum ETF is a landmark product in itself, offering mainstream investors direct exposure to Ethereum without needing to hold the digital asset directly. The introduction of options trading on this ETF was expected to amplify its appeal and utility. Let’s consider what’s at stake with this delay: Aspect Impact of Options Trading Impact of Delay Investor Participation Wider range of investors, including sophisticated traders and institutions. Potentially limits participation to primarily buy-and-hold investors initially. Market Liquidity Increased liquidity in the ETF market due to options trading activity. May result in slightly lower initial liquidity compared to ETFs with options. Investment Strategies Enables diverse investment strategies like hedging, covered calls, and spreads. Restricts investment strategies to basic buying and selling of ETF shares. Market Efficiency Options markets can contribute to price discovery and overall market efficiency. Potentially slower price discovery and less efficient market dynamics in the short term. Navigating the Crypto Regulation Maze: What Can Investors Do? For investors closely watching the developments around the Fidelity Ethereum ETF and crypto regulation in general, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news and updates from reliable sources like Solid Intel and official SEC announcements. Understanding the evolving regulatory landscape is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes and crypto investments can help mitigate risks associated with regulatory uncertainties. Understand Risk Tolerance: Crypto investments are inherently volatile and subject to regulatory risks. Assess your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Options trading, when eventually approved, will add another layer of complexity and risk that needs careful consideration. Engage with the Community: Participate in discussions and forums within the crypto community. Sharing insights and perspectives can help you better understand market sentiment and potential future developments. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Regulatory processes can be lengthy and unpredictable. Focus on the long-term potential of Ethereum and the underlying technology, rather than getting overly fixated on short-term regulatory delays. The Future of Ethereum ETF Options: A Hopeful Outlook? While this delay is undoubtedly a setback, it’s important to maintain a balanced perspective. The SEC’s decision is a delay, not a definitive rejection. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year demonstrates a growing, albeit cautious, acceptance of crypto investment products by regulators. It is plausible that the SEC is taking a measured approach to ensure investor protection and market integrity as this new asset class matures. The demand for Ethereum ETFs and related investment vehicles is undeniable. As the crypto market continues to evolve and mature, and as regulatory frameworks become clearer, the eventual approval of options trading for Ethereum ETFs seems more like a matter of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’. Investors should remain patient, stay informed, and prepare for potential opportunities as the regulatory landscape for crypto assets continues to unfold. In conclusion, the SEC’s delay on Fidelity Ethereum ETF options is a notable development, highlighting the ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the crypto space. While it introduces a temporary hurdle, it doesn’t diminish the long-term potential of Ethereum ETFs or the broader crypto market. By staying informed and adaptable, investors can navigate these regulatory complexities and position themselves for future growth in this exciting and transformative asset class.

40982681,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135582,1740790577,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Market Relief? Trump Hints at Russia-Ukraine War End,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-market-war-end-trump/,"In a surprising turn of events that sent ripples through global markets, former U.S. President Donald Trump has declared that the protracted Russia-Ukraine conflict is approaching its conclusion. During a recent high-profile meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump’s statement has ignited a spark of optimism, particularly within the volatile cryptocurrency market. But what does this declaration truly signify for the future of digital assets? Let’s delve into the potential implications of this announcement and explore how it might reshape the crypto market landscape. Why is the Crypto Market Watching the Russia-Ukraine War? The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has been more than just a regional conflict; it’s a global event with far-reaching economic consequences. The cryptocurrency market, known for its sensitivity to geopolitical events, has been particularly reactive. Here’s why: Economic Uncertainty: Wars breed uncertainty. This uncertainty often drives investors towards safe-haven assets, but also sometimes into volatile assets like crypto for potential high returns amidst chaos. The end of the war could signal a shift towards more stable economic conditions, influencing investment strategies in the crypto market . Sanctions and Financial Flows: The conflict led to unprecedented sanctions against Russia, impacting global financial flows. Cryptocurrencies have been discussed as a potential tool to circumvent sanctions, adding another layer of complexity to the crypto market dynamics. De-escalation could alter these dynamics. Global Inflation and Interest Rates: The war exacerbated global inflation and influenced central banks’ interest rate policies. These macroeconomic factors directly affect the attractiveness of different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. A move towards peace could have implications for inflation and interest rate expectations, thus affecting the crypto market . Investor Sentiment: Geopolitical tensions significantly impact investor sentiment. War creates fear and risk aversion. Any indication of de-escalation can boost investor confidence and potentially trigger a shift towards risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Decoding the Potential War Impact on Crypto The war impact on the crypto sphere has been multifaceted. We’ve witnessed: Increased Volatility: The crypto market has seen heightened volatility in response to war-related news. Price swings have become more pronounced, reflecting the uncertainty and speculative trading around geopolitical events. Donations in Crypto: Cryptocurrencies emerged as a significant tool for donations to support Ukraine, showcasing their utility in cross-border transactions and humanitarian aid. This highlighted a practical application of crypto amidst crisis. Regulatory Scrutiny: The war and the use of crypto for sanctions evasion have intensified regulatory scrutiny of the crypto industry globally. Governments are keen to understand and regulate crypto to prevent illicit activities. Shift in Investment Narratives: The conflict has subtly shifted investment narratives around crypto. From being purely speculative assets, cryptocurrencies are increasingly being viewed through the lens of geopolitical hedging and alternative finance. Geopolitics and Crypto: A Lasting Relationship? The Russia-Ukraine war has undeniably underscored the intricate relationship between geopolitics and the crypto market. It’s no longer just about technology and finance; cryptocurrencies are now firmly in the realm of international relations and global power dynamics. Consider these points: Geopolitical Event Potential Crypto Market Reaction Escalation of Conflict Increased volatility, potential flight to safety or speculative spikes De-escalation/Peace Talks Positive market sentiment, potential price rallies in anticipation of stability New Sanctions Uncertainty, potential for increased use of crypto for alternative finance Regulatory Changes Post-Conflict Long-term shifts in market structure and compliance landscape As geopolitics continues to evolve, so too will its impact on the crypto ecosystem. Investors and enthusiasts must stay attuned to global events to navigate the crypto markets effectively. Trump’s Statement: A Turning Point? When Trump , a figure known for his market-moving pronouncements, states that the Russia-Ukraine war is “nearing an end,” it’s bound to capture attention. His remarks, delivered during a meeting with President Zelensky, suggest a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape. While details remain scant, the mere suggestion of de-escalation from a prominent global leader can have a significant psychological impact on markets. Is this wishful thinking or a grounded assessment? The market’s reaction will likely offer some clues. What Does This Crypto News Mean for You? This crypto news , stemming from Trump’s statement, carries several actionable insights for crypto enthusiasts and investors: Stay Informed: Geopolitical news is now crypto news. Keep abreast of developments related to the Russia-Ukraine situation and other global events. Manage Risk: Expect continued volatility, but be prepared for potential positive shifts if de-escalation becomes more concrete. Diversification and risk management are crucial. Watch Market Sentiment: Monitor crypto market sentiment closely. News of peace talks or de-escalation could trigger rallies. Conversely, skepticism or renewed conflict could lead to pullbacks. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is expected, consider the long-term implications. A peaceful resolution could lead to a more stable global economic environment, potentially benefiting the crypto market in the long run. The Road Ahead: Hope and Cautious Optimism Donald Trump’s assertion injects a dose of hope into a world weary of conflict. For the crypto market, it presents a glimmer of optimism amidst persistent volatility. However, it’s crucial to approach this news with cautious optimism. Statements are not guarantees, and the path to peace is rarely linear. The crypto market, while potentially poised for a relief rally, will remain sensitive to further developments. Investors should remain vigilant, informed, and prepared for all eventualities. The end of war would be a welcome development for global stability and could pave the way for a more constructive phase for the crypto market and the world at large.

Ripple’s price also failed to trade above the $2.35 resistance zone, which has seen the XRP price movement start a fresh dip. On the other hand, Binance Coin has shown impressive resilience amid the recent market downturn. Meanwhile, a new DeFi is already attracting massive interest from investors. The blockchain-based payment platform Remittix (RTX) maintains its position as a potential top altcoin to buy by addressing real-world payment hurdles globally. Its PayFi features and functional orientation have seen the RTX price rally to $0.0694, having surged by over 362%. Ethereum Price Prediction: Will ETH Fall Below $2,100 As the second largest crypto by market cap, Ethereum's attempts to hold its current range are failing as analysts predict more incoming dips. Following the recent Bybit hack, the crypto sector market experienced a market correction that sent many cryptos below key support levels. Bitcoin price dipped below the $90,000 level for the first time since November 2024. Ethereum, a top altcoin, was also not left out, recording a weekly dip of over 22% and it failed to sustain its key $2,600 support level after the market crash resumed on Monday. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez had previously warned that this support level was key for the altcoin’s bullish trend continuation, and failing to hold it could send the price of Ethereum to the $2,400 mark and below. Ethereum bearish flag risks dipping to $2,100 | Source: Carl Runefelt on X After the dip, the analyst stated that the $2,345 level was Ethereum’s next critical support zone. However, the ETH token failed to hold this level on Wednesday, dropping to $2,300. Analyst Carl Runefelt also cautioned about the top altcoin dipping nature, suggesting that Ethereum risked dropping below the $2,180 level with support near the $2,000 level. Ripple Price Wobbles at $2.00: Will Bulls Step In? The price of XRP has dipped below the $2.12 support level to enter a bearish zone. A low has been formed at $2.02 as the altcoin price struggles to remain above the $2.00 level. This Ripple price movement points at many bearish signals that could see the XRP token deep even further. XRP price movement | Source: CoinMarketCap On the upside, the price of XRP could face resistance near the $2.12 level, with the first major resistance near the $2.20 level. However, there is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.20 on the hourly chart. If XRP fails to clear this resistance level, it could continue dipping further with support near the $2.02 level with major support at $2.00 If the downside break and a close below the $2.00 level is achieved, the price of Ripple might witness another decline towards the $1.96 support. However, crypto analyst Ali Martinez also suggests that the altcoin could be gearing up for a relief rally as the TD sequential indicator flashes a buy signal. Binance Coin Shows Resilience Amid Market Dip Despite a significant dip in Binance Coin price movement after struggling to surpass the $700 level earlier this month, the BNB token has demonstrated key indicators that suggest it might be primed for a rebound. In the 2024 bull market, BNB faced several key market events, including the Grayscale GBTC sell-off and the Federal Reserve policy adjustments. Despite these hurdles, Binance Coin demonstrated resilience. Recently, the price of Binance Coin faced significant selling pressure, as its price dropped below the $600 level, touching a low of around $578, with Ali Martinez's previous post suggesting it could retrace to $380 or drop to $214. However, buyers quickly stepped in, pushing the price above the $580 level. Binance Coin price movement | Source: CoinMarketCap If the price of Binance Coin maintains the $580 level, there could be a rally towards higher resistance levels, such as the $647 and $685. However, the RSI has dipped to 36, suggesting the altcoin is nearing an oversold threshold. If the selling pressure intensifies and the BNB price fails to sustain a move above $565, a critical support level, it could face more dips toward $500. Remittix (RTX) Price Records An Over 362% Rally While crypto was meant to redefine global finance, spending digital assets in the real world is still a challenge. Financial institutions globally are tightening restrictions on crypto transactions, making it hard for users to access funds. However, Remittix (RTX) offers a solution that will ensure users can easily move their crypto tokens into fiat without the existing banking limitations. Remittix holds the potential to operate outside centralized financial control. Moreover, businesses also get to benefit from Remittix Pay API. This feature will allow businesses to embrace crypto payments and convert them to over 30-plus fiat currencies. This move could position Remittix as a top altcoin in 2025, having already recorded an over 362% price rally. Moreover, Remittix distinguishes itself through its functional merits. The asset delivers real-tangible service besides holding a significant market value. This platform exists to provide meaningful benefits to users who need its services. To start with, it eliminates intermediaries from international money transfers while delivering faster and more affordable services. Its presale success demonstrates the project’s rising consumer base. With such momentum, Remittix price could record 5000% gains in 2025, with over 500M RTX tokens already sold. Its scalability also makes it stand out from other altcoins, including Ethereum, which suffers from network congestion. With a current price tag of $0.0694 and over $13M in presale funding, Remittix is set to continue recording more gains in 2025, offering early investors the opportune chance to earn higher ROI. Will Remittix Grab The Top Altcoin Throne from Ethereum Ripple, and Cardano Ethereum and Ripple's bearish outlook could lead to more dips in the coming days as the two altcoins near an oversold level. However, Binance Coin's market resilience despite the bearish outlook could help the token regain an uptrend momentum backed by its bulls. Similarly, Remittix presents itself as the ideal choice among elite altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple and Binance coins, as it delivers both promising value and real-world usefulness.

The Bitcoin market just witnessed a massive movement that has everyone talking. In a jaw-dropping hour, over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin vanished from major cryptocurrency exchanges. According to data from CryptoQuant, a staggering 9,148.64 BTC – equivalent to a cool $1 billion – was pulled out of these platforms. This isn’t just pocket change; it’s a monumental shift that’s got analysts and investors alike scratching their heads and wondering, “What does this mean for Bitcoin?” Let’s dive into the details of these significant Bitcoin withdrawals and explore the potential implications for the crypto market. Why are These Massive Crypto Exchange Outflows Happening? The numbers are truly eye-opening. CryptoQuant’s data reveals a breakdown of where this Bitcoin leaving exchanges action originated: Coinbase Prime: A hefty 3,074 BTC departed from Coinbase Prime. Binance: Binance saw 2,652 BTC move out. Coinbase Advanced: Another 1,827 BTC was withdrawn from Coinbase Advanced. These aren’t your average retail traders making small withdrawals. CryptoQuant suggests that these large-scale crypto exchange outflows from platforms that don’t typically handle custody or OTC (Over-The-Counter) trading could indicate new wallet transfers. But what does that actually mean? Here’s a simplified breakdown of potential reasons behind such significant BTC withdrawals : Institutional Accumulation: Large entities or institutions might be accumulating Bitcoin, moving it off exchanges into their own secure wallets for long-term holding. This is often seen as a bullish signal, suggesting strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future. Shifting to Cold Storage: Investors might be moving their Bitcoin to cold storage solutions for enhanced security. Cold storage, like hardware wallets, keeps your crypto offline, significantly reducing the risk of online hacks. OTC Deals: While CryptoQuant mentioned exchanges not supporting OTC, it’s still possible that these withdrawals are related to larger OTC deals being settled off-exchange. De-risking from Exchanges: In light of past exchange collapses and security concerns, some investors may be proactively removing their Bitcoin from exchanges to minimize potential risks associated with platform vulnerabilities or regulatory uncertainties. What Does a Billion Dollar Bitcoin Outflow Signify for the Market? A billion dollar Bitcoin outflow in a single hour is not just a blip on the radar; it’s a seismic event that can ripple through the entire crypto market. So, what are the potential implications? Reduced Selling Pressure: When Bitcoin is withdrawn from exchanges, it’s generally considered to be moving into longer-term storage, effectively reducing the immediate supply available for trading. This decrease in supply can potentially lead to reduced selling pressure and, consequently, upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Bullish Sentiment Indicator: Large withdrawals are often interpreted as a sign of bullish sentiment. Investors wouldn’t move significant amounts of Bitcoin off exchanges unless they anticipated holding it for the long term and potentially expecting price appreciation. Potential Price Volatility: While reduced supply can be bullish, such large movements can also contribute to price volatility, especially in the short term. The market may react to these outflows with uncertainty before settling into a new equilibrium. Institutional Interest Confirmation: Sustained periods of large Bitcoin withdrawals could be a strong indicator of growing institutional interest and adoption. Institutions tend to make larger, longer-term investments, and moving Bitcoin into custody solutions is a characteristic of their investment strategy. Could This Be a Bullish Signal for Bitcoin? Many analysts are indeed viewing these massive Bitcoin withdrawals as a potentially bullish signal. The logic is straightforward: if large holders are removing Bitcoin from exchanges, they are likely not planning to sell it anytime soon. This reduces the available supply on exchanges and signals a longer-term holding strategy. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is complex and influenced by numerous factors. While these crypto exchange outflows are noteworthy, they are just one piece of the puzzle. Other factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and overall market sentiment, also play significant roles in Bitcoin’s price action. Actionable Insights: Monitor Exchange Balances: Keep an eye on exchange balances and withdrawal trends. Significant and sustained outflows can be an indicator of shifting market sentiment and potential price movements. Track Institutional Activity: Look for news and data related to institutional Bitcoin adoption and custody solutions. Increased institutional involvement often correlates with bullish market phases. Stay Informed, Stay Vigilant: The crypto market is dynamic. Stay updated on market news, analyze data from reputable sources like CryptoQuant, and make informed decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of the market landscape. Conclusion: A Billion Dollar Question – Where is Bitcoin Headed? The billion dollar Bitcoin question remains: where is all this Bitcoin going, and what does it truly mean for the future? While the immediate impact of these Bitcoin leaving exchanges is still unfolding, the sheer magnitude of these withdrawals cannot be ignored. It’s a potent reminder of the ever-evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market and the significant shifts that can occur in the blink of an eye. Whether this is the start of a new bullish phase, a strategic repositioning by large holders, or something else entirely, one thing is certain: the crypto world will be watching closely to see what happens next. This massive outflow certainly injects a dose of excitement and speculation into the market, leaving us all pondering the next chapter in Bitcoin’s incredible journey.

As Tesla Inc.’s stock has plummeted, so too have the fortunes of many retail investors in South Korea, who placed their bets on exchange-traded products (ETPs) designed to amplify gains. Tesla, which had become a beloved stock among South Korean investors, has seen its value decrease significantly in recent months. This has affected thousands of retail investors who were banking on ETPs that mirror Tesla’s daily price movements—particularly the Leverage Shares 3x Tesla product. According to data from South Korea’s top three brokerages, as of February 21, Korean investors owned a significant share of this product, which seeks to triple Tesla’s daily returns. That strategy, however, has not paid off, as the leveraged product is down over 80% from its high in December, while Tesla stock itself has “only” dropped by 41% in that time. Leveraged ETPs — designed to maximize gains by utilizing derivatives and rebalance daily — frequently incur deadly losses when the market moves against them. These products at times will lag their underlying assets during volatile periods. That’s precisely what we’re seeing right now, with Tesla-linked products and other high-risk assets such as Bitcoin and Chinese market-linked structured notes also plunging sharply. Korean investors reel from heavy losses in risky leveraged ETPs The huge losses among Korean investors highlight their appetite for high-risk trading that, at times, has alarmed regulators and brokers. In response to the big losses in some of the riskiest leveraged ETPs listed overseas, Mirae Asset Securities Co., one of South Korea’s largest brokerages, said it would suspend orders for such ETPs last week. Another leveraged exchange-traded fund, listed in the U.S. and offering twice the daily return on Tesla shares, has lost nearly 70% of its value since peaking on Dec. 17. According to depository data, Korean investors owned about $1.5 billion of the fund on Wednesday, or 43% of its total assets. Leveraged ETPs have become all the rage worldwide, issued in huge numbers by Wall Street firms after post-U.S. election market euphoria. But after a recent pullback in the so-called “Magnificent Seven” stocks — over the summer, stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet surged on a wave of economic uncertainty and competition from Chinese tech companies — many of these speculative products are souring. South Korean retail investors, who make up a large share of the trading volume in these kinds of instruments, are feeling the pinch amid this downturn. Many have already suffered painful losses on speculative assets, including Bitcoin and structured notes linked to the Chinese market. Tesla has been particularly popular with South Korean investors since the onset of the pandemic. As of February 21, local traders held approximately 358 billion won ($245 million) in the London-listed Leverage Shares 3x Tesla product. This represented over 90% of the fund’s assets that day. Tesla mania persists in Korea despite heavy losses in leveraged ETPs Some experts believe that despite this downturn, the appetite for leveraging Tesla-specific products remains strong. “Tesla has always been one of the most favourable stocks among Korean investors, and this craze has also naturally led to the purchase of leveraged Tesla products such as TSL3,” said Bora Kim, APAC head of strategy of ETP provider Leverage Shares. He also said the extreme volatility of Tesla shares makes them appealing to short-term traders. Tesla-linked ETPs are not alone in struggling, as leveraged ETFs across the board have had a tough time. The T-REX 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF (MSTU), an exchange-traded fund that offers investors leveraged exposure to the stock of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), is also down about 81% since its November peak, according to The Kobeissi Letter . In just three trading days, it was down 40%—the same devastating trend plaguing funds tied to Tesla. Source:Kobeissi Letter Leveraged ETFs are always riskier, and in volatile periods, they do worse than plain old ETFs because of the costs associated with daily rebalancing and the use of derivatives instead of the underlying stocks. In a study by GSR Markets, leveraged ETFs often lag similar strategies in volatile markets by more than 20%. South Korean traders face reckoning as Tesla’s decline tests high-stakes bets With pressure on Tesla’s stock, South Korean retail investors may have to re-evaluate their highly leveraged trading habits. The maker of electric vehicles is in choppier waters, facing headwinds that include increased competition, patchy demand, and macroeconomic pressures. With regulators taking more precautionary steps and brokerages pulling back on risky products, South Korean investors may need to reassess their approach. Will they double down on their aggressive bets on Tesla and other leveraged assets, or will they seek safer, more conservative investments moving forward? If the slide continues, more Korean investors may be staring at steep losses, adding to wider concern about speculative trading in the country. With regulatory scrutiny mounting and brokers taking preventative measures, it will be interesting to see if South Korean investors will continue their all-out assault on leveraged bets on Tesla or temper their approach for more conservative investments.",OP-ED|South Korea|Tesla,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|ASIA|BTC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-01 01:07:34

Forget waiting for federal mandates – Lummis believes individual states will take the initiative, establishing strategic Bitcoin reserves long before any national-level policy materializes. This isn’t just about states dipping their toes into crypto; it’s a potential paradigm shift in how governments view and utilize Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Let’s delve into why this state-led revolution in Bitcoin reserves could be on the horizon and what it means for the future of cryptocurrency in the U.S. Why State-Level Bitcoin Reserves First? Senator Lummis’s prediction, shared by Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, hinges on a crucial factor: the current level of understanding and acceptance of Bitcoin among federal lawmakers. According to Lummis, there simply isn’t sufficient comfort or consensus within the House and Senate to drive federal-level Bitcoin reserves at this juncture. This hesitancy at the federal level opens a window of opportunity for states to pioneer this innovative approach. But why are states potentially more agile and receptive to the idea of holding Bitcoin? Smaller Scale, Greater Flexibility: States often operate with more budgetary and regulatory flexibility than the federal government. This allows them to experiment with new asset classes like Bitcoin without the immediate scrutiny and bureaucratic hurdles of federal policy-making. Economic Diversification at the State Level: States are constantly seeking ways to diversify their economies and attract investment. Embracing Bitcoin reserves could position a state as a hub for technological innovation and attract businesses and individuals interested in digital assets. This forward-thinking approach can be a significant economic differentiator. Competition Among States: Just as states compete for businesses and residents, they also compete for economic relevance. If one state takes the plunge and establishes successful Bitcoin reserves , others may feel compelled to follow suit to remain competitive and avoid being left behind in the burgeoning digital economy. Grassroots Crypto Adoption: In many parts of the U.S., grassroots movements and local communities are already embracing cryptocurrencies. This groundswell of support at the state level adoption can create political pressure and pave the way for state governments to consider Bitcoin more seriously. The Strategic Importance of Bitcoin Reserves What exactly does it mean for a state to hold “strategic Bitcoin reserves,” and why is this significant? The concept draws parallels to national gold reserves or strategic petroleum reserves, assets held to ensure economic stability and security. In the digital age, Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a similar kind of strategic asset. Let’s break down the potential benefits: Potential Benefits of State Bitcoin Reserves Benefit Description Economic Diversification Holding Bitcoin diversifies a state’s treasury beyond traditional assets like fiat currency and bonds. Bitcoin’s uncorrelated nature to traditional markets can act as a hedge against economic downturns and inflation. Technological Innovation Hub States embracing Bitcoin signal a commitment to technological innovation and attract businesses and talent in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. This can foster economic growth and create high-paying jobs. Future-Proofing State Finances As the world becomes increasingly digital, holding digital assets like Bitcoin can position a state for the future of finance and potentially provide long-term appreciation as Bitcoin adoption grows globally. Attracting Younger Demographics Embracing Bitcoin can appeal to younger, tech-savvy demographics, potentially attracting them to live and work in states that are perceived as forward-thinking and innovative in the digital space. Challenges and Considerations for State-Level Bitcoin Adoption While the potential benefits are compelling, establishing Bitcoin reserves at the state level is not without its challenges. States considering this move must carefully navigate a complex landscape. Here are some key considerations: Navigating the Challenges of Crypto Regulation Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving, both at the federal and state level adoption . States need to ensure compliance with existing and future regulations, which can be a moving target. Volatility Management: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a well-known characteristic. States need robust risk management strategies to mitigate potential losses due to price fluctuations. This might involve dollar-cost averaging, secure storage solutions, and clear guidelines for reserve management. Security and Custody: Securely storing and managing Bitcoin reserves is paramount. States must invest in robust cybersecurity infrastructure and consider using reputable custodians to safeguard their digital assets from theft or loss. Public Education and Transparency: Public understanding of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is still limited. States need to educate their citizens about the rationale behind holding Bitcoin reserves and ensure transparency in their management of these assets to build public trust and acceptance. Political Will and Support: Implementing such a novel policy requires strong political will and bipartisan support within state legislatures. Overcoming skepticism and securing the necessary legislative approvals can be a significant hurdle. Examples from Around the Globe: Learning from Others While no U.S. state has yet officially declared holding Bitcoin as part of its strategic reserves, other countries and regions have already begun exploring this path. El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender and its Bitcoin reserves are perhaps the most prominent example. While controversial, it offers valuable lessons in both the opportunities and challenges of integrating Bitcoin into a national economy. Furthermore, companies like MicroStrategy have demonstrated the potential of holding Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset, providing a model that states could potentially adapt. Cynthia Lummis: A Champion for Digital Assets Senator Cynthia Lummis’s advocacy for Bitcoin and digital assets is well-documented. She is one of the most vocal and informed voices in the U.S. Senate on cryptocurrency matters. Her prediction about state level adoption of Bitcoin reserves isn’t just a casual observation; it’s likely based on her deep understanding of the political landscape and the growing momentum behind crypto adoption at various levels. Lummis’s continued efforts to educate her colleagues and promote sensible crypto regulation are crucial for fostering a more favorable environment for digital assets in the U.S. Actionable Insights for States Considering Bitcoin Reserves For states contemplating following Senator Lummis’s predicted path and establishing Bitcoin reserves , here are some actionable insights: Form a Crypto Task Force: Create a dedicated task force comprising experts in cryptocurrency, finance, cybersecurity, and law to study the feasibility and implications of holding Bitcoin reserves. Conduct a Pilot Program: Start with a small-scale pilot program to acquire and manage a modest amount of Bitcoin reserves. This allows for learning and refinement of strategies before committing to larger holdings. Develop Robust Security Protocols: Prioritize the development of top-tier security protocols for storing and managing Bitcoin, potentially partnering with established custodians. Engage in Public Education: Launch public education initiatives to inform citizens about Bitcoin, its potential benefits and risks, and the state’s rationale for considering it as a reserve asset. Collaborate with Other States: Share knowledge and best practices with other states exploring similar initiatives to create a collaborative ecosystem for state level adoption of digital assets. The Dawn of State-Level Bitcoin Strategies? Senator Lummis’s prediction paints a compelling picture of a bottom-up approach to Bitcoin adoption in the U.S., driven by individual states taking the lead. While federal crypto regulation and acceptance may still be on the horizon, the agility and economic incentives at the state level could indeed pave the way for a decentralized and innovative approach to integrating Bitcoin into government treasuries. Whether Lummis’s forecast proves accurate remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly sparks an important conversation about the strategic role of Bitcoin in the future of state finances and the broader U.S. economy. The potential for states to become pioneers in digital assets is a fascinating prospect, and one that the crypto world – and indeed, the financial world – will be watching closely.

Recent data from IntoTheBlock, a leading crypto market intelligence platform, is hinting at a potentially pivotal moment for Bitcoin. A surge in Bitcoin active addresses , reaching levels not seen since December 2024, has caught the attention of analysts. Could this be a mere blip, or is it a significant indicator of something bigger brewing in the Bitcoin market? Let’s dive deep into what this on-chain activity spike could mean for you and the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the Surge in Bitcoin Active Addresses IntoTheBlock’s recent X (formerly Twitter) post highlighted a compelling trend: Bitcoin active addresses have reached their highest daily count since December 2024. But what exactly does this mean? Active addresses refer to the number of unique wallet addresses participating in Bitcoin transactions on a given day. A spike in this metric typically indicates increased network utilization and can be triggered by various factors, both bullish and bearish. In this instance, IntoTheBlock suggests it might be pointing towards a specific, often dramatic market event: capitulation. To understand the significance, let’s break down what active addresses tell us: Increased Network Activity: More active addresses directly translate to more transactions happening on the Bitcoin blockchain. This could be due to increased buying, selling, or simply movement of Bitcoin between wallets. Market Interest: A surge can suggest renewed interest in Bitcoin, either from new entrants or existing holders becoming more active. Potential Turning Points: Historically, spikes in on-chain activity, including active addresses, have coincided with both market peaks and troughs. This is because significant market movements often drive increased transactional activity as investors react to price changes. However, it’s crucial to not look at this metric in isolation. Context is key. Let’s explore why IntoTheBlock is specifically pointing towards a market capitulation scenario. Is Market Capitulation Imminent? Unpacking the Signal Market capitulation is a dramatic and often painful phase in a market cycle. It typically occurs at the end of a downtrend and is characterized by: Panic Selling: Investors, overwhelmed by fear and losses, sell off their assets aggressively, often regardless of price. Price Bottoms: Capitulation often marks or closely precedes the bottom of a price decline. The intense selling pressure can purge weak hands from the market, paving the way for a potential recovery. High Volume: Capitulation events are usually accompanied by exceptionally high trading volume as masses rush to exit their positions. IntoTheBlock’s analysis suggests that the spike in Bitcoin active addresses could be a signal of this capitulation phase. Why? Because capitulation events are inherently high-activity periods. Think about it: if many holders are panicking and selling, you’d expect to see a significant jump in on-chain transactions and, consequently, active addresses. (Replace “image-url.jpg” and adjust caption ID as needed. This is a placeholder for an image depicting the relationship between Bitcoin active addresses and price, if available). However, it’s essential to approach this interpretation with caution. While historical data shows correlations, correlation doesn’t equal causation. Let’s consider other factors that could contribute to increased on-chain activity . Beyond Capitulation: Other Drivers of On-Chain Activity While market capitulation is a compelling interpretation, it’s not the only possible explanation for a surge in on-chain activity . Other factors can also drive up Bitcoin active addresses: Bull Market Peaks: Conversely, market tops in bull runs also see high on-chain activity. As prices reach new highs, investors might be taking profits, moving funds to exchanges, or engaging in increased trading, all contributing to higher active addresses. Network Upgrades or Events: Significant network upgrades or anticipated events (like the Bitcoin halving) can increase activity as users prepare their wallets or move funds in anticipation of changes. Whale Activity: Large transactions from whales (major Bitcoin holders) can significantly impact active address counts. A few large entities moving substantial amounts of BTC can skew the daily numbers. Increased Adoption: Gradual, organic growth in Bitcoin adoption over time will naturally lead to a higher baseline of active addresses. Therefore, to accurately interpret the current spike, we need to consider the broader crypto market signals and context. Are we seeing widespread panic across the crypto market? Are other indicators, like exchange inflows, also pointing to selling pressure? Or are there other events that could be inflating on-chain metrics? Navigating Crypto Market Signals: Actionable Insights for You So, what should you, as a crypto investor or enthusiast, take away from this analysis of Bitcoin active addresses ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed, Don’t Panic: The increase in active addresses is an interesting data point, but it’s not a definitive prediction of capitulation. Use it as a signal to dig deeper, not to trigger impulsive decisions. Look at Multiple Indicators: Don’t rely solely on one metric. Analyze other on-chain data (exchange flows, transaction volume, miner activity), price charts, and broader market sentiment to form a holistic view. Assess Market Sentiment: Is there widespread fear and negative sentiment in the crypto market? News headlines, social media discussions, and crypto fear & greed indices can provide clues. Consider Your Strategy: Whether this is capitulation or not, have a clear investment strategy. Are you a long-term holder? A trader? Your approach will dictate how you react to market signals. Prepare for Volatility: Regardless of whether capitulation is truly happening, heightened on-chain activity often precedes periods of increased volatility. Be prepared for potential price swings. The Turning Point for BTC? A Cautious Conclusion IntoTheBlock’s observation of surging Bitcoin active addresses is a valuable piece of the puzzle in understanding the current state of the crypto market. It raises the possibility that we might be approaching a significant BTC turning point , potentially a market capitulation event. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is just one indicator. A comprehensive analysis requires considering a range of factors and market signals. While the data is intriguing and warrants attention, it’s not a definitive call to action in itself. Instead, it serves as a prompt to exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and remain vigilant as the crypto market continues to unfold. The coming days and weeks will be crucial in confirming whether this surge in active addresses truly signals a capitulation moment or if it’s driven by other underlying dynamics.

40983302,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135609,1740791778,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Claim: Trump Declares Zelensky ‘Not Ready for Peace’ – Crypto Market Impact?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-zelensky-peace-talks-crypto/,"In a dramatic turn of events that could send ripples across global markets, including the volatile crypto sphere, former U.S. President Donald Trump has made a startling claim about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to Trump, Zelensky is ‘not ready for peace’ despite significant U.S. intervention in the ongoing conflict. This revelation, shared on Trump’s social media platform Truth Social, raises critical questions about the future of Ukraine peace talks and the potential ramifications for international stability and financial markets. Is Zelensky’s Peace Stance a Setback for Global Stability? Trump’s statement directly challenges the prevailing narrative of Ukraine’s eagerness for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. He asserts that despite a ‘meaningful meeting’ at the White House, Zelensky’s demeanor and negotiating position indicate a lack of readiness for genuine peace. This is particularly noteworthy considering the substantial US intervention Ukraine has provided, including billions in aid and military support, which Trump suggests should give Ukraine a stronger hand at the negotiating table. Here’s a breakdown of Trump’s key assertions: Direct Meeting: Trump confirms a recent meeting with Zelensky at the White House, implying a direct and personal assessment of the Ukrainian leader’s mindset. Peace Readiness Questioned: Trump explicitly states Zelensky ‘does not seem ready for peace yet,’ casting doubt on Ukraine’s current diplomatic approach. US Leverage Ignored: Trump claims Zelensky has ‘ignored the U.S.,’ suggesting a disregard for American influence and advice in the peace process. Open Door for Future Engagement: Despite the current impasse, Trump leaves the door open for future dialogue, stating Zelensky ‘can come back when he is ready for peace.’ This isn’t the first indication of potential friction between the two leaders. Reports of a ‘heated argument’ during their meeting further fuel speculation about disagreements on strategy and objectives. The core question now is: what does this mean for the already fragile geopolitical landscape, and how might it impact the crypto market impact Ukraine conflict? Analyzing the Potential Impact of Trump’s Statement Trump’s pronouncements, especially on international matters, carry significant weight. His assertion about Zelensky peace stance not only affects diplomatic relations but could also have broader consequences: Eroding Confidence in Peace Prospects: If a major global player like Trump believes peace is not imminent due to Zelensky’s stance, it could dampen international optimism and efforts towards a negotiated settlement. Shifting Geopolitical Dynamics: This statement might signal a potential shift in U.S. policy or approach towards the Ukraine conflict, especially if Trump were to regain political power. Market Volatility: Geopolitical instability is a known driver of market volatility. Uncertainty surrounding the Ukraine peace talks could trigger fluctuations in traditional financial markets and, notably, in the cryptocurrency market, which often reacts sharply to global events. Investor Sentiment: Negative news regarding peace prospects can impact investor sentiment. In the crypto market, which is heavily influenced by sentiment, this could lead to increased selling pressure or a shift towards safer assets. A visual representaton of the tense meeting between Trump and Zelensky. Source: AI Generated Image Navigating Crypto Investments Amidst Geopolitical Uncertainty For cryptocurrency investors, understanding the interplay between global politics and market movements is crucial. Events like stalled Trump Zelensky peace discussions introduce uncertainty, which can translate into both risks and opportunities in the crypto market. Here are some actionable insights for crypto enthusiasts: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of geopolitical developments and their potential market implications. News aggregators, crypto news platforms, and financial analysis sites can be valuable resources. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification remains a key strategy in volatile times. Spreading investments across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes can mitigate risk. Manage Risk: Employ risk management tools like stop-loss orders and consider adjusting your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and market outlook. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that the crypto market is known for its cyclical nature. Focus on long-term investment strategies rather than getting swayed by short-term market fluctuations driven by geopolitical news. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Peace and Markets Trump’s assertion that Zelensky is ‘not ready for peace’ marks a potentially critical juncture in the Ukraine conflict and its global repercussions. For the cryptocurrency market, already navigating its own inherent volatility, this adds another layer of complexity. Investors need to remain vigilant, informed, and adaptable as the situation unfolds. The path to peace, and its impact on the global financial landscape, including the crypto world, remains uncertain, demanding careful observation and strategic decision-making.

Here’s what Polymarket predictions say,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/doge-major-goals-polymarket-predictions/,"Elon Musk’s DOGE has devised strategies to cut the federal budget, from auditing Fort Knox gold reserves to creating a DOGE dividend. However, sentiment on betting markets like Polymarket suggests that these plans may be too ambitious. DOGE has taken extreme measures to fulfill its goals, such as major layoffs from several government agencies and the shutdown of the US Agency of International Development. According to DOGE’s official savings tracker , the organization has saved $65 billion of the government’s budget to date. However, this achievement has not won bettors’ confidence in DOGE’s future promises. Overall, their hopes seem to be low based on Polymarket data. Polymarket bettors aren’t positive about the budget being cut by 5% in 2025 Elon Musk aimed for budget cuts of up to $2 trillion. He said reaching half that amount would be “an epic outcome.” Federal government spending reached $6.9 billion in 2024, which means that DOGE will have to cut $345 billion to hit the 5% mark in 2025. According to Polymarket’s predictions, Musk’s 5% cut is unlikely to happen, as 74% of bettors predicted against it. Chances of Elon musk cutting the budget by at least 5%.

What a time. https://t.co/hrhZmO5N6u pic.twitter.com/Ws9wI3Cxej — Deva Hazarika (@devahaz) February 10, 2025 A user on X @electricfutures revealed the number of mistakes made by DOGE when logging in the FPDS database, and mentioned that the agency is now doing “damage control.” The user said that despite making the corrections, DOGE still claims to have saved $55 billion. He added that the actual total savings would be around 32.5 billion, which is still “a huge overestimate.” And despite applying most of the changes I called for in my original thread, they STILL CLAIM TO HAVE SAVED $55B. The savings listed dropped from $16.5B to $6.5B! If this is 20% of the total, like they also claim, the total would be $32.5B! (In reality still a huge overestimate!) — Momentum Chaser (@electricfutures) February 20, 2025 The agency also allegedly counted one contract three times to reach $2 billion in savings. It also reported another IT contract’s saving of $1 billion, but its spending was already at 80%. DOGE has already corrected these errors. However, @Electricfutures on X says that despite correcting these errors, DOGE “did NOT change the underlying flaws in how they were estimating savings for any of the other contracts.” Post by @Electricfutures on X.

This clause should not be interpreted as a lack of commitment, but rather as a pragmatic approach to ensuring the long-term health and sustainability of the BNB Chain ecosystem growth . The Impact on BNB Chain and Beyond What are the potential ripple effects of CZ’s initiative? The weekly liquidity support is poised to have a multi-faceted impact: Impact Area Potential Benefits DeFi Ecosystem Enhanced stability for DeFi protocols, increased trading volumes, and reduced slippage. Developer Activity More attractive environment for developers to build and deploy applications, leading to innovation. User Experience Smoother transactions, better prices, and increased confidence in the BNB Chain network. BNB Token Value Potential positive impact on BNB price due to increased ecosystem activity and demand. Market Perception Reinforces Binance’s commitment to the BNB Chain, strengthening its reputation in the crypto space. This strategic move by CZ Binance is not just about injecting funds; it’s about injecting confidence, stability, and growth potential into the BNB Chain. It’s a testament to the power of proactive ecosystem support and community engagement in the ever-evolving world of blockchain technology. Actionable Insights for the BNB Chain Community So, what does this mean for you, the BNB Chain community member? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official Binance and BNB Chain channels for updates on the liquidity injection program and any adjustments. Engage with the Community: Participate in discussions and provide feedback on initiatives like the returned funds allocation. Explore BNB Chain Opportunities: With increased liquidity and ecosystem growth, now might be an opportune time to explore DeFi projects, NFTs, and other applications within the BNB Chain ecosystem. Monitor Market Trends: Observe how this liquidity injection impacts BNB price and overall market sentiment towards the BNB Chain. By staying informed and actively participating, you can maximize the benefits of this exciting development within the BNB Chain ecosystem. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Brighter BNB Chain Future CZ’s commitment to providing weekly BNB liquidity is a bold and commendable step towards fostering a more robust, vibrant, and sustainable BNB Chain ecosystem.

Chinese mining machine manufacturer Intchains just dropped their 2024 fiscal year earnings report, and the numbers are absolutely mind-blowing. Buckle up, because it seems the Dogecoin craze, fueled by none other than Elon Musk and Donald Trump, has sent Doge mining rig orders into orbit. Let’s dive into the details of this explosive growth and what it means for the crypto landscape. Why the Sudden Explosion in Doge Mining Rig Orders? Intchains, a key player in the altcoin mining hardware market, specifically pointed to the influence of two major figures: U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Both personalities are known for their vocal support and sometimes meme-driven engagement with Dogecoin. This endorsement appears to have directly translated into a massive spike in interest and demand for Doge mining rig equipment. Think about it – when Elon Musk tweets about Dogecoin, the crypto market often reacts. Similarly, any positive mention or association from a figure like Donald Trump can amplify interest, especially among retail investors. This celebrity-driven hype, combined with the inherent speculative nature of cryptocurrency, has created a perfect storm for Doge mining rig manufacturers like Intchains. Intchains’ Staggering Growth: By the Numbers The earnings report speaks for itself. Intchains isn’t just seeing a slight uptick; they’re experiencing a full-blown surge. Let’s break down the key figures that highlight this incredible growth: Sales Revenue Soars: Intchains reported a staggering $38.6 million in sales. Net Income Rockets: Their net income reached $8.3 million. Year-over-Year Growth: This represents a jaw-dropping 242% increase in net income compared to the previous year. ASIC Chip Sales Explode: They sold 2.68 million ASIC chips. Increase in ASIC Chip Sales: This is an impressive 84% jump in ASIC chip sales from the year before. These numbers paint a clear picture: the demand for mining machine orders , particularly for Doge mining, is through the roof. Intchains is struggling to keep up with the overwhelming influx of orders, indicating a supply-demand imbalance in the market. The Power of ASIC Chips in Doge Mining ASIC chips, or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, are the workhorses of modern cryptocurrency mining. For Dogecoin mining, specialized ASICs are far more efficient than using general-purpose CPUs or GPUs. Intchains’ success is directly linked to their ability to produce and sell these high-performance ASIC chips . Here’s why ASIC chips are so crucial for profitable Doge mining: Efficiency: ASICs are designed specifically for one task – in this case, solving the complex cryptographic algorithms required for mining. This specialization makes them incredibly energy-efficient compared to general-purpose hardware. Hash Rate Dominance: ASICs deliver significantly higher hash rates (the speed at which a miner can solve calculations) than CPUs or GPUs. A higher hash rate means a greater chance of successfully mining blocks and earning rewards. Profitability: In the competitive world of crypto mining, efficiency and hash rate directly translate to profitability. ASICs give miners a competitive edge, making Doge mining more economically viable, especially when Dogecoin prices are favorable. The surge in mining machine orders and ASIC chip sales reported by Intchains underscores the continued importance of specialized hardware in the crypto mining ecosystem. Challenges and Opportunities in the Doge Mining Boom While the surge in demand for Doge mining rig equipment is undoubtedly positive for Intchains and the broader mining industry, it also presents some challenges and opportunities. Challenges: Supply Chain Constraints: Meeting the soaring demand can strain supply chains. Manufacturing ASIC chips is complex and relies on global semiconductor supply chains, which can be vulnerable to disruptions. Competition: The profitability of Doge mining attracts competitors. As more manufacturers enter the market or existing players ramp up production, competition could intensify, potentially impacting profit margins in the long run. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Dogecoin prices can fluctuate dramatically, impacting the profitability of mining. A significant price drop could dampen enthusiasm and reduce demand for mining equipment. Environmental Concerns: Crypto mining, particularly using energy-intensive ASICs, raises environmental concerns about energy consumption. The industry is under increasing pressure to adopt more sustainable practices. Opportunities: Technological Innovation: The Doge mining boom can drive innovation in ASIC chip technology, leading to even more efficient and powerful mining hardware. Market Expansion: Increased interest in Doge mining can attract new participants to the crypto space, expanding the overall market. Revenue Diversification: For companies like Intchains, the surge in demand provides an opportunity to diversify revenue streams and solidify their position in the market. Increased Adoption of Dogecoin: A thriving mining ecosystem can contribute to the overall health and adoption of Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors What can we learn from Intchains’ explosive growth and the mining machine orders surge? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Market Trends: Pay close attention to market signals, including social media trends, celebrity endorsements, and technological advancements in mining hardware. These factors can significantly impact crypto prices and mining profitability.

Brace yourselves, crypto enthusiasts, because Whale Alert, the crypto transaction watchdog, has reported a massive USDT mint . A staggering 1,000 million USDT , yes, you read that right – one billion – has been freshly minted at the Tether Treasury. This monumental injection of Tether has sent ripples across the digital asset landscape, leaving many wondering: What does this mean for the volatile crypto market ? Let’s dive deep into this fascinating development and unpack the potential implications. Why a 1 Billion USDT Mint is Big News for the Crypto Market For those new to the crypto space, understanding what USDT and Tether are is crucial. Tether is the issuer of USDT , a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. In simple terms, one USDT is designed to be worth one US dollar. This stability makes USDT a cornerstone of the crypto market , acting as a bridge between traditional fiat currency and the often-turbulent world of cryptocurrencies. Think of it as the digital dollar within the crypto ecosystem. Now, when we see a billion-dollar USDT mint , it’s not just another day in crypto. It’s a significant event that can signal various market movements and strategies. Let’s break down why this is such a big deal: Increased Liquidity: A massive USDT mint injects substantial liquidity into the crypto market . This fresh capital can potentially fuel buying pressure across various cryptocurrencies, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to altcoins. Potential Market Uptrend: Historically, large USDT mints have sometimes preceded or coincided with bullish phases in the crypto market . Traders often interpret it as a sign that there’s anticipated demand for buying cryptocurrencies. Exchange Readiness: Cryptocurrency exchanges require USDT to facilitate trading pairs. Minting such a large amount could indicate that exchanges are preparing for increased trading volume and user activity. Institutional Interest: Significant USDT mints can also hint at growing institutional interest and investment in the crypto market . Institutions often use stablecoins like USDT to enter and exit crypto positions efficiently. Decoding the USDT Mint: Is it a Bullish Signal for Stablecoin and Crypto? So, is this billion-dollar USDT mint definitively a bullish signal? While it’s tempting to jump to conclusions and shout “bull run!”, the reality is more nuanced. Let’s explore both the potential positives and factors that warrant a cautious approach. Potential Benefits of a Large USDT Mint Market Expansion: The influx of USDT can act as rocket fuel for the crypto market . More capital available means more potential for growth, innovation, and wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): While it might seem counterintuitive, increased liquidity from stablecoin injections can sometimes reduce extreme volatility. A more liquid market can absorb larger trades without causing drastic price swings. Opportunities for Traders: For seasoned crypto traders, a large USDT mint can present exciting opportunities. It could signal the start of upward price movements, allowing for strategic entries into various crypto assets. Growth of the Stablecoin Ecosystem: The continued minting and adoption of USDT reinforces the importance of stablecoins within the crypto ecosystem. They are vital for trading, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), and remittances. Challenges and Considerations around USDT and Stablecoins Despite the potential upsides, it’s crucial to approach this USDT mint with a balanced perspective. There are challenges and considerations to keep in mind when dealing with Tether and stablecoins in general: Transparency Concerns: Tether has faced scrutiny in the past regarding the reserves backing USDT . While they have increased transparency in recent years, questions about the full backing of USDT have lingered. Regulatory Landscape: Stablecoins are under increasing regulatory attention globally. Future regulations could impact the operations of Tether and the broader stablecoin market. Market Manipulation Risks: Due to its significant market cap and influence, USDT and its minting activity are sometimes scrutinized for potential market manipulation. It’s important to be aware of these discussions, although no direct evidence of manipulation related to this specific mint is presented here. De-pegging Risks: Although designed to be stable, stablecoins can, in rare instances, de-peg from their intended value. While USDT has largely maintained its peg, the risk, however small, always exists. Examples of Past USDT Mints and Market Reactions To gain a better understanding of how the crypto market typically reacts to large USDT mints, let’s look at a few past examples. Analyzing historical data can offer insights, though past performance is never a guarantee of future results. Date of Mint Amount (USDT) Subsequent Market Reaction (Approx. within 1-2 weeks) Context/Market Sentiment at the Time Early 2021 Multiple large mints (billions) Significant Bull Run Growing institutional adoption, DeFi boom Mid 2022 Large mints amidst market downturn Market stabilization attempts, mixed reactions Bear market, liquidity concerns Late 2023 Moderate mints Gradual market recovery Signs of market bottoming, renewed optimism These examples show a correlation, but not necessarily direct causation, between USDT mints and crypto market movements. Market sentiment, broader economic factors, and other news events also play crucial roles. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Enthusiasts Do? So, what should you, as a crypto enthusiast, do with this information about the billion USDT mint ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on crypto market news and analysis. Follow reputable sources like Whale Alert and other crypto news outlets to stay updated on market developments. Monitor Market Sentiment: Gauge the overall market sentiment. Are analysts and traders generally bullish or bearish following this USDT mint ? Social media and crypto forums can provide sentiment indicators. Review Your Portfolio: Consider how this news might impact your existing crypto portfolio. Are you positioned to benefit from a potential market uptrend? Should you rebalance your holdings? Exercise Caution: While a large USDT mint can be exciting, always exercise caution. The crypto market is inherently volatile. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, and diversify your portfolio. DYOR (Do Your Own Research): Never rely solely on news headlines. Conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Understand the projects you are investing in and the broader market dynamics. Conclusion: A Billion USDT Mint – A Potential Catalyst or Just Noise? The minting of 1,000 million USDT is undoubtedly a noteworthy event in the crypto market . It’s a significant injection of liquidity that could potentially act as a catalyst for market growth. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is complex and influenced by numerous factors. While history suggests a possible bullish correlation, this USDT mint alone doesn’t guarantee a bull run. It’s essential to consider the broader market context, regulatory developments, and inherent risks associated with stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, this billion-dollar USDT mint serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the crypto market . Stay vigilant, stay informed, and navigate this exciting space with a blend of enthusiasm and prudence.

Could these memecoins be getting ready for a big climb? Concurrent with this is a newcomer known as Remittix (RTX) , upsetting the cross-border payments industry. Some believe it might be the next 1000x crypto story. Analyzing the most recent price movement of Dogecoin and PEPE, this article exposes significant support levels and professional projections. You will also discover why Remittix is becoming popular among investors since it presents a novel approach to transfer money internationally. Dogecoin's (DOGE) Wild Ride: A Bumpy But Hopeful Path Over the past week, the Dogecoin price has dropped sharply— over 27% . The fall did not follow any consistency. The Dogecoin price chart instead shows ups and downs before a major negative move. The price first stayed between $0.262 and $0.232. Then, a large breakout sent it down into the $0.180 zone. Over the past month, the meme coin lost more than 44% of its value. Still, the Dogecoin community hopes for a bullish reversal. Some observers believe this fall follows a more widespread pattern. Notable trader Trader Tardigrade notes that Dogecoin is acting historically. He counsels seeing the whole picture rather than emphasizing temporary declines. Meanwhile, technical indications produce conflicting signals. The trend-based indicator MACD points to a purchasing opportunity. However, the Momentum Oscillator tracks the rapidity of price fluctuations and shows selling pressure. PEPE at a Critical Level: A Make-or-Break Moment Over the previous week, the PEPE price has declined drastically and has now fallen over 24% . However, the fall wasn't consistent. The PEPE coin first consolidated between $0.0000102 and $0.0000089, according to the PEPE price chart. The PEPE price then dropped to $0.0000073 as a result of the bearish breakout. PEPE has dropped more than 40% of its value throughout the past month. The community is still hopeful, nonetheless, thinking a comeback is just around the corner. The support around the $0.0000073 zone strikes analysts as a crucial zone. Based on the current market structure, a massive rally could be ahead, claims Rose Premium Signals . Meanwhile, mixed signals from technical indicators also reflect on the PEPE price chart. Moving Averages—which track market trends over time—suggest selling pressure. Tracking price speed, the Momentum Oscillator also suggests weakness. Remittix (RTX) Is Transforming Cross-Border Payments For individuals looking for significant gains in the quickly expanding cross-border payments industry, Remittix is becoming the best crypto investment. It offers rapid, low-cost crypto-to-fiat conversions employing superior blockchain technology. Moreover, Remittix charges a flat 1% price with no hidden fees or delays, unlike conventional services like Stripe and Wise. Additionally, Remittix supports more than a hundred cryptocurrencies, therefore facilitating user conversion of digital assets into fiat. By its innovation, which removes the inefficiencies of past banking systems, Remittix is positioned as a leader in the $150 trillion global payments market. Among investors, Remittix is greatly sought after. After already raising more than $13 million, only a few months have seen sales of almost 510 million RTX tokens. At a current price of $0.0694, RTX offers early adopters an unmatched entrance point. As Remittix gets ready for listing on tier-1 centralized and decentralized exchanges, its market presence and liquidity will increase. By use of a BlockSAFU-certified smart contract, the platform assures security and openness. This makes RTX not only the best crypto investment but also a major player in the direction of digital finance going forward. Dogecoin, PEPE, or Remittix? The Smartest Move Right Now Though their near-term trajectories are yet uncertain, Dogecoin and PEPE may have great returns ahead. Remittix is stealthily positioned as the next great thing in the meantime. Unlike speculative memecoins, RTX is tackling a real-world problem—fast, cheap cross-border payments. With a nominal 1% charge, strong investor demand, and upcoming exchange listings, Remittixcould be the next 1000x crypto success story. Don't wait till RTX skyrockets. With almost 510 million tokens sold and over $13 million raised within a few months, early adoption is swiftly closing. Meanwhile, the presale is fast selling out, and the total RTX token supply is limited.

Though there are plenty of opportunities in the industry, where should you concentrate your efforts given so many choices? Despite the uncertainties of the current market, in this article, we look at the top altcoinsthat might be set for a significant rise. You will learn which initiatives are viable in the long term. From SUI's turbulent but exciting price action to Toncoin's possible comeback, Sonic's ecosystem development, Hedera's breakthrough possibility, and Remittix's game-changing financial solution, we dissect what makes these five cryptocurrencies unique and why you might wish to add them to your portfolio. SUI Faces Volatility but Holds Long-Term Potential Over 24% of the SUI price was lost last week. According to the SUI price chart, the altcoin first consolidated between $3.60 and $3.10 before declining. This bearish breakout drove the SUI coin to $2.50. SUI has dropped more than 28% of its value throughout the past month. Traders still have hope despite this decline, though. Based on a chart analysis, analyst PROFIT BLUE implied that SUI might rally above $40 in the long term following this downturn. Technical indications contradict one another. Moving averages show purchase suggestions when tracking trend changes over time. Though it measures price speed, the Momentum Oscillator nevertheless shows selling pressure. A similar weakness is indicated by the Commodity Channel Index (CCI). Though there is always some short-term volatility, analysts see SUI's long-term prospects as positive. Toncoin Faces Decline but Analysts See Bullish Potential Over the past week, the Toncoin price decreased by more than 11% . This fall has not been constant, though. Struggling to find direction, the Toncoin price chart reveals the altcoin to have been fluctuating between $3.87 and $3.12. Toncoin dropped nearly 33% of its value over the last month. Still, the Toncoin community remains positive. Some analysts think Toncoin offers great growth potential and may revisit its all-time high (ATH) of $8.24 later this year. Meanwhile, earlier in February, it was identified that 1.43 million TON tokens had moved from whale wallets. Ali Martinez commented that he was watching closely to see how this plays out. Technical indicators show current weakness. Tracking momentum shifts, the MACD indicates selling pressure. Additionally pointing to more downside is the Momentum Oscillator, which gauges price speed. Analogously, the Moving Averages—which help to smooth market trends—show a negative phase. Although the short-term Toncoin price chart displays uncertainty, experts still view Toncoin as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Sonic Dips, but Ecosystem Growth Stays Strong Though its ecosystem is still flourishing, the Sonic price dropped more than 29% last week. The Sonic price chart shows the altcoin trading between $0.93 and $0.77 before a bearish breakout occurred. Though there was a slight drop, the past month was positive; Sonic scored about 34%. The great success of projects created on Sonic mainnet piques developer curiosity. Miles Deutscher says this growing environment is creating a positive feedback cycle that attracts even more creativity. Technical signals point to the Sonic price perhaps rallying shortly. Tracking momentum changes, the MACD points to a purchasing opportunity. Additionally, leaning bullish is the Momentum Oscillator, which tracks price movement speed. Furthermore, supporting an increasing trend is the 50EMA. A bullish community sentiment still exists, and many believe Sonic to be among the best cryptos to buy now. Hedera Shows Strength After Long Accumulation For 620 days, the Hedera price has been rounding bottom at below $0.10. This protracted buildup points to a great possibility for a breakout. CryptoBullet finds from the Hedera price chart that the main resistance level is $0.20. Should it break, Hedera might aim for $0.44 in the mid-term; long-term estimates for an aggressive rally point to either $1.25 or perhaps $3.25. This arrangement makes Hedera among the best cryptos to buy now for those seeking long-term gains despite recent swings. Prices have moved temporarily and erratically. First falling from $0.233 to $0.177, the Hedera price then rebounded above $0.202. Still, revived selling pressure drove it down to $0.185. Technical signs show a turnaround even though Hedera lost more than 39% of its value throughout the past month. The MACD's and Moving Averages' purchase signals point to possible positive momentum soon to reappear. If Hedera breaks significant resistance levels, it will be a great choice for investors since a significant surge could follow.

Paul Prager, CEO of TeraWulf, believes 2024 was a good year for the company, saying their achievements helped to solidify its leadership role in digital infrastructure. He added that their firm is at the “convergence of Bitcoin mining and HPC hosting.” claiming they will continue to lead in the next generation of digital solutions. TeraWulf Bitcoin holdings have exceeded 1800 BTC TeraWulf’s increased revenue was mostly attributed to the rise in the amount of Bitcoin mined and overall BTC prices. Following the revenue rise, the company even cleared its long-held debt, paying off almost $140 million in 2024. Moreover, the firm’s on-GAAP adjusted EBITDA jumped from $31.9 million in 2023 to $60.4 million, and by the end of the year, it had cash and cash equivalents of $274.1 million and about 1801 BTC. CEO Prager expects the company to scale up its high-performance commute (HPC) capacity by 100-150MW annually, adding that they are targeting to execute roughly 72.5 MW of HPC hosting capacity by the year’s close. However, Bitcoin is showing no signs of a price recovery in February, with some predicting the token will close the month with a 21% dip. Some analysts have blamed the lack of positive catalysts for the price fall in the last few weeks, as well as the lack of technical support levels at $80,000 and $95,000. Bitcoin price correction could easily influence TeraWulf’s 2025 revenue earnings. CFO Patrick Fleury claims the company sold some of its equity Patrick Fleury, Chief Financial Officer, stated that they had about $500 million in oversubscribed convertible debt offering. He claimed the debt offering helped increase their liquidity and provide funds for their HPC hosting. Additionally, he said that the sale of their 25% equity interest in Nautilus, helped them get back $85 million which they reinvested in Lake Mariner’s HPC hosting capacity. Prager even added: We expanded our self-mining capacity to 9.7 EH/s, secured long-term data center lease agreements with a credit-worthy counterparty that are expected to generate significant recurring revenue, providing a stable foundation for long-term growth, and enhanced our financial flexibility through strategic asset monetization and capital raises.

Investors often focus on major players, but hidden gems like these can surprise the market. Delving into the specifics of DYDX, KAS, and GNO reveals why they might lead the pack in recovery. Discover which coins are set for growth this month. DYDX: Downward Price Movement Amid Key Support and Resistance Levels Past month and half-year performance show notable declines with a 32.43% drop over the last month and a 27.68% fall over six months. Price fluctuations between $0.80 and $1.54 and a steep weekly loss of 17.20% point to persistent bearish pressure. The data reflects a consistent downward drift, suggesting recent market sentiment has been far from buoyant. Current price action centers around a support level at $0.52 and a key resistance near $2.00, with a secondary hurdle at $2.74. Bears remain in command as indicators like the Awesome Oscillator, Momentum, and RSI hint at an oversold zone. Traders might consider light buying near support with careful stops while awaiting a decisive break above resistance. Kaspa Price Action: Recent Decline Highlights Bearish Trends Kaspa experienced a steep fall over the last month and six months, with price drops of around 37% and 54% respectively. The coin has shown a notable shift in movement characterized by a rapid decrease in momentum and persistent selling pressure. Strength indicators like a low RSI near 28.56 and negative oscillator readings reinforced the downward trend. Bearish forces have dominated, significantly dragging the coin’s value lower over time. Kaspa currently trades between approximately 0.1063 and 0.1543 dollars, with key support noted around 0.0827 dollars and resistance near 0.1787 dollars. Bears remain strong as the coin struggles to break above resistance. Traders may monitor the support level for potential bounce-back signals or a continuation of the downtrend within this range. Gnosis GNO Oversold State Hints Recovery Potential in Cryptomarket Gnosis saw a decline of nearly 30% over the past month, while its six-month performance slipped by about 5%. Weekly losses reached almost 21%, indicating significant short-term volatility compared to its steadier half-year trend. The price fluctuations have been sharp in recent weeks, showcasing unstable behavior amid broader market conditions. Current price levels range between approximately 184 and 272 dollars, with key support at 149 dollars and resistance at 325 dollars. The RSI sits at 27, indicating oversold conditions. Bears have recently dominated, but these oversold signals could attract bull interest. Traders might consider short-term plays near support and look for upward moves above resistance as potential reversal cues. Conclusion DYDX , KAS, and GNO show promise for an early recovery in March. Market trends and trading activity suggest potential growth for these coins. DYDX focuses on decentralized trading, KAS on privacy, and GNO on prediction markets. Each addresses unique needs in the crypto space. Close attention to these altcoins may reveal early recovery patterns. Market movements in March could favor these options.

The sudden price swings are nothing new in the meme coin space, where sentiment drives action, and the market can shift in an instant. While some tokens battle price drops, BTFD Coin is pulling in major investor interest with its explosive presale performance. With over $6.21 million raised, a 100% bonus code offer, and a 3650% ROI potential, it has emerged as one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week . Unlike typical meme tokens, BTFD offers a fully launched Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, 90% APY staking rewards, and an exclusive referral program, adding serious long-term value to its bullish momentum. BTFD Coin’s 3650% ROI Potential Draws Investors to Its Presale Meme coins come and go, but few pack the kind of long-term earning potential that BTFD Coin is delivering. Right now, investors who jump into Stage 14 of its presale at $0.00016 per token could be looking at major gains, considering that BTFD will list at $0.0006 and has a projected moon price of $0.006. That kind of jump translates into a staggering 3,650% ROI for early adopters. The latest presale figures prove that interest in BTFD Coin isn’t slowing down. With over 70 billion tokens sold and 11,100 holders already on board, demand is accelerating. A major presale milestone was hit when the team burned all unsold Stage 13 tokens, creating an even tighter supply, which could drive higher demand post-listing. To add fuel to the fire, BTFD Coin is currently offering a 100% bonus code (LAUNCH100), meaning every token purchase is doubled. That means an investor putting in $8,000 right now would receive 50 million BTFD tokens, and at the $0.006 moon price, that would be worth an eye-watering $300,000. With its Play-to-Earn game already live, users can earn additional tokens through in-game competitions while also taking advantage of 90% APY staking rewards. It’s no surprise that investors are calling BTFD Coin one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week as FOMO builds around its growth potential. How to Buy BTFD Coins? Getting into BTFD’s presale is simple. Investors set up a wallet using MetaMask or Trust Wallet, fund it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and purchase BTFD tokens directly on the presale page . By using the LAUNCH100 bonus code, buyers instantly double their tokens, making this one of the biggest meme coin opportunities of 2025. Toshi Battles 10.8% Price Drop Amid Market Fluctuations Toshi, a pet-themed meme coin built on Base, an Ethereum layer-two blockchain, has faced a 10.8% decline in the last 24 hours, reflecting broader market uncertainty. As a community-driven token, Toshi has built a strong following, but the current price action suggests profit-taking or lower demand in the short term. Despite the dip, Toshi’s connection to Coinbase’s layer-two ecosystem keeps it in the spotlight, with many believing that long-term scalability on Base could strengthen its use case. However, short-term investors are watching closely to see whether support levels hold or if further declines are ahead. MELANIA Slides 5.15% as Investors Look for Stability MELANIA, a meme coin inspired by digital collectibles representing engagement with symbolic artwork, has dropped 5.15% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.8363. While its non-political stance and community-driven approach have helped it attract an audience, the latest price action suggests market caution. Some investors see MELANIA’s dip as a natural correction, while others are waiting for signs of renewed buying interest. As with most meme coins, MELANIA’s future will likely be driven by community engagement and broader market trends. Final Words Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin has emerged as one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week, with its 3650% ROI potential, Play-to-Earn game, and high staking rewards. While Toshi battles a 10.8% drop and MELANIA sees a 5.15% decline, BTFD’s presale momentum continues to build, with over $6.21 million raised and a 100% bonus code doubling investor holdings. With a current presale price of $0.00016 and a listing target of $0.0006, early buyers could see a massive 275% gain on launch day alone. And if BTFD Coin reaches its $0.006 moon price, those same investors could be looking at a game-changing 3,650% return. BTFD or get left behind—the choice is yours. Join the BTFD Coin presale today . FAQs Why is BTFD Coin considered one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week?

The Singapore-based, Nasdaq-listed Bitdeer purchased 100 Bitcoin this week in two operations. It bought 50 BTC at $90,280 on Feb. 25, the same day its fourth-quarter 2024 financial report was released. On Feb. 27, it purchased another 50 BTC at $81,475 each, for a total outlay of $8,587,750. On Feb. 23, before the purchases, Bitdeer held 911 BTC. Bitdeer buys the dip, announces repurchase On Feb. 28, the company announced the completion of a $9 million share buyback program and the launch of a $20 million share repurchase program that will run through Feb. 28, 2026. The new round of repurchasing will be carried out gradually and funded with the company’s cash on hand. These actions come against the backdrop of two quarters of falling revenue. Bitdeer Technologies Group, which includes Bitdeer AI, showed healthy revenue growth in the first half of 2024. Total revenue reached $119.5 million in Q1, compared to $72.6 million in the same quarter of 2023. It also registered net income of $600,000, compared to a net loss of $9.5 million a year earlier. Q2 2024 brought in $99.2 million against $93.8 million in Q2 2023. It showed a net loss of $17.7 million, versus a net loss of $40.4 million in 2023. Halving and market trends hit Bitdeer hard The fourth Bitcoin halving in April 2024, when the reward for mining a block was reduced from 6.26 BTC to 3.125 BTC, rocked the gross profit margins of the entire mining industry. Bitdeer revenue fell to $62.0 million in Q3, down from $87.3 million the previous year. Q4 showed $69 million in revenue, down from $114.8 million in Q4 2023. Net loss skyrocketed from $5.0 million in Q4 2023 to $531.9 million. In a statement at the release of the Q3 report, Bitdeer chief business officer Matt Kong attributed the declining indicators to the halving, as well as the increased global hash rate, decreased hosting revenue and one-time research and one-time development costs. The last month has also seen a downturn in miners’ stock in line with broader stock and crypto market trends. Bitdeer was the loss leader among them, losing 55% of its value as the industry overall lost $13 billion. Bitdeer has gone into ASIC design The R&D outlay Kong referred to was connected with its SEAL02 chip development. The company announced a roadmap for designing application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) in June. Also in June, Bitdeer paid $140 million in stock for chip designed DesiweMiner and integrated its staff into Bitdeer’s ASIC design team. At that time, the first generation, SEAL01, had been released and was expected to go into mass production in the Q4 2024. SEAL02 was expected to be released in the Q3 2024, and SEAL03 in Q4 2024. SEAL04 should be released in in Q2 2025 for mass delivery in Q4 2025. At the time of writing, Bitdeer has 1,380,679 reservations for its SEAL A2 model and plans to begin shipping in March. Also this week, the company’s CEO Jihan Wu committed to the sale of up to 4 million ordinary shares between March and June 15, 2025 under a plan finalized in December. The company stressed that the plan complies with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Rule 10b5-1 on insider trading. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

As we watch that unfold, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could step up with a hybrid Layer-2 solution that could fix Bitcoin’s slow transactions and hefty fees. Let’s check out the deets. XRP Price Prediction: Can XRP Bounce Back and Surge to $10 as Analysts Urge Investors to “Buy the Dip”? XRP is currently priced at $2.44, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours, with a trading volume of $4.86 billion over the same period. The price has ranged between $2.34 and $2.49 during this period. The SEC’s closed-door meeting today could have a major impact on Ripple and XRP, with key topics including the agency’s ongoing appeal in the Ripple case and the possible approval of a Grayscale XRP-spot ETF. At the same time, whistleblower group Empower Oversight is pressuring the SEC to release information about potential conflicts of interest in its crypto-related decisions. Meanwhile, analysts have spotted a rare price pattern that sets XRP apart from Bitcoin (BTC). This movement means that XRP could be on the verge of a major rally. Crypto analyst ProjectSyndicate has projected a potential 40% surge in XRP’s price, identifying the recent dip as a “perfect entry” point for investors. Hugo , another analyst, believes XRP has confirmed a breakout and expects it to surge to at least $10 once the bull run resumes. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Brings The Hybrid Layer-2 Solution That Could Upgrade Bitcoin With Faster Transactions, Lower Fees, and Seamless DeFi Integration Bitcoin is one of the most secure and decentralized cryptocurrencies, but it has major drawbacks — slow transactions and high fees. This makes Bitcoin impractical for daily use, especially for small payments. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might solve these issues with a hybrid Layer-2 scaling solution that could make Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and more versatile. By offering block times of just 2 seconds on its own Layer-2 chain, PlutoChain could eliminate long wait times and allow Bitcoin to be used for quick payments, microtransactions, and global transfers. Beyond speed, PlutoChain is designed to lower fees and stabilize costs and could make Bitcoin more practical for businesses and individuals. Instead of just being a store of value, Bitcoin could finally function as a real payment network. PlutoChain also brings Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility and could open the door for DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and AI-powered blockchain applications. This would bridge the gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum, enabling features Bitcoin alone can’t support. Security remains a top priority. PlutoChain has passed multiple audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , alongside regular code reviews and stress tests. During the testnet phase, the platform has already processed over 43,200 transactions in a single day, which proves it can handle high volumes efficiently. Unlike Bitcoin’s miner-controlled governance, PlutoChain encourages the community to propose and vote on network changes, which makes it more transparent and adaptable. With these advancements, PlutoChain could help Bitcoin reach its full potential as a fast, efficient, and widely used digital currency. The Bottom Line With XRP at a critical moment, investors are watching closely as the SEC’s closed-door meeting unfolds. Many are seeing the current pullback as a chance to get in before a potential breakout and urging investors to “buy the dip”. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might gain attention with its Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin. With 2-second block times and full DeFi integration, PlutoChain could help turn Bitcoin into more than just a store of value.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse sees this as a sign the agency might be backing off its strict enforcement tactics. Beyond regulatory changes, StratoVM ($SVM) might be making a name for itself as a powerful new Bitcoin Layer-2. Unlike traditional scaling solutions, StratoVM is built to potentially bring smart contracts, meme coins, AI, and DeFi directly to Bitcoin—something BTC has struggled with for years. Here’s what you need to know about projects. Ripple CEO Reacts to SEC’s Surprise Decision – Can XRP Bounce Back? Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has weighed in on the SEC’s unexpected move to drop its case against Coinbase, calling it a sign that the agency is shifting away from its aggressive “regulation by enforcement” approach. Many in the XRP community see this as a turning point. If the SEC is backing off from targeting crypto firms, Ripple could be next. In addition, the SEC recently acknowledged a proposal for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) from the New York Stock Exchange and Grayscale. While this doesn’t mean immediate approval, it’s a major step toward institutional acceptance. Garlinghouse called it “inevitable,” despite the SEC’s past resistance. The review process could take months, but the possibility of an XRP ETF is optimistic for the community. Right now, XRP is trading at $2.17, down 2.4% in the last 24 hours. The price has seen a daily high of $2.36 and a low of $2.16. In his recent post on X, analyst Tylie E suggested that XRP has likely completed its correction phase and could see a slight dip before making a move toward the $10-$15 range. StratoVM ($SVM): The Bitcoin Layer 2 That Could Supercharge BTC DeFi in 2025 StratoVM ($SVM) is a rising Bitcoin Layer 2 solution that could bring smart contracts, meme coins, AI, and DeFi directly to the Bitcoin network. SVM is currently trading at $0.06365, but it has surged by 2,240% in just a month, according to CoinGecko. This rapid growth shows there’s strong demand and confidence in its potential to enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and utility. SVM 30-day chart, Source: CoinGecko With its mainnet launch coming soon, StratoVM has potential. CoreDAO, another Bitcoin Layer 2, holds a $990 million fully diluted valuation, while StratoVM sits at just $6.3 million. If its mainnet rollout is successful, it could help the protocol grow further. The broader Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) market is blowing up. DeFiLlama data shows that the total value locked (TVL) in BTCFi surged from $307 million in January 2024 to $6.6 billion by February 2025. StratoVM might be well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. Plus, its recent Uniswap listing adds further credibility. StratoVM’s network is expanding fast, with 50+ strategic partners and nearly 100,000 community members across X, Telegram, and Discord. Rumors of a CEX listing are also circulating, which could provide an additional boost. The testnet already shows promise by recording 113,312 wallets and 56,200+ daily transactions. Closing Words As XRP’s regulatory outlook improves with potential SEC policy shifts and ETF discussions, the market continues to push past old limitations. On the other hand, StratoVM ($SVM) might be a game-changer for Bitcoin. Its goal is to bring DeFi, smart contracts, and new blockchain applications directly to Bitcoin. The upcoming mainnet launch could be a turning point that makes StratoVM a key player in Bitcoin’s evolution. The information in this article does not represent financial or investment advice.

The analyst also raised the possibility of ADA reaching $10. Cardano Price To Reach New ATH Of $8.11 In a TradingView post, Master Ananda predicted that the Cardano price could rally to a new ATH of $8.11 as it records “massive growth” this year. The analyst affirmed that ADA is officially in bull market territory following the completion of the first wave of the initial bullish breakout. In line with this, he predicts a new wave that could send Cardano to this $8 price target. Related Reading: Cardano Price Bounces From Key Support Level, But There’s Still A Risk To Crash To $0.85 Master Ananda further explained that the initial bullish breakout peaked very early in December last year. The analyst noted that such a strong bullish wave will always lead to a correction, which explains why the Cardano price is witnessing a significant crash alongside the broader crypto market. The crypto analyst assured that the present correction doesn’t mean much for the market. He further remarked that this is just a period of rest while the players, traders and market participants consolidate all previous gains. Master Ananda added that the market needs to adapt to the previous massive phase of growth. Further Analysis Of ADA’s Bull Market Price Action Master Ananda noted that in a bullish market, a correction will always end in a higher low. According to him, the higher the low of the higher low, the stronger the chart or pair is considered. He gave an example of the ADA/USDT paid which launched the previous bullish wave from a baseline of $0.3000. Related Reading: Cardano Price Breaks Down From Ascending Channel, Here Are Two Ways It Could Go The correction higher-low ended at around $0.6000 for the Cardano price, which the analyst noted is 100% higher than the baseline price. Master Ananda remarked that this means that Cardano is super strong. He also revealed that the first peak ended around $1.35, which he claimed is “awesome.” Furthermore, the crypto analyst noted that from a low of $0.2756 in August 2024, this move adds up to a total growth of around 375%. However, he asserted that there will be more for the Cardano price this time around in this 2025 bull run. Alluding to his accompanying chart, Master Ananda highlighted $2, $4.84, $8.11 and even $10.5 as the new 2025 peak potential. Master Ananda stated that he is sharing this Cardano price action analysis now because he believes that ADA is witnessing the establishment of a short-term higher low. The first low happened in early February and now the second is happening. He asserted that the second higher low will launch the next bull market bullish wave. At the time of writing, the Cardano price is trading at around $0.59, down over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Despite this bullish prediction, Ethereum has recently been under bearish pressure, falling 15% in the last week alone. While ETH regains footing and prepares to climb, another altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is gaining traction. Analysts predict the new DeFi predict the new token is on the verge of a 3900% rally, far exceeding Ethereum’s 550% growth potential. The project is currently in phase 2 of its presale, priced at $0.015. It has raised over $1.8 million and attracted more than 3400 holders within just days. In the upcoming phase 3, the price of tokens will increase by 33.33% to $0.02, meaning buyers have a limited opportunity before the prices increase. Mutuum Finance could hit $2.28 from the launch price with the 38x prediction. Why Ethereum Could Hit $15,000 Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest crypto by market cap and is expected for a major rally during the 2025 bull run, with analysts predicting a rise to $15,000. The coin is currently trading at $2,296 where it is predicted to climb 550% supported by factors like, growing institutional adoption, Ethereum transitioning to a deflationary model through staking and the expansion of Layer 2 scaling. The altcoin’s dominant position in the DeFi market positions it for strong growth, not just in 2025 but in the years to come too. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Its Presale Success Mutuum Finance is currently in the second phase of its presale, giving investors an opportunity to buy MUTM tokens at $0.015. This is the cheapest available price, with gradual increase set to take place over 11 stages until a launch price of $0.06. This growth guarantees a 300% return for investors joining the presale today. And if analysts are right, MUTM could skyrocket past $2.28 the moment it is listed, making it one of the top cryptos in DeFi this cycle. So far, the presale has exceeded $1.8 million raised and, 3400 unique investors. Mutuum Finance’s Role in Revolutionizing Crypto Lending Mutuum Finance is making borrowing and lending simpler and smarter with a two-model system: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model allows investors to lock stablecoins like USDT in lending pools fueled by smart contracts and earn passive returns while borrowers borrow instant loans against crypto as collateral. Side by side, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network has no intermediaries at all and enables borrowers to set up their own interest rate, term of loans and dates of repayments for the entire decentralized process. With either one, Mutuum Finance is facilitating crypto lending in a better way, easier, more convenient, and less bureaucratic. Project’s Growth and Community Rewards Mutuum Finance project team is also worried about the sustainability of the project. Token presale prefers early investors because they can participate at a considerably lower price than the exchange listing price. The project also launched a $100,000 giveaway to reward 10 individuals $10,000 each. Members of the campaign can also increase their winning chances by inviting family and friends to the project. Mutuum Finance will be among the best performers during the upcoming bull run in the DeFi space. With its sophisticated DeFi technologies, sound tokenomics and growing investor base. Experts predict a powerhouse comeback for crypto’s second-largest asset, Ethereum, to grow by 550% to $15,000. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Provides a better chance of making a profit with its presale. Mutuum Finance has already achieved $1.8 million raised from more than 3400 investors in phase 2. Don’t miss the chance, invest now before phase 2 closes and 3 arrives with a 33.33% price increase.

Those keeping an eye on the market are taking note of its rapid progress. Among many blockchain projects competing for attention, BlockDAG stands out by offering something tangible. With an ongoing presale reaching $199.7 million, 18.6 billion coins sold, and an impressive 2,380% ROI, this project is not just aiming to ride the crypto wave—it’s creating a solid foundation for long-term growth. The moves it is making now could push it to the top tier of Layer 1 blockchains. Many Layer 1 projects struggle to differentiate themselves, but BlockDAG’s approach is comprehensive. Instead of using technical jargon to attract buyers, it has built a leadership team with industry experience, developed infrastructure for long-term expansion, and is on track for 10 centralized exchange (CEX) listings that could significantly impact its coin price. Key Industry Leaders Steering BlockDAG’s Growth A project’s success depends on the people shaping its direction, and BlockDAG has assembled a leadership team filled with experts from top firms. Nicolaas David van den Bergh has taken on the role of Chief Marketing Officer, bringing over 20 years of experience from DFY Studios. His task is to make sure BlockDAG stays in the spotlight, and with the current presale success, he has a strong foundation to build upon. Marcus Xavier, previously at Uber Academy, is developing BlockDAG Academy—a platform designed to simplify blockchain knowledge for developers, buyers, and businesses, making technology more accessible. On the technical front, Robert Radek steps in as Product Manager, focusing on developing solutions that institutions can easily adopt. With a background that includes handling nearly a billion dollars in DeFi transactions at CLSTG2A, Radek understands how to make blockchain technology practical for widespread use. Mining operations play a key role in BlockDAG’s ecosystem, and Joshua Sack is overseeing this sector. With 16,000 mining units sold and $6.5 million earned from hardware sales, the mining infrastructure is already substantial. Sack’s responsibility is to refine the efficiency of operations while addressing the growing demand for sustainable mining solutions. Running a large-scale operation isn’t just about technology—it requires a structured organization. Liza van den Berg’s experience in IT recruitment and startup operations ensures that BlockDAG’s expanding workforce stays well-managed, keeping up with the company’s ambitious objectives. Upcoming Exchange Listings Could Drive Market Growth The upcoming listings are a major turning point. With 10 exchanges preparing to list BlockDAG, the potential for price shifts increases significantly. In past instances, listing on top-tier exchanges has led to major price jumps, offering early buyers strong opportunities. Increased liquidity and easy access for a larger user base often drive demand, making these listings a crucial moment for BlockDAG. Currently, BlockDAG’s coin price is at $0.0248 in Batch 27, but once these listings go live, that number could become outdated quickly. Previous projects such as Solana and Avalanche saw substantial growth after getting listed on major platforms, and BlockDAG could follow a similar path. As visibility and liquidity rise, the possibility of price increases becomes more apparent. What Sets BlockDAG Apart in the Layer 1 Space? Competition among Layer 1 blockchains is intense. Ethereum dominates, Solana is known for its fast transactions, and Avalanche is recognized for its interoperability. BlockDAG, however, is taking a well-rounded approach. Instead of prioritizing a single feature, it is developing an ecosystem that integrates technology, education, infrastructure, and community expansion. Its blockchain architecture is designed for scalability while maintaining decentralization, tackling one of the biggest challenges in the industry. Unlike projects focused on short-term growth, BlockDAG’s leadership is working on long-term adoption strategies. Another key point is its practical applications. The mining infrastructure is already generating revenue, and its educational academy is set to onboard a new wave of users. BlockDAG is not just preparing for a successful launch—it is building the foundation for a sustainable blockchain ecosystem. Time is Running Out to Join Before Major Listings! The upcoming few months for BlockDAG are crucial. With the mainnet launch approaching, a growing community, and a marketing campaign supported by top hires, the window for entering before major exchange listings is closing fast. The crypto market moves at an incredible pace. Wealth is created and lost in short periods. BlockDAG’s combination of high-profile hires, a robust crypto presale , and upcoming exchange listings signals that it could be on the verge of something big. The only question is whether people will act now or look back later, realizing they missed out on an early opportunity. History has shown that Layer 1 projects with strong momentum don’t stay unnoticed for long.

With Solana grappling with a 15% weekly drop and Dogecoin facing a 20% slide, many are wondering where to find the best crypto to buy 2025. While these market giants navigate uncertain waters, Web3Bay is making a compelling case as a fresh and promising alternative. Web3Bay is more than just another crypto project—it’s blending decentralized finance (DeFi) with e-commerce, creating a financial ecosystem where 3BAY tokens drive real utility. As Solana and Dogecoin work to regain their footing, Web3Bay’s presale momentum and strategic roadmap could position it as a top pick for those seeking stability and growth in a volatile market. Why Web3Bay Could Be the Best Crypto to Buy 2025 Web3Bay is setting itself apart by integrating DeFi principles with decentralized e-commerce. Unlike typical platforms, Web3Bay empowers users to earn, stake, and trade 3BAY tokens, turning everyday transactions into financial opportunities. As Solana and Dogecoin wrestle with market volatility, Web3Bay offers a clear vision and practical utility through its upcoming DeFi features like lending, borrowing, and staking. The Web3Bay presale is off to a strong start, raising over $1.5 million so far. With 3BAY tokens currently priced at $0.00524 and a projected launch price of $0.1959, early participants have a real shot at notable returns. This presale isn’t just about early access—it’s about joining a project with a comprehensive roadmap that includes staking rewards, cross-chain support, and an NFT marketplace. As Solana struggles with a declining SOL price, Web3Bay is presenting a forward-thinking approach that aligns well with those seeking the best crypto to buy 2025. By combining DeFi with practical e-commerce solutions, Web3Bay is not only offering potential gains but also introducing real-world utility that could sustain its growth long after the presale buzz fades. SOL Price Faces Pressure as Market Dynamics Shift Solana’s SOL price has been under pressure recently, with a sharp 15% drop over the past week. The coin, now at $137.18, has experienced volatility, hitting intraday highs of $161.23 and lows of $134.04. This downturn is part of a broader market sell-off impacting many major assets. Adding to the challenge, Solana’s on-chain activity has decreased, with daily active addresses hitting a three-month low of 3.5 million. While these trends are concerning, Solana isn’t out of the game. BlackRock’s interest in a Solana ETF could offer a path to recovery, bringing institutional interest and market stability. However, issues like network saturation from memecoins could hold it back. As Solana strategizes its next move, Web3Bay is stepping into the spotlight, offering a fresh perspective in a crowded market. DOGE News: Market Sell-Off Hits Dogecoin Hard Dogecoin is also feeling the squeeze, with its price down to $0.204188—nearly 20% lower than last week. The DOGE news mirrors Solana’s struggles, as a broad market downturn has led to significant losses. Reduced whale transactions and lower active addresses indicate a cooling of Dogecoin’s recent momentum. However, Dogecoin is not without potential. The launch of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust could open new doors, offering more mainstream exposure to the coin. Additionally, emerging memecoin-focused ETFs might drive future interest. Yet, as Dogecoin works to maintain its relevance, Web3Bay’s innovative approach to DeFi could be the fresh opportunity that many are looking for. Key Takeaways The SOL price downturn and mixed DOGE news reflect the challenges even established cryptos face in today’s market. While Solana manages on-chain slowdowns and Dogecoin tackles reduced network activity, Web3Bay is offering a fresh perspective—one rooted in innovation and tangible use cases. Web3Bay’s strategic blend of DeFi and e-commerce, along with its ambitious roadmap, makes it a strong contender for the best crypto to buy 2025. With a presale price of $0.00524 and a potential launch price of $0.1959, the upside for early adopters is clear. As the market seeks stability, Web3Bay is stepping up with a new model—one that promises not just speculative gains but real, lasting value in the crypto space.

Some analysts even say this could push a massive rally, with its price skyrocketing to the $30 mark. Meanwhile, StratoVM (SVM) could gain attention in the BTCFi sphere with its new Layer-2 solution. CoinGecko reports a 1300% surge in the past week, showing strong demand even as the market remains in the red. Let’s check out the details! Ripple Price Prediction: Could Trump’s Support Send XRP to $30? Despite XRP facing major setbacks over the past weeks, traders are still watching for a big breakout. Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto points to a double-bottom (“W”) pattern, saying that if XRP holds above the neckline, it could push toward $30+. Meanwhile, Donald Trump just doubled down on Ripple, sharing two posts on Truth Social that highlight the company’s growth under his administration. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse called it the “Trump effect,” saying U.S. deals surged in late 2024 – more than in the previous six months combined. He also revealed that 75% of Ripple’s new hires are now based in the U.S., a huge shift from years of regulatory uncertainty that drove business overseas. With technicals aligning and political momentum building, XRP could be gearing up for the next big move. If buyers step in and the W breakout holds, Steph Is Crypto’s $30 target might not be far off. StratoVM (SVM) Could Grab a Major Share of BTCFi Market with New Layer-2 Solution StratoVM (SVM) is emerging as a Layer 2 blockchain built on Bitcoin that could enable smart contracts, meme coins, AI, and DeFi applications directly on the Bitcoin network. Currently trading at $0.06324, SVM has shown amazing growth with a 2553% increase from the previous week, according to CoinGecko data. This impressive surge might indicate its resilience amid market volatility, possibly powered by its idea to potentially solve Bitcoin’s scalability problems. The project is expected to launch its mainnet soon, which may represent a significant development milestone. When compared to other Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions like CoreDAO (around $990M Fully Diluted Valuation), StratoVM currently stands at a relatively modest valuation of nearly $6.3 million. A successful mainnet launch could potentially be bullish news for the project, and if implementation goes well, StratoVM might be undervalued at its current price point. According to DefiLlama , the total value locked in BTCFi protocols has dramatically increased from around $307 million in January 2024 to around $6.6 billion in February 2025. StratoVM could leverage this growth with its innovative approach. Furthermore, SVM’s listing on UniSwap might improve its credibility as a project worth watching in the weeks ahead. The StratoVM ecosystem appears to be developing with support from over 50 strategic partners, which could help drive innovation and growth. There are speculations about a possible upcoming centralized exchange (CEX) listing, which might provide additional bullish momentum. The community seems to be taking notice, with nearly 100,000 followers across StratoVM’s official X , Telegram , and Discord channels. While Bitcoin’s use could expand beyond being “digital gold,” StratoVM’s scalability and security features might position it to become a leader in the BTCFi field, possibly capturing a significant portion of this emerging market. With the mainnet launch just ahead of us and many new features being incorporated, SVM could secure a CEX listing after its official launch. The Verdict If XRP stays above its key resistance, Steph Is Crypto’s $30 price target might actually happen, especially with all the talk about Trump backing Ripple. With U.S. business picking up and regulators changing their tune, XRP is definitely worth keeping an eye on. Meanwhile, StratoVM (SVM) looks to be making serious moves in the BTCFi sphere with its Layer-2 solution. That 1300% jump last week shows that even in this choppy market, investors are still hungry for innovative blockchain projects.

As of today, March 1, 2025, ADA has gained 2% and is currently trading near $0.63, fluctuating within a tight range between $0.625 and $0.64. Cardano (ADA) Short-Term Price Analysis With modest upside momentum, ADA is still trading below its key level of $0.65. Over the past 24 hours, the price attempted to rally but failed to gain traction. According to expert technical analysis, ADA remains in a bearish zone, continuing to trade below the critical $0.65 level. Despite these factors, if the asset breaks out of its ongoing consolidation and closes four consecutive candles above $0.6425, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 5.50%, reaching the $0.67 level. Source: Trading View Additionally, if the asset fails to breach the upper boundary of consolidation and closes a daily candle below the $0.62 mark, ADA could see a 7% price drop to $0.58, with the potential for further decline. Bullish On-Chain Metrics Looking at the current market sentiment, it appears that bulls are returning to support the asset. Amid this, traders and investors have been engaging in bullish activity, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Over-Leveraged Levels Data from Coinglass reveals that ADA traders betting on long positions are over-leveraged at $0.618, holding $5.90 million worth of long positions. Meanwhile, $0.645 is another over-leveraged level, where traders betting on short positions have built $3.67 million worth of positions. Source: Coinglass When combining these on-chain metrics, it appears that a shift in market sentiment has begun. This notable participation on the bullish side could push ADA in an upward direction. $14.65 Million Worth of ADA Outflow Meanwhile, investors and long-term holders have been accumulating tokens during the same period, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $14.65 million worth of ADA tokens.

On-chain data suggests Ethereum ETFs influence on the market downtrend could intensify as fresh altcoin ETF approvals edge closer. Ethereum (ETH) Declines 33% in February 2025 Ethereum (ETH) experienced intense selling pressure throughout February, reflecting broader bearish sentiment in financial markets. While major altcoins like XRP and Solana gained momentum following progress in their respective ETF filings, ETH price has struggled to retain investor interest. Ethereum Price Forecast ETH price chart above highlights a significant downturn, with ETH losing over 22% this week alone. The price tumbled from $2,800 on Monday to close near $2,220 on Friday. Zooming out, Ethereum’s closing price of $2,220 represents a staggering 33% decline from its February 1 opening price of $3,200. Ethereum ETFs See $300M Outflows as Traders Rotate to LTC, SOL ETFs Ethereum ETFs have seen a relentless wave of outflows, with institutional investors pulling over $300 million in the past seven trading days. The selling spree, which began last week, has now extended into this week, marking a period of sustained capital flight from ETH-based funds. A detailed breakdown of the outflows according to Fairdside data shows that February 26 witnessed the largest single-day withdrawal at $94.3 million. The preceding days also recorded heavy selling: February 24: $78 million February 25: $50.1 million February 27: $71.2 million No ETF inflows were recorded throughout this week, making it the first week in 2025 where Ethereum ETFs saw only outflows. This trend suggests institutional investors are either reallocating capital or hedging against further downside risk in ETH. Ethereum (ETH) ETFs Flows Feb 2025 | Source: SosoValue The persistent selling pressure has aligned with Ethereum’s sharp price decline, with the asset falling 22% this week and extending its monthly losses to 33%. Market analysts attribute the downturn to a combination of macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting investor focus toward alternative crypto ETFs. Rival Layer-1 altcoin projects such as Litecoin and Solana have gained momentum. Bitwise has filed for an Aptos ETF , while CME Group is moving forward with Solana futures ETFs. With Polymarket odds suggesting a 90% chance of LTC ETF approval, capital rotation away from Ethereum appears to be accelerating. Unless ETH sees renewed institutional interest, continued ETF redemptions could reinforce its bearish trend in the coming weeks. Investors Eye Alcoin ETFs Amid Ethereum Uncertainty Ethereum’s ETF exodus coincided with increasing traction for alternative cryptocurrency ETFs. Recent SEC filings indicate a growing interest in Litecoin (LTC) and Solana (SOL) ETFs, driving speculation about near-term approvals. Key developments include: Bitwise’s Aptos ETF Filing : This filing intensified investor interest in newer blockchain projects. Polymarket Betting on Litecoin ETF Approval : Forecast markets currently price a 90% probability of an LTC ETF gaining SEC approval. CME Group’s Solana ETF Speculation : The derivatives giant’s move toward Solana futures suggests growing institutional interest in SOL-based ETFs. These developments hint at a potential reallocation of capital from Ethereum ETFs to emerging crypto ETFs, as traders seek higher growth opportunities. Ethereum price action remains under pressure amid heavy ETF redemptions and shifting investor interest toward alternative assets. While the final trading day of February saw a net ETF inflow, the prior weeks’ sell-off underscores the broader uncertainty surrounding Ethereum’s network and market positioning. With institutional traders pivoting toward Litecoin and Solana ETFs, Ethereum’s dominance in crypto ETF markets could face increased competition. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether ETH price can regain upward momentum or if capital rotation into alternative crypto ETFs will persist. Ethereum Price Forecast: Bulls Face Deeper Correction Risks if $2,200 Support Caves Ethereum price forecast charts suggests further downside risk as the market struggles to reclaim lost ground following a decisive breakdown. The chart shows ETH trading within the Donchian Channel’s lower band, signaling persistent selling pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 29.53, confirming oversold conditions, yet the lack of a strong rebound implies that bearish momentum remains dominant. Ethereum Price Forecast A bullish scenario requires ETH to defend the $2,200 level, where minor accumulation appears. If buyers step in, a move toward the midline of the Donchian Channel at $2,466.80 becomes possible, aligning with prior resistance. A bearish continuation would see ETH lose $2,200, exposing $2,076 as the next target. Failing to hold there could accelerate selling toward $2,000. The declining RSI below its signal line suggests weak buyer commitment. Until ETH decisively reclaims resistance, the trend remains bearish despite oversold conditions.

White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks and Bo Hines, the executive director of a working group on digital assets, will run the meeting, though Trump will speak at the summit, a late Friday press release said. ""Attendees will include prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto industry, as well as members of the President's Working Group on Digital Assets,"" the release said. The summit will come just about a month after Sacks, alongside congressional leaders, gave his first public remarks as Trump's crypto czar. ""We want to keep that innovation onshore in the U.S.,"" he said at the Feb. 4 press conference. ""Financial assets are destined to become digital, just like every analog industry has become digital, and we want that value creation to happen in the United States, rather than giving it away to other countries."" The White House did not name the summit's other attendees. Friday's announcement ends a busy week for the crypto industry. Earlier in the day, a federal judge signed off on the Securities and Exchange Commission's motion to withdraw its case against Coinbase. Joe Lubin, the CEO of Ethereum incubator ConsenSys, and Cameron Winklevoss, the co-founder of exchange Gemini, both said earlier in the week that the SEC informed their respective companies that it would shutter its investigations into those firms. The SEC also filed to pause its case against the Tron Foundation and founder Justin Sun.

The withdrawals came after a major announcement by CME Group regarding Solana futures trading. According to Lookonchain observations: The AHdUMw…qMnj wallet withdrew 54,544 SOL (approximately $7.46 million) from Binance two hours ago. The 7i6FUR…kp5J wallet withdrew 41,096 SOL (approximately $6.96 million) from Binance an hour ago. The whale activity appears to be a reaction to CME Group’s announcement that it plans to launch futures contracts on Solana on March 17, 2025. CME, a leading global derivatives market, plans to launch two types of Solana futures contracts: A standard contract representing 500 SOL. A micro-scale contract representing 25 SOLs. “We are responding to increasing client demand for a broader set of regulated products to manage cryptocurrency price risk,” said Giovanni Vicioso, Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products at CME. Related News: Chinese Company Can't Keep Up With Demand for Mining Devices in This Altcoin After Trump Wins Election If approved, the launch of Solana futures could pave the way for Solana-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Firms such as VanEck, 21Shares and Franklin Templeton have already filed for spot Solana ETFs with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the earliest filings set for June 2024. Industry experts suggest the SEC may want to observe several months of trading activity in a regulated Solana futures market before granting ETF approvals. The launch of CME’s futures contracts “significantly increases” the likelihood of ETF approval, said Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, noted that CME’s Solana futures will be cash-settled, which is seen as a positive factor for ETF applications. The futures will be based on the CME CF Solana USD Reference Rate, which is used as the reference for daily SOL/USD pricing and is calculated each day at 4:00 p.m. London time. *This is not investment advice.

There are digital currencies priced under a dollar that hold immense potential for growth. This article delves into five affordable cryptos that could be the key to substantial wealth, revealing opportunities that might just be waiting to explode in value. XYZ’s Rise to Glory: The Meme Coin Fighter Punching Through the Crypto Arena XYZVerse is the next heavyweight champion of meme coins. Crowned Best NEW Meme Project , it blends the electric energy of sports with meme culture, drawing in millions of fans who want to be part of something bigger. Every great story needs a hero. Not the biggest, not the strongest—just the one crazy enough to keep pushing forward. That’s XYZepe , the masked fighter, the die-hard believer, and the relentless holder of $XYZ . His mission is to bring XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap and carve XYZ into crypto history. In response, the CMC community is totally behind this future champ: 95% are super bullish on $XYZ. But greatness isn’t handed out—it’s earned in the ring. $XYZ has already passed through 10 out of 15 presale stages, and the thriving community helps it build momentum for a mindblowing take off. Undervalued at $0.0025, $XYZ is a bet worth making. By the end of presale, it’s set to soar to $0.1. The fight isn’t over, but the path to glory is clear. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who know this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the start of something legendary. XYZepe is fighting for glory. Are you ready to join the ring? LUNC: Terra Classic’s Journey to Stable Global Payments Terra is a blockchain platform aiming to make global payments fast and affordable. It uses stablecoins, digital currencies tied to traditional money like the U.S. dollar or South Korean won. This means their value stays steady, making them useful for everyday transactions. By blending the stability of regular money with the benefits of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Terra offers quick and secure payments without the usual price swings. In May 2022, Terra launched a new chain, and the original became Terra Classic. Its main token was renamed LUNA Classic (LUNC). This shift is similar to the split of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic in 2017. The change followed significant challenges with Terra’s stablecoin earlier that year. Now, LUNC continues to support stablecoins linked to various currencies, focusing on stable and efficient global transactions. In a market where many cryptocurrencies face high volatility, LUNC’s approach to combining fiat stability with blockchain technology offers a unique path. As the crypto landscape evolves, projects like LUNC highlight the potential for digital currencies to become a regular part of everyday finance. XLM Shines Bright: Stellar’s Role in Today’s Crypto Market Stellar Lumens (XLM) is a digital coin that’s changing the way people send money around the world. Since 2014, Stellar has helped move billions of dollars quickly and cheaply. It doesn’t favor any one country’s money. Instead, it lets people send any kind of money, whether it’s dollars, euros, or even other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Big companies have partnered with Stellar because it helps them make fast, low-cost payments. People can use Stellar apps to send money globally, and businesses can build their own apps on the network. Stellar stands out because it wants to work with existing financial systems, not replace them. This makes it different from many other cryptocurrencies. The Stellar Development Foundation supports the network, helping it grow and add new features like smart contracts and NFTs. In the current market, where some cryptocurrencies are struggling, Stellar’s focus on real-world applications makes it attractive. It’s building bridges between different kinds of money, which could be a big advantage. Compared to other coins that are just digital assets, Stellar offers practical tools for people and businesses. This could help it shine brighter in the crypto world. Kaspa: The Lightning-Fast Cryptocurrency Aiming to Change the Game Kaspa is a new cryptocurrency that’s turning heads. It’s built on proof-of-work, like Bitcoin, but with a clever twist. Instead of following a single chain of blocks, Kaspa lets multiple blocks exist together. This means it doesn’t waste any blocks created at the same time. As a result, Kaspa can produce blocks very quickly—currently one every second. The goal is to reach 10 blocks per second, and the dream is 100. This speed could make transactions much faster and smoother for users. Kaspa’s technology has the potential to shake up the crypto world. Its ability to handle many blocks at once without slowing down is impressive. It also includes features that make future improvements easier, such as support for additional layers on top of the main network. In a market where speed and efficiency matter, Kaspa stands out. Compared to other coins, its focus on rapid block production and quick confirmations could make it attractive to investors. With trends favoring scalable and efficient cryptocurrencies, Kaspa might be one to watch in the current market cycle. TRON (TRX): Empowering Creators in the Decentralized Internet TRON is a blockchain platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. It aims to give content creators full control over their work. Instead of relying on big companies like YouTube or Facebook, creators can connect directly with their audience. This means they earn more rewards without sharing profits with middlemen. TRX, the digital coin of TRON, started on the Ethereum network but moved to its own in 2018. TRON supports smart contracts and apps that run without a central authority. Developers can build diverse applications on it. Users can share content freely without worrying about fees. Compared to Ethereum, TRON offers faster and cheaper transactions. In today’s market, where there’s a push for decentralization, TRX stands out. Its focus on helping creators sets it apart from other coins. As people look for direct connections online, TRON could play a key role in the internet’s future. Conclusion LUNC, XLM, KAS, and TRX are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely combines sports and meme culture, aiming for significant growth as a community-driven ecosystem.

Toncoin & Hedera Price Shows Recovery,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-whales-pump-200k-into-web3bay-in-just-48-hours-toncoin-hedera-price-shows-recovery/,"Is smart money signaling a shift in the crypto market? Toncoin price has held steady despite a recent dip, with investors still holding 54% unrealized profit, as reported by Glassnode. Meanwhile, Hedera price has bounced back from a key support level, hinting at a possible breakout. As both coins respond to market changes, interest is growing in Web3Bay’s presale, which is catching the eye of large-scale investors. The whales are making decisive moves, not hesitating to act! Within just 48 hours, Web3Bay has seen over $200,000 in large-scale investments, demonstrating substantial confidence from major buyers. When deep-pocketed investors begin to accumulate, it often suggests they perceive opportunities that others might miss. With 3BAY still in its presale phase, it stands out as a top crypto pick for February, potentially before prices begin to rise further. Whales Drive Web3Bay Demand: Presale Crosses $1.5M! Crypto whales are moving fast, pouring over $200,000 into 3BAY coins within just 48 hours. Large-scale purchases often signal that whales see future growth. With Web3Bay still in presale, early buyers are locking in lower prices before potential gains. The project has already crossed $1.5 million, with more than 395 million coins sold, indicating strong demand. Each presale stage raises prices, motivating investors to secure their share before costs increase. Now in its fifth presale phase, Web3Bay offers 3BAY coins at $0.00524, with a projected launch price of $0.1959. The platform aims to create a decentralized e-commerce network that removes middlemen, reducing fees while offering transparency. Features include DAO governance, multi-currency support, and staking rewards, making it more than just a typical presale. As whale activity intensifies, the presale remains an entry point for potential gains. Recent buying trends suggest Web3Bay could be one of the top altcoins to buy now before prices climb further. Will you secure your position before the next stage begins? Toncoin Holds Steady Despite Recent Price Drop Even with a recent market dip, the Toncoin price remains above its Realized Price of $2.43, meaning most holders are still in profit. Glassnode data reveals that investors are holding 54% unrealized gains despite the pullback. Historically, the Realized Price has acted as a solid support level, often leading to buying activity during corrections. If this trend holds, further declines could be limited, encouraging more accumulation. Currently trading near $3.77, Toncoin has faced bearish pressure, but indicators suggest that selling momentum may be weakening. The MVRV ratio has fallen to 1.54, signaling a cooling phase that could lead to a recovery. Yet, recent spikes in Realized Loss indicate some traders who bought at higher levels have exited. Whether this marks the end of the correction or signals a buying opportunity remains uncertain. Hedera Price Rebounds: Will It Break Key Resistance? After dropping 28% in the past month, Hedera price is showing signs of recovery, bouncing off crucial support at $0.18. This movement aligns with a Broadening Wedge pattern, which often precedes breakouts. Recent gains have pushed Hedera to $0.2375, and if upward momentum continues, the next challenge is the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Clearing this level could confirm a shift toward bullish territory. Technical indicators are turning positive, with the MACD showing a bullish crossover, suggesting buying pressure is increasing. However, broader market trends will influence whether this rebound holds. If Bitcoin dominance continues to drop and altcoins gain strength, Hedera could see further upside. The next few trading sessions will be key to confirming whether this recovery has long-term potential. Wrapping Up! Toncoin remains above its Realized Price of $2.43, with investors holding 54% unrealized profit despite recent selling pressure. Sustained buying momentum could help stabilize prices around $3.77. Meanwhile, Hedera has rebounded from $0.18, with a potential breakout if it surpasses the 100-day SMA. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether this recovery continues. As market attention shifts, Web3Bay’s crypto presale stands out, with Whales investing over $200,000 in 48 hours. With the project still in presale, early buyers are positioning themselves before the next price increase. The question is—will you secure your share before the price climbs further?

Solana Has Plunged To The Realized Price Recently In a new post on X, CryptoVizArt.₿, senior analyst at the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, has discussed about the Realized Price of Solana. The “Realized Price” refers to an indicator that, in short, keeps track of the cost basis of the average investor or address on a given cryptocurrency network. Related Reading: Don’t Call Bitcoin Bottom Just Yet, CryptoQuant Head Says: Here’s Why When the value of this metric is under the spot price of the asset, it means the holders as a whole can be assumed to be in a state of profit. On the other hand, it being under the coin’s value suggests the overall market is carrying a net loss. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the trend in the Realized Price for Solana over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, Solana had been trading above its Realized Price during the last year or so, which means the cryptocurrency’s holders had been enjoying profits on average. In the last few days, however, the entire digital asset has been shocked by a crash, and SOL has been no exception. As a consequence of this plunge, the coin’s price has retraced to the Realized Price, implying the holders are now sitting around their break-even level. Historically, the Realized Price has been a critical level for not just Solana but cryptocurrencies in general. This is because of the fact that investors tend to react more strongly to movements that relate to their cost basis. During bullish trends, the level can act as support for the asset’s price, as investors are keen on buying ‘dips.’ If the level is lost, however, it signals that the holders are no longer accumulating at their break-even. From the chart, it’s apparent that the last time this type of breakdown took place was in 2022. Back then, Solana fought to stay above the level for around five months before the bulls finally gave out and the coin slipped under it, kicking off the bear market. It wasn’t until the last quarter of 2023 that optimism around the token returned, and the price was able to recover above the line.

Polkadot & Mantra Price Trends Show Rally,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-whales-pour-over-200k-into-web3bay-polkadot-mantra-price-trends-show-rally/,"Is Polkadot (DOT) on the verge of a breakout, or will it encounter resistance? Currently, DOT is at a pivotal point, with $5.50 serving as a critical resistance level. If it surpasses this threshold, we could see prices ranging from $7 to $8. However, failing to break through could send it tumbling to $3.60. Meanwhile, MANTRA crypto has seen a remarkable 35% increase within 24 hours, soaring past $7 with robust trading volume supporting its ascent. With top cryptocurrencies rapidly shifting, the pressing question is—where will the next significant opportunity emerge? Whales are making a big splash in Web3Bay’s crypto presale , investing over $200K in just two days, eager to secure positions before prices rise in the next phase. As the presale progresses and prices increase, early investors are swiftly locking in their stakes. The opportunity is here—will you seize it? Web3Bay Presale Gains Speed as Whales Secure Positions— 2000K+ Raised in 24! Whales are actively securing their stakes in Web3Bay, with over $200K invested in just two days—a clear sign of their strong belief in the project’s potential. With each presale phase leading to a price hike, early investors are locking in their tokens now to capitalize before costs escalate. Currently priced at $0.00524, the tokens are set to launch at $0.1959, presenting a substantial upside for early participants. Web3Bay’s presale has already surpassed $1.5 million with over 395 million tokens sold, drawing those aiming to make the next big move in top crypto assets. As demand mounts, the cost of waiting could mean paying a significant premium later. This rush isn’t merely about securing a favorable price; it’s about getting in before the real wave of FOMO begins. The platform itself is turning heads with its decentralized e-commerce model , which eliminates intermediaries, reducing costs and enhancing security. Backed by strong fundamentals, Web3Bay is poised to become a key player in blockchain-powered commerce. As investment continues to flow, the pressing question remains: will you buy now, or face higher prices in the next stage? Polkadot (DOT) Approaches Key Resistance: Will It Break Through? Polkadot (DOT) is at a critical level, with traders eyeing the $5.50 resistance. A breakout above this point could drive DOT toward $7-$8, especially if buying volume increases. However, if prices fail to hold above this level, DOT might slide back to $4.00-$3.60, with a drop below $3.60 signaling deeper losses. Although DOT is still in a downtrend, breaking above its descending resistance could turn the outlook positive. Volume remains low, meaning DOT needs stronger buying pressure to sustain its bullish momentum. If that happens, prices could push toward $10-$12. On the flip side, failing to break resistance could increase selling pressure. Traders are watching the $5.00-$5.50 range closely—whichever side breaks first will set the tone for DOT’s next move. Mantra (OM) Rally Continues After 35% Price Surge OM price soared 35% within 24 hours, climbing above $7 and reaching a new all-time high. This rally pushed Mantra’s market cap to $7.3 billion, surpassing several Real-World Asset (RWA) competitors. Trading volume jumped 455% to $851 million, showing strong market interest, with many expecting further gains. The ADX indicator rose to 24.8, signaling that the uptrend is still strong and may continue. Technical indicators support the rally, with OM trading above the Ichimoku Cloud. The next key target is $8, with a move above $7.3 confirming the trend. However, if momentum slows, $6.48 is the main support level, followed by $5.26 and $4.37 if a pullback occurs. Wrapping Up! Polkadot (DOT) is on the verge of a breakout, but it must surpass $5.50 to confirm bullish momentum. If buying volume increases, prices could climb to $7-$8, while a failure could lead to a drop toward $4.00-$3.60. Meanwhile, OM price jumped 35%, reaching a high above $7, with traders eyeing $8 as the next target. Holding $6.48 is key to avoiding a deeper pullback. With major moves among top crypto assets, Web3Bay’s presale is drawing attention fast. Over $200K was secured in just two days as buyers locked in before prices rise. With 3BAY tokens priced at $0.00524 and a projected launch price of $0.1959, early buyers could see strong gains.

Solana’s SOL: Speeding Ahead in the World of Blockchain Among the numerous projects in the blockchain space, Solana is making a name for itself. Unlike its competitors, Solana offers the perfect mix of speed and scalability, ensuring that you never have to sacrifice one for the other.

At the heart of the Solana ecosystem is SOL, the native cryptocurrency that powers everything from lightning-fast transactions to program execution and rewarding dedicated network supporters.

The summit will feature prominent CEOs, investors, and key members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, including David Sacks and Bo Hines. This event marks a major milestone in the United States’ pro-crypto government stance. With regulatory agencies like the SEC now supporting the digital asset space, this summit is seen as a major step towards formalizing the government’s relationship with the cryptocurrency industry. Industry experts view this as incredibly bullish news for the crypto market. As more regulatory bodies show their support, the momentum for cryptocurrencies continues to grow. The summit will provide an opportunity for crypto industry leaders to engage directly with government officials, further solidifying the industry’s position. “The White House announced today that President Trump will host and deliver remarks at the first ever White House Crypto Summit on Friday, March 7. Attendees will include prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto industry, as well as members of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. The Summit will be chaired by the White House A.l. & Crypto Czar David Sacks, and administered by the Working Group’s Executive Director Bo Hines,” the statement read. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1895652998774456737 In addition to the summit, there is also news of the Trump Organization filing a trademark for the launch of a Metaverse and NFT trading platform. This move reflects Trump’s recognition of the potential of NFTs and the Metaverse, signaling a new era for digital assets. While NFTs gained popularity during the last market cycle, their use cases are expected to extend far beyond artwork. Experts predict that NFT technology will eventually revolutionize sectors like real estate, contracts, and even government identification, driving widespread adoption.

While artificial intelligence-driven tokens have dominated the headlines, real utility is where the future of blockchain lies. Story (IP) recently surged to $7.33 before cooling off, showing the power of AI-driven intellectual property. Meanwhile, SEI has cemented itself as a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, fine-tuned for DeFi trading, offering speed and efficiency unmatched in the market. But nothing is making waves quite like Qubetics . Unlike many blockchain projects that promise innovation but lack real-world application, Qubetics is delivering a game-changing decentralized VPN, revolutionizing online privacy and security. As digital finance evolves, these three projects are proving why they are the top crypto coins to buy now. Qubetics ($TICS): Decentralized VPN & Secure Transactions Privacy concerns are at an all-time high, and centralized VPN services are riddled with trust issues. Enter Qubetics—a decentralized VPN built on blockchain, ensuring absolute privacy and security without reliance on centralized servers. Qubetics’ decentralized VPN isn’t just another privacy solution. It ensures user anonymity by eliminating central points of failure, protecting professionals, businesses, and individuals from cyber threats. Imagine a journalist in a politically restrictive country, a business executive safeguarding sensitive data, or an everyday internet user tired of invasive tracking—Qubetics provides real, blockchain-backed protection. Right now, the crypto presale is in full swing, with $TICS tokens available at $0.0888. Over 21,600 buyers have already seized the opportunity, and analysts predict an ROI explosion. With projections soaring post-mainnet launch, the window to secure $TICS at a bargain price is closing fast. Story (IP): AI-Powered Intellectual Property on Blockchain Story Protocol is revolutionizing how intellectual property is managed. As an AI-powered blockchain project, it enables creators to tokenize and protect their work, ensuring rightful ownership and fair monetization. Since its February 13 launch, Story’s utility token, IP, has surged 115%, peaking at $7.33 before retracing. Social dominance initially spiked above 1%, reflecting massive market interest, though it has since dropped. With AI transforming multiple industries, Story is positioning itself as a leader in securing digital rights in a decentralized manner. IP’s retracement to $6.17 has traders on edge, with indicators like MACD and Bull Bear Power pointing to bearish momentum. If bulls defend the $5.64 support, a rebound to $8 could be imminent, making Story one of the most-watched crypto projects today. SEI: High-Performance DeFi Trading Blockchain SEI is a powerhouse for traders. This Layer 1 blockchain was built for speed, efficiency, and seamless DeFi trading, tackling high transaction costs and network congestion head-on. Latency and inefficiencies have long plagued decentralized trading platforms. SEI solves these problems with lightning-fast transactions and deep liquidity, making it the go-to platform for high-frequency traders and institutional players. Unlike most blockchains, SEI enhances cross-chain trading by providing seamless liquidity pools across different networks. This interoperability is crucial for traders seeking efficiency and cost savings, positioning SEI as a top choice in the DeFi sector. Conclusion The best crypto projects don’t just follow trends—they set them. Qubetics, with its decentralized VPN, is reshaping online security. Story Protocol is protecting intellectual property like never before, and SEI is driving efficiency in DeFi trading. These three powerhouses are the top crypto coins to buy now , each offering groundbreaking solutions in their respective fields.

The surge in Pi’s price has outpaced Bitcoin and other altcoins, generating excitement within the community. At the time of writing, Pi price is down by more than two percent and is trading at $2.32. There are speculations that Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, is set to list Pi Network, and this has caused a surge in market sentiment. Binance recently conducted a community poll on Twitter, asking users if Pi Network should be listed on the platform. With an overwhelming 86% voting in favor, investors and supporters are awaiting that Pi Network will soon be available for trading on Binance. This alleged listing is expected to send Pi’s price soaring, with many speculating that it could double or even triple following the listing, as coins listed on Binance tend to experience massive price gains due to the platform’s market power. Crypto influencers are already predicting that Pi could reach $10 shortly after its Binance listing. Despite a bearish overall market, Pi has already approached $3, and experts believe it could hit $5 by the end of April. Another factor contributing to Pi’s price surge is the ongoing public dispute between ByBit’s CEO and Pi Network’s founder, Nicholas K. This controversy has sparked increased attention, which in turn is positively impacting Pi’s market trajectory. With the Binance listing rumours and the ongoing market interest, Pi Network’s future looks promising. Traders and investors are eagerly awaiting the official announcement and the potential price explosion that could follow.

PS: I'll be in San Francisco next week for the American Banker Payment Forum. Say hello. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. New era The narrative The crypto industry racked up a number of early wins in the first month (and week) of Donald Trump's second term as U.S. president. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced it would drop or close half a dozen open investigations and ongoing cases, and asked courts to pause two more. Why it matters The crypto industry clearly won big during the 2024 election, and it's only just beginning to see what that means. Questions of how it actually should or shouldn't be regulated are now up in the air. Breaking it down Over the last week and change, the SEC filed to withdraw its case against crypto exchange Coinbase, pause its cases against Binance and Tron and informed ConsenSys, OpenSea, Robinhood, Uniswap and Gemini it would close its cases or investigations into those platforms. These announcements come on the heels of SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce announcing she would head up a new crypto task force at the regulatory agency and publishing a number of open questions to the general public about how securities law might apply to different types of cryptocurrencies and defining how the SEC would oversee this industry. The SEC also withdrew staff accounting bulletin 121, an accounting standard much of the industry hated. While there are a number of investigations or cases still outstanding, it's clear the SEC has taken a sharply diverging tack under Acting Chair Mark Uyeda from when former Chair Gary Gensler helmed the agency. Commissioner Hester Peirce said the SEC was now working to develop more policy that would guide the Division of Enforcement's future actions, rather than have these enforcement actions ""write regulatory policy."" ""We're really trying to get back to using our enforcement division for its intended purpose, and letting the regulatory divisions do the hard work of figuring out how to craft rules, guidance [and] interpretations,"" she told CoinDesk in an interview. ""And then enforcement has a role after that, of course, to enforce the rules that are on the books. But this has just been an area where we've kind of gone about it backwards, and we're trying to right the ship here."" The industry has been taking a victory lap with the withdrawals and dropped cases (and to be clear, it's not just the SEC withdrawing enforcement actions and investigations). Amanda Tuminelli, the chief legal officer at DeFi Education Fund, a decentralized finance-focused lobbying group, said any groups in the crypto sector should be more confident they would not be sued ""for a mere registration violation."" ""I don't think that we've won. I won't think that we have won until there are clear final rules on the books that make it clear, that are durable wins that make it clear that the industry is going to be able to innovate and exist for years in the future,"" she said in an interview. On the other side of this argument, the SEC — and Congress — are ""actively welcoming"" chaos from the crypto sector to the broader financial system, said Corey Frayer, the director of Investor Protection for the Consumer Federation of America and a former SEC senior adviser to Gensler. ""The SEC is not just abandoning enforcement actions, it's actively building an unregulated market for crypto assets,"" he said in an interview. This could create risk for contagion, he said, referencing FTX and Silicon Valley Bank's collapses. FTX had an issue with leverage (and the various FTX-affiliated tokens, which were used as collateral but lost their value following the exchange's collapse). ""As we’ve learned from prior financial crises, ramping up leverage risks that any single bad bet or any significant move in the value of one asset or intermediary will crash the entire crypto sector,"" Frayer said. Congress's efforts may take some time. Earlier this week, lawmakers with the Senate Banking Committee's new digital assets subcommittee convened its first hearing focused on future legislation. Lewis Cohen, an attorney who's long been active in the crypto sector and a witness at the hearing, said developers had ""raced ahead of the legal and policy frameworks designed decades ago."" ""Perhaps most critically, this uncertain regulatory environment has left consumers and users of digital assets at risk,"" he said. ""A clear, practical and flexible federal statutory regime is urgently needed to address activity involving digital assets in both the primary and the secondary markets."" Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Timothy Massad suggested Congress should focus on stablecoins and hold off on any kind of market structure legislation, at least until his former agency and the SEC have had a chance to work on rulemakings and guidance first. Tuminelli said she was worried that some builders might take these recent signs to mean ""it's just open season,"" even though she expects law enforcement agencies to continue cracking down on outright criminal activity. Other recent incidents, like Bybit's $1.5 billion hack, are also poor signs for the industry. ""We have things like Bybit to worry about, and we do have to worry about national security concerns and things like that,"" she said. ""So there are still going to be compliance issues that people need to pay attention to, even as there is a much greater runway in front of us.""

I'm told it's unlikely his account is compromised though. ETF bonanza Outside of enforcement actions, the crypto industry is looking to the SEC for another purpose: Approving a broad swath of new exchange-traded products backed by, or tracking the prices of digital assets that weren't under significant discussion a year ago.

The integration of AI (artificial intelligence) into blockchain technology is not just a trend or a narrative. It’s now a paradigm shift that is reshaping the crypto industry in profound ways. The rise and unexpected fall of AI agents in crypto Autonomous AI agents have become indispensable in the cryptocurrency world. They can process massive amounts of data, execute trades and make quick decisions. These sophisticated software systems are designed to perform specific tasks within the blockchain ecosystem without direct human oversight. By early 2025, the market capitalization of AI agent tokens will reach $14 billion, indicating rapid expansion. This growth is driven by the increasing integration of AI-powered solutions in the crypto space, including trading strategies and DeFi (decentralized finance) applications. Meanwhile, the integration of AI into the cryptocurrency landscape has taken an unexpected turn in 2025. While initial projections were optimistic, at the time of writing, recent data from Delphi Digital paints a different picture. AI frameworks and platforms have experienced the steepest decline, with an average drop of 84%. This sharp decline has caught many investors off guard, especially given the high expectations for AI-driven projects in the crypto space. Agent-based projects, which were touted as the next big thing in crypto innovation, didn’t fare much better. These projects have seen an average decrease of 73% year-over-year, a significant drop that raises questions about the long-term viability and adoption of AI agents in the crypto ecosystem. AI agents – B eyond simple bots However, it’s important to understand that AI agents are not just advanced versions of traditional trading bots. While bots operate according to predefined rules, AI agents can adapt to new information and change course based on market conditions. This flexibility allows them to do the following. Analyze blockchain data, social media trends and market patterns Identify investment opportunities Execute trades and manage portfolios autonomously The integration of AI into cryptocurrency has far-reaching implications. Advanced trading strategies AI agents can analyze real-time market data to identify trends, predict cryptocurrency price movements and optimize trading strategies – a capability that is particularly valuable in the volatile crypto markets , where quick decisions can make all the difference. Enhanced security AI-powered systems are being used to monitor blockchain transactions, detect irregularities and prevent fraud. As cases of cryptocurrency fraud have skyrocketed and scams such as phishing and scam schemes have become more sophisticated, the importance of AI-driven security solutions cannot be overstated. Democratizing advanced trading tools No-code platforms enable individuals without technical expertise to build complex AI tools, democratizing innovation in the crypto space. This accessibility is likely to drive broader adoption and foster a more connected ecosystem. The future of AI in crypto Looking ahead, we can expect to see the following. Exponential growth – Projections suggest that the number of AI agents could reach one million by the end of 2025, indicating widespread adoption across multiple platforms. Diversification – AI agents are expanding beyond DeFi into various sectors, including social media influence, financial analysis and interactive applications. AI-themed tokens – The convergence of AI and meme culture has given rise to AI-themed meme coins, adding a new dimension to the crypto market. Integration with traditional exchanges – Major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, Kraken and MEXC are integrating AI solutions to improve security, risk assessment and the trading experience for their users. While the potential for AI in crypto is immense, we must also be mindful of the challenges. Regulatory concerns – As AI-driven systems become more autonomous, questions of accountability and regulatory oversight become more pressing. Market manipulation – The power of AI could potentially be used to manipulate markets, raising concerns about fairness and transparency. Data privacy – As AI agents process vast amounts of data, ensuring the privacy and security of user information becomes paramount. In conclusion, I see the integration of AI into the cryptocurrency landscape as both an opportunity and a challenge. As industry leaders, it’s our responsibility to harness the power of AI to create more efficient, secure and accessible crypto markets, while also addressing the potential risks and ethical considerations. The future of crypto is undoubtedly intertwined with AI, and those who can successfully navigate this convergence will be well positioned to lead in the evolving digital economy.

USDT has established itself as the primary asset for value transfers and trading. In fact, CryptoQuant’s latest analysis revealed the overwhelming dominance of USDT on the Tron network, which accounts for 98.5% of the total stablecoin supply. USDT’s Market Share on Tron With a circulating supply of $62.76 billion out of nearly $64 billion in stablecoins on the network, USDT has established itself as the cornerstone of Tron’s stablecoin ecosystem. Competing stablecoins hold only marginal shares, with USDC representing 0.06%, USDD at 1.15%, TUSD at 0.26%, and USDJ making up just 0.01% of the supply, as per the on-chain analytic platform’s findings . Notably, the supply of other stablecoins has remained stagnant since March 2024. The same cannot be said for USDT which continued to expand while solidifying its market dominance. Beyond supply, USDT also plays a crucial role in Tron’s liquidity. Its daily on-chain volume from centralized exchanges ranges between $4 billion and $5 billion, spiking during periods of high TRX price volatility. This indicates that USDT not only dominates the network’s stablecoin supply but also serves as a critical pillar for trading activity and value transfers across the Tron blockchain. Data from IntoTheBlock further revealed that the Tron network currently processes over 14 million USDT transactions per week, which represents 69% of all USDT activity. This figure is a notable increase from 61% in late January. Zero-Fee USDT Transactions on Tron Tether’s USDT stablecoin is set to introduce commission-free transactions on the Tron blockchain, according to Tron founder Justin Sun’s recent post on X. The Gas Free feature will allow USDT transfers without requiring TRX tokens for gas fees, making transactions more accessible. Sun invited wallets and projects to integrate the feature through JustLend, which happens to be Tron’s official lending platform. Tron has been known for its low-cost USDT transfers compared to Ethereum, but recent data shows it has become one of the most expensive networks for USDT, with gas fees ranging between $3.06 and $6.22 – significantly higher than Ethereum’s $0.14 fees. As such, the new Gas Free feature aims to restore Tron’s position as a cost-effective stablecoin network by eliminating the need for users to hold TRX for transactions.

Back in 2013, no one took it seriously—until it skyrocketed. Early buyers who snagged DOGE for mere fractions of a cent are now sitting on millions. Missed that train? Don’t worry, because Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is offering a golden opportunity for those who regret not investing in Dogecoin’s early days. Dogecoin’s Early Days – The Ultimate Missed ICO Dogecoin was launched in December 2013 at an initial price of around $0.00026. At the time, it was considered nothing more than a fun meme coin. Fast forward to 2021, and DOGE soared past $0.70, delivering mind-blowing gains. Investors who put in just $100 in Dogecoin’s early days walked away with over $250,000 at its peak. The lesson? The best investments often look like jokes at first. Dogecoin proved that meme coins can explode, and now Arctic Pablo Coin is set to follow that path. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Big Meme Coin with Massive ROI Potential Arctic Pablo Coin is rewriting the rules of meme coin presales.

Not only that, but Arctic Pablo Coin also has a powerful token burn mechanism that permanently removes unsold tokens every week during the presale. This scarcity-boosting feature increases the coin’s value over time, just like what happened with DOGE when supply became a concern. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Staking & Rewards System – Passive Income for Holders Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just about price appreciation; it also offers an APY of 66% during the presale. This means investors can stake their tokens and earn even more, making it one of the top new meme coins for exponential returns . On top of that, the project features referral incentives and community competitions, ensuring early adopters get the most out of their investments. Time is Running Out – Get in Before the Next Price Jump Dogecoin’s early investors had years to accumulate. Arctic Pablo’s meme coin presale , however, is moving at lightning speed. It has already raised over $1.64 million, and as it moves to the next location, the price will only go up. If you want to lock in at $0.000067, now’s your moment. Once it hits exchanges at $0.008, the window for life-changing gains will have closed. Final Thoughts – Arctic Pablo Coin is the Next Meme Coin to Watch Dogecoin proved that meme coins can make millionaires. Arctic Pablo Coin is taking that legacy and adding higher rewards, staking, a strategic burn mechanism, and a thrilling presale journey. If you regret missing DOGE at $0.00026, this is your second chance. Get in before Arctic Pablo Coin leaves Penguinopolis and the price shoots up!

What The UTXO Data Is Telling Us,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-finding-a-bottom-what-the-utxo-data-is-telling-us/,"Bitcoin’s price recently experienced another significant downturn, falling below $80,000 earlier today—a nearly 20% decrease in just the past week. This prolonged slump highlights the broader challenges facing the market, with minimal signs of recovery in sight. Amid this turbulent price activity, insights from tugbachain, a contributor to the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, have shed light on an intriguing trend within the Bitcoin market: the shifting patterns of UTXO Realized Price Age Distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s 60-Day CDD Spikes: A Warning Sign or Buying Opportunity? UTXO Realized Price Age Distribution: Uncovering Key Support Levels The UTXO Realized Price Age Distribution metric provides a detailed look at realized prices across various age bands, effectively illustrating the holding patterns of different investor groups. By calculating the realized price—derived by dividing the Realized Cap by the total Bitcoin supply—this metric offers a snapshot of how both long-term holders and newer market entrants are behaving under current market conditions. Historically, certain realized price levels have functioned as key support zones during market corrections. In particular, the realized price levels for 1-month and 3-month periods often hold significance in bull markets. These levels are where fear-driven selling from smaller investors tends to peak, potentially creating an environment for larger players to stabilize the market. However, as tugbachain highlighted, these 1-3 month realized price levels have now fallen below their typical support thresholds. The next potential support area lies in the 3-month to 6-month range, approximately around $75,875. This shift signals that the market may still be searching for a solid foundation before any meaningful recovery can begin. Bitcoin: Analyzing the Bigger Picture In a separate analysis, tugbachain delves into the Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross metric, which serves as a key tool for identifying local market peaks and troughs. The NVT Golden Cross measures the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to its daily transaction volume. When this ratio exceeds certain thresholds, it can signal whether the market is overbought or oversold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Are Hoarding Their Crypto Despite Plunge—Here’s What It Means Currently, the NVT value is below -2.4, placing Bitcoin firmly in the oversold territory. Historically, oversold conditions at such levels have often coincided with local market bottoms. NVT Golden Cross and Market Conditions “An NVT value below -1.6 indicates a possible market bottom, pointing to oversold conditions. Currently, the NVT value is below -2.4.” – By @tugbachain Full analysis 👇https://t.co/VuIHzc6liT pic.twitter.com/eTXIrwjOo7 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 27, 2025 Should a rebound materialize from this oversold zone, tugbachain suggests that the 111-day moving average, currently at $96,895, may act as a resistance point during any price recovery. This perspective offers investors a potential roadmap for understanding and navigating the ongoing market plunge.

This area has proven to be a crucial level for the coin’s price, and any attempts to rally higher are likely to face resistance here. If XRP does experience a short-term bounce, traders should watch for resistance within this range. Current Support Levels: XRP has found some support around the $1.95 to $2 range. This is an important zone that has been acting as a price floor for XRP in recent weeks. In fact, the price recently bounced from exactly $1.95, which has been a recurring support level. Short-Term Outlook: On the smaller timeframes, XRP has triggered an oversold signal, indicating potential short-term relief. Historically, when XRP’s RSI has been oversold, it has resulted in some bullish relief over the next 1-3 days. However, this does not guarantee a long-term reversal. Bearish Divergence and Larger Trend: Despite some short-term bounces, the broader market structure for XRP remains bearish. There is still a larger bearish divergence visible on the chart, and no signals have emerged to invalidate this trend yet. This suggests that XRP is still in a downtrend, characterized by lower highs and lower lows. Critical Support Levels: On the flip side, the $1.95-$2.00 range continues to act as a key support area for XRP. If the price were to break below this level, it would invalidate the current bullish short-term setup. The next key support to watch would be $1.77, which is an important level. Medium-Term Scenario: If XRP holds above the $1.95-$2.00 range, there is still a potential for the price to climb in the medium term. However, the outlook remains cautious as the larger trend is still down. A significant breakout would require a move above $2.36, and ultimately $2.83, to signal a true reversal.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-01 05:01:15

Judge Carol Bagley Amon said the charges against Heart are not tied to the United States. Heart is the creator of the HEX token , the PulseX asset trading platform and the PulseChain blockchain. The SEC filed a suit against him in July 2023, alleging the three tokens — Hex (HEX), PulseChain (PLS) and PulseX (PSLX) — were unregistered securities and that Heart spent $12.1 million of investor money on sports cars, Rolex watches and the world’s largest black diamond. The SEC throws the book at Heart, doesn’t quite reach him The SEC suspected Heart of raising over $1 billion with his three tokens. According to Dexscreener.com, PLSX has gained 70.60% in value in the last 24 hours at the time of writing to reach $0.00004790 and had a market cap of $6.59 billion. HEX rose by 65.67% to $0.01619 with a $6.59 billion market cap. Both tokens saw large jumps in trading volume. “The alleged misappropriation occurred through digital wallets and crypto asset platforms, none of which were alleged to have any connection with the United States,” Amon found . The SEC was unsuccessful in having papers served to Heart in Finland in November 2023. In December 2024, lawyers for Heart were unsuccessful in getting the SEC’s case thrown out. Heart has legal troubles in Finland too Heart is an American citizen but has lived in Finland for a number of years. In Finland, he was charged with income tax evasion to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars between June 2020 and April 2024 and assault in September. Local press reported that the tax charges were related to the launch of the tokens. The assault charge comes from an incident in February 2021 and involves a minor. The Finnish police believe that he has left Finland. An Interpol red notice was issued for Heart in December. In January, Finnish authorities seized 20 luxury watches from an uninvolved third party that purportedly belonged to Heart. All the while the law enforcement has searched for him, Heart has maintained a presence on social media. “If the haters really wanted to get me down they could raise more than the $27M I did for medical research. Write free self help books better than my sciVive and Fix The World. Work in the courts for legal precedent for P2P publishing software. Found things that work flawlessly and become valuable,” he wrote on X in December. “Case dismissed. Thank you Judge Amon,” he posted on Feb. 28. Heart has posted close to 500 videos on his YouTube channel Heart Pulse Radio, starting in January 2022, but the channel has been inactive for the last two months.

The operation, conducted on February 25-26, 2025, spanned over 60 locations, including major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru.

The bill also calls for federal oversight for issuers with over $10 billion market cap.

March 1, 2025 05:46:46 UTC SEC’s Shift in Strategy Signals Bright Future for Crypto Industry The SEC has recently dropped multiple cases against major crypto platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and ConsenSys, signaling a more favorable environment for the industry under Acting Chair Mark Uyeda. While some analysts see this as a win, others caution that the lack of clear rules could still lead to future risks. The SEC is focusing on policy development, rather than using enforcement as regulation. Debate continues in Congress on stablecoins and market structure. March 1, 2025 05:44:17 UTC Federal Judge Dismisses SEC Lawsuit Against HEX Founder Richard Heart A U.S. federal judge has dismissed the SEC’s lawsuit against Richard Heart, the founder of HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX, ruling that the agency lacked jurisdiction. Judge Carol Bagley Amon stated that Heart’s online communications were “untargeted, globally available information” and not specifically aimed at U.S. investors. The court found that the SEC failed to prove Heart intentionally engaged with the U.S. market. The SEC can appeal or amend the ruling within 20 days.

Simon’s Cat Token and Book of Meme are dealing with some serious dips, as Simon’s Cat is down 7.12% in the last 24 hours and 15.7% over the past week, while BOME has lost 7.9% in a day and 15.3% in seven days. Trading volume for Simon’s Cat is also slipping, down 4.6%, showing signs of lower engagement from traders. On the other hand, BTFD Coin is in full bull mode, with a presale that has already raised over $6.21 million and a projected 3,650% ROI potential. The launch of its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game on January 1, 2025, combined with 90% APY staking and a 100% bonus code offer, has turned it into one of the best new meme coins to buy today . BTFD Coin’s Play-to-Earn Game Brings a New Era for Meme Coins Why settle for a meme coin that just rides the hype when there’s one that actually pays players to play? That’s the game-changing model behind BTFD Coin’s P2E ecosystem , which is already live and rewarding users for engaging in battles, completing quests, and climbing leaderboards. Unlike most projects still in development, BTFD’s P2E game is fully operational, attracting a growing community of players eager to stack up BTFD tokens. The most bullish part? Tokens earned in-game can be staked for 90% APY, meaning players not only enjoy the game but also multiply their holdings while they play. With Stage 14 of its presale in motion, a current price of $0.00016, and over 70 billion BTFD tokens sold, this meme coin is proving why it’s one of the best new meme coins to buy today. Investors are watching closely because once BTFD lists at $0.0006, early buyers could be sitting on 275% gains—and if it hits the $0.006 moon price, that’s a wild 3,650% ROI. An investment of $8,000 at the current $0.00016 price gets you 50 million BTFD tokens. If the price climbs to $0.0006, that’s already worth $30,000. But if BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 moon price, that same $8,000 turns into a life-changing $300,000. Buying BTFD is simple. Set up a wallet using MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head to the BTFD presale page . Connect your wallet, enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code, buy your tokens, and claim them before listing. With the presale speeding toward its final stages and a 100% bonus code doubling tokens, BTFD is the biggest meme coin opportunity on the market right now. Simon’s Cat Sees Market Dips but Holds Strong Brand Power Simon’s Cat Token might be going through a 7.12% daily drop and a 15.7% weekly decline, but it still holds a strong cultural presence. Backed by the official Simon’s Cat brand with over 1.6 billion YouTube views, this memecoin is unique in its approach—combining meme culture with real-world cat rescue initiatives. Its short-term price action shows some hesitation in the market, with trading volume also slipping by 4.6%. However, long-term believers in the Simon’s Cat IP integration into Web3 are watching closely to see if the token can regain momentum. With a growing NFT presence and an expanding social media following, Simon’s Cat could turn things around, but for now, it remains in a downward trend. Book of Meme Faces Price Struggles Despite Strong Web3 Vision Book of Meme (BOME) is an experimental Web3 project that aims to merge memes, decentralized storage, and tokenized communities. Despite this ambitious goal, BOME has taken a hit, with a 7.9% daily drop and a 15.3% decline over the past seven days. One interesting aspect of BOME is its focus on decentralized meme preservation, using Solana, Arweave, and IPFS to permanently store memes on the blockchain. This approach aligns with the future of decentralized social media, making memes resistant to censorship or deletion. Even with a slight 1.75% trading volume increase, BOME still struggles to keep price stability. The project’s success will likely depend on its ability to attract more adoption from the meme community in the coming weeks. Final Words Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is dominating the meme coin space with its P2E game, presale growth, and massive earning potential. While Simon’s Cat and Book of Meme are dealing with short-term price dips, BTFD’s 90% staking APY, 100% bonus code, and Play-to-Earn model are fueling investor demand. With a presale price of $0.00016, a listing target of $0.0006, and a projected $0.006 moon price, BTFD’s 3,650% ROI potential is turning heads. Add in the fact that the LAUNCH100 bonus code doubles token purchases, and this could be the last major chance to get in before prices explode. BTFD or get left behind—the choice is yours. Join the BTFD Coin presale today . FAQs What makes BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to buy today? BTFD Coin offers a fully launched Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY staking, and a presale that has already raised over $6.21 million, making it stand out from the typical meme coin crowd. How does the LAUNCH100 bonus work for BTFD Coin? When investors use the LAUNCH100 bonus code during the presale, they receive double the amount of BTFD tokens, making this one of the most lucrative opportunities in crypto right now. What is the potential return on investment for BTFD Coin? At the current presale price of $0.00016, BTFD will list at $0.0006, offering 275% immediate gains. But if it reaches its $0.006 moon price, investors could see a massive 3,650% ROI.

Ukrainian lawmakers are working on a crypto tax bill, with the final version expected by mid-2025. The proposed tax rates range from 5% to 10%, but for undocumented crypto holdings, the tax could go as high as 23%. Ukraine Moves Closer to Crypto Taxation As Ukraine continues to legalize cryptocurrency, officials are drafting a bill that would introduce a 5% to 10% tax on crypto transactions. The goal is to use these funds to support the state budget and strengthen military operations amid the ongoing conflict with Russia. According to Danylo Hetmantsev, head of the Verkhovna Rada’s Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy, the primary text of the bill has already been finalized. However, discussions are ongoing about how authorities will monitor and regulate crypto transactions. Hetmantsev further noted that the bill is expected to pass its first reading by March 2025, but full implementation might take longer. Debate Over Tax Structure Meanwhile, Taras Kozak, deputy of the Kyiv City Council, believes the process could extend into 2026. He noted that Ukrainians widely support a 5% crypto tax which could be a fair rate. However, the government is also considering a more traditional tax structure. Under current rules, individuals pay an 18% income tax plus a 5% military tax, bringing the total to 23%. If applied to crypto income, investors could face significantly higher tax burdens. 23% Tax for Undocumented Crypto Holdings One of the key provisions of the bill is a 23% tax rate on undocumented crypto assets. Investors who fail to provide proof of their initial investment sources may be required to pay this higher tax. As Ukraine pushes ahead with crypto legalization, the final decision on tax rates will play a crucial role in shaping the country’s digital asset growth.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-01 05:19:10

The major agenda of the summit is to address the infrastructure and regulatory challenges faced by the crypto industry while encouraging innovation in this space. What to Expect from First Crypto Summit? The official White House press release shows that President Donald Trump will deliver remarks at the first-ever White House Crypto Summit, set to take place on Friday, March 7. Chaired by David Sachs, the White House’s “Crypto Czar” and hosted by Bo Hines, the group’s Executive Director, the event will have crypto leads coming together including founders, CEOs, investors, and members of the President’s Digital Asset Working Group. As America’s First Crypto President, Donald Trump will set the tone for his policy approach with Executive Order 14178. The order states that the Trump administration would prioritize “the healthy growth and use of digital assets in all sectors of the economy”. Furthermore, as opposed to the previous regulatory challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry, the Trump administration will introduce clear frameworks, encourage innovation, and uphold economic freedom. Will Working Group, David Sacks Push Crypto Policy Ahead? The digital assets working group includes the US Treasury, the Justice Department, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Earlier this week, the US SEC dropped lawsuits against crypto exchange Gemini, and has delayed decisions in the Binance lawsuit for 60 days, as the securities regulatory agency is working on a crypto task force. The Crypto Summit next week will probably offer greater insights into the crypto task force’s working under the leadership of Hester Peirce and key initiatives that are ahead of schedule. Earlier this month, crypto czar David Sacks confirmed that significant announcements regarding U.S. cryptocurrency policy are on the horizon. In preparation, the inter-agency Digital Asset Working Group has intensified its efforts, collaborating closely with the SEC and CFTC on joint initiatives. During a press conference, Crypto Czar David Sacks announced that his team is actively exploring the creation of a Bitcoin Reserve . Sacks stated that this initiative is among the top priorities being evaluated by the administration’s internal digital asset working group.

40992439,https://invezz.com/?p=2594664,1740807900,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Experts compare this altcoin to Ethereum (ETH) in 2021, is MUTM the next major investment?",https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/01/experts-compare-this-altcoin-to-ethereum-eth-in-2021-is-mutm-the-next-major-investment/,"Ethereum’s early investors saw life-changing returns, and now analysts believe a new opportunity may be emerging with Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Unlike speculative tokens, MUTM is a DeFi lending protocol designed for real financial utility, allowing users to supply, borrow, and earn passive income. Its presale is moving fast, with over 3,050 holders securing their tokens at $0.015, as investors anticipate significant price growth post-launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance ’s presale is drawing massive interest, with over $1,543,653.32 raised in less than 18 days. The project has already completed 26% of the second phase in just 96 hours, making it one of the fastest-growing presales of 2025. Investors are taking advantage of the low entry price before the next increase, positioning themselves for potential high returns. With a launch price set at $0.06, early investors are already looking at a 400% gain before the token even hits exchanges. However, experts believe that as the platform gains adoption and exchange listings go live, MUTM could surpass $1–$2 in the coming months, following a trajectory similar to Ethereum’s early days. Mutuum Finance stands out from the crowd because it isn’t just another altcoin, it’s a decentralized lending protocol with real-world use cases. Instead of relying on speculation, MUTM offers a practical way for users to earn passive income while maintaining asset ownership. Lenders can deposit assets like USDT, ETH, or BTC into liquidity pools, earning interest based on demand. Borrowers, on the other hand, can use their assets as collateral to access funds without a fixed repayment schedule, only paying interest according to the platform’s APY model. The platform provides two lending options: Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Direct lending agreements give borrowers access to tokens that aren’t normally available in liquidity pools, such as lower-cap assets and meme coins like DOGE and SHIB. Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Users contribute assets to liquidity pools, earning passive income while borrowers obtain funds directly from the platform. This model establishes a balanced ecosystem, guaranteeing long-term price growth and sustainable token demand. Mutuum Finance also features a buy-and-distribute mechanism designed to support token price stability. A portion of the platform’s revenue is used to buy back MUTM tokens, creating constant buy pressure. These acquired tokens are then distributed to mtToken holders, further rewarding long-term investors. mtTokens represent user deposits, acting as interest-bearing assets that grow in value over time. For example, an investor supplying 10,000 USDT will receive mtUSDT, which increases in value as interest accrues. Because of this, customers can profit without actively trading, which makes MUTM a great choice for those looking for passive income. To increase the platform’s use cases, the team is also creating an overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will offer consumers more liquidity choices while maintaining price stability because it will be backed by assets provided through Mutuum’s lending mechanism. With the presale price at $0.015 and an expected launch price of $0.06, early investors are already positioned for solid gains. However, analysts predict MUTM could surge beyond $1 or even $2, reflecting a minimum 45x increase from its presale price. For example, an investor who buys 300,000 MUTM tokens at the current presale price of $0.015 would invest $4,500. If MUTM reaches $2, as analysts predict, that same investment would grow to $600,000. With strong fundamentals, real-world utility, and growing demand, many see this as a rare opportunity to enter early before the price surges. Mutuum Finance is proving itself as a strong DeFi contender, with a rapidly growing presale and real-world financial applications. Those who missed early Ethereum have an opportunity to secure a high-utility altcoin before its price surges. With the presale still open but moving fast, investors looking for long-term gains and stable DeFi opportunities should consider joining before the next price jump.

The firm points to macroeconomic factors like a strengthening US dollar and shifting central bank policies as key drivers of Bitcoin’s struggle. Bitcoin Dips Below $80K Amid Market Sell-Off Bitcoin’s recent decline follows a broader financial market shift, with the US dollar strengthening due to tighter liquidity conditions. The US Dollar Index (DXY) has been rising, making risk assets like Bitcoin more vulnerable. Matrixport analysts suggest that this correction could be part of a natural 13-week cycle observed in past Bitcoin price movements Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy remains a key factor, with a more hawkish stance anticipated due to rising inflation expectations. Market analysts also note the increasing correlation between Bitcoin and traditional financial markets, making it susceptible to macroeconomic shifts Hence, there is a strong chance that mid-April will mark the lowest point of the year for Bitcoin. This goes against the prevailing expectation that the market will pump and change its current course. Even if such a pump occurs, it will likely be short-lived, creating a false sense of strength. While most people anticipate a rally in mid-April, it may turn out to be a trap. Only from that point will the market begin a healthy recovery, following the “natural” cycle toward the expected highs in Q3. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today : March 1st – Whitehouse Crypto Summit, Bitcoin News, Pi Coin Price , Bulls Still Betting on a Rebound Despite these bearish signals, some traders remain positive. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs , which have brought in $39 billion since their launch in early 2024, continues to shape market sentiment. However, Markus Thielen from 10x Research suggests that over half of these inflows are likely tied to arbitrage strategies rather than long-term investments. Even after shedding all election gains, BTC is back to square one. Still, some traders believe that “buying the dip” is a golden opportunity at this stage. Santiment data shows that mentions of “buy the dip” have surged to their highest level since July 2024. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investment, believes the market may be nearing a short-term bottom, while CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju maintains that the bull cycle isn’t over—though he warns that a drop below $75,000 could change that outlook. For now, Bitcoin remains under pressure, but with strong bullish sentiment still in play, traders are watching closely to see if the correction extends or if a rebound is on the horizon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ukraine has decided to move forward with the legalization of digital assets, and legislation is expected to be completed by mid-2025. Ukrainian local media reported on Feb. 28th that the country’s lawmakers were expected to vote on a long-awaited bill in the coming months, but uncertainty over how digital assets will be taxed remained a key issue that could impact the country’s growing crypto sector. According to the report, the issue of legalization and taxation of crypto in the country has long been in ‘limbo’, but it is assumed that ‘people’s deputies will vote for the corresponding bill already in the first quarter of 2025’. Taras Kozak, the president of the investment group UNIVER and deputy of the Kyiv City Council, said that the problem with the legality of the digital assets market will be solved by the summer, although what happens with income tax is still unclear. Chairman Hetmantsev disclosed that he was doing everything possible to fast-track the adoption of a bill on the legalization of crypto. Hetmantsev predicts first reading by the end of March JUST IN: UKRAINE IS MOVING FORWARD WITH THE LEGALIZATION OF CRYPTO WITH LAWMAKERS EXPECTED TO VOTE ON A BILL IN THE COMING MONTHS. Source: @News_Crypto https://t.co/B9k739hp5y pic.twitter.com/Kpsc5HxssA — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) March 1, 2025 Chairman Hetmantsev forecasted that the first reading would take place by the end of March, and the second reading in the parliament would follow immediately after. He noted that the law should be adopted by the summer, although Kozak disagreed with him, saying that he expected these procedures to be completed in 2026. Kozak added that he was an optimist and believes that the draft law will pass all readings in the Verkhovna Rada, be signed, and that crypto will be legalized and income from it will be taxed from 2026. According to Kozak, investors and businesses that use crypto in their activities were not against replenishing the state budget, but the final rate was very important. The consensus of this community is 5%, so many Ukrainians are ready to pay with income, he added. However, the state was still discussing standard taxation with a proposed 18% tax on the income of individuals plus 5% military levy. Ukrainians who invest before the law comes into force will pay 23% of the entire asset and not from the income received because they will not be able to prove the origin of their original finances. “I am inclined to the fact that there should be a small tax – about 5% to 10%. All incomes of citizens should be taxed, because our state lives on this money, our army fights, we buy weapons and maintain security.” -Taras Kozak Hetmantsev previously cautioned that ‘Ukrainians should have no illusions about the introduction of benefits’. He added that the crypto market was not going to receive a low rate, but there would be ‘an ordinary model of taxation of operations from securities’ when all investment profits were taxed. People’s Deputy says no preferential taxation conditions for crypto after legalization Hetmantsev stated at the EP forum “Prospects for Investments Within the Country” that while Ukraine was most likely to legalize crypto in Q1 of 2025, ‘one should not count on preferential taxation conditions’. He also said that there will be no tax breaks for crypto, and taxation will be applied according to the securities model, where profits will be taxed when assets are converted into currency. The head of the Verkhovna Rada Tax Committee explained that Ukrainian officials were in consultations with European experts and the IMF, and they were cautious about using crypto with tax benefits due to the possibility of tax evasion in traditional markets. Hetmantsev emphasized the urgency of passing the crypto legislation, arguing that delays could hinder Ukraine’s ability to attract foreign investment in crypto-based industries. According to Hetmantsev, if the law is enacted, Ukraine will join a growing list of countries formally integrating crypto into their financial and tax systems. However, industry leaders stressed that taxation policies will play a crucial role in determining whether the crypto market will flourish or struggle under regulatory pressure.

The Summit will feature prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto ecosystem. The White House Crypto Summit will also be attended by the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. The White House AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks will chair the Summit, while the Working Group’s Executive Director Bo Hines will administer the event in White House. The Working Group on Digital Assets also includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other key officials tasked with shaping the digital asset framework. President Trump plans to host the first-ever Crypto Summit next Friday First-ever White House Crypto Summit • Date: March 7 • Host: President Trump • Attendees: Crypto founders, CEOs, investors, and officials • Chair: White House A.I. & Crypto Czar David Sacks pic.twitter.com/BodE9OGmcQ — Terminus (@terminus_pos) March 1, 2025 The White House revealed that it will host the White House Crypto Summit on Friday, March 7. President Trump is set to deliver remarks during the Summit as he pledged to be “America’s first crypto president.” The event is set to bring together industry leaders, CEOs, investors, and members of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets in a bid to shape the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in the United States. David Sacks, the White House’s AI & Crypto Czar, shared that he was looking forward to “seeing everyone there!” Sacks will chair the Summit, with Bo Hines serving as Executive Director at the event. The White House highlighted plans to introduce a clear regulatory framework for the crypto industry while supporting innovation and promoting economic liberty. The Summit aligned with Trump’s Executive Order 14178, signed in his first week in office, which outlined his administration’s commitment to the “responsible growth and use of digital assets…across all sectors of the economy.” The order also directed federal agencies to prioritize policies encouraging crypto adoption while addressing fraud and money laundering risks. Trump’s administration pressed on its predecessor for having “unfairly prosecuted” the cryptocurrency industry. The event will mark a strong departure from the previous administration’s stricter regulatory stance, which led to heightened legal challenges for the digital asset industry. The White House Summit will not be just a policy meeting for the President but a political statement. Trump’s campaign actively engaged with crypto advocates, which positioned him as a pro-innovation leader in contrast to what he refers to the Biden administration as “war on digital assets.” His predecessor enforced regulatory crackdowns on crypto firms and exchanges, which drew ire from industry advocates who argued it stifled innovation in the financial industry. Sarah Jennings, CEO of CryptoPulse blockchain analytic firm, believes that the meeting “could be a game-changer if they deliver on the promise of clarity.” Jennings also highlighted that the last four years were a regulatory minefield and “businesses need predictability to thrive.” Sacks wants to create a golden age for cryptocurrencies. The President established a working group for digital currencies to propose Federal regulatory frameworks governing the issuance and operation of cryptocurrencies. In his first press conference on Bitcoin and digital assets, Sacks said the first thing industry experts wanted from Washington was regulatory clarity. “They just want to know what the rules of the road are so they can abide by them. We’re coming off frankly four years of arbitrary prosecution and persecution of crypto companies where the SEC wouldn’t tell founders what the rules were and then they would prosecute them.” -David Sacks, AI & Crypto Czar. Sacks added that many founders told him stories of “being debunked personally just because they had founded a crypto company.” The lawmaker also noted that he was looking forward to working with the politicians hosting the conference alongside him in “creating a golden age for digital assets.” Senator Tim Scott highlighted that this “golden age has begun” and that “the good news is that it’s going to get better.” Scott added that he will “work synergistically with the House and the Senate, with the White House leading the way” when it comes to passing bills on virtual currencies.

40994429,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135653,1740811736,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unstoppable DeepSeek AI: Challenging US Dominance in the Chatbot Race,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/unstoppable-deepseek-ai-chatbot/,"The AI world is buzzing, and the spotlight is firmly on DeepSeek. This Chinese AI lab has seemingly appeared out of nowhere, yet its AI Chatbot App has skyrocketed to the top of app store charts, sparking intense debate. Is the US losing its grip on AI leadership? Will the demand for AI chips continue to surge? Let’s dive into the story of DeepSeek, exploring its origins and its meteoric rise to global recognition. DeepSeek’s Intriguing Origins: From Trading Floors to AI Frontiers DeepSeek’s roots are in the world of finance. It’s backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese hedge fund leveraging AI for trading decisions. Liang Wenfeng, a passionate AI enthusiast and former Zhejiang University student, co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. By 2019, High-Flyer was a dedicated hedge fund, deeply invested in AI algorithms. In 2023, DeepSeek emerged as a separate AI research lab under High-Flyer, eventually spinning off as its own entity, also named DeepSeek. From its inception, DeepSeek prioritized building its own data centers for model training. However, like other Chinese AI innovators, it has navigated the complexities of US export restrictions on advanced hardware. To train its cutting-edge models, DeepSeek reportedly utilized Nvidia H800 chips, a less powerful alternative to the H100 chips more readily available to US-based companies. Interestingly, DeepSeek’s team is known for its youth and dynamism, actively recruiting PhD holders from top Chinese universities and even individuals from non-computer science backgrounds to broaden the AI’s understanding across diverse subjects. This blend of expertise and fresh perspectives appears to be a key ingredient in DeepSeek’s rapid ascent. Unveiling DeepSeek’s Powerful Generative AI Models DeepSeek burst onto the scene in November 2023 with its initial suite of models: DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat. However, it was the spring of 2024 that truly turned heads when the company launched its next-generation DeepSeek-V2 family. This powerful system, capable of analyzing both text and images, excelled in AI benchmark tests and boasted remarkable cost-efficiency compared to its contemporaries. DeepSeek-V2’s impact was immediate, pushing domestic competitors like ByteDance and Alibaba to drastically reduce prices or even offer some of their models for free. The subsequent release of DeepSeek-V3 in December 2024 further solidified DeepSeek’s growing reputation. DeepSeek’s internal testing indicates that V3 outperforms both open-source models like Meta’s Llama and closed models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Adding to its arsenal, DeepSeek introduced the R1 “reasoning” model in January. DeepSeek asserts that R1 matches OpenAI’s o1 model in performance on crucial benchmarks. Reasoning models like R1 are designed to fact-check themselves, mitigating common errors. While they may take slightly longer to process, their enhanced reliability in fields like physics, science, and mathematics is a significant advantage. Here’s a quick comparison of DeepSeek’s key models: Model Description Key Features DeepSeek Coder Code generation model Efficient code generation, supports multiple languages DeepSeek LLM Large Language Model General-purpose text understanding and generation DeepSeek Chat Chatbot model Conversational AI, user interaction DeepSeek-V2 General-purpose text and image analysis High performance, cost-effective, multi-modal DeepSeek-V3 Advanced LLM Outperforms Llama and GPT-4o in internal benchmarks DeepSeek R1 Reasoning Model Self-fact-checking, high reliability in complex domains However, there’s a crucial aspect to consider. As a Chinese-developed AI, DeepSeek’s models are subject to content regulation by China’s internet authorities. This means its responses are assessed to align with “core socialist values.” For instance, DeepSeek’s chatbot app with R1 will not engage with topics deemed sensitive, such as Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. This content filtering is a significant factor differentiating DeepSeek from Western AI models. A Disruptive Force in the AI Industry Disruption DeepSeek’s business strategy remains somewhat enigmatic. It offers its products and services at prices significantly below market averages, even providing some for free. DeepSeek attributes this to breakthroughs in efficiency, enabling extreme cost competitiveness. While some experts question these claims, developers are flocking to DeepSeek’s models. Although not strictly open source, DeepSeek offers permissive licenses allowing commercial use. Clem Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, notes that developers on their platform have created over 500 derivative models of R1, amassing 2.5 million downloads. DeepSeek’s impact on the AI landscape is undeniable. Its success against larger, more established competitors has been described as both “upending AI” and “over-hyped.” Notably, DeepSeek’s rise contributed to an 18% drop in Nvidia’s stock price in January and prompted a public statement from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Microsoft has integrated DeepSeek into its Azure AI Foundry service, highlighting its enterprise-level appeal. When questioned about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI investments, CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized that AI infrastructure spending remains a “strategic advantage” for Meta. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,” pointing out that reasoning models like DeepSeek’s are beneficial for Nvidia due to their high compute demands. Conversely, DeepSeek faces growing scrutiny. Some companies, and even entire countries like South Korea and governments like New York state, have banned DeepSeek on government devices, signaling concerns about its origins and potential influence. The Future of DeepSeek and the China AI Race What lies ahead for DeepSeek? Continued model improvements are a given. However, the increasing wariness from the US government regarding perceived foreign influence adds a layer of complexity. DeepSeek’s journey is intertwined with the broader China AI Race and the global competition for AI dominance. Its innovative models and disruptive pricing are forcing established players to react and adapt. Whether DeepSeek can maintain its momentum amidst geopolitical tensions and regulatory hurdles remains to be seen. One thing is clear: DeepSeek has undeniably shaken up the AI world and ignited a crucial conversation about the future of AI leadership and accessibility.

40994556,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135663,1740811934,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary ChatGPT Sora Integration: Unleashing AI Video Generation Power,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chatgpt-sora-ai-video/,"Get ready for a game-changing update in the world of artificial intelligence! OpenAI, the company behind the groundbreaking ChatGPT, has announced its ambitious plan to weave its cutting-edge AI video generator, Sora, directly into the ChatGPT experience. Imagine creating stunning, cinematic videos simply by typing prompts into your favorite chatbot. This integration promises to democratize video creation, bringing powerful AI video tools to a much wider audience, including the crypto and tech-savvy community. Exciting News: ChatGPT to Get AI Video Generation Power with Sora Integration In a recent office hours session on Discord, OpenAI leaders unveiled their vision to embed Sora into ChatGPT. Currently, Sora exists as a standalone web application launched in December, allowing users to generate short, twenty-second video clips. However, Rohan Sahai, OpenAI’s product lead for Sora, confirmed that the company is actively working to expand Sora’s reach, with ChatGPT integration being a key priority. This move signals OpenAI’s intent to make AI video generation more accessible and user-friendly, moving beyond its initial focus on creative professionals and video production studios. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: Direct Integration: OpenAI is developing a method to directly integrate Sora into ChatGPT, merging the capabilities of both platforms. Broader Accessibility: This integration aims to make Sora’s powerful video generation accessible to ChatGPT’s vast user base. Timeline Undefined: While the plan is confirmed, OpenAI has not yet provided a specific timeline for when this integration will be rolled out. Unlocking Creative Potential: Benefits of Sora in ChatGPT The integration of OpenAI Sora into ChatGPT holds immense potential, offering a plethora of benefits for users. Imagine the possibilities: Simplified Video Creation: No need to switch between different platforms. Generate videos directly within the familiar ChatGPT interface using simple text prompts. Enhanced User Experience: ChatGPT Sora integration promises a seamless and intuitive video creation experience, making it accessible to users of all skill levels. Content Creation Revolution: From explaining complex crypto concepts visually to creating engaging social media content, the applications are virtually limitless. Potential Premium Features: Integrating Sora into ChatGPT could also incentivize users to upgrade to premium ChatGPT subscriptions, potentially offering higher video generation limits and advanced features. While the exact feature set of Sora within ChatGPT remains to be seen, it’s likely that the initial version might offer a streamlined experience compared to the dedicated Sora web app. Sahai hinted that the ChatGPT version might not have the same level of granular control as the web app, where users can edit and stitch footage. This suggests OpenAI might be prioritizing ease of use and accessibility for the ChatGPT integration. Navigating the Challenges: Control and Accessibility of Sora within ChatGPT While the prospect of Sora AI in ChatGPT is exciting, there are considerations to keep in mind regarding control and accessibility: Feature Sora Web App Potential ChatGPT Integration Control Level High (editing, stitching) Potentially Lower (simplified interface) Complexity Potentially Steeper Learning Curve Likely More User-Friendly Target Audience Creatives, Video Professionals Broader ChatGPT User Base One of the reasons OpenAI initially launched Sora as a separate web app was to maintain ChatGPT’s simplicity. Introducing complex video editing features directly into ChatGPT could potentially overwhelm users. Therefore, a more streamlined version of AI video tools within ChatGPT makes sense for wider adoption. Beyond Video: Sora’s Future Image Generation and Mobile App Ambitions The ambition for Sora extends beyond video. OpenAI is reportedly developing an AI image generator powered by Sora. This could be a significant leap forward in image generation, potentially surpassing the photorealism of images created by DALL-E 3, which currently powers ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities. Imagine creating hyper-realistic images alongside cinematic videos, all within the same AI ecosystem. Furthermore, OpenAI is exploring a standalone mobile app for Sora. Sahai mentioned they are actively seeking mobile engineers for the Sora team, indicating a serious consideration for a dedicated mobile experience. This suggests a future where Sora could be accessible across multiple platforms – web, chatbot, and mobile – further expanding its reach and utility. What This Means for Crypto and Tech Enthusiasts For those in the cryptocurrency and tech space, the integration of Sora into ChatGPT represents a significant advancement in accessible AI. Imagine: Creating engaging educational content about blockchain, NFTs, or DeFi with visually stunning videos generated effortlessly. Developing marketing materials for crypto projects with high-quality video explainers and promotional clips. Visualizing complex data and trends in the crypto market through dynamic and informative video presentations. The possibilities are vast, and as AI video tools become more integrated into everyday platforms like ChatGPT, we can expect a surge in creative applications across various sectors, including the innovative world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Conclusion: The Dawn of AI-Powered Video Creation for Everyone OpenAI’s plan to integrate Sora into ChatGPT is a bold step towards making advanced AI video generation accessible to everyone. While the exact implementation and timeline are still under wraps, the potential impact is undeniable. This move promises to democratize video creation, empowering users to unleash their creativity and communicate ideas in visually compelling ways. As we await the arrival of Sora within ChatGPT, one thing is clear: the future of content creation is becoming increasingly visual and AI-driven.

CZ has claimed that this will help boost the BNB ecosystem . He said , “I will add a few hundred BNB in liquidity to the BNB Chain weekly winners until no funds are left.” The crypto community supports CZ’s decision to strengthen the BNB project’s liquidity CZ has maintained that he wants to provide consistent liquidity to the BNB chain ecosystem. In an X post on February 28, the former CEO claimed he would donate BNB from his own address until the funds were fully exhausted. Some analysts agree that Zhao’s weekly BNB injections could stabilize the meme projects’ liquidity and even mitigate price volatility. This could help build a more predictable space for developers and users. Not to mention, Zhao has claimed that they will probably expand their initiative to include more crypto assets and not just meme coins. Multiple X users have already expressed gratitude to Zhao, saying that the liquidity program is a great initiative. One user even stated that Zhao deserved the gains from every project that would see increased liquidity. CZ says he will not return tokens that are sent to his address However, in his X post, CZ asked the crypto community not to send any funds to his BNB address. According to Zhao, once he donated 150BNB, about $100,000, he received over $1 million back. He warned those sending him tokens to his address, hoping they’d have an interaction with him once he sends the tokens back, that he wouldn’t return the tokens. He even called them out for being “greedy.” He further argued that returning tokens would be more tedious for him. Moreover, he plans to either leave the tokens or burn them, adding that he has no intention of promoting them. He also stated that he considered selling them to BNB, like Vitalik. However, he claimed that doing so could harm crypto projects and alter crypto prices. He even claimed that selling the tokens would be more work for him, saying he’d choose the “least amount of work.” Nevertheless, Zhao has maintained that he doesn’t know when he’ll have time to deal with those tokens; however, he reserves his right to change his plans regarding them.

However, DOGE managed to remain north of a key support line on the daily scale. This suggests an upcoming rally, according to analysts, and a potential surge by triple digits. The massacre that took place within the past week was nothing short of mindblowing, and meme coins were hit the hardest. Recall that DOGE stood above $0.26 last Friday before the Bybit hack, Trump’s escalating trade war, and the overall market crash started to push it south hard. The culmination came a week later as the largest and oldest meme coin plunged to just over $0.18. This represented a 30% slump within the span of a week. Moreover, DOGE had dumped by 60% since the 2025 peak of $0.44. However, the asset didn’t spend much time below $0.19 and actually managed to reclaim it within hours. This is of particular significance as the $0.19 support line has been described multiple times as crucial for DOGE. If broken, it could result in a price drop to $0.06, which would essentially invalidate the entire bull market narrative. In contrast, a rebound from it could mean a surge to $0.5, as Ali Martinez and other analysts noted on X. To do so, though, DOGE has a long way to go as it needs a 150% surge from this point on in a time when all the hype in the crypto market has evaporated. Still, Dogecoin has proven before that it is able of spectacular price rises in relatively short times. #Dogecoin $DOGE holds above a critical support level! pic.twitter.com/jDNo5aoAdw — Ali (@ali_charts) March 1, 2025 The post Good News for Dogecoin (DOGE) Investors: Is $0.5 Still in Play? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|DOGEBTC|DOGEUSD|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,DOGE|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-03-01 07:03:53

Kiyosaki slams Bitcoin ETF as ‘bankster’s money’,https://finbold.com/r-kiyosaki-slams-bitcoin-etf-as-banksters-money/,"Renowned investor and author Robert Kiyosaki has expressed his distrust of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds ( ETFs ), branding them as tools of the financial elite. The ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ author labeled the Bitcoin ( BTC ) investment product as “bankster’s money,” stressing that it undermines the cryptocurrency’s independent spirit, according to an X post on March 1. He grouped Bitcoin ETFs with gold and silver ETFs , dismissing them as extensions of the same alleged corrupt financial machine he has long criticized. As previously reported by Finbold, Kiyosaki had vowed not to invest in Bitcoin ETFs, terming them ‘fake. ’ Instead, Kiyosaki urged investors to protect wealth by holding physical gold, silver, and Bitcoin itself, free from what he views as manipulative intermediaries. “Please protect yourself from the banksters. Buy real gold, silver, and Bitcoin. No gold, silver or Bitcoin ETFs…. Which are bankster’s money,” he said. Bitcoin and centralized financial systems His philosophy of investing in alternative assets aligns with his longstanding skepticism about centralized systems. In this case, the financial educator took aim at the U.S. dollar, the Federal Reserve, and the broader banking industry. Kiyosaki suggested that Bitcoin might have questionable aspects, but it pales compared to the flaws he sees in the traditional financial system. For instance, he accused the Fed and banking leaders of shielding their failures, bailing out institutions after massive losses instead of facing consequences. At the same time, Kiyosaki concluded his outlook by warning of a possible imminent collapse of the financial system and encouraging people to take steps to shield themselves from the fallout. Is BITCOIN a SCAM? It might be…. But not a big a scam as the US Dollar and the US Banking System…. Starting with the Fed. They are BANKSTERS. For example…. When they F. U. and lose billions…. The criminals at the Fed bail them out. They should go to jail. That’s… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) March 1, 2025 Interestingly, Kiyosaki has long predicted market crashes but has faced scrutiny because some of his projections failed to materialize. The S&P 500 price chart with Rober Kiyosaki’s crash predictions up to 2021. Source: @fintwit_news Overall, Kiyosaki believes that Bitcoin, gold, and silver can be used to protect investor wealth during market crashes. Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin outlook His latest remarks come when Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market are witnessing significant capital outflows, with the leading digital asset losing key support levels. To this end, the author noted that declining Bitcoin prices should be viewed as a ‘sale’ and an opportunity to accumulate more of the asset, as he maintains a bullish outlook. In particular, Kiyosaki sees Bitcoin hitting a new record high in 2025, predicting that the cryptocurrency will likely trade between $175,000 and $350,000 this year. Notably, this outlook appears to be a downgrade compared to his prediction for November 2024, when he projected that BTC would reach $500,000 in 2025 while leveraging an unnamed artificial intelligence (AI) tool. Considering Bitcoin’s current rough path, Kiyosaki’s prediction might seem ambitious. However, given underlying fundamentals such as the current pro-cryptocurrency administration, how the asset will trade remains to be seen. Featured image via Cavaleria Com YouTube The post R.

Recent reports indicate that the Ukrainian government is seriously contemplating imposing an income tax of up to 10% on crypto investors. This news, sourced from CryptoSlate, signals a potential shift in the country’s approach to digital assets and has sparked discussions within the global crypto community. Let’s dive into what this could mean for you and the future of crypto in Ukraine. Why is Ukraine Considering a Crypto Income Tax? Ukraine’s journey with cryptocurrencies has been quite remarkable. Initially embracing the digital asset space, the nation even legalized crypto in 2022 amidst global recognition for its innovative use of crypto donations during challenging times. However, like many governments worldwide, Ukraine is now grappling with the complexities of regulating and taxing this burgeoning sector. The primary driver behind this proposed crypto tax Ukraine seems to be twofold: Revenue Generation: In the current global economic climate, governments are constantly seeking new avenues for revenue. The crypto market, despite its volatility, represents a significant pool of potentially taxable income. Imposing a tax on crypto Ukraine could bolster the national budget, providing much-needed funds for various public services and infrastructure projects. Regulatory Alignment: As crypto adoption grows, international bodies and organizations are pushing for standardized regulatory frameworks. Implementing a crypto income tax would bring Ukraine more in line with global trends in crypto regulation, potentially fostering greater international cooperation and legitimacy within the financial world. What Does a 10% Crypto Tax Rate Actually Mean for Investors? The proposed tax rate of 5% to 10% might seem modest compared to income tax rates in some other sectors, but it’s crucial to understand its potential impact on crypto investors tax liabilities. Let’s break down what this could entail: Taxable Events: It’s likely that the tax will apply to capital gains realized from selling or trading cryptocurrencies. This means that if you buy Bitcoin and later sell it for a profit, that profit would be subject to the Ukraine crypto regulation . Tax Calculation: The exact methodology for calculating the taxable amount will be crucial. Will it be based on the difference between the purchase price and the selling price? Will there be allowances for expenses related to crypto trading or mining? These details will be outlined in the legislative process expected to conclude in the first half of 2025. Compliance and Reporting: Investors will need to meticulously track their crypto transactions to accurately calculate and report their taxable income. This might necessitate using specialized crypto tax software or seeking professional accounting advice to ensure compliance with the new regulations. Potential Benefits of Crypto Tax in Ukraine While taxes are rarely welcomed with open arms, a well-structured Ukraine crypto regulation , including taxation, can bring certain benefits to the crypto ecosystem and the nation as a whole: Increased Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Clear tax regulations can legitimize the crypto industry in the eyes of traditional financial institutions and the broader public. This could pave the way for greater mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and related technologies in Ukraine. Attracting Investment: A defined and predictable regulatory environment, even with taxes, can be more attractive to serious crypto businesses and investors than a completely unregulated space. Clarity reduces uncertainty and encourages long-term investment. Funding Innovation and Development: Tax revenues generated from the crypto sector could be reinvested into developing Ukraine’s digital infrastructure, supporting blockchain innovation, and fostering growth in the tech industry. Challenges and Concerns for Crypto Investors Despite the potential benefits, the introduction of a crypto income tax also raises some concerns and challenges for crypto investors: Compliance Burden: Navigating crypto tax regulations can be complex, especially for individuals unfamiliar with tax laws. The need for detailed record-keeping and potentially complicated calculations could create a compliance burden for investors. Impact on Innovation: Excessive or poorly designed taxation could stifle innovation and drive crypto businesses and investors to more tax-friendly jurisdictions. Finding the right balance is crucial to avoid hindering the growth of the crypto sector. Enforcement Challenges: Crypto transactions can be complex and cross-border, making tax enforcement a significant challenge for governments worldwide. Ukraine will need to develop effective mechanisms to ensure compliance and prevent tax evasion in the crypto space. What Can Crypto Investors in Ukraine Do Now? With the legislative process expected to conclude in the first half of 2025, crypto investors in Ukraine have some time to prepare. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in Ukraine crypto regulation . Follow reputable crypto news sources and official government announcements to stay updated on the proposed tax laws and their implementation. Review Your Crypto Holdings: Assess your crypto portfolio and understand your potential tax liabilities under the proposed regulations. Consider seeking advice from a tax professional specializing in crypto to understand the implications for your specific situation. Maintain Detailed Records: Start meticulously tracking all your crypto transactions, including purchase prices, sale prices, dates, and transaction fees. Good record-keeping will be essential for accurate tax reporting. Engage with the Community: Participate in discussions within the Ukrainian crypto community and voice your opinions and concerns regarding the proposed tax regulations. Collective feedback can influence the final legislative outcome. The Road Ahead for Crypto in Ukraine Ukraine’s consideration of a crypto income tax marks a significant step in the evolution of its crypto landscape. While the specifics are still being developed, it’s clear that the government is moving towards a more regulated approach. The key to success will lie in striking a balance – creating a tax framework that generates revenue and ensures compliance without stifling innovation and driving away crypto talent and investment. As Ukraine navigates this evolving regulatory landscape, the global crypto community will be watching closely to see how this develops and what lessons can be learned.

This marks the biggest monthly withdrawal since launch as macro uncertainties, the Trump trade war have escalated crypto market panic over the past week. Investors are curious whether March will be better or are we heading for another month of correction. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Resume After February Bloodbath During the last month of February 2025, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net outflows of $3.546 billion, or 40,000 BTC, from the market. This marked the first month where every BTC ETF reported negative inflows, coinciding with an 18% drop in Bitcoin’s price from $102,400 to $84,300. Top funds like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw its first ever monthly outflows, shedding off 9,470 BTC worth a $721 million outflow. Now, the fund holds a total of 573,136 BTC. Similarly, the Fidelity Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) experienced a $1.202 billion outflow while Grayscale’s two Bitcoin funds – GBTC and BTC – clocked a cumulative outflow of $585 million. Source: TraderT After eight consecutive days of outflows, Bitcoin ETFs finally recorded net inflows on Friday. As per the data from Farside Investors , yesterday’s inflows stood at a total of $94.9 million amid the broader crypto market recovery . While BlackRock’s IBIT continued with net outflows of over $243 million, Ark Invest’s ARKB and Fidelity’s FBTC made up for it with $193.70 million and $176.03 million worth of inflows respectively. It seems that the crypto market is finally taking a sigh of relief after key corrections in February. Will March Be Better for Bitcoin and Altcoins? February 2025 proved to be the toughest on record for the crypto market. Bitcoin price crashed more than 17.39% all the way to $82,000, making it the worst February performance for BTC over the past decade. However, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) faced even steeper fall correcting 31.95%, making it its worst February since inception. Blockchain analytics platform SpotonChain showed that historically, negative trends in February have often carried over into March, raising concerns about whether the market will rebound or if the downturn will continue. Analysts are closely watching for signs of recovery as March unfolds. Source: SpotonChain The latest Matrixport report suggested that hedge funds, and not traditional investors, have been behind the current Bitcoin sell-off. Furthermore, the report shows that the current Bitcoin price correction can continue even further until March or April, before the upward journey resumes again. Thus, it’s a wait and watch to see whether institutional inflows return to Bitcoin ETF moving ahead.

The crypto world was going wild, and BabyDoge Coin stormed onto the scene, wagging its tail to a 5,000% surge in just two weeks. Inspired by Dogecoin, this adorable token wasn’t just another meme coin—it was a viral sensation backed by Elon Musk himself. At its peak, early investors saw eye-watering gains, turning a few hundred bucks into six-figure fortunes. And yet, many were caught watching from the sidelines, wishing they had aped in before it skyrocketed. But here’s the thing about crypto: it always gives you another shot. Enter BTFD Coin , a next-gen meme coin bringing Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming, high-yield staking, and an insanely engaged community. This isn’t just a hype train—it’s a meme coin revolution with 1000X potential. The best part? You’re still early. BabyDoge’s Wild Ride to Success: A Meme Coin Fairytale If you were in the crypto space in 2021, you remember the BabyDoge mania. The coin launched with a mission to improve upon Dogecoin, promising faster transactions and community-driven growth. But let’s be real—what sent it to the moon was Elon Musk’s tweet: “Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo…” That one tweet was all it took. BabyDoge went parabolic, hitting an all-time high in July 2021 with a market cap exceeding $1.6 billion. The hype was unreal. Investors who bought in early reaped life-changing profits, while those who hesitated were left watching from the sidelines. Since then, BabyDoge has remained a major player in the meme coin world, continuing to expand its ecosystem. But for those who missed its golden entry point, the question remains: Where’s the next BabyDoge-level opportunity? BTFD Coin: One of the Best New Meme Coins with 1000X Potential Meet BTFD Coin, the meme coin that’s turning heads with its P2E game, high-APY staking, and explosive presale success.

P2E Gaming: The Future of Meme Coins Forget just holding and hoping—BTFD Coin is flipping the script with its four-level P2E game . Players can earn real BTFD tokens just by playing, which means there’s constant demand for the token. With gaming revenue projected to exceed $321 billion by 2026, integrating P2E into a meme coin ecosystem is a genius move.

This is gaining serious momentum. Investors are piling in before prices jump in Stage 15, and with every stage, the entry price increases. Wait too long, and you’ll be kicking yourself. Investment Example: What Happens If You Buy $7,000 Today? If you grab $7,000 worth of BTFD tokens at $0.00016, you’ll be holding 43.75 million tokens. If BTFD Coin reaches $0.0006 (its projected listing price), your investment becomes $26,250. If it hits $0.006 (a realistic moonshot), you’re sitting on $262,500. That’s a 3650% return—the kind of gains meme coin legends are made of. Final Thoughts: You Don’t Want to Miss This One History repeats itself in crypto. First, it was Dogecoin. Then BabyDoge. Now, BTFD Coin is setting up for its legendary run—but the window to get in early is closing fast. The difference this time? BTFD Coin isn’t just relying on hype—it’s packing a full ecosystem of staking, gaming, and a devoted community of Bulls.

The White House is reportedly gearing up to host its first-ever crypto summit on March 7th, a development first brought to light by Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett via a post on X (formerly Twitter). This news has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, sparking intense speculation and anticipation about what this high-level meeting could signify for the future of the industry. What is the White House Crypto Summit and Why Should You Care? For anyone invested in or curious about the world of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and the evolving landscape of digital finance, this crypto summit is a pivotal event to watch. Think of it as a crucial dialogue between the highest levels of the U.S. government and key stakeholders within the crypto industry. But why is this so significant? First of its Kind: This marks the inaugural crypto summit hosted by the White House, signaling a potential shift in the government’s approach and engagement with the digital asset sector. High-Level Attention: Hosting a summit at the White House itself underscores the growing importance and recognition of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology on a national level. It moves the conversation from niche tech circles to the heart of policy-making. Potential Policy Implications: The discussions held at this summit could directly influence future regulations, policies, and the overall legal framework governing cryptocurrencies in the United States. Industry Direction: Insights gleaned from the summit could provide valuable clues about the government’s stance on innovation, consumer protection, and the role of digital assets in the American economy. In essence, this isn’t just another meeting; it’s a potential landmark moment that could shape the trajectory of the crypto industry for years to come. For investors, developers, businesses, and even casual observers of the crypto space, understanding the outcomes of this summit is paramount. Decoding the White House’s Crypto Agenda: What’s on the Table? While the exact agenda for the White House crypto summit remains under wraps, we can speculate on some key areas likely to be at the forefront of discussions. Given the current regulatory landscape and ongoing debates surrounding digital assets, several critical topics are expected to be addressed: Potential Discussion Topics Why It Matters Regulation and Compliance Establishing clear rules for crypto exchanges, DeFi platforms, and stablecoins is crucial for mainstream adoption and investor protection. Innovation and Competitiveness Balancing regulation with fostering innovation is vital to ensure the U.S. remains a leader in the burgeoning blockchain and crypto space, preventing innovation from moving overseas. Consumer Protection Addressing risks associated with crypto investments, including scams, market volatility, and lack of understanding, is paramount for safeguarding consumers. National Security Concerns Examining the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit activities, money laundering, and sanctions evasion is a significant national security consideration. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) The potential development and implications of a U.S. CBDC, and its interplay with private cryptocurrencies, is a topic of intense global interest. It’s reasonable to anticipate that the summit will bring together policymakers, industry leaders, regulatory bodies (like the SEC and CFTC), and potentially even tech innovators. The goal is likely to foster a productive dialogue that can inform future policy decisions and provide a clearer path forward for the crypto industry within the U.S. Navigating Crypto Regulation: Benefits and Challenges for the Industry The topic of crypto regulation is arguably the most pressing issue for the digital asset space. While many in the crypto community initially resisted the idea of government oversight, there’s a growing recognition that well-defined regulations are essential for long-term growth and mainstream acceptance. Let’s consider both the potential benefits and challenges: Potential Benefits of Clear Crypto Regulation: Increased Institutional Investment: Clear regulatory frameworks can provide the necessary clarity and security for institutional investors to confidently enter the crypto market, injecting significant capital. Reduced Uncertainty: Defined rules reduce the legal and operational ambiguities that currently plague the crypto industry, fostering a more stable and predictable environment. Enhanced Consumer Trust: Regulations aimed at consumer protection can build trust in the crypto space, encouraging wider adoption by the general public. Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Regulatory clarity can legitimize the crypto industry in the eyes of traditional financial institutions and the broader public, paving the way for mainstream integration. Potential Challenges of Overly Restrictive Crypto Regulation: Stifling Innovation: Overly burdensome or poorly conceived regulations could stifle innovation and drive crypto businesses and talent to more favorable jurisdictions. Increased Compliance Costs: Complex and stringent regulations can significantly increase compliance costs, particularly for smaller crypto startups, potentially hindering competition. Reduced Decentralization: Certain regulatory approaches might inadvertently undermine the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, which is a core principle for many in the space. Unintended Consequences: Regulations implemented without a thorough understanding of the technology could lead to unintended negative consequences for the industry and its users. The key is to strike a balance – regulations that are robust enough to protect consumers and maintain financial stability, yet flexible enough to allow innovation to flourish. The White House summit presents an opportunity to move closer to achieving this delicate equilibrium. Digital Assets in Focus: Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum While Bitcoin and Ethereum often dominate headlines, the world of digital assets is far broader and more diverse. The White House summit is likely to encompass discussions that extend beyond these two giants to include the entire spectrum of digital assets, such as: Stablecoins: These cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies (like the US dollar) are gaining traction as a means of payment and a bridge between traditional and crypto finance. Regulatory clarity around stablecoins is crucial. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): As mentioned, the potential for a US CBDC is a major topic. The summit might explore the potential benefits, risks, and design considerations of a digital dollar. Security Tokens: Representing ownership in traditional assets (like stocks or real estate) on a blockchain, security tokens have the potential to revolutionize capital markets. Regulatory frameworks are still evolving. Utility Tokens: These tokens provide access to a product or service within a blockchain ecosystem. Their regulatory classification remains a subject of ongoing debate. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): While initially associated with digital art and collectibles, NFTs have broader applications in areas like ticketing, gaming, and intellectual property. Their legal and regulatory status is still being defined. By taking a holistic view of digital assets , the White House can formulate policies that are comprehensive and adaptable to the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. This summit could be a crucial step towards recognizing the diverse potential of blockchain technology and its applications beyond just cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Policy and the Future of Finance: What to Expect Ultimately, the White House crypto summit is about more than just cryptocurrencies; it’s about shaping blockchain policy and defining the future of finance in the digital age. The discussions and outcomes of this summit could have far-reaching implications for various sectors beyond just the crypto industry, including: Financial Services: Blockchain technology has the potential to transform payments, lending, trading, and other financial services, making them more efficient, transparent, and accessible. Supply Chain Management: Blockchain can enhance supply chain transparency and traceability, reducing fraud and improving efficiency. Healthcare: Blockchain can be used to securely store and manage patient data, improve clinical trial processes, and enhance pharmaceutical supply chains. Intellectual Property: Blockchain can provide a secure and transparent way to manage and protect intellectual property rights. Government Services: Blockchain can enhance transparency and efficiency in government operations, such as voting systems, land registry, and identity management. As governments worldwide grapple with how to approach blockchain and digital assets, the White House summit could position the United States as a leader in fostering responsible innovation and shaping global blockchain policy . The outcomes will be closely watched by industries, investors, and policymakers around the globe. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto The upcoming White House crypto summit on March 7th represents a potentially crucial juncture for the digital asset industry. It signals a significant step towards increased dialogue and engagement between the government and the crypto sector. While the specific outcomes remain to be seen, this summit offers a hopeful opportunity to address critical issues, foster responsible innovation, and pave the way for a clearer and more constructive future for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology within the United States. The world will be watching to see if this summit truly marks a landmark shift in digital asset policy.

The speculation arose from widespread allegations that major crypto firms, including Binance, were liquidating large amounts of tokens through OTC deals. However, Binance has categorically denied these accusations, emphasizing that the company has no control over independent market makers and their strategies. Addressing concerns over the transfer of a significant amount of SOL tokens by well-known market maker Wintermute, a Binance spokesperson explained that such firms operate according to their own trading strategies. “We have no way of understanding the decisions of our users, including market makers who transfer their assets according to their own strategies. Therefore, while blockchain transparency is one of the biggest advantages of cryptocurrencies, it is important not to jump to conclusions based on transaction screenshots,” he said.

Global cryptocurrency exchange BYDOXE has just announced a significant milestone that could reshape its presence in the United States. For crypto enthusiasts and investors in the US, this is a development you definitely want to understand. Let’s dive into what this means for BYDOXE and the broader crypto landscape. BYDOXE Secures Key MSB License: A Game Changer for US Crypto Services BYDOXE, a prominent global cryptocurrency exchange, has officially announced the acquisition of a U.S. Money Services Business (MSB) financial license. This isn’t just another piece of paper; it’s a crucial regulatory clearance that allows BYDOXE to operate legally and offer a comprehensive suite of crypto services across all 50 states of the United States. This move signifies BYDOXE’s commitment to regulatory compliance and its ambition to tap into the vast potential of the U.S. cryptocurrency market. But what exactly is an MSB license, and why is it such a big deal for a crypto exchange like BYDOXE? Understanding the MSB License: Your Gateway to Compliant Crypto Services In the United States, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency businesses is primarily overseen by agencies like FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) and state-level regulators. The MSB license, issued by FinCEN, is a fundamental requirement for businesses dealing with money transmission, currency exchange, and other financial services – which naturally includes cryptocurrency exchanges. Think of it as a stamp of approval from the U.S. financial authorities. Obtaining an MSB license means BYDOXE has met stringent regulatory requirements, demonstrating its commitment to anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) standards. This not only builds trust with users but also positions BYDOXE as a compliant and reliable platform in a sometimes murky crypto world. Key aspects of the MSB license include: Legal Compliance: Operating without proper licensing can lead to severe penalties, including fines and even operational shutdowns. The MSB license ensures BYDOXE operates within the legal framework of the U.S. Enhanced Trust and Credibility: For users, knowing that an exchange is licensed provides a greater sense of security and trust. It signals that the platform is serious about regulatory obligations and user protection. Access to the U.S. Market: The U.S. is one of the largest and most influential cryptocurrency markets globally. The MSB license effectively unlocks access to this market for BYDOXE, allowing it to offer its services to millions of potential users. Banking Relationships: Licensed entities often find it easier to establish and maintain relationships with traditional financial institutions, which is crucial for the smooth operation of a crypto exchange. In essence, the MSB license is a vital piece of the puzzle for any crypto exchange aiming to establish a significant presence in the United States. It’s a testament to BYDOXE’s dedication to operating within regulatory boundaries and providing a secure environment for its users. Why is this MSB License a Triumph for BYDOXE Crypto Exchange? For BYDOXE, securing the MSB license is more than just a regulatory checkbox ticked off. It represents a strategic victory with far-reaching implications. Let’s explore the key benefits: Benefits for BYDOXE: Expanded Market Reach: Operating across all 50 U.S. states instantly broadens BYDOXE’s potential customer base exponentially. This allows them to tap into diverse markets and demographics within the US. Competitive Edge: In a competitive crypto exchange landscape, regulatory compliance can be a major differentiator. The MSB license gives BYDOXE a competitive advantage over exchanges that are not yet fully compliant in the U.S. Attracting Institutional Investors: Institutional investors are increasingly interested in the crypto space, but they prioritize regulatory compliance and security. The MSB license can make BYDOXE more attractive to institutional capital. Platform Growth and Expansion: With a solid regulatory foundation in place, BYDOXE can confidently plan for further expansion of its services and product offerings within the U.S. market. Brand Reputation Boost: Obtaining the MSB license enhances BYDOXE’s reputation as a trustworthy and legitimate crypto exchange on a global scale. Benefits for Users of BYDOXE Crypto Services in the US: Increased Security and Trust: Users can have greater confidence in using BYDOXE, knowing it operates under U.S. regulatory oversight. Wider Range of Services: With the MSB license, BYDOXE is positioned to offer a full spectrum of crypto services in the U.S., potentially including trading, staking, lending, and more. Access to a Compliant Platform: For users who prioritize regulatory compliance, BYDOXE becomes a go-to platform for their crypto activities. Potential for Enhanced Features: As BYDOXE establishes itself in the U.S. market, users can expect the platform to evolve with new features and improved services tailored to the U.S. regulatory environment and user needs. In essence, the MSB license acts as a catalyst, paving the way for BYDOXE to become a major player in the U.S. crypto market and offer enhanced services to its users. Navigating US Regulation: Challenges and Opportunities for BYDOXE While the MSB license is a significant achievement, navigating the U.S. regulatory landscape for crypto is an ongoing process. BYDOXE, like all crypto businesses operating in the US, will face both challenges and opportunities. Challenges: Evolving Regulatory Landscape: Crypto regulations in the U.S. are still developing and can vary at the federal and state levels. BYDOXE needs to stay agile and adapt to any future regulatory changes. Compliance Costs: Maintaining MSB compliance involves ongoing costs related to reporting, audits, and adherence to AML/CFT requirements. Competition: The U.S. crypto market is highly competitive, with numerous established exchanges and new entrants. BYDOXE needs to differentiate itself through its services, user experience, and competitive pricing. State-by-State Nuances: While the MSB license allows federal operation, specific state regulations may still apply to certain aspects of crypto services. BYDOXE needs to navigate these state-level nuances effectively. Opportunities: Market Leadership: By demonstrating a strong commitment to compliance, BYDOXE can position itself as a leader in the U.S. crypto market, attracting users and partners who value regulatory adherence. Innovation and Growth: A clear regulatory framework provides a foundation for innovation. BYDOXE can confidently explore new crypto products and services within the U.S. market, knowing it operates within legal boundaries. Strategic Partnerships: Compliance can open doors to partnerships with traditional financial institutions and other businesses seeking to enter the crypto space through regulated channels. First-Mover Advantage (in some areas): As the regulatory landscape evolves, exchanges that proactively embrace compliance can gain a first-mover advantage in offering new regulated crypto products and services. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Users and Investors? The BYDOXE MSB license news offers several actionable insights for crypto users and investors, particularly those in the United States: For Crypto Users: Consider Compliant Platforms: When choosing a crypto exchange, prioritize platforms that demonstrate a commitment to regulatory compliance, like BYDOXE. This offers greater security and peace of mind. Explore BYDOXE’s Offerings: With the MSB license in hand, keep an eye on BYDOXE as they expand their services in the U.S. market. They may offer competitive trading options and innovative crypto products. Stay Informed on Regulations: The crypto regulatory landscape is dynamic. Stay informed about developments in U.S. crypto regulations to make informed decisions about your crypto activities. For Crypto Investors: Regulatory Compliance as a Key Indicator: For investors evaluating crypto exchanges or crypto-related businesses, regulatory compliance, like obtaining an MSB license, should be a positive indicator of long-term viability and stability. BYDOXE as a Potential Investment Opportunity (indirectly): While you may not directly invest in BYDOXE as a private company, its success in the U.S. market, driven by regulatory compliance, can contribute to the overall growth and maturity of the crypto ecosystem, which benefits crypto investors in general. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Regulatory clarity and positive regulatory signals, such as the granting of MSB licenses, can be bullish for the crypto market as a whole. Keep an eye on regulatory news as it can influence market sentiment and investment strategies. Conclusion: A Powerful Step Forward for BYDOXE and US Crypto BYDOXE securing the U.S. MSB license is undoubtedly a significant milestone. It’s a testament to their commitment to regulatory compliance, a strategic move to expand their reach in the lucrative U.S. market, and a positive signal for the broader cryptocurrency industry.

40995601,https://coinpedia.org/?p=426298,1740813849,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,XRP News Today: SBI’s Report Shows XRP’s 7X Surge & Growing Market Presence,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-today-sbis-report-shows-xrps-7x-surge-growing-market-presence/,"The post XRP News Today: SBI’s Report Shows XRP’s 7X Surge & Growing Market Presence appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News SBI Holdings, a major Ripple partner, has just dropped a financial report that reveals eye-opening details about XRP. From its circulation supply to its soaring market value, the report highlights XRP’s impressive rise . Even more surprising, XRP’s value has multiplied over time, reflecting its strong position in the market. XRP Supply Breakdown: Circulation, Escrow, and Burn Mechanism According to SBI’s financial report for the fiscal year ending March 2025, as of February 2, 2025, about 57.76 billion XRP are circulating in the market. With a maximum supply of 100 billion XRP, this means a significant portion is still held in reserve. The report also states that Ripple currently holds 4.79 billion XRP, while 37.43 billion XRP remains locked in escrow. This escrow system ensures that XRP is released gradually to prevent excessive market supply. Another key aspect discussed in the report is the burning of XRP through transaction fees. So far, 0.01 billion XRP have been burned , reducing the total supply over time. Meanwhile, this burning mechanism helps in maintaining the efficiency and security of the XRP Ledger by preventing spam transactions. SBI’s XRP Rewards for Shareholders The report also provides insights into SBI’s shareholder benefits distributed in XRP. Since March 2020, SBI has rewarded its shareholders with XRP on five occasions, amounting to a total of 796 XRP per shareholder. Initially, the value of these distributions was around 8,000 Japanese Yen, calculated at an average of 50.2 Yen per XRP. However, as of February 6, 2025, the value surged to 354.6 Yen per XRP, nearly seven times the original value. This increase reflects XRP’s strong market performance and growing adoption. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For March 1 , Growing Partnership with Ripple Furthermore, the long-standing partnership between SBI and Ripple continues to expand. SBI, which owns a 9% stake in Ripple, has been instrumental in promoting XRP adoption. The two companies formed SBI Ripple Asia in 2016 to enhance cross-border payments in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2021, SBI Remit introduced Japan’s first international remittance service using XRP. The collaboration is now set to extend into the NFT space , with plans to issue NFTs on the XRP Ledger at Expo 2025 in Osaka, Japan. Additionally, SBI recently launched RLUSD, a stablecoin linked to the US dollar, further strengthening its presence in the digital asset space. The strong partnership between SBI and Ripple continues to push XRP forward, making it a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

One day, optimism reigns supreme, with prices soaring to new heights. The next, fear can grip the market as prices plummet, leaving investors in a state of uncertainty. To help gauge this ever-shifting sentiment, tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index have emerged as invaluable resources. Let’s delve into the latest readings and understand what they signify for the current state of the crypto landscape. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Should You Care? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me, is a metric designed to assess the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100. A reading of 0 indicates “Extreme Fear”, suggesting investors are highly anxious and potentially selling off their holdings. Conversely, a reading of 100 signifies “Extreme Greed”, implying excessive optimism and a potential market bubble. A neutral reading of 50 would suggest a balanced market sentiment. Why is this index important? Because market sentiment is a powerful driver in the crypto world. Extreme fear can often lead to undervaluation, presenting potential buying opportunities for savvy investors. On the other hand, extreme greed can signal an overheated market ripe for correction. By monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , you gain insights into the prevailing emotions driving market movements, helping you make more informed decisions. Think of it as a weather vane for the crypto market’s emotional climate. It doesn’t predict the future, but it provides a snapshot of the current mood, allowing you to understand whether the market is driven by panic selling or exuberant buying. Extreme Fear Persists: Index at 20 Despite Slight Increase As of March 1st, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 20. This marks a slight uptick of four points from the previous day. While any increase might seem positive, it’s crucial to note that a reading of 20 still firmly places the market in the “Extreme Fear” zone. This indicates that despite a minor improvement in sentiment, a significant level of anxiety and apprehension continues to dominate the crypto market. This “Extreme Fear” reading suggests that: Investor Caution: Market participants are still largely risk-averse, likely hesitant to invest heavily due to prevailing uncertainties. Potential Undervaluation: Historically, periods of extreme fear can sometimes precede market rebounds. Assets might be undervalued if fear is driving prices down excessively. Bearish Momentum: While there’s a slight improvement, the overall trend still leans towards bearish sentiment. It’s essential to remember that the index is a sentiment indicator, not a precise predictor of price movements. However, consistently low readings like 20 highlight the prevailing cautious mood within the crypto community. Decoding the Factors: What Drives the Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on guesswork. It’s calculated using a weighted average of six different market factors, providing a comprehensive view of market sentiment. Let’s break down these components: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin and compares it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 and 90 days. Unusually high volatility is often a sign of fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares the current market momentum and volume with the last 30 and 90-day averages. Strong buying volume and positive momentum can indicate greed. Social Media 15% Analyzes social media sentiment, particularly on platforms like Twitter and Reddit, for crypto-related hashtags and engagement rates to gauge public opinion. Surveys 15% Conducts weekly crypto polls to directly gauge investor sentiment and expectations. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin dominance relative to the broader cryptocurrency market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal a flight to safety during periods of fear, as investors move away from riskier altcoins. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for crypto-related search queries. Increased search interest in terms like “Bitcoin” or “crypto crash” can indicate fear. As you can see, the index is a multifaceted measure, taking into account a range of quantitative and qualitative data points to provide a holistic view of crypto sentiment . Market Volatility: A Key Driver of Fear? One of the most significant factors influencing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , as highlighted in the component breakdown, is market volatility . The crypto market is renowned for its price swings, and periods of high volatility can understandably trigger fear among investors. When prices fluctuate dramatically and unpredictably, it creates uncertainty and anxiety. High market volatility often leads to: Increased Risk Perception: Investors perceive greater risk during volatile periods, making them more inclined to reduce exposure or sell assets. Emotional Trading: Volatility can exacerbate emotional trading, leading to panic selling during downturns and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) buying during surges. Market Instability: Extreme volatility can contribute to overall market instability and uncertainty, further fueling fear. Currently, even with the slight increase in the index, the persistent “Extreme Fear” reading suggests that market volatility , among other factors, is likely still playing a significant role in shaping investor sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance: What Does it Tell Us About Fear? Another crucial component of the index is Bitcoin dominance . Bitcoin dominance refers to the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Changes in Bitcoin dominance can offer insights into market risk appetite and sentiment. In periods of heightened fear and uncertainty, Bitcoin dominance often tends to increase. This is because: Flight to Safety: Bitcoin is generally perceived as the “safest” and most established cryptocurrency. During times of fear, investors may move their funds from riskier altcoins into Bitcoin, seeking relative stability. Altcoin Sell-offs: Fear can trigger sharper sell-offs in altcoins compared to Bitcoin, as investors become more risk-averse and liquidate their more speculative holdings. Market Contraction: In a fearful market, the overall crypto market cap may contract, but Bitcoin’s relative share can increase as altcoins decline more significantly. Therefore, monitoring Bitcoin dominance in conjunction with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can provide a more nuanced understanding of the prevailing market sentiment. A high fear reading coupled with rising Bitcoin dominance could suggest a strong “flight to safety” dynamic is at play. Navigating Extreme Fear: Opportunity or Further Downturn? The million-dollar question is: what does “Extreme Fear” mean for investors? Is it a signal to stay away, or does it present a potential opportunity? The answer, as with most things in crypto, is nuanced and depends on individual risk tolerance and investment strategies. Potential Opportunities in Extreme Fear: Buying the Dip?: Historically, periods of extreme fear have sometimes been followed by market recoveries. “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,” as Warren Buffett famously said. Extreme fear can create buying opportunities if you believe in the long-term potential of crypto. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Investing gradually over time, especially during periods of fear, can be a prudent strategy. DCA helps mitigate the risk of trying to time the market bottom and allows you to accumulate assets at potentially lower average prices. Focus on Fundamentals: Extreme fear can shake out weaker projects and highlight fundamentally strong cryptocurrencies. It’s a good time to reassess your portfolio and focus on projects with solid technology, strong teams, and real-world use cases. Cautions During Extreme Fear: Risk Management is Key: Extreme fear can also be a precursor to further market downturns. It’s crucial to manage risk effectively, diversify your portfolio, and avoid over-leveraging. Emotional Control: Fear can lead to impulsive decisions. Avoid panic selling based on short-term price fluctuations. Stick to your long-term investment plan and make rational decisions based on research and analysis, not emotions. Market Uncertainty: “Extreme Fear” signifies significant uncertainty. Be prepared for continued volatility and potential further price declines. Conclusion: Staying Informed in a Fearful Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , currently lingering in “Extreme Fear” at 20, serves as a valuable reminder of the prevailing cautious sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. While a slight increase from the previous day offers a glimmer of potential improvement, the overall mood remains apprehensive. Understanding the factors driving this index, such as market volatility and Bitcoin dominance , empowers investors to make more informed decisions. Whether “Extreme Fear” presents a buying opportunity or signals further downturn is a matter of perspective and strategy. However, staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining emotional control are paramount in navigating these uncertain times. By monitoring sentiment indicators like the Fear & Greed Index, you can better understand the market’s emotional landscape and position yourself to make strategic moves in the dynamic world of crypto.

This unexpected decision raises significant questions about the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation and the future of digital assets. Let’s dive into the details of this shocking dismissal and understand what it means for the crypto landscape. SEC Lawsuit Against HEX Founder Dismissed – What Really Happened? On February 28th, a federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, delivered a blow to the SEC’s enforcement efforts in the crypto space. The lawsuit against Richard Heart, which accused him of securities fraud and selling unregistered securities , was thrown out. According to reports from Bloomberg, the judge stated that the SEC failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the alleged fraudulent activities occurred within the United States. Here’s a breakdown of the key points: The Charge: The SEC initially charged Richard Heart with securities fraud and the illegal sale of unregistered securities related to his cryptocurrency project, HEX. The Allegations: The SEC claimed Heart misappropriated investor funds, using the money to fund a lavish lifestyle, including the purchase of luxury watches, high-end cars, and even a massive 555-carat black diamond known as “The Enigma.” The Dismissal: The judge dismissed the lawsuit, stating the SEC “failed to allege specific facts” proving the alleged misconduct took place within U.S. jurisdiction. Jurisdictional Issue: The core reason for dismissal was the SEC’s inability to sufficiently link Heart’s actions to U.S. territory, a crucial element for U.S. courts to assert jurisdiction. Who is Richard Heart and What is HEX Crypto? For those unfamiliar, Richard Heart is a somewhat controversial figure in the cryptocurrency space, known for his outspoken personality and marketing prowess. He launched HEX, a cryptocurrency project that positions itself as a “high-interest blockchain certificate of deposit.” HEX crypto operates on the Ethereum network and is designed to reward users for staking their tokens for a set period. It gained significant attention, and also scrutiny, for its high yield promises and complex tokenomics. Critics have often raised concerns about its sustainability and potential Ponzi-like structure, while proponents tout its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). Here’s a quick look at HEX: Feature Description Type Cryptocurrency, ERC-20 Token Purpose Decentralized Certificate of Deposit Network Ethereum Key Mechanism Staking for Yield Controversy Sustainability, Ponzi scheme accusations Crypto Regulation in the US: Is This a Setback for the SEC? This dismissal comes at a time when crypto regulation is a hot topic globally, and especially in the United States. The SEC has been actively pursuing enforcement actions against various crypto projects and companies, aiming to bring the digital asset space under traditional securities laws. This case against Richard Heart was seen as a significant test of the SEC’s reach and authority in the crypto domain. The dismissal can be interpreted in several ways: Procedural Setback: It’s primarily a procedural setback for the SEC, highlighting the importance of establishing clear jurisdictional links in cross-border crypto cases. Not an End to Scrutiny: This dismissal doesn’t necessarily mean Richard Heart or HEX are in the clear. The SEC could potentially refile the lawsuit with more concrete evidence of U.S. nexus, or pursue other avenues of investigation. Impact on SEC Strategy: It might force the SEC to refine its approach to regulating global crypto projects, emphasizing the need for stronger evidence of U.S.-based activities. Broader Regulatory Debate: This case underscores the ongoing debate about how to effectively regulate decentralized and global cryptocurrency projects within existing legal frameworks. Unregistered Securities and the Ongoing Crypto Conundrum The core of the SEC’s argument against Richard Heart and HEX revolved around the allegation of selling unregistered securities . This is a recurring theme in SEC enforcement actions within the crypto industry. Securities laws are designed to protect investors by requiring companies issuing securities to register them with the SEC and provide detailed disclosures. In the context of crypto, the question of what constitutes a security is complex and often debated. The SEC applies the Howey Test, derived from a Supreme Court case, to determine if an asset qualifies as an investment contract and therefore a security. Many cryptocurrencies and crypto-related products fall into a gray area, leading to legal battles and regulatory uncertainty. Key considerations regarding unregistered securities in crypto: Howey Test Application: The SEC uses the Howey Test to assess if a crypto asset involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others. Decentralization vs. Centralization: The level of decentralization in a crypto project is a factor. More centralized projects are often seen as having a higher likelihood of being classified as securities. Investor Protection: The SEC’s primary goal is investor protection. They argue that many crypto offerings lack the transparency and disclosures required under securities laws, putting investors at risk. Industry Pushback: The crypto industry often argues for clearer guidelines and a more tailored regulatory approach, claiming that applying traditional securities laws is ill-suited to the unique nature of digital assets. What’s Next for Richard Heart, HEX, and the SEC? The dismissal of the SEC lawsuit is undoubtedly a victory for Richard Heart and the HEX community, at least in the short term. However, the legal saga might not be over. The SEC has the option to appeal the dismissal, or potentially refile the lawsuit with additional evidence addressing the jurisdictional concerns raised by the judge. For HEX crypto, this news could be seen as a positive development, potentially boosting investor confidence and market sentiment. However, the underlying regulatory questions and criticisms surrounding the project remain. Looking ahead: SEC Appeal: The SEC could appeal the judge’s decision, leading to further legal proceedings. Refiled Lawsuit: The SEC might choose to refile the lawsuit with strengthened evidence to establish U.S. jurisdiction. Continued Scrutiny: Regardless of this specific case, HEX and Richard Heart will likely remain under regulatory scrutiny. Wider Crypto Regulation Impact: This case will likely influence the ongoing development of crypto regulations in the U.S. and globally. In conclusion, the dismissal of the SEC lawsuit against Richard Heart is a significant development in the ongoing story of crypto regulation. While it marks a win for Heart and HEX in this particular instance, it also highlights the complexities and challenges the SEC faces in regulating the decentralized and global nature of the cryptocurrency industry. The future remains uncertain, and the crypto world will be watching closely to see the SEC’s next move.

This transpired in February 2025 as many market observers, as well as historical performances, hinted at substantial gains. That didn’t come to fruition, though. Worst February Since ’14 There was a lot of hype for February 2025. Perhaps deservingly so as bitcoin’s price movements since 2013 had been highly bullish within the second month of the year. In fact, only on two occasions – 2014 and 2020, the asset had charted losses. Moreover, Februaries after a halving year, which was the 2025 one, brought double-digit gains (62% in 2013, 23% in 2017, and 37% in 2021). So, the stage was set for another rally and perhaps a fresh all-time high above $110,000. After all, BTC had charted a 9.3% gain in January, according to CoinGlass data, and had neared the aforementioned level but never managed to break it. However, BTC never actually managed to go beyond January’s closing price, which was at around $102,500. It briefly managed to challenge it at the beginning of the month, but overall, it spent most of the month below $100,000. The landscape worsened in the last week of the month when it plummeted by double digits to a multi-month low of $78,000 amid Trump’s escalating trade war. It managed to recover some ground by February’s closing time and ended the month at around $84,000. This still meant a substantial decline of 17.39% within the second month of the year, making it the worst February since 2014. Bitcoin Monthly Returns. Source: CoinGlass What’s Next in March? March has been historically a controversial month for BTC. After a mindblowing rally of 173% in 2013, the month delivered declines for six out of the next seven, with the latest being in March 2020, when the entire world was struck by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the trend changed once again for the next four years as BTC saw gains of 29.84% in March 2021, 5.39% in 2022, 22.96% in 2023, and 16.81% last year. The good news for March 2025 is that bitcoin doesn’t have to register some big gains to end the month in the green, as it started after a severe correction in what is still considered a bull market. Still, history doesn’t always rhyme as February 2025 proved.

In a recent memo that’s making waves across Silicon Valley, Brin emphasized a seemingly old-school approach to cutting-edge AI development: Return To Office (RTO) . Yes, you heard that right. As companies worldwide grapple with hybrid and remote work models, Brin is betting big on in-person collaboration to propel Google to the forefront of the AGI revolution. Let’s dive into why this tech titan believes physical presence is the secret weapon in the fiercely competitive AGI race . Why Return To Office is Google’s Secret Weapon in the AGI Race? For many, the idea of mandatory office returns feels like a step back in time, especially in the tech industry, which has long championed remote flexibility. However, Brin’s memo, as reported by The New York Times, paints a different picture. He’s not just asking for employees to clock in; he’s urging them to be in the office “at least every weekday,” suggesting a commitment beyond the current three-day-a-week policy. But what’s the rationale behind this push, especially when discussing something as futuristic as AGI? Boosting Collaboration and Innovation: Brin’s core argument hinges on the power of in-person synergy. He believes that the spontaneous interactions, brainstorming sessions, and quick problem-solving that happen organically in an office environment are irreplaceable for tackling complex challenges like building AGI. Intensified Work Hours: The memo reportedly mentioned a “sweet spot” of 60-hour workweeks. While this might raise eyebrows about work-life balance, it underscores the intensity and dedication Brin believes is necessary to win the AGI race . It signals a wartime-like urgency, where every hour counts. Catching Up in the AI Arena: Let’s not forget the context. Google, once the undisputed king of AI, found itself playing catch-up after OpenAI’s ChatGPT took the world by storm in 2022. Brin’s return to Google and this RTO push are clear indicators of the pressure Google feels to reclaim its AI leadership. Belief in Google’s AGI Potential: The memo itself is a powerful statement of intent. It reveals Brin’s conviction that Google is capable of building AGI – a system with human-level intelligence. This isn’t just about incremental AI improvements; it’s about achieving a monumental leap in artificial intelligence. Is 60 Hours the New 40? Decoding AI Productivity in the RTO Era Brin’s mention of a 60-hour workweek as a productivity “sweet spot” is bound to spark debate. In an era increasingly focused on work-life balance and employee well-being, such long hours might seem counterintuitive. However, within the context of the AGI race , it reflects a high-stakes, high-pressure environment. Let’s break down what this could mean for AI productivity and the future of work at Google and beyond: Aspect Implications of 60-Hour Workweeks Innovation & Speed Potentially faster progress in AGI development due to increased time investment and focus. Employee Burnout Risk of increased stress and burnout if not managed sustainably. Google needs to consider employee well-being alongside productivity goals. Collaboration Intensity More hours together in the office could amplify collaborative efforts, but also demands effective team dynamics. Industry Trendsetter? Google’s move might influence other tech companies in the AI space to reconsider RTO for competitive advantage. It’s crucial to remember that Brin’s memo isn’t an official policy change yet. Google’s current hybrid model of three days in office remains. However, the memo is a strong signal – a glimpse into the mindset of a co-founder deeply invested in Google’s AI future. It highlights the immense pressure Silicon Valley giants are under to not just keep up but to lead in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Beyond the Memo: What Does This Mean for the Future of Google AI and the Broader Industry? Sergey Brin’s memo is more than just an internal communication; it’s a bellwether. It reflects a critical juncture in the tech industry, where the pursuit of AGI is becoming the new space race. Here’s what we can infer from this development: AGI is the Ultimate Prize: The memo unequivocally underscores the importance of AGI as the ultimate goal in AI research and development. It’s not just about incremental improvements in existing AI models; it’s about achieving a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence. RTO as a Strategic Tool: While remote work offers flexibility, Brin’s stance suggests that for certain highly complex and competitive endeavors like AGI development, the benefits of in-office collaboration are deemed indispensable. This could lead to a re-evaluation of remote work policies, at least for core innovation teams within tech giants. Heightened Competition in AI: The urgency in Brin’s memo reflects the intense competition in the AI space. Google, OpenAI, and other players are locked in a high-stakes battle for AI dominance, and every strategic lever, including work models, is being considered. Focus on Foundational AI Research: Winning the AGI race requires deep, foundational research. Brin’s return to Google and the RTO emphasis could signal a renewed focus on fundamental AI breakthroughs, moving beyond applied AI and towards the core science of intelligence. The Bottom Line: Will RTO Really Help Google Win the AGI Race? The effectiveness of RTO as a strategy to win the AGI race remains to be seen. It’s a bold move, a counter-narrative to the prevailing trend of remote work. Sergey Brin’s memo is a clear message: Google is not just playing to participate; it’s playing to win. Whether this bet on in-person intensity pays off will be a story to watch closely. One thing is certain: the race for AGI is on, and the stakes are higher than ever. For the crypto and tech world, this development signifies a renewed commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI, which could have profound implications across industries, including blockchain and decentralized technologies. The innovations in AI, particularly AGI, may very well shape the future of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technologies.

Recently, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance and a prominent figure in the crypto space, offered some grounded advice for navigating these turbulent waters. His message? Sometimes, less is more, especially when it comes to your mental well-being during crypto market dips . Why is Mental Stability Crucial During Market Volatility? Imagine riding a rollercoaster – the initial climb is exciting, the drops can be thrilling, but prolonged extreme ups and downs can leave you feeling nauseous and disoriented. The crypto market, particularly during periods of high market volatility , can feel very similar. It’s an emotional rollercoaster where your portfolio’s value can fluctuate dramatically in short periods. This constant fluctuation can take a significant toll on your mental health. Here’s why maintaining mental stability is paramount, especially for crypto investors: Emotional Decision Making: Fear and greed are powerful emotions that market volatility amplifies. When your mental state is compromised, you’re more likely to make impulsive decisions, such as panic selling at market bottoms or FOMO-buying at market tops – often detrimental to your long-term investment strategy . Stress and Anxiety: Watching your investments plummet can induce significant stress and anxiety. Chronic stress impacts sleep, focus, and overall well-being, extending beyond just your portfolio. Long-Term Perspective: A stable mental state allows you to maintain a long-term perspective. Crypto investing, especially in emerging projects, is often a long game. Short-term volatility should ideally be viewed as noise rather than a reason to abandon your strategy. Health and Relationships: Unmanaged stress from market volatility can spill over into other areas of your life, affecting your physical health and relationships with family and friends. CZ’s Shocking Advice: Reduce Holdings for Peace of Mind? Changpeng Zhao (CZ), with his vast experience in the crypto industry, understands the psychological pressures of market volatility firsthand. His recent post on X wasn’t about chasing quick gains or predicting the next bull run. Instead, it was a pragmatic suggestion focused on investor well-being: if market dips are causing you significant stress, consider reducing your investment size. This might seem counterintuitive to some. Isn’t the goal to ‘buy the dip’? Yes, strategic buying during dips can be a sound investment strategy . However, CZ’s advice targets a different, equally important aspect: risk management from a psychological perspective. Here’s a breakdown of CZ’s rationale: Personal Risk Tolerance: Everyone has a different risk tolerance – the amount of financial and emotional risk they can comfortably handle. What might be a manageable dip for one investor could be a source of immense anxiety for another. Investment Size vs. Comfort Level: Sometimes, the size of your crypto holdings might simply be too large relative to your comfort level. If you’re constantly checking prices and feeling panicked during dips, it’s a sign your position size might be impacting your mental stability negatively. Proactive Stress Reduction: Reducing your holdings during periods of high market volatility isn’t about admitting defeat; it’s about proactively managing stress and regaining control over your emotional state. It’s a strategic move to protect your mental health, which, in the long run, can lead to better investment decisions. How to Implement CZ’s Advice: Actionable Steps for Investors CZ’s advice isn’t a blanket recommendation for everyone to sell their crypto at the first sign of a dip. It’s a nuanced suggestion to consider adjusting your portfolio based on your individual emotional response to crypto market dips . Here are actionable steps to implement this advice: 1. Self-Assessment: Understand Your Emotional Response to Market Volatility The first step is honest self-reflection. Ask yourself: How do I typically react when the crypto market experiences a significant dip? Do I feel anxious, sleepless, or constantly preoccupied? Am I making impulsive decisions based on fear or panic during these times? Is my crypto investment strategy causing more stress than it’s worth? If the answer to these questions leans towards negative emotional impact, it’s a strong indicator that adjusting your approach might be beneficial. 2. Define Your Comfort Zone and Risk Tolerance Before making any investment decisions, clearly define your financial and emotional risk tolerance. Consider: Financial Risk Tolerance: What percentage of your total investment portfolio are you comfortable allocating to crypto? What level of potential loss can you stomach without significant financial distress? Emotional Risk Tolerance: How much market volatility can you handle emotionally? At what point does market fluctuation become overwhelmingly stressful? Your comfort zone is where your financial risk tolerance intersects with your emotional risk tolerance. Ideally, your crypto investments should operate within this zone. 3. Strategic Portfolio Adjustment During Market Dips If you determine that market volatility is negatively impacting your mental stability , consider a strategic portfolio adjustment. This doesn’t necessarily mean selling everything. It could involve: Reducing Exposure: Decrease the percentage of your portfolio allocated to crypto. This could involve selling a portion of your holdings to reduce overall risk exposure. Diversification: If you’re heavily invested in a few volatile assets, diversify into less volatile cryptocurrencies or even traditional assets to mitigate risk. Taking Profits: During bull runs, consider taking some profits and rebalancing your portfolio. This provides a buffer for potential future dips and reduces the emotional sting of drawdowns. 4. Focus on Long-Term Investment Strategy and Education Shift your focus from short-term price fluctuations to your long-term investment strategy . This involves: Due Diligence: Thoroughly research the projects you invest in. Understand their fundamentals, technology, and long-term potential. Informed decisions are less likely to be swayed by short-term market noise. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider using DCA, where you invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price. This strategy can smooth out the impact of market volatility and reduce emotional decision-making. Continuous Learning: Stay informed about the crypto market, but avoid obsessively tracking minute-by-minute price charts. Focus on understanding broader trends and developments. 5. Prioritize Mental and Physical Well-being Remember that your mental and physical health are paramount. During periods of market volatility , prioritize self-care: Limit Screen Time: Reduce the time spent constantly checking crypto prices. Set specific times to review your portfolio rather than constant monitoring. Exercise and Mindfulness: Engage in physical activity and mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing to manage stress and anxiety. Healthy Lifestyle: Ensure you’re getting enough sleep, eating well, and maintaining social connections. A healthy lifestyle provides a stronger foundation for managing stress. The Benefits of Prioritizing Mental Stability in Crypto Investing Adopting CZ’s advice and prioritizing mental stability in your crypto journey offers several significant benefits: Benefit Description Improved Decision Making A calm and rational mind makes better investment decisions, avoiding impulsive actions driven by fear or greed. Reduced Stress and Anxiety Managing your portfolio in a way that aligns with your comfort level significantly reduces stress and anxiety associated with market volatility . Enhanced Long-Term Focus Mental clarity allows you to stay focused on your long-term investment strategy , weathering short-term fluctuations with greater resilience. Better Overall Well-being Prioritizing mental health positively impacts your overall well-being, extending beyond just your financial life to improve relationships and physical health. Sustainable Investing Investing becomes more sustainable and enjoyable when it’s not a constant source of stress, leading to a healthier and more balanced approach to wealth building. Challenges and Considerations While CZ’s advice is valuable, there are challenges and considerations to keep in mind: Missing Potential Gains: Reducing holdings during dips might mean missing out on potential rebounds if the market recovers quickly. This is a trade-off you need to be comfortable with in exchange for mental stability . Timing the Market: Knowing when to reduce holdings and when to reinvest is challenging. Market timing is notoriously difficult, and emotional decisions can sometimes lead to selling low and buying high. Individual Circumstances: CZ’s advice is general. Your financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance are unique. What works for one person may not be suitable for another. Understanding Market Cycles: It’s crucial to understand crypto market cycles and historical trends. Dips are a normal part of these cycles, and panic selling during every dip can be detrimental in the long run. Conclusion: Investing in Your Mental Peace is Investing Wisely In the exhilarating yet often nerve-wracking world of cryptocurrency investing, CZ’s advice serves as a crucial reminder: your mental well-being is paramount. Navigating crypto market dips isn’t just about technical analysis or market predictions; it’s about understanding your emotional response to market volatility and crafting an investment strategy that aligns with your personal comfort level and promotes mental stability . By taking proactive steps to manage stress, define your risk tolerance, and adjust your portfolio accordingly, you can approach crypto investing with greater confidence and peace of mind. Remember, investing wisely isn’t just about maximizing returns; it’s about building wealth in a way that supports your overall well-being and allows you to thrive, even amidst the inevitable ups and downs of the crypto market. Changpeng Zhao ‘s insightful advice encourages us to prioritize mental health as a cornerstone of successful and sustainable crypto investing.

40996129,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135847,1740814658,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling Mistral AI: The Audacious European Challenger to OpenAI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/mistral-ai-openai-european-challenger/,"In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, a new contender has emerged, capturing global attention and sparking discussions about the future of AI development. This audacious player is Mistral AI, a French startup that has quickly risen to prominence, positioning itself as a formidable OpenAI competitor . But what exactly is Mistral AI, and why is it being touted as Europe’s best hope against the giants of the AI industry? Let’s dive into everything you need to know about this fascinating company. What Exactly is Mistral AI and Why Should You Care? Founded in 2023, Mistral AI isn’t just another tech startup; it’s a beacon of European innovation in the AI landscape. With a bold mission to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone,” Mistral AI is making waves by championing openness and accessibility in a field often dominated by closed-door developments. Think of it as a refreshing breeze in the sometimes stuffy atmosphere of AI monopolies. This ambition to democratize advanced AI is a core part of what makes Mistral AI stand out as a unique French AI startup . Its flagship product, Le Chat, is designed as a direct alternative to ChatGPT, and is now conveniently available on both iOS and Android platforms. The mobile app launch was a resounding success, hitting 1 million downloads within just two weeks and even topping the free app charts in France. Imagine the French President, Emmanuel Macron himself, recommending Le Chat over ChatGPT – that’s the kind of buzz Mistral AI is generating! Beyond Le Chat, Mistral AI offers a suite of powerful AI models designed for various applications: Mistral Large 2: The powerhouse large language model, succeeding the original Mistral Large, designed for top-tier performance. Pixtral Large: A multimodal model introduced in 2024, expanding the Pixtral family’s capabilities to handle more than just text. Codestral: A specialized generative AI model crafted specifically for coding tasks, a boon for developers. “Les Ministraux”: A family of efficient models optimized for use on edge devices like smartphones, bringing AI power to your pocket. Mistral Saba: A model with a focus on the Arabic language, demonstrating Mistral’s commitment to linguistic diversity in AI. Who are the Masterminds Behind this OpenAI Competitor? The team at Mistral AI is nothing short of an AI dream team. The three founders bring a wealth of experience from the very heart of AI research at major U.S. tech companies, all with significant operations in Paris. CEO Arthur Mensch is a DeepMind alumnus, while CTO Timothée Lacroix and Chief Scientist Officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta heavyweights. This pedigree gives Mistral AI serious credibility and technical prowess right from the start. It’s like assembling a basketball team with all-star players – you expect them to compete at the highest level, which is exactly what Mistral AI is doing as an OpenAI competitor . Adding to their impressive roster, co-founding advisors include Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve and Charles Gorintin from the health insurance innovator Alan, and even former digital minister Cédric O. While Cédric O’s involvement raised eyebrows due to his political background, it underscores the significant connections and ambitions Mistral AI holds within the French and European tech ecosystem. Open Source or Proprietary? Understanding Mistral AI’s Model Strategy One of the intriguing aspects of Mistral AI is their nuanced approach to open source. Unlike some AI labs that operate strictly behind closed doors, Mistral AI differentiates between its top-tier models and its more accessible offerings. Their premier AI models are not open source for commercial use, safeguarding their competitive edge and revenue streams. However, they do offer free models with weights accessible under the Apache 2.0 license. This includes research-focused models like Mistral NeMo, developed in collaboration with Nvidia and open-sourced in July 2024. This balanced strategy allows Mistral AI to contribute to the open AI community while also protecting its core business. Here’s a simple breakdown: Model Type Open Source? Commercial Use Premier Models (e.g., Mistral Large 2) No (Weights not available) Commercial via API/Licensing Free Models (e.g., Mistral NeMo) Yes (Apache 2.0 license) Permitted How Does Mistral AI Actually Generate Revenue? While many of Mistral AI’s offerings are freely accessible, the company has a clear plan for monetization. Le Chat, their ChatGPT alternative, features paid Pro tiers, launched in February 2025 and priced at $14.99 per month. This subscription model is a direct revenue stream from individual users. For businesses, Mistral AI monetizes its premium AI models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these advanced models for their internal applications. Strategic partnerships also play a crucial role in their revenue generation, as highlighted during the Paris AI Summit. Despite these efforts, reports suggest Mistral AI’s revenue is still in the eight-digit range, indicating significant growth potential ahead. Strategic Partnerships: Fueling Mistral AI’s Ascent Strategic alliances have been instrumental in Mistral AI’s rapid growth. In 2024, a landmark deal with Microsoft included both a strategic partnership to distribute Mistral’s AI models via Microsoft Azure and a €15 million investment. Although the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority quickly waved it through, the deal did raise some eyebrows within the EU, underscoring the geopolitical sensitivities around AI technology. This partnership with Microsoft provides Mistral AI with significant cloud infrastructure and market reach, essential for competing with established giants. In January 2025, Mistral AI further solidified its position by partnering with Agence France-Presse (AFP), granting Le Chat access to AFP’s vast text archive dating back to 1983. This access enhances Le Chat’s knowledge base and positions it as a powerful tool for information retrieval and analysis. Other notable strategic partnerships include collaborations with the French army and job agency, German defense tech firm Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis, showcasing the breadth of Mistral AI’s applications and appeal across diverse sectors. Funding Frenzy: The Billion-Dollar Startup Mistral AI’s funding journey is nothing short of meteoric. As of February 2025, the company has raised approximately €1 billion, or $1.04 billion, through a mix of equity and debt financing. This rapid accumulation of capital underscores investor confidence in Mistral AI’s vision and potential to disrupt the AI landscape. Even before launching its first AI models , Mistral AI secured a record $112 million seed round in June 2023, valuing the then-one-month-old startup at a staggering $260 million – Europe’s largest seed round ever. Just six months later, a Series A round of €385 million ($415 million) followed, catapulting its valuation to $2 billion. This round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and included participation from existing investors and new heavyweights like BNP Paribas and Salesforce. The $16.3 million convertible investment from Microsoft was considered a Series A extension, maintaining the $2 billion valuation. In June 2024, another €600 million (around $640 million) was raised in a mix of equity and debt, led by General Catalyst, rocketing the valuation to $6 billion. Investors in this round included tech giants like Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, and Samsung Venture Investment Corporation. This phenomenal funding trajectory highlights Mistral AI’s status as a unicorn startup with serious momentum. What’s Next for Mistral AI? IPO or Acquisition? Despite the swirling acquisition rumors, Mistral AI CEO Arthur Mensch has firmly stated, “Mistral is ‘not for sale.’” An IPO is the clearly stated plan. Given the massive amounts of funding raised, an IPO makes strategic sense to deliver returns to investors and maintain the company’s independence, especially considering the sensitive nature of AI technology and European sovereignty concerns. However, to justify its near $6 billion valuation, Mistral AI needs to significantly scale its revenue. The path ahead is challenging but filled with immense potential. Keep a close watch on this dynamic French AI startup – its journey is just beginning, and it promises to be a thrilling one in the ever-evolving AI narrative.

It will be led by David Sacks, known as the White House’s “Crypto Czar,” and hosted by Bo Hines. https://twitter.com/davidsacks47/status/1895660834799698008 The main goal is to discuss crypto regulations , improve the industry’s infrastructure, and encourage new ideas. With President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President attending, the event could bring big changes to U.S. crypto policies . This is a very important event as this will mark a new era for crypto assets in the U.S. Trump’s Pro-Crypto Vision President Trump will be in the center stage at the summit to brief his new administration’s views on digital assets. His first executive order 14178, after his inauguration, confirms that his administration will prioritize the “healthy growth and use of digital assets in all sectors of the economy.” Unlike the previous administration’s strict regulatory approach, Trump’s team aims to introduce clear and structured policies to support the industry while ensuring economic freedom. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Recovered: Is this a Rebound or a Bull Trap? , Crypto Task Force and Regulatory Shifts The Digital Asset Working Group, which includes key agencies such as the U.S. Treasury, SEC, CFTC, and Justice Department, is expected to play a major role in shaping policy. Recently, the SEC dropped its lawsuit against crypto exchange Gemini and postponed decisions in the Binance case for 60 days , signaling a shift in its enforcement strategy. The summit will likely provide deeper insights into the ongoing work of the crypto task force , led by SEC Commissioner hester peirce hester peirce Hester Peirce of the Securities and Exchange Commission, often known as ""Crypto Mom,"" is one of the most outspoken supporters of cryptocurrency at the government level in the United States.

She was born in Ohio and graduated from Yale Law School. Prior to joining the Securities and Exchange Commission, she worked in a variety of capacities evaluating and creating financial regulations. She worked at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, a libertarian-leaning think tank, most recently before becoming commissioner, where she produced, among other things, critiques of legislation like the Dodd-Frank Act. As chairman Jay Clayton steps out and a Joe Biden nominee takes his place, Republican Peirce will find herself in the minority. Clayton, on the other hand, was not particularly forward-thinking when it came to digital assets. President Biden has declared his intention to select Gary Gensler, a crypto expert who would presumably be more prepared to deal with Peirce than Clayton was. The SEC's approval of initial public offerings for crypto businesses like Coinbase, the first U.S.-authorized Bitcoin ETF, and, of course, the ICO safe harbour are all obvious targets for Peirce. We won't know what Peirce thinks about the SEC's pursuit of Ripple until after the fact, per SEC protocol, but the outcome of that case will almost certainly serve as a springboard for more clarity. Peirce told guests at the Crypto Finance Conference in January that the future SEC chairman's priority should be supporting innovation and giving regulatory clarity: ""We need to embrace innovation and figure out how to create a regulatory framework that encourages it, which, in our field, I believe means providing clarity.""

One of the biggest announcements expected from the summit is the potential establishment of a Bitcoin Reserve. David Sacks confirmed that this initiative is among the administration’s top priorities, and discussions are taking place within the inter-agency digital asset working group. If implemented, this move could dramatically change Bitcoin’s role in the U.S. economy. What to Expect Moving Forward With the White House actively shaping crypto regulations, the summit is expected to lay the groundwork for a more structured and supportive regulatory environment. If Trump follows through with his pro-crypto policies, it could accelerate institutional adoption and provide much-needed clarity for businesses operating in the space.

A major red flag has been raised in the digital asset world. The Bybit exchange is grappling with the aftermath of a significant security breach, and the perpetrator is now making moves. On-chain data reveals an alarming development: a staggering $32.2 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) has been laundered by the Bybit hacker in just the past 24 hours. Let’s dive into the details of this developing crypto security saga and understand the implications for the broader blockchain ecosystem. What We Know About the Bybit Hack and ETH Laundering According to prominent on-chain analyst @EmberCN, the Bybit hacker initiated a massive ETH laundering operation. Over a single day, a whopping 14,300 ETH, valued at $32.2 million, was moved through complex transactions aimed at obscuring the funds’ origin. This information, revealed on X (formerly Twitter), sent ripples through the crypto community, highlighting the ever-present risks in the digital asset space. The hacker’s activity, however, seems to have paused. @EmberCN reported that the ETH transfers and laundering ceased around 06:00 UTC yesterday. Key Highlights of the Bybit ETH Laundering Incident: Massive Sum Laundered: $32.2 million in ETH moved in 24 hours. Analyst Alert: On-chain analyst @EmberCN first reported the suspicious activity. Hacker’s Stash: Despite the laundering, the hacker’s wallet still holds a colossal 218,000 ETH. Value of Remaining ETH: This remaining ETH is currently worth approximately $486.6 million. Laundering Pause: ETH transfers and laundering actions have stopped since 06:00 UTC yesterday. Why is ETH Laundering a Major Concern in Crypto Security? Cryptocurrency, while offering decentralization and transparency through blockchain technology, is not immune to illicit activities. ETH laundering , in this context, refers to the process by which hackers attempt to conceal the origins of illegally obtained Ethereum. This often involves a series of complex transactions across multiple wallets and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to break the traceable link back to the original source of the stolen funds. Challenges of ETH Laundering in Crypto Security: Obfuscation of Funds: Laundering makes it significantly harder for law enforcement and exchanges to track and recover stolen assets. Enables Further Criminal Activity: Successfully laundered funds can be used to finance other illegal activities, further harming the crypto ecosystem’s reputation. Erosion of Trust: High-profile incidents of crypto security breaches and subsequent laundering erode trust in digital assets among potential investors and the general public. Regulatory Scrutiny: Such events often lead to increased regulatory pressure on the cryptocurrency industry, potentially stifling innovation. Understanding the Scale of the Bybit Hack and Remaining Funds The fact that the Bybit hack resulted in the theft of such a large amount of Ethereum is concerning. Even after laundering $32.2 million, the hacker’s wallet still contains a staggering $486.6 million in ETH. This massive remaining balance underscores the scale of the initial security breach and the potential ongoing threat. Let’s put the numbers into perspective: Metric Value ETH Laundered (Past 24 Hours) 14,300 ETH Value of Laundered ETH $32.2 Million ETH Remaining in Hacker’s Wallet 218,000 ETH Value of Remaining ETH $486.6 Million These figures highlight the urgent need for robust crypto security measures within exchanges and the broader blockchain infrastructure. Incidents like the Bybit hack serve as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that exist and the sophistication of malicious actors in the crypto space. What Does This Mean for Ethereum and the Blockchain Ecosystem? The incident of ETH laundering following the Bybit hack has broader implications for the Ethereum network and the entire blockchain ecosystem. It emphasizes the critical importance of ongoing vigilance and improvements in security protocols across all platforms handling digital assets. Impact on Ethereum and Blockchain: Need for Enhanced Security: Exchanges and wallet providers must continually upgrade their security infrastructure to prevent breaches. Improved On-Chain Monitoring: Advanced analytics and monitoring tools are crucial for detecting and tracking suspicious transactions in real-time. Collaboration is Key: Exchanges, blockchain analysis firms, and law enforcement agencies need to collaborate effectively to combat crypto crime. User Awareness: Educating users about crypto security best practices, such as using strong passwords and being wary of phishing attempts, is essential. Actionable Insights: Protecting Yourself in the Crypto World While large-scale exchange hacks are beyond the control of individual users, there are proactive steps you can take to enhance your own crypto security and protect your assets: Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Employ robust and unique passwords for all your crypto accounts. Consider using a password manager. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Always activate 2FA for an extra layer of security on your exchange and wallet accounts. Be Cautious of Phishing: Be wary of suspicious emails, links, and messages that may be attempts to steal your login credentials or private keys. Use Hardware Wallets: For long-term storage of significant crypto holdings, consider using a hardware wallet for cold storage. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest crypto security news and best practices to stay ahead of potential threats. Conclusion: Crypto Security – A Constant Battle The Bybit hack and subsequent ETH laundering incident serve as a stark reminder that crypto security is an ongoing battle. As the digital asset space evolves, so too do the tactics of cybercriminals. Exchanges, developers, and users must remain vigilant, proactive, and collaborative in strengthening security measures to safeguard the future of cryptocurrency. The sheer scale of the remaining funds in the hacker’s wallet – nearly half a billion dollars – underscores the urgency and importance of addressing these vulnerabilities head-on. The crypto world must learn from these incidents and continuously innovate in security to build a safer and more trustworthy ecosystem.

Meanwhile, the rising dominance of memecoins raised some concerns, as a couple of rug pulls adversely impacted the SOL price rally. The selling pressure escalated heavily over the token, which prevented the bulls from reviving a notable rebound. The SOL price experienced a strong upswing, preventing the token from dropping below a pivotal support zone at $133. Now the question arises: whether the latest rebound can be considered as a trend reversal or if it’s a trap laid for the bulls. One of the major reasons for the recent upswing is said to be a huge whale activity. As per the update shared by LookonChian, whales withdrew a massive amount of SOL from a popular CEX, Binance, worth over $7.5 million. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1895496538488758713 With this, the SOL price quickly gained momentum as the market participants became hopeful of the next price action. The token surged above the psychological resistance at $145 but failed to clear the $150 range. Now, when the price is holding above the resistance-turned-support at $145, yet another whale activity occurred, which may circulate bearish clouds over the token. Lookonchain shared another update wherein 5 whale accounts unstaked 5.52 million SOL worth $810 million in the past 12 hours. Among them, 3.54 million SOL was deposited into Coinbase Prime. With this, the possibility of a major selling pressure hovers over the token, as whenever the whales move such a huge amount of crypto to CEXs, it heavily alters the value of the token. So, what’s next for the SOL price rally? Solana (SOL) Price Analysis The Solana price witnessed a massive pullback in the past few weeks that dragged the levels by more than 57% from the highs. Meanwhile, the whale accumulation is seen to have changed the trajectory of the token. However, the growth trajectory does not appear to be strong enough, which suggests that the SOL price may undergo an extended consolidation between $138 and $145 for a while. As seen in the above chart, the SOL price has triggered a rebound from the local lows close to $125. However, the upswing appears to be short-lived, as the bulls failed to push the price beyond the pivotal resistance but helped to keep up the trend above the pivotal support. On the other hand, the RSI displayed bearish divergence while the CMF failed to rise above 0, suggesting the bulls are holding significant strength regardless of the rebound. Being a little diverse, the MACD shows a drop in the selling volume while the levels are heading towards a bullish crossover. Therefore, the Solana (SOL) price is believed to remain consolidated for a while, and if the MACD undergoes a bullish crossover, the price could experience a notable rise. Until then, the token may remain within an accumulation phase.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|SOL|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-01 07:46:03

CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has ignited a firestorm of discussion by proclaiming that Strategy stock (MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, is significantly undervalued . This isn’t just casual market chatter; it’s a strong statement from a respected figure in blockchain analytics, hinting at a potentially lucrative opportunity for savvy investors. Let’s dive deep into why Ki Young Ju believes Strategy stock is a steal and what this could mean for the future of crypto-related investments. Why Does CryptoQuant CEO See Strategy Stock as Undervalued? Ki Young Ju, the head honcho at CryptoQuant CEO , didn’t mince words. His recent post on X (formerly Twitter) stating that Strategy stock is undervalued has sent ripples through both the crypto and traditional finance communities. But what’s the rationale behind such a confident assertion? It stems from a comparison with the tech titans known as the “Magnificent 7” and a deep understanding of Strategy ‘s unique position in the market. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors fueling this undervalued crypto narrative: Bitcoin Exposure: Strategy , under the leadership of its former CEO Michael Saylor , has become synonymous with Bitcoin. It holds a massive amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet, making it a publicly traded company with significant exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. As Bitcoin’s price fluctuates, so does the perceived value of Strategy . Magnificent 7 Comparison: Michael Saylor himself alluded to the potential of Strategy surpassing even the “Magnificent 7” – a group comprising Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, Alphabet, and Tesla. These companies are market giants, but Saylor’s bold claim suggests he sees Strategy on a similar trajectory, especially considering its Bitcoin strategy. Market Perception Lag: The traditional stock market may not fully grasp the implications of Strategy ‘s Bitcoin-centric approach. This lag in understanding could be contributing to the stock being undervalued . CryptoQuant CEO ‘s statement might be a wake-up call for investors to re-evaluate Strategy in the context of the evolving digital asset landscape. Potential for Bitcoin Upside: If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, then Strategy stock becomes an indirect, yet accessible, way to gain exposure in the traditional stock market. Should Bitcoin’s value surge, Strategy ‘s holdings would appreciate significantly, potentially driving its stock price upwards. This future growth potential might not be fully priced in currently, leading to the undervalued assessment. At the close of trading on Friday, Strategy ’s stock price (MSTR) stood at $255.58. Is this price point truly reflective of the company’s potential, especially considering its massive Bitcoin holdings and the bullish outlook from figures like CryptoQuant CEO and Michael Saylor ? Decoding Michael Saylor’s “Magnificent 7” Challenge Michael Saylor , the visionary behind Strategy ‘s bold Bitcoin adoption, has never been one to shy away from ambitious statements. His post, “you need a @Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7,” isn’t just marketing bravado. It’s a calculated assertion rooted in his belief in Bitcoin’s transformative power and Strategy ‘s unique positioning. Let’s unpack what Michael Saylor might mean by this challenge: Beyond Tech Growth: The “Magnificent 7” are predominantly tech companies, driven by innovation in software, hardware, and digital services. Saylor might be suggesting that the next wave of significant growth will be driven by digital assets and the companies strategically positioned within this space, like Strategy . Bitcoin as the Ultimate Asset: Saylor is a staunch Bitcoin maximalist. He views Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value and a superior asset class compared to traditional commodities and even some equities in the long run. By aligning Strategy so closely with Bitcoin, he’s betting on this long-term appreciation to outpace even the impressive growth of the “Magnificent 7”. A Different Kind of Value Proposition: While the “Magnificent 7” generate value through products and services, Strategy ‘s value proposition is intrinsically linked to Bitcoin’s performance. Saylor might be arguing that in an increasingly digital and inflation-conscious world, this form of value – tied to a decentralized, scarce digital asset – will become increasingly sought after and ultimately more valuable than traditional tech growth metrics alone. Disrupting the Status Quo: Saylor and Strategy are disruptors. They’ve challenged conventional corporate treasury management by embracing Bitcoin. This disruptive approach, Saylor implies, is the “strategy” needed to outperform even the most successful companies of the current era. While directly comparing Strategy to the “Magnificent 7” in terms of market capitalization and revenue might seem premature today, Michael Saylor ‘s vision is about future potential and the long game. CryptoQuant CEO ‘s undervalued assessment adds weight to this narrative, suggesting that the market might be underestimating Strategy ‘s long-term trajectory. Analyzing MSTR Stock: Is it Really Undervalued Crypto? To determine if MSTR stock truly represents undervalued crypto exposure, we need to look beyond the headlines and delve into some key analytical points: Bitcoin Holdings as a Primary Value Driver: Strategy ‘s value is heavily dependent on its Bitcoin holdings. Therefore, assessing Bitcoin’s future price trajectory is crucial when evaluating MSTR stock . Bullish on Bitcoin? Then MSTR stock might indeed be undervalued if Bitcoin’s potential upside isn’t fully reflected in the current stock price. Premium or Discount to NAV (Net Asset Value): Investors should analyze whether MSTR stock is trading at a premium or discount to its Net Asset Value, primarily driven by its Bitcoin holdings. An undervalued scenario would suggest a discount, meaning you’re getting Bitcoin exposure at a potentially lower price than buying Bitcoin directly (indirectly through the stock). Market Sentiment and Volatility: Both the crypto market and MSTR stock are known for volatility. Market sentiment can swing wildly, impacting valuations. Understanding the current market sentiment towards both Bitcoin and MSTR stock is essential to gauge if the undervalued perception is justified or merely a temporary dip. Company Performance Beyond Bitcoin: While Bitcoin is central, Strategy also has a software business. Analyzing the performance of this core business provides a more holistic view of the company’s financial health and potential beyond just crypto asset appreciation. A strong core business can further strengthen the argument for MSTR stock being undervalued . It’s crucial to remember that investing in MSTR stock is not the same as directly investing in Bitcoin. MSTR stock is subject to stock market dynamics, company-specific risks, and overall market sentiment, in addition to Bitcoin price fluctuations. However, for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure within the traditional stock market, MSTR stock , if truly undervalued as CryptoQuant CEO suggests, could present a compelling opportunity. Actionable Insights: Is Now the Time to Consider Strategy Stock? So, what should investors take away from CryptoQuant CEO ‘s bold statement and Michael Saylor ‘s ambitious comparison? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on opinions, even from respected figures. Conduct thorough research on Strategy (MSTR), Bitcoin’s potential, and the overall market conditions. Understand the risks and rewards involved. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Investing in MSTR stock , due to its Bitcoin correlation, carries inherent volatility. Ensure your risk tolerance aligns with the potential fluctuations in both the stock and crypto markets. Compare to Direct Bitcoin Investment: Consider if direct Bitcoin investment or exposure through other crypto investment vehicles better suits your portfolio strategy. MSTR stock offers a unique avenue, but it’s not the only one. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep a close eye on market sentiment surrounding both Bitcoin and MSTR stock . News, regulatory developments, and broader economic trends can significantly impact valuations. Consult a Financial Advisor: If you’re unsure about incorporating MSTR stock or crypto exposure into your portfolio, seek advice from a qualified financial advisor. They can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation and investment goals. Conclusion: The Undervalued Potential of Strategy Stock in the Crypto Era The assertion from CryptoQuant CEO that Strategy stock (MSTR) is undervalued is more than just market noise. It’s a compelling argument rooted in Strategy ‘s unique Bitcoin strategy, Michael Saylor ‘s visionary outlook, and the potential for the market to re-evaluate companies deeply intertwined with the burgeoning crypto asset class.

A Critical Crypto Market Analysis,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-bitcoin-season-12/,"Is the crypto market currently favoring Bitcoin, or are altcoins taking the lead? The answer, according to the latest CoinMarketCap data, leans heavily towards Bitcoin. The Altcoin Season Index , a key indicator for gauging market sentiment, has signaled a definitive shift. Let’s dive deep into what this means for you and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Should You Care? The Altcoin Season Index is not just another metric; it’s a compass for navigating the volatile crypto seas. Think of it as a barometer that tells you whether the market winds are blowing in favor of Bitcoin or altcoins. Measured by CoinMarketCap , this index provides a score from 1 to 100, reflecting the comparative performance of altcoins against Bitcoin. Here’s a breakdown of what the index signifies: Altcoin Season (Index above 75): When the index surges above 75, it indicates a vibrant ‘Altcoin Season’. This is when at least 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It’s typically a period of heightened excitement and potentially higher returns in altcoins. Bitcoin Season (Index below 25): Conversely, when the index dips below 25, we enter ‘ Bitcoin Season ‘. This signifies that Bitcoin is dominating the market, with 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins failing to keep pace with its performance. This often suggests a flight to safety or renewed confidence in Bitcoin’s market leadership. Neutral Territory (Index between 25 and 75): An index value between 25 and 75 suggests a more balanced market, where neither Bitcoin nor altcoins are overwhelmingly dominant. Currently, the Altcoin Season Index stands at a mere 21 (as of March 1st, 00:45 UTC), a slight decrease from the previous day’s 22. This reading firmly places us in Bitcoin Season . But what does this mean in practical terms? Bitcoin Season in Full Swing: What Does it Actually Mean for the Crypto Market? A Bitcoin Season , as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index , isn’t necessarily a negative event for the crypto market as a whole. It simply signals a shift in market focus and capital flow. Here’s what typically happens during a Bitcoin Season : Bitcoin Dominance Increases: Capital tends to flow back into Bitcoin, often considered a safer and more established cryptocurrency, leading to an increase in Bitcoin’s market dominance. Altcoin Volatility and Potential Correction: Altcoins may experience increased volatility and potentially face price corrections as investors reallocate funds to Bitcoin. Focus on Bitcoin Fundamentals: Market attention often shifts towards Bitcoin’s fundamentals, such as network upgrades, institutional adoption news, and macroeconomic factors influencing Bitcoin’s price. Opportunities in Bitcoin Trading: Traders and investors might find more lucrative opportunities in Bitcoin trading during this period, capitalizing on its relative strength and momentum. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is dynamic. Bitcoin Season is not necessarily permanent, and market conditions can change rapidly. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season: Actionable Insights So, how can you navigate the crypto market effectively when the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season ? Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Assess your current crypto portfolio and consider your risk tolerance. A Bitcoin Season might be a good time to rebalance your portfolio, potentially increasing your Bitcoin holdings or taking profits from altcoins that have underperformed. Focus on Bitcoin Analysis: Pay closer attention to Bitcoin’s price charts, on-chain metrics, and market sentiment. Understanding Bitcoin’s movements is key during this phase. Selective Altcoin Investing: While it’s Bitcoin Season , not all altcoins will necessarily underperform. Look for fundamentally strong altcoins with unique use cases, strong development teams, and growing adoption. These might still offer opportunities even in a Bitcoin-dominant market. Manage Risk Carefully: Increased volatility can be expected in both Bitcoin and altcoins. Implement robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and diversifying your portfolio (even within Bitcoin and select altcoins). Stay Informed and Adapt: The crypto market is ever-evolving. Continuously monitor the Altcoin Season Index , market news, and on-chain data to adapt your strategies as market conditions change. Is Altcoin Season Over? Understanding Market Cycles The dip in the Altcoin Season Index to 21 raises the question: Is altcoin season definitively over? While the current reading strongly suggests a Bitcoin Season , it’s essential to understand that crypto markets operate in cycles. Just as Bitcoin Season emerges, altcoin season will likely return in the future. Market cycles are influenced by a multitude of factors, including: Market Sentiment: Overall optimism or pessimism in the crypto market significantly impacts capital flow between Bitcoin and altcoins. Technological Developments: Breakthroughs in blockchain technology, new project launches, and protocol upgrades can trigger shifts in market focus. Regulatory Landscape: Changes in regulations can impact investor sentiment and market dynamics, influencing the performance of both Bitcoin and altcoins. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, and interest rate policies can also play a role in shaping crypto market cycles. Therefore, while the Altcoin Season Index currently indicates Bitcoin Season , it’s not a permanent state. Savvy investors understand these cycles and position themselves to capitalize on both Bitcoin Season and the eventual return of altcoin season. Conclusion: Decoding the Altcoin Season Index for Crypto Success The Altcoin Season Index is a powerful tool for understanding the ebb and flow of the crypto market. Currently signaling a definitive Bitcoin Season , it highlights a period where Bitcoin is outperforming the majority of altcoins. By understanding this metric and its implications, you can make more informed investment decisions, adapt your strategies to changing market conditions, and navigate the exciting, yet often unpredictable, world of cryptocurrencies. Remember, staying informed and agile is key to long-term success in the crypto space.

According to data from Binance, BTC hit a low of $78,258, filling the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap between $78,000 and $80,000. Bitcoin Fills CME Gap, Is It Time For Rebound? With today’s dip, BTC has now filled every CME gap since March 2024. At the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is trading in the low $80,000 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits Its Most Oversold Level Since August 2024 – Is A Rebound Coming? For the uninitiated, the CME gap refers to the price difference that occurs on the CME Bitcoin futures chart between Friday’s closing price and Monday’s opening price, as CME does not trade on weekends. These gaps are often filled later as Bitcoin’s price naturally retraces to these levels, acting as key support or resistance zones. A new CME gap has now emerged due to the ongoing market sell-off, triggered by US President Donald Trump’s confirmation that trade tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico will take effect on March 4. According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, the new CME gap lies between $92,800 and $94,000. If past data is anything to go by, this new CME gap may work as a price magnet, pulling BTC upward and initiating a bullish trend reversal. For example, back in January 2021, BTC filled a CME gap between $29,410 and $33,050. After filling the gap, BTC continued to dip further, before surging to as high as $40,000. That said, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors remain significant. The US Federal Reserve (Fed) and Trump continue to clash over interest rate policies. While the Fed has maintained that it is in no rush to cut rates, Trump has repeatedly called for immediate reductions. However, positive inflation data could pressure the Fed to accelerate rate cuts. According to an X post by The Kobeissi Letter, January’s PCE inflation – the Fed’s preferred measure – aligned with its projection of 2.5%. Similarly, core inflation – which measures the change in consumer prices excluding volatile items like food and energy – was in-line with expectations of 2.6% as well. However, data from CME FedWatch suggests that the Fed is likely to keep interest rates unchanged at the March 19 FOMC meeting. Is The BTC Bottom In? Although BTC has fallen nearly 20% over the past month, some analysts believe further downside may still be ahead. A recent forecast from Standard Chartered suggests BTC could decline another 10% before finding support. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Showing Early Signs Of Bullish Divergence? Analyst Explains However, there are also signs that BTC may be forming a local bottom. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that sell-side pressure is easing, which could indicate that BTC is stabilizing. Additionally, the Cryptoasset Sentiment Index recently flashed a strong contrarian buy signal, further hinting at a potential price floor for BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $83,508, down 2.5% in the past 24 hours.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 463,000 followers on the social media platform X that payment tokens Litecoin ( LTC ) and XRP may soon be top market performers as they hold key support levels above recent low prices despite Bitcoin’s price collapse this week. “At this time, for the the first time in a while, select alts are holding their own against prior lows while BTC has nuked below its own relative range lows. Look for those alts that have held their relative lows on this drop; they may be the ones to lead the next rally. Great examples at the moment are LTC and XRP (you seeing a theme here?).” LTC is trading for $127 at time of writing, up marginally in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, XRP is trading for $2.15 at time of writing, down 1.6% on the day. The analyst also says that Bitcoin may trade sideways in the coming days before a breakout. “BTC tagged $79,000 and we are now seeing some relief. Only two levels that really matter from my perspective at the moment: local supply at $94,000-$99,000 and high timeframe demand just under $74,000. I suspect we form a base between these two levels over the coming days before a full-on reversal.” Source: Credible Crypto/X Bitcoin is trading for $85,070, up fractionally in the last 24 hours.

XRP price action also looks good on the daily chart, hinting at a reversal amid rising whale activity and positive skew. Moreover, many analysts expect Bitcoin to pause its crash over the weekend and potentially recover, adding credence to a Ripple (XRP) price rally that could hit $3 over the weekend. XRP Price Recovers as Bitcoin Selloff Pauses The selloff that weighed on Bitcoin’s price this week has cooled. BTC is back above $85,000, and most altcoins are trading in the green today. The global crypto market cap has also surged by more than 7% within 24 hours, hitting $2.93 trillion in market capitalization. Crypto Market Cap Crypto markets are historically more volatile on weekends due to lower liquidity. This can cause wild swings in either direction. Therefore, as traders bought the dip, it triggered a recovery for Bitcoin and altcoins . These market-wide gains have boded well for XRP price, which trades at $2.20 today with a 9% gain in 24 hours. Derivatives trading data and whale activity suggest that XRP price may extend this rally and potentially recover past $3. XRP Derivatives Trading Data Shows a Positive Skew The XRP order book shows that Ripple has flashed a bullish signal as traders place more bids (buy orders) than asks (sell orders). Moreover, there is a significant bid skew that is within 50% of XRP’s current price, suggesting traders are willing to buy at higher prices. This imbalance shows that demand for XRP is currently high, making it more likely for the price to rise rather than fall. According to analyst DOM on X, this bid skew has only happened 4 times over the past year. Each time it has happened, the XRP price registered a strong rally. XRP Bid Skew If Ripple price were to repeat this historical pattern and the bid skew proves to be another bullish signal, it could stir a rally towards $3 over the weekend. Ripple Whale Activity Flashes a Buy Signal Whale activity is crucial in determining accumulation and distribution phases and after the recent drop in XRP price, the altcoin may have entered another accumulation phase. Looking at past trends, a sharp drop in XRP price has often signaled a buying opportunity for whales. At the same time, a price rally has led to XRP whales selling . If this pattern repeats itself, these large addresses may start buying the bottom, which is likely to drive the price up. XRP Whale Activity However, if Ripple price continues to show weakness, whales may remain hesitant until the altcoin establishes a local bottom where these large addresses will start buying. Can XRP Price Reach $3? XRP can continue to rally and reach $3 if Bitcoin continues to recover and averts another selloff. Additionally, other catalysts like an end to the SEC vs. Ripple case could stir a 300% gain for XRP price in March . Analyst CRYPTOWZRD notes that XRP price has established support at $2. After bouncing from this level, traders can expect more upside past $2.80 to the next major target of $3.65. XRP/USDT: 1-day chart However, Ripple price is likely to continue tracking Bitcoin in the near term. Therefore, until Bitcoin establishes a strong support level within the $80K – $90K zone, XRP may continue experiencing wild swings.

Recently, altcoin faced one of the biggest declines in the broader crypto market crash. More is at risk, with whale moving $516M SOL to the Coinbase Prime exchange, raising fears of a potential sell-off. With it already facing resistance, let’s discuss the potential impact of this massive whale activity. Whale Transfers Shake Solana Market Amid Price Recovery Amid the broader crypto market downturn, the Solana price crashed to a multiple-month low of $126.11. With a 15% recovery over the last 24 hours, investors are eyeing a recovery, especially given the rising investor interest and high open interest of $4.63B per Coinglass data. However, the on-chain data reveals that whales were constantly on the move earlier for buying the dip and now for the profits. Recently, one Solana whale bought $14 million worth of SOL, withdrawing it from Binance and staking the tokens. However, other whales are on the opposite side, eyeing a profit on the recent recovery. This is because the on-chain data analytics revealed several large transactions of whales moving SOL to the Coinbase Prime exchange. This includes five whale accounts unstaking 5.52M SOL, worth $810M, and depositing $516M to the Coinbase Prime, fueling speculation that major whales are looking to offload their holding. This move can either take profit or hedge against a potential downturn as $2.06 billion worth of token unlocks to happen today. Solana Price Under Pressure: Will It Crash? The Solana whale transactions indicate that a potential sell-off might take place. More importantly, this could build selling pressure as the SOL price struggles to recover. Such selling can also introduce downward pressure, resulting in further declines. Additionally, the FTX distribution would add 2.2% supply (more than $1 billion SOL) to the Solana network, making it one of the biggest unlocks. Such events increase the liquidity of the token, impacting the price on a short-term basis. More unlocks are expected in the upcoming months, so the price can face turbulence. However, as the trading volume is 28% up to $6.4B and OI surged, this indicates investors building confidence. More importantly, it is unclear when the whale will sell, so that the impact may vary significantly. Key Levels to Watch Despite a significant recovery, the Solana price is struggling to maintain its bullish momentum. At the time of writing, it hovers around crucial support levels, trading at $143.91 with a market capitalization of $72.98B. The whale moves are building selling pressure around the token, and if this pressure intensifies, the price could drop to the $100 psychological level. The SOL price might crash to $70 in the worst-case scenario. In contrast, it might surge to $180 if the buyers stepped in. Therefore, $180.28, $201.47, and $206.75 are key resistance levels to watch. Bottom Line With the recent market crash, the whale activity is in its prime, either for buying the dip or taking the most profit. Five Solana whales also unstaked and deposited $516M of SOL tokens on an exchange. The SOL price might witness a temperory downtrend if they sold these due to increased selling pressure. Investors must monitor the whale movement, SOL token unlocks, and the key support level for better Solana price prediction analysis.

The XRP lawyer urged key SEC officials Hester Peirce and Mark Udeya as well as crypto czar David Sacks and crypto advisor Bo Hines for the Ripple case dismissal. In an X post , Deaton wrote, “As Amici counsel and on behalf of 75K XRP holders, Hester Peirce, David Sacks, Bo Hines, Mark Udeya, when Ripple?” US Court Drops SEC Lawsuit Against Hex Founder Notably, John Deaton’s X post comes on the heels of the US federal court’s dismissal of the lawsuit against the Hex founder, imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC alleged that Richard Heart accumulated over $1 billion through unregistered cryptocurrency offerings and $12.1 million through defrauding investors. However, the court countered that the regulators failed to demonstrate US jurisdiction over Heart’s crypto activities. In a February 28 court ruling, Judge Carol Bagley Amon stated, The alleged misappropriation occurred through digital wallets and crypto asset platforms, none of which were alleged to have any connection with the United States…To the extent the Complaint shows that Heart misappropriated investor funds through deceptive mixer transactions, those actions occurred entirely outside of the United States. The Hex founder’s lawsuit update and John Deaton’s statement come following the SEC’s dismissal of multiple crypto lawsuits involving Coinbase, Robinhood, Uniswap, etc. In a contrasting view, former SEC official John Reed Stark perceives these developments as a warning sign, suggesting that they may ultimately lead to the agency’s destruction. Following the court win, the crypto tokens like PulseChain (PLS), PulseX (PLSX) and HEX (HEX), which the SEC alleged were securities, surged significantly. Richard Heart celebrated the victory, coupled with the tokens’ rally. In an X post, he stated, “HEX has operated flawlessly for over 5 years. Today’s decision in favor of a cryptocurrency founder and his projects over the SEC brings welcome relief and opportunity to all cryptocurrencies.” John Deaton’s Long Battle for Ripple’s Victory Significantly, John Deaton began his crusade against the SEC in response to the agency’s allegations against Ripple, taking on a role as an advocate for XRP holders. He began his journey as an amicus counsel representing 75k XRP holders, filing a writ of mandamus to question the SEC’s jurisdiction and motives. Over the four-year lawsuit, he continued to support Ripple, arguing that the SEC’s claims were unfounded. Recently, John Deaton reflected on Ripple’s significant transformations over the past few years, especially since 2020, when the SEC filed the lawsuit. He credits Ripple’s successful court battles and Donald Trump’s re-election as key factors contributing to the optimistic developments surrounding XRP ETFs.

At the time of writing, Cardano and Solana are both having difficulty returning to their previous highs, with Cardano trading at $0.60 and Solana at $131.10. With more than 3,400 investors and more than $1.8 million already secured, MUTM is currently in phase 2 of its presale. Investors have a unique opportunity to enter the market before the price spikes 33.33% to $0.02 in phase 3. In a few months, Mutuum Finance should hit $3, offering investors a whopping 200x return. Cardano and Solana: Can They Reclaim Their Former Glory? Two of the most well-known cryptocurrency companies in 2021 were Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL), which saw enormous bull runs and hit all-time highs. Both are still having difficulty recovering as of right now. Solana is presently trading at $131.10, still well below its all-time high of around $258, while Cardano is trading at $0.60, a long cry from its $3 peak. Both projects have seen fierce competition and market changes as a result of the overall market slump, despite their ongoing growth and robust communities. Consequently, in search of more profits, investors are turning to Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The DeFi Investment Set for Explosive Growth Investors are flocking to purchase tokens before the price goes up as Mutuum Finance gains a tremendous amount of traction. Even though MUTM is just $0.015 and in Phase 2 of presale, demand is going through the roof. With more than 3,400 investors investing more than $1.8 million, the price will shortly rise 33% to $0.02, so it is the ideal time to invest before the next rise. When MUTM begins at $0.06, an investment today may yield 300% returns. And if expert projections are anything to believe, the token may reach $3, and early adopters may reap life-altering benefits. Revolutionizing Crypto Lending By granting consumers complete control over their assets, Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending. The site can let you access liquidity without selling your cryptocurrency or generate passive revenue as a lender. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending: Smart contracts automatically modify interest rates in response to market demand and manage loan pools. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending does not involve intermediaries. Instead, users are allowed to choose their own terms, interest rates, and collateral, creating a customizable, decentralized borrowing experience. With this dual-lending system, Mutuum Finance improves the efficiency, transparency, and usability of lending and borrowing. The first priority is security. To provide full openness for investors, the team is dedicated to open-source smart contract technology and third-party audits. Staking MUTM tokens is another way for consumers to get additional passive revenue. In order to increase liquidity and solidify its place in the DeFi market, Mutuum Finance intends to grow to other blockchain networks, including non-EVM chains. $100,000 Giveaway for Early Investors To celebrate its growing number of users, Mutuum Finance is giving away $100,000 of MUTM tokens! 10 lucky winners will each receive $10,000,a gesture to thank early birds and keep things active as the project continues toward its launch. Whereas Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) are yet to reach their all-time highs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast taking center stage. It is among the most hopeful cryptocurrency options due to its new loan concept, prosperous presale, and monster growth potential. With estimated profits of 200x, early investors will be able to get in at a paltry $0.015 per token before the price shoots up to $0.02 in Phase 3. This might just be a game-changer. Get into presale right now to secure your share before the next price surge happens—don’t miss this opportunity! Also, don’t miss the $100,000 early supporter incentive.

Good Crypto to Invest In Before Its Q2 2025 Mainnet as Chainlink Gains Momentum & Algorand Climbs 13%",https://thecoinrise.com/qubetics-aims-for-16791-roi-good-crypto-to-invest-in-before-its-q2-2025-mainnet-as-chainlink-gains-momentum-algorand-climbs-13/,"Ever feel like you’re watching crypto prices skyrocket, wishing you got in earlier? Chainlink is eyeing a bullish breakout, Algorand has jumped 13%, and the market is heating up. But the real game-changer? Qubetics ($TICS), the world’s first Web3 Aggregator, is revolutionizing cross-border payments and raking in millions during its presale. With over $14.2M already raised and 21,600+ holders, Qubetics is positioning itself as the next big thing before its Q2 2025 mainnet launch. Analysts are calling it one of the best cryptos to invest in, predicting a staggering 16,791% ROI if $TICS hits $15 after the mainnet goes live. Could this be your chance to buy in before the next 100x move? QUBETICS: REVOLUTIONIZING CROSS-BORDER TRANSACTIONS Sending money across borders has always been a slow, expensive mess. Banks slap on high fees, delays, and hidden charges, making transactions frustrating for businesses and individuals alike. But Qubetics changes the game by offering instant, near-zero-cost cross-border payments using blockchain. Picture this: A small business owner in the U.S. needs to pay a supplier in Asia. Normally, they’d deal with SWIFT transfer delays, high conversion fees, and bank intermediaries. With Qubetics, they send the payment in seconds, directly from wallet to wallet, with no third-party interference. Or imagine a remote freelancer in Europe working with U.S. clients. Traditional payment platforms eat away at their earnings with processing fees and conversion rates. But Qubetics’ blockchain-powered system lets them receive payments instantly, with no middlemen taking a cut. This is why Qubetics is a good crypto to invest in —it’s solving real-world financial problems that legacy banks have ignored for decades. QUBETICS PRESALE: TIME IS RUNNING OUT If you missed Ethereum at $1 or Solana under $5, you might not want to sit this one out. Qubetics is currently in Stage 23 of its presale, with each stage lasting just 7 days before the price jumps by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM. Here’s where things stand: Total Raised: Over $14.2M Current Price: $0.0888 Total Holders: Over 21,600 Tokens Sold: Over 491 million $TICS Analysts are bullish on Qubetics, predicting: $TICS at $0.25 (presale end) → 181.52% ROI $TICS at $1 (after presale) → 1,026.09% ROI $TICS at $15 (after mainnet launch) → 16,791.32% ROI That means a $1,000 investment today at $0.0888 would buy 11,261 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits $10 post-mainnet, that bag could be worth $112,610—and if it reaches $15, you’re looking at $168,000. With the mainnet launching in Q2 2025, this crypto presale isn’t just another hype train—it’s a real opportunity. Join the Qubetics presale today before the next price jump! CHAINLINK: IS A MAJOR BREAKOUT COMING? Chainlink (LINK) has been stuck in a corrective phase, but recent bullish momentum suggests a turning point is near. After bouncing off support at $14.50, LINK has been climbing, with traders eyeing $20.45 as a key breakout level. Technical analysis shows a WXY corrective structure on the 4-hour chart, hinting that the downtrend may be ending. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved out of oversold territory, indicating a shift in market sentiment. If LINK breaks above the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $20.45, it could trigger a massive rally, with $18.01 as the next resistance level. However, if LINK drops below $14.78, the correction could extend further. For now, bulls are in control, and Chainlink is looking strong. ALGORAND SURGES 13%—IS MORE UPSIDE COMING? Algorand (ALGO) has been on a strong upward trend, jumping 13% from $0.2090 to $0.2375 in recent days. This bullish move comes despite broader market uncertainty, signaling strong community support and buying pressure. The price surge has sparked renewed interest among community members, especially as Algorand continues building its DeFi and enterprise partnerships. With growing adoption and solid fundamentals, ALGO could be gearing up for another leg up if market sentiment remains positive. However, technical indicators suggest caution, as overbought conditions could lead to short-term corrections before further gains. Whether ALGO can maintain its momentum remains to be seen. CONCLUSION: WHICH CRYPTO HAS THE MOST UPSIDE RIGHT NOW? Chainlink is flashing bullish signals, Algorand just rallied 13%, but Qubetics is in another league altogether. With a revolutionary cross-border payments system, a booming presale, and a 16,791% ROI target, Qubetics is easily one of the best cryptos to invest in before its Q2 2025 mainnet launch. Don’t wait until it’s too late—join the Qubetics crypto presale now before the next price increase!

Curious to know more details? Read on? CBI Seizes $2.75 M in Cryptos in Nationwide Raids In a press release , the CBI acknowledges the rumours that it has conducted raids in nearly 60 locations across India in connection with the infamous Gainbitcoin scam case – which was transferred to them for a detailed investigation by the top court of the country, the Supreme Court of India, after the registration of multiple First Information Reports across states in connection with the scam. Reports suggest that the raids have been conducted in several major cities, including Delhi, Pune, Nanded, Kolhapur, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Mohali, Jhansi and Hubli. As per reports, several important pieces of evidence, including 121 documents, 34 laptops and hard disks, 12 mobile phones and several email and instant messaging data dumps, have been seized during the raids. The press release of the CBI confirms the reports that several crucial documents and electronic devices have been seized during the raid. Importantly, reports state that the central agency has seized cryptocurrencies worth no less than $2.75 million during the raids. Gainbitcoin Scam: How It Defrauded Investors It was in 2015 that the infamous Gainbitcoin Ponzi scheme was launched. As mentioned above, it was alleged that Amit Bharadwaj (deceased) and Ajay Bhradwaj played a crucial role in orchestrating this fraud scheme. Like every successful Ponzi scheme, the Gainbitcoin scheme also attracted people with a massive monthly return. It promised investors a striking monthly return of 10% on BTC investments for 18 months. Initially, everything worked smoothly. Naturally, it helped the scammers attract more victims. Its multi-level marketing model complemented its growth and expansion significantly. The collapse commenced when withdrawals were suspiciously switched to an in-house cryptocurrency, MCAP. In 2018, Amit Bharadwaj and his team, including Ajay Bhradwaj, Nikunj Jain and Sahil Baghla, were booked in connection with the scam, and produced before a special court. Multiple FIRs were registered across the country in connection with the scam in a very short span of time. Considering the severity and nature of the crime, the Supreme Court directed the CBI to launch a detailed investigation into this matter. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Intriguingly, the price surge comes alongside a whopping 389 million SHIB token burn in February, per recent burn metrics. As an upshot, market watchers anticipate that a breakout for the meme coin looms, with analysts also forecasting the same. Shiba Inu Price Bullish Amid Massive 389M Burn As of press time, Shiba Inu price pumped nearly 6% and exchanged hands at $0.00001393. The leading meme coin bottomed and topped at $0.00001301 and $0.00001412 in the past 24 hours. While this bullish action fell in line with the broader crypto market’s recent recovery-like trend, it’s worth taking into account the massive token burn. According to metrics revealed by the official tracker Shibburn on March 1, a staggering 389.18 million tokens were burnt the previous month, February. This surge in the burn rate indicates that the meme coin’s circulating supply is further shredded. Source: Shibburn, X In turn, market watchers remain bullish about the asset’s future performance, abiding by the law of supply and demand. For context, the burn mechanism sends tokens to a null address, permanently removing them from the supply. As a result, the circulating supply diminished and totaled 584.32 trillion, with the massive burn rate surge constantly dealing blows to it. How Much SHIB Burnt To Date? Shibburn’s statistics indicated that a staggering 410.72 trillion coins have been removed from the supply to date. Intraday data revealed that 14 million coins were burnt. As a result, market watchers continue to weigh optimism over Shiba Inu price’s long-term performance. SHIB ETF Speculations Build Up On the other hand, SHIB marketing lead Lucie took to X on February 27, stating, “Wen SHIB ETF?” This statement has set off waves of speculations across the broader market as meme coin-backed ETPs have been in the trends lately. Notably, dog-themed meme crypto Dogecoin has secured a vital milestone in this field. CoinGape reported that Grayscale Investments, CoinShares, and WisdomTree have submitted applications for DOGE ETF approval . The U.S. SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s filing, with approval odds gaining substantial weight in recent days. This broader development has fueled hope for other meme coin-backed ETFs, such as a potential SHIB ETF. Shiba Inu’s price could substantially leverage this, given the market sees such a feat ahead. Market Analyst Forecasts Bullish Outlook For SHIB Price If Buyers Step In Simultaneously, renowned analyst ‘Rose Premium Signals’ posted on X, spotlighting the crucial support of $0.00001461 for SHIB price. As per the analyst, if buyers step in now, the meme coin could see a bullish movement toward the resistance of $0.00002941 and $0.00003738. Source: Rose Premium Signals, X Further, the highly bullish target remains $0.00004401, per the analyst. Overall, traders and investors extensively eye the token amid a recovery-like trend and token burns, The constant SHIB burns continue to bolster the crypto’s tokenomics, urging the price to move upwards.

The world's largest cryptocurrency has fallen 28% from its all-time high of $109,241 reached on Jan. 20, a dramatic pullback amid market turmoil and growing concerns over U.S. trade policies. The crypto market’s recent decline comes amid heightened risk aversion in financial markets, triggered by renewed tariff threats from US President Donald Trump. Trump announced that 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods will come into effect on March 4, and an additional 10% tax on goods imported from China. Beijing has vowed to take “all necessary measures” in response. Trade tensions have dampened investor sentiment, fueling a sell-off in stocks and risk-sensitive assets, with cryptocurrencies among the hardest hit. “Some of the big investors said at the end of the day, ‘you know what, I’m giving up now,’” said Zaheer Ebtikar, co-founder of crypto fund Split Capital. “There was definitely a lot more selling than usual, so it’s hard to pinpoint a specific exchange or location.” Related News: Binance Responds To Allegations That It Sells Altcoins And Drags The Market Down With Its Sales Bitcoin’s decline pushed it below key technical levels that investors have been watching for signs of a potential reversal. BTC fell below its 200-day moving average for the first time since October, while the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) entered oversold territory for the first time since September. Traders are still waiting for Trump to clarify his crypto policies, including speculation about a potential Bitcoin stockpile, said Stefan von Haenisch, director of over-the-counter trading at crypto custody firm BitGo Inc. “Given the macro environment, it’s not surprising to see where we are,” he said. Market analysts are warning that Bitcoin could see even steeper losses if sentiment in stocks continues to deteriorate. “The real panic could still be ahead. There’s always another 70%+ crash in Bitcoin’s future,” MLIV Editor-in-Chief Mark Cudmore said in a statement. Cudmore highlighted the $72,000-$74,000 range as a potential technical crisis zone that could trigger another prolonged crypto decline. Ruslan Lienkha, head of markets at crypto platform YouHodler, suggested that Bitcoin could find support around $70,000, but warned against assuming the worst is over. “We could see that level only if there is a negative sentiment in the equity markets,” Lienkha said. *This is not investment advice.

Notably, this update comes amid the soaring buzz over the project among the market participants. Besides, the recent developments of the token also fueled speculations over the Pi coin price’s potential rally to $5 ahead. Pi Network Extends Deadline For KYC & Mainnet Migration In a crucial update, Pi team announced an extension for its Grace Period deadline , allowing users additional time to complete their Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and migrate their balances to Mainnet. A recent blog post showed that the deadline has been pushed to March 14, 2025, at 8:00 AM UTC , coinciding with Pi Coin’s sixth anniversary . According to the Pi Network, this extension is the last opportunity for users who have yet to verify their accounts. The decision aims to ensure inclusivity, enabling early Pioneers who have returned after Open Network’s launch to complete their migration . Meanwhile, the team emphasized the importance of this deadline, stating that any Pioneers who fail to complete the KYC process risk forfeiting most of their mobile balances. They explained that previous extensions had provided ample time for verification, making this the final chance for unverified users to secure their holdings. Why Pi Network Extended the Grace Period? Pi Network’s latest decision aligns with its commitment to inclusivity and fairness. The team outlined several reasons for this extension, highlighting key network goals: Reengaging Early Pioneers: Many users who contributed to Pi’s initial success have recently returned. The extension gives them a chance to complete KYC and migration. Ensuring Maximum Participation: The network’s strength depends on verified users. Allowing more Pioneers to complete the process fosters a healthier ecosystem. Addressing Corner Cases: Some users faced unique challenges in completing their migration. The extension serves as a remedy for those who still need time. Strengthening the Network: Pi aims to maintain a decentralized, verified ecosystem. The deadline ensures the network transitions smoothly into its next phase. Pi Network made it clear that while inclusivity remains a priority, this marks the final extension. Users must act promptly or risk forfeiting their balances. What Happens If Pioneers Miss the Deadline? Pi Network’s latest statement reinforces that failing to complete the KYC and Mainnet migration by March 14, 2025, will result in forfeiture. Unverified users will lose most of their mobile balance, except for Pi mined in the last six months before migration. To avoid this , users must: Submit their KYC application via the Pi Network app. Complete the Mainnet Checklist under the app’s ‘Mainnet’ section. Remind their Referral Team and Security Circle members to complete the migration. What’s Next For Pi Coin Price? Market speculation around Pi’s price continues to intensify as the network nears its full transition. Some analysts believe that increasing adoption, combined with a fully verified network, could drive PI’s price higher in the coming days. However, the crypto has witnessed volatile trading lately. Pi value today was down about 2% and exchanged hands at $2.22, after touching a 24-hour high of $2.36. However, unlike other cryptocurrencies that witnessed massive selloffs during the latest crash, PI was up around 170% over the last seven days. Besides, with speculations gaining momentum over Pi’s listing on Binance , market watchers anticipate robust gains ahead for the crypto. Notably, a recent Pi Coin price analysis indicates that the crypto might hit $5 if the bullish momentum holds among traders.

This week’s highlights included the Avalanche Foundation introducing the Avalanche Card, a credit card for users in Latin America and the United States. The card, which was announced in a statement to Cointelegraph en Español, strives to bring cryptocurrencies into use as a powerful tool for daily transactions. According to John Wu, president of Ava Labs, the card image offers a credit card-like experience, reflecting the growing popularity of digital assets. With Avalanche Card, the Avalanche network securely integrates a potential payment method within the Visa network, allowing users to spend their digital assets much more easily without jumping between platforms. With this initiative, users can use cryptocurrencies like USDC, USDT, Wrapped AVAX (wAVAX), and AVAX to buy goods and services online or at any merchant that accepts Visa. The card, which is also marketed toward freelancers and the underbanked demographic, focuses on financial inclusivity in Argentina – for instance- where some 30% of adults do not have access to traditional banking services. The Avalanche Card, backed by the widest acceptance network of Visa, simplifies access to decentralized finance (DeFi) and enables users to hold effectively in self-custody wallet addresses. Tether’s bets on LATAM by relocating to El Salvador Tether, the stablecoin giant, has moved its headquarters to El Salvador and plans to acquire big agricultural companies such as Adecoagro. Unlike other recent Tether news, the top stablecoin issuer is taking steps to ensure its survival in the face of potential existential threats from US institutions. According to Cointelegraph, Tether aims to create its stablecoin marketplace in a more favourable regulatory environment. Shopify’s development into fields including energy, AI, and agriculture may be viewed as a successful diversification strategy or a risky pursuit of growth. According to the report, USDT has the potential to become America’s digital haven as Tether expands throughout the region. The company’s activities may be influenced by regional economic and geopolitical factors, but its goal is to create a financial system based on blockchain technology for inclusion and development. Investing in Adecoagro is more than just a financial transaction; it is a commitment to connecting the digital and real economies. Tether faces regulatory obstacles and competition from new stablecoin entrants such as Circle and Paxos. Tether’s impact on Latin America’s financial future will demand regulatory certainty, notwithstanding the tough road ahead. Peru ranks third in LATAM crypto growth Peru has emerged as a major player in the Latin American bitcoin sector. According to Lemon’s most recent research , “Estado de la Industria Crypto 2024,” (State of the Crypto Industry 2024) the country ranks seventh in terms of cryptocurrency value received. The report shows that the country ranks third in annual growth within the area. This rapid ascension is being driven by developments in legislative frameworks, technical integration, and growing public interest in digital assets such as Bitcoin. According to Cointelegraph , several factors such as improvements to regulations, the development of technology and an ever-growing population interest in topics digitally owned (Bitcoin being one of them) caused this accelerated rise. According to the Lemon report, Peru achieved several milestones contributing to the expansion of the crypto landscape during this past year. The key point came with the implementation of interoperability, enabling local and foreign fintech to interact with Peru’s financial system.

The SEC had accused Heart of raising over $1 billion through unregistered cryptocurrency offerings and misusing $12.1 million for personal purchases, including luxury items and rare collectibles. Jurisdictional Challenges The dismissal was based on jurisdictional issues, with the judge ruling that Heart’s activities were not specifically directed at U.S. investors. The court noted that the alleged misappropriation occurred through digital wallets and crypto asset platforms that lacked a concrete connection to the United States. SEC’s Accusations The SEC had claimed that Heart promoted HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX with exaggerated promises of wealth, including statements suggesting that HEX could provide 38% annual returns. Additionally, the agency alleged that investor funds were used for extravagant purchases, including high-end sports cars, expensive watches, and unique auctioned items. Court’s Reasoning The judge ruled that Heart’s online promotional efforts were global rather than targeted specifically at the U.S. market. Furthermore, the SEC was unable to demonstrate that Heart engaged in financial transactions within the U.S. jurisdiction, weakening the foundation of the case. Heart’s Response Following the ruling, Heart’s representatives expressed relief, emphasizing that the decision was a step toward protecting legitimate crypto entrepreneurs from overreach by regulatory agencies. Heart himself acknowledged the challenges of winning a securities-related case against the SEC and welcomed the outcome. SEC’s Position The SEC has not publicly commented on the dismissal, leaving uncertainty about whether further legal actions will be pursued. Implications for Cryptocurrency Regulation The case highlights the difficulties regulators face in enforcing securities laws within the decentralized crypto industry. As digital assets continue to evolve, this ruling may set a precedent for future cases, influencing how regulators approach enforcement in the space.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-01 09:25:47

This upward momentum has given investors renewed confidence in the market. However, analysts caution that despite the rally, market indicators suggest the bottom may not yet be fully established. The Role of Spot and Margin Buying A significant portion of Bitcoin’s latest rally has been attributed to strong spot buying, as well as leveraged margin longs. Market participants have shown a growing appetite for risk, pushing prices higher despite broader market uncertainties. The influx of institutional interest has also played a role in the price spike, with large buyers accumulating positions amid market optimism. Potential Risks of Overleveraging While the rally has been impressive, there are concerns about overleveraging. High levels of margin trading can lead to sudden liquidations, which may trigger sharp corrections in Bitcoin’s price. If long positions become overextended, a market downturn could wipe out gains and create increased volatility. Macro Factors and Market Sentiment External economic factors, including inflation concerns, monetary policy shifts, and global financial uncertainty, continue to play a role in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Investors are watching central bank policies closely, as changes in interest rates and liquidity conditions could impact risk appetite in the crypto space. Key Support and Resistance Levels Analysts point to key technical levels that will determine Bitcoin’s next moves. If the asset fails to sustain momentum above the $85,000 mark, a pullback to lower support levels could be likely. Conversely, a breakout past resistance could pave the way for further gains, potentially pushing Bitcoin to $100,000 and into new all-time highs. Caution Amid Bullish Momentum Despite the optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s latest surge, experts urge caution. The market remains highly volatile, and traders should be prepared for potential corrections. While long-term sentiment remains positive, short-term fluctuations are expected, making risk management essential for those looking to capitalize on the current trend. Final Thoughts Bitcoin’s rally to $85,000 highlights strong demand and growing institutional participation. However, with leveraged positions rising and external macroeconomic factors at play, the market remains uncertain. Investors should stay vigilant, considering both the bullish momentum and the potential risks that could lead to sudden market reversals.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-01 09:27:19

While top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) experienced a brutal 31% correction in February, LTC staged a strong show, ending 1% on the green side. Market analysts believe that LTC can continue the rally further and surge past $200 levels by April. Will Litecoin Outperform Bitcoin in March? February 2025 turned out to be among the worst-performing months for Bitcoin (BTC) with a 17.3% correction, while Litecoin ended up 1% in the green. According to analytics platform Santiment, LTC price has risen 25% against BTC during the month, a notable divergence in a bearish crypto market. Amid the strong performance, Santiment also highlights a recent spike in LTC addresses and an overly bullish commentary for the altcoin in the last 24 hours. Analysts caution that these factors may signal a minor price retracement in the short term. Source: Santiment Litecoin ETF Demand Grows The surge in the network activity has been largely due to the growing optimism surrounding the approval of Litecoin ETF by the US SEC this year. Bloomberg has pegged the odds of such an approval to 90%, much higher than XRP ETF or Solana ETF. The potential approval of an LTC ETF reflects a growing trend in the cryptocurrency market. The success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have seen significant net inflows since their 2024 launches, has opened the door for additional crypto-focused investment products. While an ETF may not command the same level of demand as its Bitcoin and Ethereum counterparts, analysts believe that even moderate inflows could make it appealing. Will LTC Price Rally to $200? As of press time, the LTC price is trading 11% up at $127.70, however, the bulls still need to push it past the crucial resistance of $130 and sustain above it to trigger the next leg of the rally. As per the Coinglass data, the LTC open interest has surged 8.68% to $645 million. Also, the 24-hour liquidations have soared to $2.25 million of which $1.90 million is in short liquidations. Market analysts have mixed opinions, especially with Litecoin price’s recent surge despite the broader market crash. Some believe that the current bounce in LTC price is the outcome of short liquidations instead of fundamental shifts in market conditions. On the other hand, CoinCodex data shows that Litecoin can rally all the way to $224 by April 2025. Source: Coincodex Tight liquidity conditions have been the major reason behind recent crypto market pullbacks and will continue to influence Bitcoin and altcoin movements ahead. Apart from the current surge, there has to be a strong catalyst that can drive the LTC rally ahead.

The total market capitalization has reached $2.81 trillion, reflecting a 7.15% daily increase.

Recent market activity suggests growing momentum as digital assets trade near key support levels. Cryptocurrencies Price Prediction – Turn $500 to $50K With These Altcoins With Bitcoin pausing its crash over the weekend and other cryptocurrencies looking good, here are four altcoins to turn $500 to $50K. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL), a layer one altcoin, has seen notable momentum over the past year. After dropping to $131 on February 25, marking a five-month low, SOL has since experienced a recovery after a week. This follows other broader crypto markets seeing a rebound, with BTC surging by 10% in the past 24-hours. SOL has overcome the $140 support line in its current market position. SOL price experienced a 10% increase throughout the previous 24-hour period. Experts anticipate substantial cryptocurrency value appreciation while SOL represents a top altcoin position that will be significant during 2025. According to CoinGlass, the SOL derivatives market is showing positive momentum. The volume of trades has surged by 12%, reaching $14.86 billion. Open interest has also climbed by 9%, now at $4.50 billion. This increase suggests growing market interest and may have a bullish impact on Solana’s price, signaling a potential rise in demand and future value.

Speculation surrounding a potential DOGE ETF has fueled optimism, with analysts predicting further price growth. The crypto expert Ali observes DOGE price maintaining its position above key support areas that suggest further price increases next week. Dogecoin’s price outlook for the upcoming weeks is favorable, given the current signs of market recovery. Cryptocurrencies price predictions suggest that altcoins like DOGE could see substantial increases before March 31, 2025. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA), a proof-of-stake blockchain platform, shows signs of rebound. At the time of writing the ADA is trading at $0.6415, ADA has gained 8% over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency recently hit a support level before seeing a rebound. Analytical experts predict ADA will reach the $1 price target in the near future.

Currently trading below $82,000, the cryptocurrency has experienced a significant 24.6% drop. Amid this bearish trend, CryptoQuant contributor EgyHash has highlighted a troubling development on Binance that could further pressure Bitcoin’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Buying The Dip: $1.28 Billion Added Below $90,000 Bearish Sentiment Takes Hold EgyHash notes that Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, is seeing a steady rise in key metrics that indicate growing sell-side activity. According to EgyHash, the 7-day moving average of mean coin inflows into Binance is increasing, signaling that investors are making larger, more frequent deposits. This uptick in inflows often precedes heightened selling activity, as it suggests that more coins are becoming available on the exchange’s order books. Adding to this, the “Bitcoin: Exchange Inflow (Top10)” metric—an indicator that tracks the total coin volume of the top ten largest inflow transactions—has reached levels not seen in almost a year. This surge suggests that significant amounts of Bitcoin are being moved onto Binance, potentially with the intent to sell. EgyHash also points out that Binance’s Bitcoin reserves are climbing, returning to levels last observed in November of the previous year. A rise in exchange reserves typically reflects an increase in coins held by the platform, which can signal more selling pressure. Bearish Signals on Binance? Key Metrics Point to Rising Sell Pressure “Binance’s Bitcoin reserve has risen to levels last observed in November of the previous year, potentially indicating more selling pressure.” – By @EgyHashX Read more ⤵️https://t.co/vl4sDIxaKD pic.twitter.com/y7qB1D4IS1 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 28, 2025 Further supporting this view is the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, which reveals that sell orders currently outweigh buy orders, painting a bearish picture for the market. This accumulation of factors—rising inflows, growing exchange reserves, and a dominant bearish sentiment—could indicate that Bitcoin’s downward trajectory may continue. Examining the Role of Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) While sell pressure on exchanges is a significant factor, other indicators are offering a broader perspective on the market’s overall sentiment. Another CryptoQuant analyst, tugbachain, recently discussed the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric, which tracks the network’s unrealized profits and losses to determine whether investors, on average, are holding Bitcoin at a gain or a loss. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Suffer Massive Losses: $1 Billion Drained In Single-Day Outflow According to tugbachain, the NUPL currently sits just below the 0.50 support level. Historically, a reading below this threshold has coincided with bearish phases, while a recovery above it can suggest renewed buying interest. If Bitcoin’s monthly close for February exceeds this 0.50 mark, it could indicate a shift toward more optimistic price action, possibly encouraging long-term holders to re-enter the market.

Pi Coin’s decline comes as the broader crypto market faces a sell-off . Trump’s tariff policies are creating a mess in the global market. Reports suggest that institutional investors, including BlackRock, have been offloading Bitcoin and Ethereum, dragging down the entire market.

Technical analysis points to a possible recovery. Pi Coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 31.36, close to oversold territory. When RSI dips below 30, it signals seller exhaustion, meaning the price could soon bounce back. Additionally, PI’s price has broken below its Bollinger Bands’ lower line, a volatility indicator that suggests the coin is oversold and due for a reversal. Meanwhile, a Binance survey shows that 86% of participants favor listing Pi Coin on the exchange. A listing would boost liquidity, adoption, and global trading accessibility, which could significantly impact Pi’s price. If Binance lists Pi, a breakout above $3.67 could push it to new highs near $4.20. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Coin Price Prediction: Is $10 Possible After Binance Listing? , Key Levels to Watch Pi Coin needs to break above the $2.56 resistance level to trigger a rally toward its all-time high of $3—a 44% increase from its current price.

The news triggered an immediate bullish reaction, pushing BTC from $78,000 to a new intra-day high. Ethereum (ETH) and major altcoins like Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) followed suit, with increased investor optimism around potential regulatory shifts. Bloomberg reported that Trump is expected to discuss the future of digital assets, leading to speculation that the government may adopt crypto-friendly policies. White House just announced its first-ever Crypto Summit on March 7 Trump, top CEOs, big money – they’re all in the room This ain’t just another meeting, this is THE SIGNAL – Regulatory clarity – Mass adoption – Or just insiders front-running again?

BTC surged 8% to $86,500, while ETH and major altcoins also posted gains. Market sentiment is improving, but macroeconomic risks could weigh on prices. Trade Tensions & Inflation Data Pose Risks to Bitcoin Despite Bitcoin’s impressive rally, external macroeconomic factors could limit further upside. Trump reaffirmed 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports and imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, escalating global trade tensions. These developments strengthened the US dollar, making risk assets like Bitcoin more vulnerable to corrections. US President Donald Trump confirms that his administration plans to implement tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico from 2 April.

Core PCE, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, slowed to 2.6% from 2.9% in December. While the data aligned with expectations, it reinforced the likelihood of the Fed keeping interest rates steady, a factor that could dampen BTC’s momentum. Key Takeaways: Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China intensified global trade tensions. US PCE inflation slowed, with core PCE dropping to 2.6%, keeping rate cuts uncertain. Fed’s hawkish stance could slow Bitcoin’s rally, impacting its long-term trajectory. Bitcoin Rebounds as Experts Predict Key Support at $77K Bitcoin’s recent dip below $83,000 triggered short-term panic, with fears of a potential drop to $70,000. However, BTC quickly rebounded by over 4%, climbing back above $86,000. According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, Bitcoin is at a critical bull-bear boundary. He believes BTC’s bullish cycle will extend until April 2025, following its two-year market pattern. If demand remains strong, Bitcoin could continue higher, but weak buying pressure could drag prices lower toward $77,000 support. Bitcoin Climbs 4% as CryptoQuant CEO Dismisses Market Crash Speculation https://t.co/DDwdB3WBvl — Jestin Jibber © (@JestinJibber) March 1, 2025 Analysts also warn that Trump’s trade tariffs on European goods could increase market volatility, making Bitcoin’s rally less predictable in the coming weeks. Traders are advised to remain cautious, especially with leveraged positions. Key Takeaways: BTC rebounded 4% to $86,000 after briefly falling below $83,000. CryptoQuant CEO expects BTC to remain bullish until April 2025, with $77K as strong support. Market volatility remains high due to Trump’s tariffs on European imports Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook – March 1, 2025 Bitcoin is currently trading at $85,400, showing a 0.8% gain after hitting lows near $82,200. The 2-hour chart indicates BTC is testing key resistance at $86,500, aligning with both the descending trendline and the 50-period EMA ($86,000). If BTC breaks above $86,500, it could target $89,400 in the short term. However, failure to clear resistance may trigger another decline, with $82,200 acting as immediate support. A rejection at current levels could reinforce bearish momentum, potentially dragging BTC toward $78,100 or even $74,000. Bitcoin’s rally is fueled by Trump’s Crypto Summit announcement, but macro risks like trade tensions and Fed policy remain obstacles. Investors should watch $86,500 resistance closely—if BTC clears it, the next leg higher could take prices toward $89,400. However, failure to break out may lead to renewed downside pressure.

With the market facing uncertainty, many are shifting their focus to alternative investments with higher growth potential. One project gaining traction among investors is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi lending platform offering real financial utility. MUTM’s presale has already drawn thousands of investors, with its decentralized lending model providing a sustainable use case beyond speculation. Currently priced at just $0.015, early buyers see an opportunity to secure tokens before its expected surge post-launch. As Bitcoin whales look for fresh investment opportunities, many are betting on MUTM’s long-term potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Many big investors are diversifying their holdings in search of alternatives with high long-term potential as a result of the growing selling pressure on Bitcoin. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gained attention as a result of this change since it delivers more than simply speculation; its decentralized lending and borrowing approach gives real financial benefits. In contrast to conventional cryptocurrency investments, MUTM’s liquidity pools enable users to lend and provide assets while generating passive income. By guaranteeing constant demand, this approach gives the token a structured value as opposed to one that is solely determined by the market. Mutuum Finance is becoming a more popular option for investors that value stability and long-term profits over volatile assets like Bitcoin. The presale phase has been a major success, with over 3,050 holders and $1.54 million raised in a short period. The second phase is already 26% complete within 96 hours, signaling strong demand. Investors are buying in at $0.015 per token, knowing that the launch price is set at $0.06, already offering an automatic 4x return before it even hits exchanges. However, experts predict a much higher surge, with some expecting MUTM to climb to $1 or beyond, delivering over 65x gains. Why investors are Turning to MUTM Beyond the growing presale interest, investors are drawn to the platform’s real-world financial use case. Mutuum Finance enables users to access liquidity without selling their assets. Those who need funds can use their holdings as collateral, borrowing stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies while maintaining ownership of their original assets. This is particularly attractive to long-term holders who want liquidity without exiting the market. On the other side, suppliers who deposit assets like ETH or DAI into the protocol’s lending pools earn passive income based on the demand for borrowing. This model ensures a self-sustaining ecosystem, where both borrowers and suppliers contribute to the token’s utility. Adding to its long-term value, Mutuum Finance will introduce an overcollateralized stablecoin, further reinforcing its lending protocol. This stablecoin will be minted when users provide collateral, maintaining a decentralized and transparent value system without relying on centralized entities. With the presale progressing rapidly, early investors are securing MUTM at its lowest price before the next phase increases costs. If an investor invests $2,000 now, their holdings will automatically increase to $8,000 after launch; if prices continue to rise, this might reach $40,000 or higher, contingent on post-listing performance. Investors who participate in the presale have the opportunity to win MUTM tokens as part of Mutuum Finance’s $100,000 offer. The goal of this campaign is to encourage further involvement with the project while rewarding early backers. The official website has all the information on how to enter, and winners will be chosen according to certain standards. As Bitcoin whales shift their focus to promising DeFi projects, Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the most compelling investment opportunities of 2025.

Investors pulling out of crypto at an alarming pace,https://finbold.com/start-of-bear-market-investors-pulling-out-of-crypto-at-an-alarming-pace/,"While the cryptocurrency market is witnessing bearish sentiment, capital movement trends suggest more cause for concern, as investors appear to be becoming skeptical in the long term. Specifically, for the week ending February 26, cryptocurrency funds experienced a $2.6 billion outflow, marking the largest withdrawal on record, according to data shared by financial markets commentary platform The Kobeissi Letter in an X post on February 28. This outflow surpassed the previous record of $2.1 billion, set at the end of last year, by approximately $500 million. The sharp decline in investor confidence was particularly evident on February 25, when Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds ( ETFs ) saw a record single-day withdrawal of $1 billion, further exacerbating concerns about the market’s stability.

Bitcoin’s worst monthly close Adding to the bearish outlook, Bitcoin ( BTC ) plunged about 20% in February, suffering its worst monthly close since June 2022. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

However, BTC remains red on the weekly chart, down over 11%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Despite the short-term recovery, Bitcoin’s technical outlook presents a concerning picture. According to an analysis shared by cryptocurrency analyst Crypto Rover in an X post on February 28, the latest market conditions suggest that Bitcoin is more oversold than during the FTX collapse in late 2022, when BTC plummeted to $16,000. To this end, Bitcoin’s 90-day market and realized price gradient oscillator indicate that the current oversold reading is deeper than any point in the last five years, including the FTX-induced crash.

Possible shift in Bitcoin sentiment Looking forward, cryptocurrency on-chain analytics platform Santiment suggests a possible shift in market expectations. In an analysis shared on February 28, the platform stated that Bitcoin’s latest price swings have made for one of the most emotional weeks in cryptocurrency since the August 5, 2024, crash. While fear and greed are running high, Santiment observed that a clear pattern has emerged: the crowd keeps misreading Bitcoin’s every move. Bitcoin’s social media sentiment. Source: Santiment Data indicates that traders’ social media predictions have been consistently off the mark. When optimism surges and mentions of $90,000 to $95,000 increase, Bitcoin’s price tends to drop. Conversely, when fear takes over and discussions of $70,000 to $75,000 spike, Bitcoin immediately begins to rise. This dynamic has repeatedly played out, with traders chasing breakouts at the wrong moments and panic-selling just before rebounds. Regarding the cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index, the reading stands at 20, signaling extreme fear as of March 1, 2025. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index.

Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett cleared the rumors that have been spreading that the U.S. SEC might be considering dropping its appeal against Ripple. Will it or Will Not? Legal Experts Weigh In on SEC’s Approach The speculation began after the SEC’s Crypto Task Force recently held a closed-door meeting with legal experts Jason Gottlieb, Andrew Hinkes, and J.W. Verret on 24 Feb 2025. They submitted a document discussing how the SEC regulates digital assets and highlighting key legal issues. One of the key topics in the document was the Ripple lawsuit. The experts noted that the SEC called some cryptocurrencies securities without clear court approval. They also pointed out that judges have not fully agreed with the SEC’s stance on crypto transactions. Specifically, the document mentioned Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling, which stated that XRP’s secondary sales those made by regular investors are not investment contracts. This goes against the SEC’s claims and weakens its argument in the case. SEC Not Dropping the Case After the SEC meeting, some members of the XRP community speculated that the agency was preparing to drop its appeal against Ripple. However, Eleanor Terrett quickly dismissed these claims. When asked about it, she responded with a firm “no”, rejecting the idea that the SEC is considering backing down. She even added a facepalm emoji, showing her frustration with the misleading rumors. No — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) February 28, 2025 Current Status of the Lawsuit As of now, there is no official word that the SEC plans to drop its case against Ripple. Although the commission has withdrawn other crypto-related lawsuits, its fight against Ripple remains active. As of now, there is no confirmation that the SEC plans to drop its case against Ripple. Although the commission has withdrawn other crypto-related lawsuits, its fight against Ripple remains active. If the SEC were to drop its appeal, it would require further legal discussions with Judge Torres. For now, the case continues, leaving the crypto community watching closely. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While they continue battling for dominance in the altcoin market, traders are hyping Mutuum Finance (MUTM) instead. The new project is currently in Phase 2 of its presale at a price of $0.015. Early investors stand to gain a 300% return, as MUTM is projected to launch at $0.06. The project has seen remarkable growth, surpassing $1.6 million in funds raised and attracting over 3,100 holders in an unprecedented timeframe. Unlike XRP and SOL, which have already made big moves, MUTM is just getting started, giving investors a shot at getting in before the hype kicks in. Solana and XRP: navigating market challenges Solana (SOL) and Ripple’s XRP are two top performers in the market and both are facing challenges. Solana, known for being fast and cheap to use, has seen its price drop over 50% since January 2025 peaks. On the other hand, XRP is stuck in a legal fight with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over whether it should be considered a security, which has made some investors nervous. While Solana deals with price swings, XRP faces legal troubles, showing how different issues can affect cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance: the next big player in DeFi lending Mutuum Finance is changing the decentralized lending game with a dual-lending system that combines both the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model uses smart contracts to control the lending pools so that users can put their stablecoins like USDT into the pool and the borrowers can take crypto-backed loans using assets like ETH. On the other hand, the P2P model removes the intermediaries between the lenders and borrowers to enable them to come up with their loan agreements. This hybrid strategy improves the security, adaptability, and profitability of the platform, which enables liquidity providers to get up to 10% APY. Mutuum Finance is building a financial ecosystem for lenders and borrowers. By avoiding the middlemen, the platform reduces the costs of borrowing and increases the returns on the liquidity providers. With near-instant transactions, full visibility, and empowerment of users, Mutuum Finance is establishing itself as a new standard in decentralized finance. Security, stability, & long-term growth Security and transparency are the key principles of Mutuum Finance. The platform is set for third party audits and features open source smart contracts, enhancing reliability. Mutuum Finance is also preparing to launch a USD pegged stablecoin and a buyback policy using the platform’s fees to support the price increase. Advanced risk management protocols add another layer of protection, combining audited smart contracts with an innovative lending framework. This makes Mutuum Finance an attractive choice for both institutional and retail investors seeking stable, high-yield DeFi opportunities. Momentum is building fast, with more than 3,100 investors already on board. An unmatched opportunity for early investors Mutuum Finance’s presale is currently in Phase 2, offering a rare chance to secure MUTM tokens at $0.015 before the price gradually increases through 11 presale stages, reaching $0.06 at launch. Investors in this phase are positioned for a 300% return before the token even hits public trading. Analysts predict that MUTM could surpass $5 post-launch, making it one of the most promising DeFi tokens of 2025. Those who joined in Phase 1 have already locked in a 50% gain, with the total amount raised surpassing $1.6 million. $100,000 giveaway & community incentives To accelerate adoption and reward early supporters, Mutuum Finance is giving away $100,000 in MUTM tokens. Ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000, with additional rewards available through a referral program that encourages users to bring in new investors and grow the community organically. While market giants like Solana and XRP lose momentum at the top, a newcomer, Mutuum Finance, is quickly gaining. Joining the Mutuum Finance presale now, allows you to get in at the cheapest available price and position yourself for life-changing returns during the upcoming bull run. Invest now in phase 2 before a 33.33% price increase in the next one.

February 2025 has etched itself into the history books for all the wrong reasons. Imagine a month where the crypto world reels from a staggering wave of cyberattacks, leaving investors and platforms in disarray. That’s precisely what happened, according to a recent report from the renowned blockchain security firm, PeckShield. Let’s dive into the chilling details of this record-breaking month and understand the implications for the future of cryptocurrency security. Why Did February 2025 Become the Month of Crypto Hack Mayhem? PeckShield, a leading authority in blockchain security, dropped a bombshell report via their PeckShieldAlert X account, revealing that February 2025 witnessed an unprecedented surge in crypto hack incidents. The numbers are frankly staggering: a total of 20 separate attacks resulted in a jaw-dropping $1.51 billion in cryptocurrency losses . This makes February 2025 the most financially devastating month ever recorded in the crypto industry’s history. But what fueled this alarming spike? Was it a coordinated attack, or a series of unfortunate vulnerabilities exploited in quick succession? Let’s break down the key factors contributing to this crisis: Increased Sophistication of Attacks: Cybercriminals are constantly evolving their tactics. February may have seen the emergence of more sophisticated attack vectors, bypassing existing security measures. Exploitation of DeFi Vulnerabilities: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms, while innovative, are often targeted due to the complexity of smart contracts and potential coding flaws. February could have seen a concentration of exploits targeting these vulnerabilities. Human Error: Despite advanced technology, human error remains a significant vulnerability. Phishing attacks, social engineering, and insider threats can all contribute to security breaches. Market Conditions: While not directly causal, volatile market conditions can sometimes create an environment where attackers see increased opportunity, or where security protocols are inadvertently relaxed in the pursuit of rapid gains. While the exact reasons are still under investigation, the sheer scale of the losses demands a serious re-evaluation of blockchain security practices across the industry. The Bybit Breach: A Colossal $1.43 Billion Loss At the heart of this devastating month lies one colossal breach that dwarfs all others: the Bybit hack . PeckShield’s report pinpoints Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, as the victim of the largest single attack, resulting in a staggering $1.43 billion loss. To put this into perspective, the Bybit breach alone accounts for over 94% of the total losses in February! This incident is not just a headline; it’s a seismic event that sends shockwaves through the crypto community. Consider the magnitude: The sheer size of the cryptocurrency losses from the Bybit attack raises serious questions about security protocols at even established exchanges. While details of the attack are likely still emerging, it underscores the immense risks involved in holding and trading digital assets. The impact on Bybit users and the platform’s reputation will undoubtedly be significant. Beyond Bybit: Other Notable Crypto Hacks in February 2025 While the Bybit breach dominated the headlines, February 2025 also saw a series of other significant crypto hack incidents, contributing to the overall record-breaking losses. PeckShield report highlighted several other notable attacks, including: Infini: Suffering losses of $49.5 million. zkLend: Experiencing a breach resulting in $9.66 million in losses. Ionic: Falling victim to an attack with $8.6 million stolen. sujiYan: Reporting losses of $4 million. These incidents, while smaller in scale compared to the Bybit behemoth, collectively paint a grim picture of the heightened security risks in the crypto space during February 2025. The table below summarizes the top 5 hacks reported by PeckShield: Platform Losses (USD) Bybit $1.43 Billion Infini $49.5 Million zkLend $9.66 Million Ionic $8.6 Million sujiYan $4 Million What Can Be Done to Fortify Blockchain Security? The February 2025 crypto hack statistics serve as a harsh wake-up call for the entire cryptocurrency industry. So, what steps can be taken to prevent such devastating losses in the future and strengthen blockchain security ? Here are some crucial areas to focus on: Enhanced Security Audits: Regular and rigorous security audits of smart contracts, exchange platforms, and all crypto-related systems are paramount. These audits should be conducted by reputable third-party firms with expertise in blockchain security. Advanced Threat Detection and Prevention Systems: Implementing sophisticated intrusion detection and prevention systems, utilizing AI and machine learning, can help identify and neutralize threats in real-time. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Robust Access Controls: Strong authentication measures, including MFA, and strict access controls are essential to protect user accounts and sensitive data. Community Vigilance and Information Sharing: A proactive and collaborative approach within the crypto community is crucial. Sharing threat intelligence, reporting suspicious activity, and educating users about security best practices can create a more resilient ecosystem. Regulatory Scrutiny and Standards: Increased regulatory oversight and the establishment of clear security standards for cryptocurrency platforms can drive greater accountability and incentivize stronger security measures. Addressing cryptocurrency losses of this magnitude requires a multi-faceted approach, combining technological advancements, improved security protocols, community collaboration, and potentially regulatory frameworks. Conclusion: A Call for Heightened Vigilance in the Crypto World February 2025 will be remembered as a watershed moment in the cryptocurrency industry, but for all the wrong reasons. The record-breaking $1.51 billion in losses due to crypto hack incidents, spearheaded by the colossal Bybit breach, underscores the ever-present and evolving threats in the digital asset space. This alarming report from PeckShield should serve as a stark reminder to investors, platforms, and developers alike: security cannot be an afterthought; it must be the bedrock of the crypto ecosystem. The future of cryptocurrency adoption hinges on building trust and confidence, and that starts with robust and unwavering commitment to security. Let February 2025 be the catalyst for a new era of heightened vigilance and proactive security measures in the crypto world, ensuring that such devastating losses are not repeated.

The individual, Olumide Osunkoya, was alleged to have carried out his services in the United Kingdom between 2021 and 2022. In the ruling delivered by Judge Gregory Perrins at the Southwark Crown Court, Osunkoya will serve a jail term of four years for violating regulatory orders. The sentencing follows a plea made by Osunkoya in September 2024, where he pleaded guilty to the allegations against him. According to the authorities, he was charged with five offenses, with two offenses as the director of GidiPlus Ltd, and as a sole trader. According to authorities, the 46-year-old Osunkoya carried out his crypto ATM services between December 2021 and March 2022 across 28 different locations in the United Kingdom. He operated the machines under his company, GidiPlus, despite not being registered and recognized as a legal crypto ATM service provider. The company applied for registration in 2020 and was refused in 2021. Illegal crypto ATM operator bags four-year jail term In the statement released by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Osunkoya carried on with his services despite being refused registration, making his activity a crime under federal law. After his first warning, he transferred the machines from GidiPlus Ltd, operating a reduced 12 ATMs personally. The authorities mentioned that the machines and the business were created under a false name to evade detection. According to the United Kingdom authorities, Osunkoya failed to carry out standard checks to ensure that the machines were not being used by criminal elements in the crypto industry. The authorities mentioned that the rate at which criminals used the crypto ATMs to launder proceeds of crimes was alarming. Authorities mentioned that he used fake bank statements to pass the wealth checks of a crypto asset manager. He also attempted to use one of his fake names to incorporate a company in the United Kingdom. He was also charged with possession of criminal property, with regulators seizing £19,540 as proceeds from operating the illegal ATMs. The FCA added that he charged fees ranging from 30% to 60% on each transaction. In the hearing, Osunkoya was also charged with forgery, using false names and identity documents to carry out his illegal activities. The regulators also charged him with possession of criminal property. During the hearing, the FCA asked the court to approve confiscation proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act of 2002. The proceedings will seize all financial benefits he enjoyed during the span of his illegal activities. United Kingdom’s FCA warns about the dangers in the crypto industry According to reports, this is the first prosecution for an unregistered crypto activity in the United Kingdom. The prosecution is coming after efforts by the FCA, in partnership with law enforcement agencies, to remove illegal crypto ATMs at different locations in the United Kingdom. In 2023, the FCA recorded great success, removing 30 machines from 38 locations in the United Kingdom. According to a CoinATMRadar report, the number of crypto ATMs advertised in the United Kingdom has dropped from 80 in 2022 to none in 2024. The FCA still maintains its stance against crypto, warning the general public of the dangers of buying cryptocurrencies, and warning that they may lose all their funds in the process. The FCA has also published a list of suspected ATMs operating in the country without approval on its website. During Osunkoya’s sentencing, the Judge mentioned that it was not only a regulatory issue, because Osunkoya violated federal law by using a false identity to conceal his real identity. The judge also added that his actions were deliberate and carefully thought out due to the technicality of the plan and how he carried out his activities. FCA enforcement officer, Therese Chambers, also noted the impact of the prosecution, noting that it will send a clear message to other individuals carrying out illegal acts.

Once valued at $32 billion, FTX’s downfall was attributed to allegations of misusing customer funds to support its affiliated trading firm, Alameda Research. This led to a liquidity crisis, preventing customers from accessing their assets and culminating in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Initiation of Creditor Repayments In February 2025, FTX began its first round of creditor repayments, with a second round scheduled for later in the year. Creditors eligible for the next phase must verify their claims before receiving payments. Under the exchange’s recovery plan, the majority of affected users are expected to receive more than 100% of their claims in cash. Industry Reactions and Expert Opinions Industry analysts believe that the two-year repayment timeline, despite initial frustration, should be viewed as a positive outcome. Many had anticipated a much longer legal battle due to the complexities involved, including multiple jurisdictions, regulatory barriers, and legal negotiations. Challenges in the Repayment Process FTX’s multinational operations complicated the repayment process, requiring coordination across various legal systems. These jurisdictional challenges added layers of complexity, making the relatively swift resolution surprising to many. Impact on Creditors and Market Sentiment The repayment process has offered some relief to creditors and is seen as a step toward restoring confidence in the crypto industry. The ability to distribute funds relatively quickly, despite the scale of the collapse, demonstrates a level of accountability that is often lacking in similar cases. Lessons Learned and Future Implications The downfall of FTX has underscored the importance of transparency, regulatory oversight, and proper risk management for cryptocurrency exchanges. These developments could pave the way for stronger industry regulations and increased scrutiny over centralized platforms. While the collapse was a significant blow, the expedited repayment process is being regarded as a sign that structured recovery efforts can yield positive results in the face of financial disasters.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-01 10:40:00

As Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) is one of the largest U.S.-based crypto exchanges, its performance is affected by the performance of digital assets. As the market plummeted heavily, the COIN price declined. But how much further can it drop? Let’s discuss this. Crypto Market Plunge Drags Coinbase Stock Price Down Coinbase stock price is experiencing a sharp decline due to the broader crypto market crash. As the market cap of digital assets plummeted to $2.81 trillion from its earlier peak of $3.5 trillion, this exchange’s valuation was also affected. At the time of reporting, COIN stock trades at $215.64, having declined 10% over the last five days. Although the stock is recovering today (3.49% up), the fear of a further crash remains, as the stock’s overall movement shows further weakness. Coinbase Stock Price: Broader Stock Market Turbulence Amplifies Pressure Interestingly, along with the decline in the COIN stock price, the rest of the stock market is experiencing turbulence . The technology sector, especially the one linked to the crypto market, shows signs of instability. More importantly, high interest rates and regulatory uncertainty add a burden. Blind, an analytics platform, pointed out the downtrend in Tesla, Coinbase, Salesforce, and other stocks. However, the worrisome part is that these stocks have lost trillions of dollars in valuation over the last two months, generating fearful sentiments about the stock market’s downtrend. As it has not been long since the recent Stock market crash, the downtrend in COIN stock price and others are concerning. How Low Can COIN Stock Price Go? The COIN stock price has historically shown high volatility, with its year’s high being $298.22 in the middle of February 2025. Considering this performance, some analysts anticipated the COIN stock would hit $500 , but the cryptos’ downtrend brought a different outcome. If the crypto market correction deepens, the stock’s value might face additional pressure. However, other than that, analysts reveal that it has recently broken out of a symmetrical triangle, which could result in a massive decline to as low as $177. According to Ali Martinez , COIN could test its $170-$180 range, with its moving out of the summetrical triangle pattern. Adding this to the broader market selloff could push the stock even lower, potentially revisiting its 2023 low. However, if the crypto market recovers and gains bullish momentum, the COIN stock price might regain momentum, finding stability above $250. Conclusion Coinbase’s stock fate remains intertwined with the crypto market. However, regulatory clarity, such as the US SEC dropping the Coinbase lawsuit, and other macroeconomic factors are helping with the recovery. If the recovery stays maintained and results in strong uptrends, the Coinbase stock price might hit $250. In contrast, it might crash to $177.

Having experienced firsthand the thrill of investing in meme coins, I can tell you it’s not all about hype. One rising star in the crypto world is Dawgz AI , an innovative project using powerful trading bots to help investors maximize their returns. By leveraging Ethereum, Dawgz AI offers a fresh opportunity to capitalize on crypto growth, potentially outpacing Dogecoin as a serious investment. The future of meme coins might be more strategic than we thought! The Rise of Dogecoin: A Meme Coin’s Journey Dogecoin's price began its journey as a fun, meme-driven project, based on the Doge meme. At first, it seemed like just another joke in the crypto market, but something unexpected happened: Dogecoin caught the attention of both the crypto community and investors. Thanks to its low price and massive online following, Dogecoin surged in value, leading to explosive trading volume and growth. In recent years, Dogecoin's doge price has fluctuated wildly. From hitting a peak price during the 2021 bull run to experiencing major dips, Dogecoin's price history has been nothing short of dramatic. Despite its ups and downs, Dogecoin's market cap has grown significantly, and its influence in the meme coin world remains strong. Dogecoin’s Current Market Impact At the time of writing, Dogecoin's price continues to show resilience, with market analysts predicting further potential for growth. The current price of Dogecoin, while not at its peak price, still holds a solid place in the market, especially among meme coins. The trading volume remains high, indicating active trading and interest in Dogecoin. Many experts have weighed in on the Dogecoin forecast, and there’s a mixed outlook. Some predict steady growth, while others believe Dogecoin's price will experience volatility. Regardless, Dogecoin's doge price will likely be influenced by community engagement, market trends, and the growing crypto market interest in meme coins. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Can It Keep Up? When looking at Dogecoin price predictions, it’s important to consider market capitalization, trading volume, and historical performance. Dogecoin's price has been heavily impacted by social media trends and celebrity endorsements, so it’s no surprise that it’s often seen as an unpredictable asset. That said, many market analysts believe Dogecoin could see further growth in the next crypto bull run. Some estimates predict Dogecoin's doge price could increase significantly, but reaching the maximum value seen in previous years may be a stretch. For example, Dogecoin price predictions vary, with minimum and maximum prices for the coin ranging from conservative to more optimistic forecasts. Dogecoin's price could rise again, but it’s important to note that much of this potential hinges on the overall crypto market performance. What Affects Dogecoin’s Price? The Dogecoin price prediction hinges on several factors: Community Engagement: Dogecoin thrives on its vibrant community. If the community stays active and engaged, it could help Dogecoin's price grow. Meme Culture Influence: Meme coins like Dogecoin are heavily driven by internet culture. The hype around these coins plays a massive role in driving price action. Crypto Market Trends: The overall performance of the crypto market will play a significant role. If the market experiences a surge, Dogecoin's doge price could follow suit.

The Dogecoin price prediction for 2025 shows potential for steady growth, with market analysts suggesting a bullish sentiment depending on the overall crypto market performance. While Dogecoin's doge price could see price increases, it’s unlikely to reach its peak price from the past. Based on technical analysis, Dogecoin's price could experience fluctuations, but predictions vary. The market capitalization and circulating supply are pivotal in determining Dogecoin price movements, and own research is always crucial when making investment decisions. Can DOGE reach $10? Reaching $10 for Dogecoin seems unlikely, given its current price and market capitalization. Although the price of Dogecoin has seen impressive growth in the past, the minimum and maximum prices indicate a significant challenge for Dogecoin doge to hit that level. The maximum value Dogecoin has reached so far is well below $10, and considering the trading volume and market dynamics, the highest price is projected to stay much lower than that. However, price prediction models still see room for price increases in the future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? The price of Dogecoin fluctuates, so the value of $500 in Dogecoin doge depends on the current price. For instance, if the average price of Dogecoin is $0.05, $500 would buy you around 10,000 Dogecoin coins. As Dogecoin’s price can experience fluctuations, especially influenced by social media buzz or meme coin hype, checking the latest data before making a move is essential. Use technical analysis to forecast price action trends, but always remember that future results can be uncertain. Is Dogecoin projected to skyrocket? While Dogecoin's price could see price increases, it’s important to note that a skyrocket is uncertain. Market analysts predict that the doge price prediction will likely follow trends influenced by community involvement, social media buzz, and overall crypto market activity. As for the doge price forecast, some predict moderate growth, but reaching past peak price levels is challenging. With a bullish sentiment in the market, Dogecoin's doge price may grow, but for explosive growth, coins with more strategic potential ROI, like Dawgz AI, might be a better bet for investment decisions.

I’ve dabbled in a variety of coins, and from my experience, I can confidently say that Dawgz AI presents a more strategic and reliable opportunity. Unlike Shiba Inu, which often fluctuates based on trends and hype, Dawgz AI is powered by innovative trading bots that maximize ROI. With Ethereum at its core, Dawgz AI offers a way to engage with the crypto market without relying solely on speculation. It’s a smart bet for long-term growth. Next Crypto Bull Run: Why This Coin Might Be the Best Bet for Explosive Growth As the next crypto bull run looms closer, many investors are turning their eyes to the meme coin market. One such coin that has caught attention is Shiba Inu. However, as the Shiba Inu price prediction remains uncertain, a fresh competitor is positioning itself for explosive growth. Enter Dawgz AI - a new project with the potential to outpace Shiba Inu and other coins during the upcoming surge. The Rise of Shiba Inu: A Meme Coin’s Journey Shiba Inu began its journey as a meme coin, often compared to Dogecoin due to its internet meme origins. However, Shiba Inu's price quickly gained momentum, and it soon attracted a massive following. What initially started as a joke quickly became a serious player in the crypto market. Its popularity skyrocketed with the help of social media buzz, and its market capitalization expanded significantly. In fact, Shiba Inu’s price movements during the 2021 bull run were nothing short of impressive. With its average price seeing exponential growth, Shiba Inu's price reached a new peak price that stunned many in the crypto community. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Can It Keep Up? Looking at Shiba Inu’s price prediction, it’s clear that the future is uncertain. According to Shiba Inu's price forecast, many analysts expect moderate growth, but Shiba Inu’s rise to new all-time highs seems unlikely without a major market catalyst. A minimum Shiba price has been suggested in some forecasts, with analysts pointing out that Shiba Inu’s price might stabilize in the coming months. Several factors influence Shiba Inu’s price movements. The Shiba Inu coin relies heavily on its community and social media trends, so any major news or viral moments can push Shiba Inu’s price upward. Dawgz AI, on the other hand, provides a more structured approach to investing, using advanced technical analysis and trading bots to capitalize on market fluctuations. This is where Dawgz AI stands out. Dawgz AI: The Rising Star Ready to Outshine Meme Coins Dawgz AI is not just another meme coin - it’s an investment opportunity designed for long-term growth. Unlike Shiba Inu, which is largely driven by community hype, Dawgz AI leverages cutting-edge technology, including AI-powered trading bots, to enhance Ethereum-based investments. This gives it a strategic edge over coins like Shiba Inu, which often rise and fall based on social media buzz.

Why Dawgz AI is the Superior Choice While Shiba Inu has been a leader in the meme coin space, its reliance on community engagement and market hype makes it a risky investment. Dawgz AI, on the other hand, is built for long-term growth through AI-powered trading and Ethereum integration. Conclusion While Shiba Inu’s Shib price and Shiba Inu price prediction have gained traction in the crypto space, Dawgz AI stands out as the next big cryptocurrency for long-term growth. From my personal experience, Dawgz AI offers a more reliable investment opportunity. Unlike speculative coins like Shiba Inu, which rely on market cap and community hype, Dawgz AI uses advanced trading strategies that are backed by technical analysis. With its market cap steadily growing, Dawgz AI is primed for explosive growth, making it the better bet for anyone looking for serious, sustainable returns. FAQ How much will Shiba Inu be worth in 2025? The Shiba Inu price prediction for 2025 suggests it could see significant growth, but reaching new highs depends on market trends and trading volume. Analysts predict moderate growth, with some expecting it to follow a bullish trend, but factors like resistance and the overall crypto market could impact its price. Will Shiba Inu coin reach 25 cents? Reaching 25 cents for Shiba Inu coin seems highly unlikely due to its market cap and circulating supply. While Shiba Inu’s price might experience price increases, it would require extraordinary demand to hit this level. The potential ROI is more likely to be modest, with Shiba Inu's price constrained by various factors like resistance and market trends. Will Shiba hit $1 in 2040? While it’s difficult to predict the future, Shiba Inu hitting $1 in 2040 would require unprecedented demand and a significant growth in market capitalization. This would depend on the broader crypto market’s adoption and the growth of the Shiba Inu token’s use case. What is a realistic price prediction for Shiba Inu in 2050? A realistic price prediction for Shiba Inu in 2050 depends on the evolution of digital assets and Shiba Inu's price action. With long term forecast models, it’s hard to predict beyond the next few decades, but Shiba Inu could potentially see steady growth if it continues to gain adoption.

As the anticipation builds around this summit and the impact it will have on crypto prices, savvy investors are looking for altcoins that could deliver 100x returns. In this article, we identify the top 4 US altcoins that you can buy today for massive gains ahead of this event. US Altcoins to Buy Ahead of White House Crypto Summit White House crypto czar David Sacks has announced that President Trump will host a crypto summit at the White House on March 7. President Trump will speak at this summit where prominent crypto founders, executives, and investors will be in attendance. Per the statement, members of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets will also attend the summit. This meeting will deepen the ties between Trump and the crypto industry, which he promised to support during last year’s campaign trail. White House Crypto Summit This development has stirred excitement within the crypto community. Analyst Crypto Patel believes that it “could be a game changer for the crypto industry.” Additionally, BitWise co-founder Matt Hougan noted that it adds to the positive developments happening in the US crypto environment that will benefit US altcoins. As the crypto community eagerly awaits this summit, below are the top 4 US altcoins you can buy. Ripple (XRP) Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is likely to be among the crypto executives who will attend this summit. Garlinghouse has previously met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, raising speculation about Elon Musk picking Ripple for US national debt repayment . The XRP price has also bounced from its critical support of $2. The price is still trading above the 200-day EMA and the Chaikin Money Flow shows buying pressure is strong. If Ripple sustains a rally above this support, the US altcoin could support a breakout toward the resistance levels of $2.45 and $3.40. Solana (SOL) Solana price, at press time, had outperformed the other top altcoins with a 10% gain. The altcoin shows a strong outlook despite a $1.8B SOL unlock happening this week that could drive selling activity. Solana is breaking the midline of the descending parallel channel, suggesting a possible bullish reversal. The ADX is also falling showing weakening bearish momentum. If buyers step in now, and SOL breaks out of this trendline, it may aid a recovery to resistance at $206, making it one of the top US altcoins to buy. SOL/USDT: 1-day Chart Dogecoin (DOGE) Speculation is rife that Dogecoin price could hit $10 this cycle . One of the factors that could drive this rally is the recent move by the SEC to declare that meme coins are collectibles and not securities. The DOGE Awesome Oscillator shows a bullish divergence, and the price has bounced from support. If this US altcoin flips the 200-day EMA, it could resume the uptrend to the 123.6% Fibonacci level of $0.55. DOGE/USDT: 1-day Chart Cardano (ADA) Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson might also be among the executives that will attend the White House crypto summit, boding well for the altcoin’s price. Buyers are already reentering the market, with the RSI tipping north. This supports a bullish Cardano price prediction that could lead to a rally to the 178.6 Fibonacci level of $1.97. ADA/USDT: 1-day Chart Why Are These The Best US Altcoins to Buy For 100x Gains Ripple, Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin can rally 100x this week amid speculation about the crypto summit. These are US-based coins and some executives and representatives from their ecosystems might attend this summit. As speculation around this summit grows, these 4 altcoins are a good pick for crypto traders.

Whether you’re after a triple-double ROI or just looking to ride the next big wave, this is where the smart money’s heading. Solana might be making moves, but in a market where speed, efficiency, and insane returns matter, $DAGZ is leading the pack. Are you ready to level up your portfolio? Solana’s Market Position & Price Prediction Solana has been one of the fastest-growing blockchains, gaining attention for its ability to process thousands of transactions per second. It’s often positioned as a strong competitor to Ethereum, thanks to its scalability and low transaction costs. Solana’s Strengths Solana’s speed is its biggest advantage. The Solana blockchain can handle around 65,000 transactions per second, making it far faster than Ethereum. It also has significantly lower fees, making it a favorite among developers and traders. The Solana ecosystem has also grown rapidly, attracting NFT projects, DeFi applications, and institutional investors. With its strong development team and expanding network, it remains a dominant force in the crypto space. Solana Price Forecast: What Analysts Expect The solana price prediction has been mixed, with some analysts expecting it to reach new highs, while others remain cautious due to market volatility. Technical analysis suggests that if market capitalization continues to grow, solana sol price prediction could show a steady upward trend. However, there are risks. The Solana forecast has also included concerns about price drops, especially after previous network outages. Dawgz AI: The Future of Crypto Investing While Solana has built a strong reputation, $DAGZ is offering something entirely different-a crypto ecosystem designed for both profitability and fun. Unlike Solana, which is purely a blockchain, $DAGZ is an investment-focused project that helps traders maximize returns using AI-powered automation. What is Dawgz AI? $DAGZ is a meme coin with real utility. For investors, this means they don’t have to spend hours studying charts or making emotional trading decisions - $ DAGZ does the work for them. A New Way to Invest: More Than Just a Blockchain Solana is great for developers, but $DAGZ is built for investors. Instead of just offering fast transactions, $DAGZ provides a complete profit-generating system with automated trading and staking rewards. While the Solana price forecast depends on adoption and market trends, $DAGZ’s profit potential is driven by AI trading and smart tokenomics. Staking & Passive Income: How Dawgz AI Rewards Holders One of the most attractive aspects of $DAGZ is its staking rewards. Unlike Solana, where staking returns can fluctuate, $DAGZ offers a stable, competitive APY for Ethereum holders. ETH Staking for Competitive APY Investors can stake their ETH and earn passive income, making $DAGZI an appealing choice for long-term holders. The staking rewards are designed to be sustainable, unlike Solana’s variable staking system. Tokenomics That Work for Investors Dawgz AI has a total supply of 8.888 billion tokens, with a well-structured distribution model: 30% allocated to presale 20% for staking rewards 10% for liquidity This ensures that investors are rewarded while maintaining long-term stability. In contrast, Solana’s supply is much larger, which can lead to more volatility and inflation in price. Solana vs. Dawgz AI: Who Wins in Staking? While Solana allows staking, its APY fluctuates based on network activity. In comparison, $DAGZ offers a clear, competitive staking model that provides predictable and sustainable returns. Presale Success & Market Potential Dawgz AI isn’t just an idea-it’s already gaining major traction in the market. Investors are recognizing its potential, as seen by its successful presale numbers. Over $2M Raised & Growing The project has already raised over $2 million, with the next goal set at $2.1 million. The momentum continues to build, signaling strong demand from early investors. Limited Supply = High Demand Unlike Solana, which has a high circulating supply, Dawgz AI has a hard-capped supply of 8.888 billion tokens. This scarcity creates higher demand, which can drive prices up as adoption increases. Why This Matters for Investors While Solana has already experienced its biggest growth phase, Dawgz AI is still in its early stages, meaning there’s more room for upside potential. Getting in early could mean higher returns compared to buying into an already established project like Solana. The Verdict: Which is the Better Long-Term Bet? Both Solana and Dawgz AI have their strengths, but which one is truly the better investment for the future? Solana is a Strong Blockchain, But… There’s no denying that Solana has made a name for itself in the crypto world. However, it faces challenges: Network outages and reliability issues Growing competition from Ethereum and other blockchains Uncertain price trends, making price prediction difficult Dawgz AI Offers More Than Just Transactions Dawgz AI isn’t just another blockchain-it’s a profit-driven ecosystem designed for traders and investors who want automated income, staking rewards, and strong tokenomics. While Solana price predictions depend on market conditions, Dawgz AI’s model is built for consistent profits through AI trading. Meme Coin with Real Utility = High Growth Potential Meme coins usually lack real-world applications, but Dawgz AI changes that by offering real AI-driven trading tools. This makes it a unique hybrid of meme culture and profitable investing-something no other project has successfully achieved at this scale. Conclusion Solana has had an impressive run, and its market cap remains strong. But when looking at long-term opportunities, Dawgz AI presents a more innovative and rewarding investment. For those seeking passive income, AI-powered trading, and strong tokenomics, Dawgz AI is the smarter bet. While Solana continues to fight for dominance in the blockchain space, Dawgz AI is offering a new way to invest-one that’s both profitable and fun. Frequently Asked Questions What price will Solana be worth in 2025? The expected price of Solana in 2025 varies depending on market trends and competition. Some analysts predict a range between $150 and $300, while others are more conservative due to past network issues. Solana Labs has made improvements, but with decentralized finance expanding, newer projects like Dawgz AI are stealing the spotlight. Can Sol reach $1000? While some believe Solana could hit $1000, it’s an expected price that relies on extreme market growth and perfect execution from the Solana team. With low transaction costs and a strong presence in smart contracts and Solana NFTs, it has potential, but competition is fierce. Instead of waiting for Solana’s growth to hit uncertain numbers, investing in a high-utility meme coin like $DAGZ could provide bigger and faster returns. How high can Solana go in 2025? Solana’s expected price in 2025 largely depends on market conditions and demand for its blockchain. Some estimates place it around $100 to $250, but this isn’t guaranteed. While Solana NFTs and smart contracts contribute to its value, $DAGZ is proving to be the more lucrative choice for investors. If you’re looking for real returns rather than speculation, Dawgz AI is the clear winner. Is Solana going to boom? Solana’s growth has been fueled by decentralized finance, smart contracts, and institutional backing, but it still struggles with network stability issues. Dawgz AI offers a more promising future, combining trading with staking rewards for maximum profitability. Instead of waiting for another Solana surge, investing in Dawgz AI now positions you ahead of the curve with higher potential gains and real-world utility.

As the pioneering BTC network, Bitlayer, announced at ETH Denver 2025 its key partnerships with five Blockchains, viz., Arbitrum, Statknet, Base, SonicSVM and Plume Network. The partnership aims to unlock Bitcoin’s $1.9 trillion liquidity by integrating it with these five major Blockchains through Bitlayer’s BitVM. The collaboration is set to work towards redefining the role of Bitcoin by bringing Bitcoin-powered smart contracts, interoperability, and decentralized finance (DeFi) similar to existing Ethereum. Bitlayer BitVM transforming the Passive role of BTC Historically, Bitcoin has been the most secure and decentralized blockchain, but its limited scripting language has prevented the development of advanced smart contracts. The off-chain computation framework, Bitlayer BitVM Bridge, seeks to change that by enabling Turing-complete smart contracts on Bitcoin without requiring protocol changes. Developed by Bitlayer, the BitVM Bridge – which is the core of these partnerships – is a trust-minimized Bitcoin bridge powered by the innovative BitVM smart contract framework. This technology facilitates secure and efficient transfers of Bitcoin ( BTC ) into various blockchain ecosystems, allowing BTC holders to engage directly with DeFi applications without relying on centralized intermediaries. Bitlayer’s Bitcoin Virtual Machine or BitVM enables Turing-complete smart contracts on Bitcoin and allows developers to build Ethereum-like dApps without changing Bitcoin’s protocol. It uses off-chain computation and fraud proofs to ensure security and efficiency.

Every partner in this partnership is set to play a key role, such as: The integration of Bitlayer BitVM bridge with Base will allow Bitcoin holders to utilize their assets across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains, enhancing Bitcoin’s liquidity within the DeFi ecosystem. 2. As one of the leading Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, Arbitrum will provide scalability and high-speed execution for BitVM-powered smart contracts and yBTC DeFi applications. Through the BitVM Bridge, Arbitrum users can bridge assets to and from Bitcoin under a trust-minimized framework, enriching Arbitrum’s DeFi landscape. 3. The integration with Starknet will offer Bitcoin users instant transactions with minimal fees in a secure environment, leveraging STARK proofs for enhanced security. 4. By integrating with Sonic , the first Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) chain, the BitVM bridge will be able to bring Bitcoin liquidity to Web3 applications, including gaming and social media platforms. 5. The collaboration with Plume Network , a Layer 1 blockchain focused on real-world assets (RWA), can unlock Bitcoin’s liquidity for institutional-grade financial products, bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology. It will enable native BTC to flow directly into its ecosystem to access real yields and RWA staking, bridging a new era of RWAfi and BTCfi together. Further, the integration of yBTC (Yield Bitcoin) into these networks will enhance Bitcoin’s utility. yBTC is a wrapped Bitcoin asset that allows BTC holders to participate in DeFi applications, lending protocols, and yield-generating opportunities while maintaining exposure to Bitcoin’s value. With this partnership, yBTC will be natively supported across multiple blockchain ecosystems, creating new liquidity and DeFi use cases. Estimated Market Impact of Bitlayer’s Bitcoin integration into Web3. With yBTC available across multiple networks, BTC holders can access lending, staking, and liquidity provision without relying on centralized intermediaries. Thus, the partnerships and collaborations are set to unlock new cases of Bitcoin while expanding its utility. As over $1 trillion of Bitcoin sits idle in wallets, the aimed efforts of Bitlayer alongwith the key Blockchain partners can significantly work towards transforming it into an active asset.

As the price starts to recover from the recent lows, some analysts consider the weekend might bring some bullish relief for investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Drop Coming? ETH Risks Fall To $2,180 If This Support Fails – Analyst Bitcoin Recovers From $78,000 Drop Bitcoin has experienced significant selling pressure over the last week, fueling doubts about a potential market top. The flagship crypto has dropped 21% from last week’s high of $99,000, dipping below the $80,000 level for the first time since November. The correction also saw BTC drop nearly 30% from its January all-time high (ATH) and trade below its post-US election price range. A week after the market bleeding started, Bitcoin hit a new three-month low, retesting the $78,000 support on Friday morning. Various market watchers noted that BTC’s most recent decline reached and partially filled its November 2024 CME Gap between $78,000 and $80,700. Rekt Capital pointed out that Bitcoin is experiencing a “strong rebound against the partially filled CME Gap and is doing so on above-average seller volume.” The flagship crypto has surged around 7% from today’s lows, hovering between the $83,000 and $84,000 support zone for the past few hours. To the analyst, the CME Gap support and sell-side volume will be two key indicators to pay attention to over the weekend as constant, uninterrupted BTC sell-side pressure is unsustainable, and seller exhaustion potentially accelerates in the next few days. Bitcoin is finally starting to experience above-average seller volume. There’s still scope for more seller volume to come in, but the chances of Seller Exhaustion occurring are increasing. And Seller Exhaustion tends to precede price reversals. Is A Weekend Rebound Coming? Crypto analyst Jelle highlighted that Bitcoin has done “three drives in deeply oversold territory” this week and is retesting the local lows before today’s drop, which suggests that a “weekend relief seems likely.” The analyst stated that reclaiming the $84,500 support is key for BTC’s recovery as “the past two retests ended up resulting in new lows.” Nonetheless, he noted that today’s rebound seems different due to BTC “touching the 200-ema cluster” for the first time this week and breaking above it. To Jelle, this could signal an “interesting weekend,” with the new CME Gap at $93,000 open. Rekt Capital pointed out that Bitcoin “has filled every CME Gap that has formed since mid-March 2024” and that only the newly formed CME Gap between $92,800 and $94,000 remains open after this retrace. If BTC continues this pattern, the price could see a rebound to fill the new gap soon.

The project is initiating a reward system to compensate active testnet contributors, with the beta launch set for March. These incentives aim to stimulate participation from developers, miners, and validators, especially given the strong interest shown by the sale of over 18.6 billion coins. The presale has already raised $199.5 million, and BlockDAG is steadily moving towards the $200 million milestone. Driving Network Stability: The Incentive Initiative During the AMA, the BlockDAG team underscored the necessity of incentivizing node operators to ensure a stable and secure network. A structured rewards system is being launched, targeting key contributors: Testnet Validators—Those running testnet nodes will receive compensation for verifying transactions and maintaining network integrity. Stakers—Those staking BDAG coins will earn rewards based on the duration and amount staked, fostering long-term involvement. Contributors: BlockDAG rewards developers, bug testers, and community members who actively participate in improving the testnet. These incentives are designed to attract a broad range of participants, from casual miners to blockchain developers testing smart contracts, and further drive the exciting speculative nature of the project. Building a Robust Foundation: Expanding the Validator Ecosystem BlockDAG’s aim is to establish a decentralized and efficient validator network. To achieve this, the project will introduce staking rewards and community-driven initiatives that allow validators to secure the blockchain while earning BDAG coins. These measures are expected to enhance the network’s security and resilience. Additionally, BlockDAG’s testnet program will include a structured beta-testing phase. Select users will be given early access to validate network performance under real-world conditions. Those running nodes during this phase will receive exclusive bonuses before the mainnet launch. The exciting speculative movements within the project are already driving increased participation. Recognizing Contributions: Rewarding Testers & Developers A significant highlight from the AMA was BlockDAG’s commitment to rewarding testers who identify vulnerabilities or optimize network performance. The company will introduce bug bounties and milestone-based incentives, allowing participants to earn rewards based on their contributions. Developers will also have access to grants and tools necessary to build decentralized applications on BlockDAG’s infrastructure. BlockDAG’s presale has seen considerable success, with over $199.5 million raised to date. The project is currently in Batch 27, with BDAG coins priced at $0.0248. Since the first batch, the coin price has increased by 2380%, reflecting strong public interest. Over 18.6 billion BDAG coins have already been sold, positioning the project as a significant player. This rapid growth, combined with the upcoming testnet incentives, highlights BlockDAG’s strategy to build a sustainable and engaged network before its official launch. Public participants are closely watching these developments, especially with the anticipated staking opportunities and validator rewards. The exciting speculative possibilities are driving much of this observation. Looking Ahead With the beta testnet launching in March, BlockDAG is laying the groundwork for a robust network powered by its community. The company’s incentive programs for validators, miners, and developers are designed to ensure a smooth transition to mainnet while strengthening long-term engagement. As BlockDAG moves closer to its mainnet release, participants can expect further announcements on staking mechanics, additional reward structures, and potential new exchange listings. The upcoming months will be crucial as the project continues to expand its ecosystem and attract more users to its decentralized infrastructure. For those looking to get involved, now is the time to explore BlockDAG’s testnet opportunities and secure their place in the network’s future.

The market tumbled 20.57%, dragging Bitcoin down 17.5%, Ethereum by 32.2%, and XRP by 29.3%. The worst of the crash came between February 24 and 26, when the market plunged 12.42% in just two days. Bitcoin followed suit, dropping 12.48%, weighed down by three consecutive red candlesticks. But here’s where things get interesting – XRP didn’t follow the exact same script. While it fell on February 24, it quickly bounced back the next day, showing signs of resilience. And in the past 24 hours, XRP has surged 8.4%, outpacing both Bitcoin and Ethereum. So, is XRP breaking free from the broader market downtrend? Could this be the start of a bigger rally? Let’s dive into what analysts are saying. Crypto Market Dips, But XRP Holds Strong Yesterday, the total crypto market cap dropped to $2.55 trillion, and Bitcoin briefly fell below $80,000. Meanwhile, XRP touched a low of $1.95 but managed to close above the $2 support level. At the start of today, XRP traded around $2.14, and it now stands at $2.19, up 2.33% from its opening price. Despite this recovery, analysts warn that a full rebound is still uncertain. Key Levels: Will XRP Rally or Consolidate? Crypto analyst Dom believes XRP must break above $2.20 to confirm a stronger rally. If it does, he predicts a rise to $2.40 or higher. He also points out that $2.20 is a key level—if XRP fails to move past it, the market could see more sideways movement. On the downside, if XRP loses the $2 support level, it may drop further. Dom also warns that if Bitcoin falls to $75,000, it could pull XRP down with it. https://twitter.com/traderview2/status/1895561674448396614 Key Levels to Watch Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlights a strong support level at $1.65, noting that XRP is still moving within an upward price channel that started last year. Meanwhile, Dark Defender believes XRP has already bottomed out. He points to a Fibonacci retracement level, suggesting XRP could now enter a fifth wave – a pattern that could push prices to $5 or even $8. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today: Signs Point to SEC Dropping Ripple Lawsuit Soon – Here’s Why , XRP is showing signs of strength despite the broader market dip, but its next move depends on key resistance and support levels.

The crypto world has seen explosive growth in community-driven tokens, and new contenders are shaking up the space. With Peanut the Squirrel making waves and Cheems securing fresh traction, a new challenger is emerging— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). Arctic Pablo Coin is already turning heads with its innovative presale strategy, unique token burn mechanism, and sky-high ROI potential. With its presale currently in the 12th phase at Penguinopolis, early investors have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to secure an entry at just $0.000067 before its anticipated launch at $0.008. This article will cover the latest updates and developments of Arctic Pablo Coin, Peanut the Squirrel, and Cheems. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Strategy: How Token Burns Boost Value A key factor in Arctic Pablo Coin’s sustainability is its aggressive token burn strategy, which directly impacts scarcity and value. Each week, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation during the presale, reducing supply and strengthening the coin’s long-term price potential. Moreover, any tokens left after the presale will also be burned, ensuring a deflationary model that benefits early adopters. This mechanism isn’t just about limiting supply—it’s about increasing investor confidence and fostering long-term sustainability. By continuously reducing available tokens, Arctic Pablo Coin is creating a scarcity-driven demand, which could significantly boost its price post-launch. With crypto enthusiasts constantly searching for the best meme coin investments, Arctic Pablo Coin’s burn strategy is setting it apart. Arctic pablo coin is in the middle of Top New Meme Coins to Join for Short Term. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale – The Journey to Penguinopolis Offers Massive Potential The Meme Coin presale is anything but ordinary. Unlike traditional presales split into multiple pricing stages, this one follows a unique approach where Arctic Pablo “travels” through different locations. Currently, it has reached its 12th phase—Penguinopolis—where investors can get in at an ultra-low price of $0.000067 per APC. With over $1.64 million already raised, the momentum is building fast. The most exciting part? Early adopters stand to gain an astronomical ROI. From the current phase in Penguinopolis to its expected launch price of $0.008, investors could see gains exceeding 11,844.78%. To put it in perspective, a $100 investment at this stage would fetch 1,492,537 APCs, translating to a projected value of $11,940.30 post-listing. As Arctic Pablo Coin moves to new locations, prices will only increase. Those who act now could secure the best entry point before the next phase drives the price higher. With Arctic Pablo Coin solidifying its place among the top new meme coins to join for short-term gains, this presale is not one to be missed.

Cheems’ Recent Surge in Popularity Amid Community-Driven Developments Cheems has been making significant strides in the crypto space, gaining traction through its innovative community-led governance initiatives. By empowering token holders with voting rights on key project decisions, Cheems has reinforced its commitment to decentralization, ensuring that its future is shaped by those who believe in its vision.

Mark your calendars, March 14, 2025, will be the final day. No more extensions, no more waiting. This is it! With recent updates, many believe Pi Coin could soon rise from $3 to $5. One Last Extension Until 14 March The decision to extend the KYC deadline aims to provide early Pioneers who may have gone inactive with another opportunity to verify their identity and migrate their Pi holdings to the Mainnet. Pi Network has officially announced on X that the KYC and Mainnet migration deadlines have been extended one last time to 8:00 AM UTC on March 14, 2025. This gives real Pioneers extra time to verify their balances and move their Pi to the Mainnet after the Open Network launch. The KYC and Mainnet migration deadlines for the Grace Period have been extended one last time to 8:00am UTC on March 14, 2025, allowing additional time and opportunity after Open Network for real Pioneers to verify their balances and migrate to the Mainnet. Learn more:… pic.twitter.com/lD2jsDN8Wd — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) February 28, 2025 Pi developers also raised concerns about unverified and unclaimed Pi. Now that the Open Network is live, holding large amounts of unverified Pi on mobile wallets is not practical. They made it clear that this final extension is needed to help the network move forward while keeping it secure and decentralized. What Happens If You Miss the Deadline? Pioneers who fail to complete KYC and migrate to Mainnet by March 14, 2025, risk losing most of their mobile balance. However, Pi Network clarified that users will retain Pi mined within the last six months before migration. This means that anyone still holding older, unverified Pi must act before the deadline to avoid losing their assets. Pi Coin Price Prediction As the Pi Network ecosystem grows, speculation around Pi Coin’s price is rising. Recent trends suggest increasing market interest, with the token currently trading at $2.15, reflecting a 10% rise in 24 hours. If the bullish momentum continues, experts believe Pi could reach $3 or even $5 soon. With the final deadline now set, Pioneers who have yet to complete KYC should take action to secure their Pi holdings before it’s too late.",News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-01 11:15:45

Popular analyst Credible Crypto believes Litecoin (LTC) and XRP could become key players in the next market rally. Both tokens have maintained their support levels despite Bitcoin’s price dip below $80K, showing resilience while BTC continues to hover around key price ranges. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, remains stagnant at $2.1K but could surprise investors if momentum shifts in its favor. Altcoins Showing Strength Amid Market Uncertainty Since the Bitcoin and ETH craze is fading , several altcoins are standing out in the current market. Solana, Pi Network, Dogecoin, and Cardano have rebounded strongly, presenting investment opportunities. Dogecoin saw a 10.90% jump to $0.2044, largely driven by speculation of a potential ETF approval, which has fueled optimism among investors. Cardano is also showing positive buying signals, indicating a potential upward move. https://twitter.com/CredibleCrypto/status/1895425691262537946 LTC vs XRP: Altcoins Giving Bull Vibes! Litecoin and XRP have emerged as some of the most stable altcoins in this downturn. The analyst points out that while Bitcoin has dropped below its key support levels, LTC and XRP have held steady, making them likely candidates to lead the next market recovery. At the time of writing, Litecoin is trading at $127, showing marginal gains, while XRP sits at $2.15, down 1.6% on the day . Crypto analyst BearBull points out that while XRP has held its relative low, a drop to the high-timeframe (HTF) demand zone around $1.60 would challenge its current strength. However, Litecoin (LTC) appears more likely to hold higher, as its local low at $80 is still 33% away, compared to XRP’s 15% margin. In response , Credible Crypto agrees, noting that if XRP breaks its range lows and hits HTF demand, it may not look as strong in the short term, but overall, the HTF remains bullish. Bitcoin’s Current Position—Sideways Action Before a Breakout? Bitcoin recently dropped to $79,000 before recovering slightly to $85,070. According to Credible Crypto, BTC is likely to trade sideways between $74,000 and $99,000 before making a significant move. This consolidation phase could provide a foundation for select altcoins to surge ahead. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Recovered: Is this a Rebound or a Bull Trap? , Are We in a Selective Altcoin Season? Bitcoin dominance remains above 60%, keeping most altcoins in check, but select tokens like XRP, Litecoin, Solana, Pi Network, Dogecoin, and Cardano have rebounded, attracting investor interest. CryptoQuant’s CEO, Ki Young Ju, sugests that only a handful of altcoins will benefit in this cycle. Unlike past bull runs where most altcoins surged together, this time, only select assets tied to institutional adoption, stablecoins, and meme coins are standing strong. The total crypto market cap is now at $2.76 trillion, testing the highs of 2021. However, many altcoins are still down over 80% from their peak. Investing in projects with real utility rather than hype could be the best strategy in this bear market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ethereum Faces Bearish Pressure As Sentiment Hits 12-Month Low – Can ETH Avoid Dropping Below $2,000? https://t.co/8ncqGw6Mby — X Crypto News (@pakjobsidea) March 1, 2025 However, Ethereum quickly rebounded, surging to an intra-day high of $2,277 amid optimism surrounding Trump’s upcoming Crypto Summit on March 7. Despite the brief recovery, Ethereum is now facing renewed downward pressure, as the extended trendline resistance around $2,275 has pushed the price back down to $2,185. Geopolitical Tensions Impact Crypto Markets; Impact on ETH The sudden drop in Ethereum’s price was attributed to rising geopolitical uncertainties following a tense meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy. According to reports, their discussion on Ukraine’s natural resource investment plan turned into a heated exchange, with Trump and U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance openly criticizing Zelenskyy. The situation escalated when Zelenskyy stated that he would not return to the White House, further adding to the market’s nervousness.

U.S.… pic.twitter.com/auQfbVHhgH — Kyrylo Shevchenko (@KShevchenkoReal) February 28, 2025 Financial analysts believe that investors reacted to the uncertainty by moving funds out of riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. As a result, Ethereum’s decline below $2,100 marked its lowest level this year, raising fears of further downside if support at $2,000 fails to hold. Ethereum dropped due to Trump-Zelenskyy tensions. Investors pulled funds, pushing it below $2,100. If $2,000 breaks, more losses may follow. ETH Slips Ahead of Trump’s Crypto Summit Despite the initial losses, ETH swiftly regained momentum as positive news from the U.S. boosted investor confidence. Trump’s announcement of a Crypto Summit on March 7 sparked optimism regarding potential regulatory changes, leading to a surge in demand for digital assets. Bitcoin (BTC) also benefited, jumping from $78,000 to $86,500, while altcoins like Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) followed suit with notable gains.

The cryptocurrency’s 24-hour trading volume has surged to $22.97 billion, while its market capitalization stands at approximately $269.68 billion. This rapid recovery highlights the market’s sensitivity to both geopolitical risks and regulatory developments. Ethereum rebounded as Trump’s Crypto Summit announcement boosted confidence. Bitcoin surged to $86,500, with altcoins like XRP and ADA also gaining. ETH now trades at $2,236.52, up 5.36%, with a $22.97B trading volume. ETH/USD Outlook and Key Levels to Watch Market analysts caution that ETH’s price movements remain highly reactive to geopolitical news and upcoming regulatory discussions. If Ethereum sustains levels above $2,200, further upside momentum could push it toward the $2,300 resistance level. However, a break below $2,100 could expose the asset to renewed selling pressure, with $2,000 being a critical support zone.

The move comes after BNB Chain’s $4.4 million liquidity support initiative aimed at encouraging growth in the meme coin ecosystem. CZ noted that the program’s rules could be adjusted to accommodate larger volumes of tokens and support could be expanded beyond just memecoins. In a post addressing speculations about interactions with his wallet, CZ made it clear that he will not be refunding any funds sent to the designated address.

CZ also rejected the idea of selling these tokens for BNB, citing concerns over the potential price impact and additional workload it would create. “I usually choose to do the least amount of work,” he added, adding that he can change his approach at any time, depending on his availability. *This is not investment advice.

In this period, Bitcoin has crashed by over 15% falling as low as $80,000. Interestingly, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode has provided an in-depth analysis of investors’ behavior amidst this price decline highlighting the cohort with the largest realized losses. BTC 1-Day To 1-Week Holders Lead Market Liquidation Pressure On Friday, February 28, Bitcoin dipped below $80,000 reaching a price level last seen in November 2024. In response, the BTC market recorded $685 million in realized losses in addition to the initial $2.16 billion between February 25-27. In a recent X post , Glassnode analysts dived into the market sell-off on Friday, indicating that this recent capitulation is primarily concentrated among short-term holders (STH) who are realizing losses at a much higher rate than long-term holders. From Glassnode’s report, the most affected cohort of STH has been new market entrants over the past week as indicated in the following data: 1-day to 1-week holders with $238.8 million in losses,1-week to 1-month holders ($187.6 million), 1-month to 3-month holders ($132.4 million) and 24-hour buyers ($104.9 million). However, it’s worth noting that holders from the past 3-6 months also experienced a significant spike in realized losses. This group recorded $ 12.7 million in realized losses on Friday, representing a 95.4% gain from the previous day. Looking further, Glassnode’s report also realized the price dip on Friday also pushed the Bitcoin loss realization average rate to $57.1 million per hour. The realization speed per cohort of the STH – who account for the majority of the market losses is as follows: 1-day to 1-week holders with $19.9 million/hour, 1-week to 1-month holders ($13.9 million/hour), 1-month to 3-month holders ($14.2 million/hour) and 24-hour buyers ($8.04 million/hour). As expected, the 1-day to 1-week cohort is the dominant force in driving liquidity pressure with a loss realization rate almost double the next largest group. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Stay Resolute According to more data from Glassnode’s report, Bitcoin long-term holders from the last 6-12 months have shown minimal, negligible loss realization despite a widespread market capitulation. This development indicates that the longer-term investors are largely unbothered by the recent sell-off and price correction with strong confidence for a market rebound. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $85,200 following some price recovery on Friday. However, its weekly losses remain at 11.34% indicating the current bearish move in the market.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|BTC new entrants|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Glassnode,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-01 11:30:39

He stated that cryptocurrencies have several issues as an asset class, in an interview with the Tamedia newspaper group. Why Cryptocurrencies Don’t Fit the SNB Swiss National Bank (SNB) President Martin Schlegel explained why cryptocurrencies do not fulfill the essential characteristics that a good currency should have in an interview with a media group. He highlighted three main reasons: first, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, which makes them unreliable for maintaining long-term value. Second, he remarked that SNB reserves need to be highly liquid, allowing for quick use in monetary policy if needed. Lastly, Schlegel pointed out that cryptocurrencies have security flaws, as they are based on software, which can have bugs and vulnerabilities. SNB In Competition With Crypto? Furthermore, Schlegel argues that the SNB’s role is not to offer cryptocurrencies, noting that the total market value of all cryptocurrencies, around CHF 2,000 billion, is still small compared to the global financial system. He described cryptocurrencies as a “niche phenomenon.” When asked about competition from crypto, Schlegel stated that currencies have always competed with each other. However, he emphasized that the Swiss franc is in high demand and that the SNB is not really worried about competition from cryptocurrencies. The Bitcoin Initiative However, a proposal launched last December aims to make the Swiss National Bank (SNB) invest in bitcoin. The group behind the “Bitcoin Initiative” has 18 months to collect 100,000 signatures to bring it to a public vote. The plan suggests the SNB should build its currency reserves with earnings, including gold and bitcoin, although it doesn’t say how much bitcoin should be held. The initiative is backed by Yves Bennaïm, an internet pioneer, and other Swiss crypto advocates, whose main goal is to spark a public debate.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-01 11:41:41

However, the same cannot be said about the Ethereum counterparties, as they extended their negative streak to seven days in a row. BTC ETFs: The Bad and Minor Good The US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs didn’t enjoy February, which turned out to be the worst month in terms of net outflows since their inception over a year ago. The second part of the month was particularly painful , which is perhaps what helped make February 2025 the poorest for BTC’s price movements in over a decade. There hasn’t been a day with a triple-digit net inflow since February 7. In fact, only two trading days since that date have been in the green, while the remaining 12 were deep in the red. The biggest net withdrawals came on February 25 when $1.138.9 billion left the funds. The two surrounding dates – 24 and 26 – were also deep in the red, with $539 million and $754.9 million exiting, respectively. After another $275.9 million was withdrawn on Thursday (Feb 27), the tables finally turned on Friday with $94.3 million in net inflows. Despite this minor glimpse of hope, though, the week still ended deep in the red, with $2,614.1 billion exiting the funds. Perhaps it’s no surprise that BTC’s price went from $96,000 to $78,000 within this timeframe and dumped to its lowest level since early November 2024. ETH ETFs in Knockdown State The spot Ethereum ETFs had a slightly different trajectory this month as they even registered some consecutive days of net inflows from February 13 to February 19, granted there were three non-trading days within this timeframe. However, their streak was halted on February 20, and they have bled out each trading day since. The past week alone saw $78 million taken out on Monday, $50.1 million on Tuesday, $94.3 million on Wednesday, $71.2 million on Thursday, and $41.9 million on Friday. Overall, the week ended well in the red, with $335.5 million leaving the funds. ETH’s price performance was quite similar to that of BTC, as the asset is now down by over 20% on a weekly scale. Moreover, it dipped toward $2,000 for the first time in several months but managed to defend that level, at least for now.

Despite the massive bull run in the crypto landscape since 2023, Ethereum (ETH) holders have not had the same experience. Although ETH price shot 243% in 2023 and early 2024, it has failed to perform for the better part of 2024 . Meanwhile, its peer altcoins have yielded massive gains. As of this writing, ETH has undergone 12 weeks of agonizing downtrend. Ethereum’s uninspiring performance can be attributed to the Ethereum Foundation’s unconcerned and unchanging approach toward ETH and Solana’s sudden popularity as an “ETH-killer.” Regardless, let’s explore what technicals suggest is next for Ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, after 12 weeks of downtrend as it follows Bitcoin’s lead . What Comes After Ethereum Price Endures 12 Weeks of Pain? As shown in the weekly chart, Ethereum price crashed 49% from a peak of $4,087 on December 2, 2024, to $2,076 as of February 24, roughly constituting 12 weeks . In doing so, ETH has revisited the $2,100 support level for the fifth time since January 2024. Due to these frequent visits, a large portion of liquidity is likely to be present below this key level from investors looking to open long positions, hoping for a reversal. Technicals suggest that markets typically sweep this liquidity , allowing smart investors to buy at a discount, kickstarting a bullish reversal. So, to put it simply, investors can expect the ETH’s value to slide even lower before it can attempt to embark on a full-blown uptrend. ETH/USDT 1-week chart How Low Can ETH Go? Based on the weekly chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has attempted to overcome the mean level of 50 and failed, which signals a prevalence of strong bearish momentum . The Awesome Oscillator (AO) also expresses similar intent as it has produced three red histograms below the zero mean level. Therefore, investors can expect the Ethereum price to dip below $2,000 as it hunts for the sell-side liquidity below equal lows formed at $2,100 . Catalysts That Could Prepone Ethereum’s Bull Run Despite the lackluster Ethereum price performance, here are a few high-probability catalysts that could preempt ETH’s bull run. The Ethereum Foundation crisis involving Vitalik Buterin and Aya Miyaguci needs to be resolved with an appropriate replacement who will make Ethereum great again. A part of this solution was already implemented by removing Miyaguci from the helm and the Foundation exploring staking and other DeFi services instead of selling ETH for operational expenses. The Crypto Summit on March 7 could potentially pause the downtrend and catalyze a dead cat bounce. An announcement of a strategic digital asset stockpile that involves Bitcoin and Ethereum could further improve ETH’s odds of restarting the bull run. Regardless, it will be interesting to see how Ethereum price predictions change as ETH price action nears the end of its 12-week painful downtrend.

Bitcoin fell 17.5%, Ethereum plunged 32.2%, and XRP dropped 29.3%. Unlike the broader market, XRP took a hit on February 24 but staged a quick recovery the next day, showing resilience. Over the past 24 hours, it has jumped 8.4%, outpacing both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, this surge came after SEC’s recent case drops that raised hopes of Ripple vs SEC case dismissal . But if that made you think XRP will moon, think again. Analyst says this will not be the only factor. The long-awaited conclusion of the SEC lawsuit against Ripple may bring regulatory clarity to XRP, but analysts warn that investors shouldn’t expect an immediate price explosion. According to a recent thread by All Things XRP, the real catalyst for XRP’s surge lies in Ripple’s next moves—adoption, partnerships, and real-world utility. https://twitter.com/XRP_investing/status/1895628037917729184 Factors Supporting XRP Pump, NOT SEC Case Closure Once the legal chapter closes, XRP’s market activity is expected to go higher. Exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken could expand trading pairs, while Binance.US might reintroduce XRP to its platform. The resulting liquidity boost and renewed retail interest could provide the initial push for a price rally. https://twitter.com/XRP_investing/status/1895628044926320704 Meanwhile, Ripple has already established partnerships with over 300 financial institutions through RippleNet, showcasing confidence in future adoption. With regulatory hurdles out of the way, major players like Standard Chartered, Santander, or even PayPal could integrate XRP for cross-border payments. This shift could lead to a massive spike in transaction volume. Another key factor is Ripple’s newly launched RLUSD stablecoin . If Ripple strategically integrates RLUSD into DeFi platforms and pairs it with XRP, institutional investors could flood the network, attracted by the combination of stability and fast, low-cost transactions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why XRP Is Going Up Today & Analyst Price Predictions , Tokenization: The Real Game-Changer? Moreover, the analyst noted that Ripple has long hinted at real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on the XRP Ledger. With the SEC case resolved, Ripple could accelerate plans to tokenize assets like gold, real estate, or carbon credits. If XRP becomes the transaction fuel for these trades, demand could skyrocket. The Power of Sentiment and Strategic Moves Ripple’s CEO, brad garlinghouse brad garlinghouse Brad Garlinghouse is the CEO of the financial technology company Ripple Labs, he is an extremely popular name across the global crypto landscape. He has previously served as the CEO of Hightail, a file-sharing service, and is also an active angel investor. He joined Ripple as COO in April 2015, answering to the CEO and prime supporter, Chris Larsen. He was elevated to CEO in December 2016. Initially, he worked at AOL and Yahoo! From 2003 to 2008, he filled in as Senior Vice President at Yahoo!, where he ran its Homepage, Flickr, Yahoo! Mail, and Yahoo! Courier divisions. While at Yahoo!, he wrote an inner update known as the ""Peanut Butter Manifesto,"" requiring the organization to zero in on its core business instead of extending itself excessively far, much like peanut butter.Details:Organization: RippleLocation: United StatesEducation: MBA from Harvard Business School and BA from The University of KansasSkills: Venture capital and StartupsExperience:CEO at Ripplefrom from Jan 2017 - Present ·President and COO at Ripple logo from Apr 2015 - Dec 2016Board Member at Animoto from 2012 - Dec 2017Tonic Health, an R1 company logoBoard Member at Tonic Health from 2011-2016Board Member at Ancestry from 2013 - 2016CEO at Hightail from May 2012 - Sep 2014FAQsWho is Brad Garlinghouse?The CEO of Ripple, a financial technology business that specializes in blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency XRP, is Brad Garlinghouse.

From secret meetings with political leaders to major announcements, a well-executed PR strategy could further elevate XRP’s market position. While the lawsuit’s resolution is a milestone, the real driver of XRP’s long-term price movement will be Ripple’s ability to deliver on its partnerships and technology. If adoption and scaling efforts materialize as expected, XRP could be in for a much bigger rally than just a legal win. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Expert Predicts Why Dogecoin Price Will Teleport to $3,https://coingape.com/markets/buy-doge-now-expert-predicts-why-dogecoin-price-will-teleport-to-3/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) price has maintained stability around the $0.20 mark despite recent market downturns. This key support level signals potential strength for the meme token. As the broader crypto market shows signs of recovery, analysts suggest that Dogecoin may be poised for a major breakout. An expert predicts that DOGE could surge toward $3, citing technical patterns and growing market interest as key factors driving bullish momentum. Crypto Expert Predicts Dogecoin Price Breakout To $3 Crypto experts suggest Dogecoin price is on the verge of a major breakout after weeks of consolidation. An analyst chart highlights a descending price channel, with DOGE trading near the $0.2 support level. Experts project a potential surge beyond $0.6, marking a 208% rally if critical resistance levels are breached. The Mmeme coin price action indicates a reversal pattern, suggesting that DOGE Price could be preparing for an upward trend. Market watchers are closely monitoring the breakout zone as technical indicators show signs of momentum shifting. If Dogecoin surpasses its resistance, a rally above the support levels will be fueled by increased market interest. DOGE Holds Above Critical Support Level, Eyes Potential Breakout Crypto analyst Ali also shared an X post that the Dogecoin price is holding above a critical support level. The chart shared by the analyst highlights DOGE’s long-term trend, showing a key support zone around $0.18. Despite recent price fluctuations, the meme coins asset remains within an upward channel, suggesting resilience in its structure. The chart also marks Fibonacci levels, with resistance near $0.25 and a potential breakout level above $0.30. If DOGE maintains support, it could sustain its upward trend. However, a drop below this level might indicate further declines. The rising Dogecoin price has caused broad cryptocurrency market optimism among investors. During the last 24-hours, Bitcoin prices soared by almost 10%, followed by substantial growth of Ether, XRP, and Solana (SOL). Market experts question whether positive market movement represents a lasting effect or a brief upward trend. Key Levels To Watch DOGE price experienced a 10% increase in 24 hours, which pushed it to a trading value of $0.20 on Saturday. Following constant stabilizing market trends, Dogecoin surpassed its previous $0.20 price level because of potential ETF development. The top altcoin needs to overcome $0.22 resistance before it can advance more in the short term. The Dogecoin price prediction continues rising so the next significant barrier stands near $0.25. The price would potentially engage support at $0.20 before breaking through that support level. The RSI stands at level 45 to show moderate but rising bullish market sentiments. Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView The price outlook for Dogecoin suggests a bullish trend where experts expect it to move toward the $3 milestone.

Priced at $0.015, analysts predict the altcoin could skyrocket to $1.5, a 100x return on investment for holders. Mutuum Finance is in phase 2 of its presale. Over $1.6 million has already been raised and more than 3100 investors are in. Investors have this once in a lifetime opportunity to enter before the price spikes 33.33% to 0.02 in phase 3. If Mutuum Finance pulls off this prediction, a $700 investment today becomes $70,000 during the next bull run. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): the DeFi opportunity everyone’s talking about Mutuum Finance ’s presale is gaining massive traction, offering early investors a rare chance to buy MUTM tokens at just $0.015 before they hit the open market. Currently in Phase 2, the token price is set to climb to $0.06 by the end of the presale, delivering a 300% return before public trading even begins. Analysts are optimistic, with predictions that once listed, MUTM could soar past $1.5. The excitement continues to build, with over $1.6 million raised and more than 3,100 investors already on board. Revolutionizing DeFi lending with a dual-system model Mutuum Finance is making crypto lending easier and more flexible with two smart ways to borrow and lend money: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) Model: investors can put stablecoins like USDT into a special pool managed by smart contracts. This helps them earn passive income, while borrowers can take out quick loans using their crypto as security. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model: Borrowers and lenders deal directly with each other, they can set their own loan rules, interest rates, and guarantees. There are no middlemen, making everything faster, fairer, and fully decentralized. With these two models, Mutuum Finance gives users more freedom, security and better ways to grow their money. Mutuum Finance is also set to launch a fiat-backed stablecoin on Ethereum. The stablecoin will be pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. This differentiates it from algorithmic stablecoins, which are prone to depegs causing massive losses to investors. Mutuum Finance is designed for long-term success, with a well-structured presale pricing model that rewards early adopters. A controlled token release strategy prevents inflation and keeps prices stable, while funds are strategically allocated to liquidity, security, and partnerships to fuel continuous platform development. Big rewards & community incentives To drive mass adoption, Mutuum Finance is giving away $100,000, with 10 winners receiving $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. Additionally, their referral program lets users earn bonuses for bringing in new investors, accelerating the community’s growth. Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a game-changer in the decentralized finance market, with groundbreaking DeFi solutions, strong tokenomics, and a fast-growing community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about opportunities in crypto. Currently, its presale price is just $0.015, but with Phase 3 approaching, it’s about to jump 33.33% to $0.02. By the time the presale ends, Mutuum Finance token price will be $0.06, delivering a 300% gain before it even reaches public trading. Looking long-term, analysts believe MUTM could soar to $1.5, a 9900% increase. Momentum is building fast, with over $1.6 million raised and more than 3,100 investors already in.

BTFD Coin’s $0.00016 Entry Price and 3,650% ROI Potential Are Screaming Opportunity",https://thecoinrise.com/wishing-youd-bought-snek-early-btfd-coins-0-00016-entry-price-and-3650-roi-potential-are-screaming-opportunity/,"The crypto market has always been full of surprises, with meme coins leading some of the most unexpected rallies. Many investors who missed out on early opportunities have found themselves watching from the sidelines as prices skyrocketed. Snek became one of the most talked-about projects on Cardano, and those who got in early saw massive gains as its deflationary model drove demand. But as history shows, every missed opportunity is followed by a new one, and right now, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be the next big thing. BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s a project designed for long-term growth, combining a Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards, and a strong community foundation. The presale is currently in Stage 14, with an entry price of just $0.00016. Analysts are already predicting a listing price of $0.0006 and a potential moon price of $0.006, signaling a massive 3,650% ROI potential. Investors looking for the best new meme coins to join this week are turning their attention to BTFD Coin before the window closes. BTFD Coin’s Play-to-Earn Game and Explosive Growth Potential The biggest reason BTFD Coin is gaining momentum is its Play-to-Earn game, which officially launched on January 1, 2025. This isn’t just a promise of future development—it’s a fully functional game that allows players to earn rewards in real-time. The gaming sector has proven to be one of the strongest drivers of crypto adoption, and BTFD Coin’s early entry into this space is setting it apart. Imagine investing in a project where you don’t just hold tokens—you actively engage in a growing ecosystem that pays you for your participation. That’s exactly what BTFD Coin is offering. With players already earning rewards and staking opportunities providing an incredible 90% APY, the project has created multiple ways for holders to grow their investments. This combination of gaming and staking makes BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to join this week, attracting both investors and gamers alike. With over $6.21 million raised, more than 11,100 holders, and 70 billion tokens already sold, the presale is moving fast. Every day, more investors are realizing that this is the chance they’ve been waiting for. At the current price of $0.00016, those who invest now stand to gain significantly once the token reaches its projected $0.006 price. A simple $5,000 investment at presale prices would turn into $187,500 at the predicted moon price. That’s the kind of opportunity that doesn’t come around often, and those searching for the best new meme coins to join this week are starting to take action. Snek’s Run Was Huge, But BTFD Coin’s Future Looks Promising Snek became a cultural force on Cardano, with its deflationary mechanism driving increased demand. As tokens continue to be burned, supply shrinks, creating additional buying pressure. This unique model helped push Snek into the spotlight, cementing its status as one of the most traded tokens in its ecosystem. Investors who spotted the opportunity early have already reaped the benefits, while many others are left wondering what’s next. The reality is that crypto moves fast, and waiting too long can mean missing out on the next major trend. That’s why so many traders and investors are now looking at BTFD Coin. With its presale still ongoing and multiple revenue streams for holders, it presents one of the strongest cases for those looking for the best new meme coins to join this week. The combination of a live Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY staking, and a referral program that rewards early supporters makes it clear that this project is built for growth. How to Buy BTFD Coin Before the Presale Ends Buying BTFD Coin is simple, but the key is to act before the presale ends. Start by setting up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head to the official presale page . Connect your wallet, choose the amount of BTFD you want to buy, and confirm the transaction. Once the presale concludes, your tokens will be available for claim. With staking and Play-to-Earn rewards already in place, early buyers will have the opportunity to start earning right away. Final Thoughts Crypto history has proven time and time again that early movers often see the biggest gains. Those who got into Snek early had the chance to profit, while others were left watching from the sidelines. BTFD Coin is presenting a second opportunity, but the clock is ticking. With its $0.00016 presale entry price, projected $0.006 moon price, and over $6.21 million already raised, it’s clear why this is one of the best new meme coins to join this week. Investors looking to make a move need to act before the next presale stage sells out because once the price moves up, the best entry point will be gone.

Besides, speculations are also soaring over a potential dismissal of the Ripple SEC case, given the recent shifting stance of the US SEC towards the crypto sector. However, a top expert recently shrugged off concerns over the lawsuit’s impact on Ripple’s native coin, saying that the crypto is likely to hit $8 irrespective of the case result. XRP Price Soars 6%: More Stream Left? XRP price today jumped nearly 6.25% and exchanged hands at $2.15, while its trading volume fell 32% to $5.16 billion. Notably, the crypto has hovered between $2.21 and $2.02 over the last 24 hours. Further, derivatives data by CoinGlass showed that XRP Futures Open Interest rose 7% today, reflecting the regaining market confidence. Amid this, a renowned market analyst CasiTrades said that the correction is likely over for the crypto and XRP’s major resistance now looms at $2.2. Besides, the expert added if Ripple’s coin breaks the $2.5 ahead, it could continue to move towards the north. Source: CasiTrades, X Meanwhile, despite the positive market sentiment, the community has shown frustration over the US SEC’s delay in dropping the Ripple SEC case. For context, the US SEC has dropped many of the major crypto cases this week but made no comments on the long-running XRP lawsuit. Highlighting the delay, renowned legal expert John Deaton recently pushed for a settlement in the ongoing legal battle. Will Ripple SEC Case Impact XRP Price Ahead? Renowned market expert Dark Defender has made a bold prediction that the XRP price will reach $8, irrespective of the outcome of the ongoing Ripple SEC case. This prediction comes as Ripple’s coin has recovered today, indicating renewed investor confidence amidst a broader crypto market recovery. The Ripple Vs SEC lawsuit has been a major point of speculation, with many investors worried about its impact on the asset’s price. However, Dark Defender’s prediction suggests that the crypto’s price will continue to rise, regardless of the case’s outcome. In a recent social media post, Dark Defender explained that XRP has reached the lowest Fibonacci level for a 4th wave and is expected to start a 5th wave, which could push its price towards $5-$8. Source: Dark Defender, X This prediction is significant, given the current market sentiment. XRP’s price has been volatile in recent times, but Dark Defender’s analysis suggests that it has the potential to reach new heights. It’s worth noting that the Ripple case is still ongoing, and its outcome is uncertain. However, if Dark Defender’s prediction comes true, it could be a major boost for the traders. Key Levels to Watch Ahead As XRP price noted some recovery and hovered in the green zone, top experts have provided key price levels to watch ahead. For context, market pundit Ali Martinez said that the crypto has found new support at $1.65. Having said that, it’s crucial that the crypto holds this support to maintain its upward trajectory. Source: Ali Martinez, X On the other hand, expert Rose Premium Signals said that Ripple’s coin is currently experiencing a retracement phase, testing key Fibonacci levels. The cryptocurrency is expected to bounce back strongly from the support zone of $1.2578. If successful, this could trigger a massive recovery and a bullish breakout. Potential targets include $3.0110 and $4.2243. Source: Rose Premium Signals, X Having said that, it appears that the crypto is poised for a strong rally ahead. Besides, another expert has recently predicted the Ripple price to hit $320 in 2026, which has sparked significant discussions in the market.
