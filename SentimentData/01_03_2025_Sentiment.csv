This represented a 57% drop from its highest value this year. However, the cryptocurrency rebounded to $145 following a major purchase by SOL whales. Solana Price Stabilizes After Crash – Is a Rally to $180 Possible? Solana price saw a major decline, falling from its yearly peak of $295 to $126.15. This drop marked its lowest level since September 6. The decline also led to a breakdown below the $170 support level. Meanwhile, a Solana whale purchased $14 million worth of SOL, withdrawing it from Binance and staking the tokens. The accumulation occurred before a $1.75 billion token unlock, a typically bearish event. The purchase helped ease sell pressure and contributed to the slight SOL price recovery. Despite the rebound, Solana price remains below key resistance levels. If the bullish momentum continues, traders target the $170 level as a short-term target. A breakout beyond this level could push SOL toward the $180 mark. Meanwhile, according to a recent report, CME Group announced plans to introduce Solana (SOL) futures on March 17, subject to regulatory approval. This move positions Solana alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum as one of the few cryptocurrencies with futures trading on the platform. Market analysts suggest that the launch could strengthen the case for a potential Solana ETF in the future. Solana’s Total Value Locked Declines by Nearly 50% Solana’s total value locked (TVL) has dropped significantly in recent weeks. The TVL, which peaked at $12.19 billion, has now declined to $6.94 billion. The drop reflects lower investor confidence and reduced capital inflow into Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The decline in TVL has been linked to the crash of top Solana-based meme coins . The market cap of Solana meme coins fell from $25 billion in January to $8.9 billion. This shift in capital has negatively affected the Solana network’s liquidity and overall market position. While TVL remains under pressure, some Solana-based meme coins have started to recover. The overall DeFi activity on the network will be a key factor in determining the future movement of Solana price. Key Resistance Levels to Watch Solana price is approaching a critical resistance zone between $147.09 and $166.42. This area represents a fair value gap in the market. If SOL breaks above this range, it could signal a stronger recovery toward the $180 resistance level. Supporting the bullish move by SOL whales, technical indicators suggest increasing momentum in favor of buyers. The Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) indicator, displayed as dots above and below the price action, has shifted below the recent candles. This shift indicates a potential reversal from the previous downtrend. As long as the dots remain below the price, it suggests that buyers are in control, and the uptrend may persist. Source: TradingView Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator and its histogram reinforce this bullish outlook by SOL whales. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line, which is a classic bullish crossover indicating strengthening upward momentum. Additionally, the histogram bars have turned positive and are expanding, confirming buying pressure. If the momentum sustains, Solana price might break key resistance levels toward $180. More so, according to analysis, SOL price has shown signs of stabilization after crashing 40% and reaching extremely oversold levels. Historically, such deep RSI drops have often preceded price reversals, hinting that Solana price could regain upward momentum.

This week, all eyes were on the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) as they released the January core PCE price index data. Did it bring any surprises? Let’s dive into what this report means, especially for those navigating the crypto landscape. What is the Core PCE Price Index and Why Does it Matter? For those new to economic jargon, the core PCE price index might sound like another complicated term. But in reality, it’s a vital tool for understanding inflation and the overall health of the U.S. economy. Think of it as the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) favorite inflation thermometer. Here’s a breakdown: Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE): This measures the prices that people living in the United States, or those visiting the country, pay for goods and services. It’s a broad gauge of consumer spending. Core PCE: To get a clearer picture of underlying inflation trends, economists often strip out volatile categories like food and energy prices. These sectors can fluctuate wildly due to temporary supply shocks or seasonal changes, potentially masking the true inflationary pressures. The resulting metric is the core PCE price index . Why the Fed Cares: The Federal Reserve uses the core PCE price index as a primary benchmark for inflation. The Fed has a target inflation rate of 2%. Monitoring this index helps them decide on monetary policy, like adjusting interest rates, to keep inflation in check and maintain price stability. In essence, when you hear about the core PCE price index , think of it as a key indicator influencing the Federal Reserve’s decisions, which in turn can ripple through all markets, including cryptocurrency. Decoding the January Core PCE Data: What are Inflation Expectations? Now, let’s get to the numbers that were just released. The BEA reported that in January, the core PCE price index : Rose 0.3% from the previous month: This means that prices, excluding food and energy, increased by 0.3% in January compared to December. Increased 2.6% year-over-year: Looking at a longer timeframe, the index is up 2.6% compared to January of the previous year. Matched Market Expectations: Crucially, both these figures were in line with what economists and analysts had predicted, according to Investing.com. So, what does matching expectations mean? In the short term, it can be interpreted as a sign of stability. Markets generally react more dramatically to surprises. When data aligns with forecasts, it reduces uncertainty and can prevent sharp price swings. However, it also means that inflation expectations remain anchored around these levels. The Fed, and market participants, are still watching closely to see if inflation will continue to moderate towards the 2% target. Federal Reserve’s Inflation Gauge: How Core PCE Influences Policy The Federal Reserve inflation measure , particularly the core PCE, is not just a number; it’s a compass guiding the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. When the core PCE shows persistent inflation above the 2% target, the Fed often responds by: Raising Interest Rates: Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can cool down economic activity and reduce inflationary pressures. This is a primary tool the Fed uses. Quantitative Tightening: This involves the Fed reducing its holdings of government bonds and other securities, further tightening financial conditions. Forward Guidance: The Fed communicates its intentions and outlook to the public, influencing market expectations and behavior. Conversely, if the core PCE price index were to show a significant and sustained decline below the 2% target, the Fed might consider lowering interest rates or implementing other measures to stimulate economic growth and push inflation back up. In the context of the latest 0.3% rise, which is in line with expectations, it suggests that the Fed is likely to maintain its current stance. They will likely continue to monitor incoming data closely, including future US inflation data releases, before making any significant policy shifts. The ‘wait-and-see’ approach seems to be the prevailing strategy. Impact of Core PCE on the US Economy and Crypto Markets The US inflation data , reflected by the core PCE and other indicators, has broad implications for the entire economy and, by extension, the cryptocurrency market. Here’s how: Broader Economic Health: The core PCE is a reflection of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy. Stable and moderate inflation is generally seen as healthy. High or volatile inflation can erode purchasing power, create economic instability, and lead to tighter monetary policy. Interest Rate Sensitivity: Cryptocurrencies, while often touted as inflation hedges, are not immune to broader macroeconomic conditions. Rising interest rates can make riskier assets, like crypto, less attractive compared to safer, yield-bearing investments like bonds. Market Sentiment: Inflation data influences market sentiment. If inflation remains stubbornly high, it could lead to concerns about more aggressive interest rate hikes from the Fed, potentially dampening investor enthusiasm for risk assets, including crypto. Dollar Strength: Inflation and interest rate expectations can impact the value of the US dollar. A stronger dollar can sometimes exert downward pressure on crypto prices, especially when paired against USD. For crypto investors, keeping an eye on economic indicators like the core PCE is not just about understanding economic theory; it’s about making informed decisions in a market that is increasingly intertwined with traditional finance. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what can crypto enthusiasts and investors take away from this latest core PCE report? Stay Informed: Regularly monitor economic data releases, especially inflation indicators like the core PCE, CPI, and PPI. Understand how these reports can influence market sentiment and Fed policy. Diversify and Manage Risk: Economic uncertainty and potential interest rate hikes can increase market volatility. Diversification across different asset classes and prudent risk management strategies are crucial. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, maintain a long-term perspective on your crypto investments. Focus on the fundamental value and adoption potential of the projects you believe in. Understand Macroeconomic Context: The crypto market doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Understanding the broader macroeconomic environment, including inflation, interest rates, and economic growth, is essential for navigating market cycles. Conclusion: Navigating the Economic Landscape The January core PCE price index data, while meeting expectations, underscores the ongoing focus on inflation and the Federal Reserve’s delicate balancing act. For cryptocurrency investors, this report serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of the crypto market with the broader economy. By staying informed, understanding key economic indicators , and adapting to the evolving macroeconomic landscape, you can better navigate the exciting, yet often unpredictable, world of digital assets.

Ripple (XRP) price moves to defend $2 support as ETF approval edges closer Ripple (XRP) experienced significant volatility this week, influenced by impending inflationary pressures from tariffs set to commence on March 1. Early Friday, XRP’s price dipped to $1.95 during European trading hours. However, the U.S. trading session brought renewed momentum following CME Group’s announcement to introduce Solana futures contracts on March 17, pending regulatory approval. This development has sparked optimism for altcoin ETFs, leading to increased buying interest in XRP and other altcoins with pending ETF applications. XRP price action, Feb 28, 2025 | TradingView As a result, Ripple price rebounded by 5% within the day, reaching $2.14 at press time. While Solana, the main subject CME’s announcement, had its potential gains constrained by recent controversy surrounding Libra memecoin rug pull and impending 11.2 million SOL payouts from FTX Estate on March 1, investors have shifted focus to XRP, Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin ( LTC ), all of which have ETF applications under review. XRP open interest holds firm above $3B as traders anticipate ETF decision XRP swift rebound to $2.14 after testing a three-week low of $1.95 highlights a strong market intent to maintain the $2 support level. Trends observed within XRP’s derivatives markets on Friday further support this narrative Coinglass ‘ Open Interest data indicates that, despite a 24.4% price decline over the past five days—from $2.58 on Monday to $1.95 on Friday—XRP’s open interest only decreased by 19.3%, from $3.73 billion to $3.01 billion in the same period. XRP Open Interest vs. Price | Coinglass When prices decline at quicker rate than Open Interest, it typically suggests that many bullish traders are opting to increase their margin requirements rather than liquidate their long positions. This behavior aligns with recent developments, as many XRP speculative traders appear to be holding out for a favorable ETF decision, with approval odds seemingly increasing. Should XRP’s open interest remain above the $3 billion threshold observed this week, bearish forces may find it challenging to drive the price decisively below the $2 mark. In summary, XRP’s resilience above the $2 support, coupled with steadfast open interest levels and positive ETF-related news, suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency in the near term. XRP Price Forecast: Consolidation above $2 keeps bears at bay XRP price forecast remains neutral as the token consolidates above the critical $2 support level, signaling market indecision. The Bollinger Bands indicate contracting volatility, with price action oscillating around the mid-line, suggesting a potential breakout. A move above $2.50 would confirm bullish momentum, while a close below $2.10 could expose XRP to further downside risks. The MACD indicator leans bearish, with the signal line maintaining its downward slope, reflecting waning bullish momentum. The histogram prints shallow red bars, indicating diminishing selling pressure. However, if MACD flips positive, it could signal an early trend reversal favoring bulls. XRP Price Forecast Trading volume remains steady, with notable buying interest emerging after XRP’s 29% drop over the last eight days. This suggests that buyers are accumulating near key support levels. Should bulls sustain price action above $2.15, a rebound toward $2.50 remains on the table. However, a breakdown below $2 could accelerate losses toward the lower Bollinger Band at $1.95, placing bears in control. The coming sessions will determine whether XRP stabilizes or faces another leg down.

This will allow market participants to obtain futures contracts whose micro contracts amount to 25 SOL and typical contracts amount to 500 SOL and are settled in cash. The rollout expands CME Group’s existing offering of cryptocurrency derivatives, including Bitcoin and Ether Futures, which has attracted demand among institutional and retail investors looking to hedge their risk in the highly volatile digital asset market. By launching Solana futures, CME Group is reinforcing its commitment to offering an extensive range of regulated crypto investment products that meet the changing needs of market participants. It provides an alternative route, similar to holding shares in blue-chip technology companies, for traditional finance investors to gain exposure to the asset class without directly holding any of the assets, which is one of the leading blockchain networks. The group expects this measure to help attract new capital to crypto markets, enhance liquidity, and stabilize prices. However, listing Solana futures suggests a growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies after institutional interest in digital assets. Cash-settled contracts enable traders to bet on the price of Solana or hedge open positions inside a regulated framework, which may help bridge the gap between traditional finance and the emerging digital economy. Solana’s price surges following CME Futures announcement The price of Solana (SOL) soared by around 17% on February 28, jumping from around $125 to approximately $146, after the announcement of Solana (SOL) futures slated to go live in March. This sharp increase reflects renewed investor interest and optimism surrounding regulated derivatives for the asset. Source:Tradingview Nevertheless, SOL has held a robust downtrend for the entire month of February. Its price has lost 46% since the beginning of the month after going up to $233. Broader market conditions, traders’ booking profits, and overall macroeconomic trends that have influenced the crypto industry have spurred this continued downside price action. Currently, the SOL price is trading significantly below its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), an essential dynamic support level indicating the general direction of the long-term trend. If an asset trades below the 200DMA, that generally provides sentiment that traders are bearish on the asset. Moreover, according to technical indicators, SOL looks close to a price bottom. The relative strength index (RSI) now stands at 33, just above the oversold level 30. This level of RSI indicates that selling momentum may be running out of steam and is primed for a reversal if the buy-side interest returns. As the market digests the implications of CME Group’s Solana futures launch, investors will be keen to see if this trend brings new upward momentum to SOL’s price action or if wider market patterns continue to limit SOL prices. Fresh liquidity required for crypto market rebound Liquidity is to financial markets what oxygen is to a diver; the lifeblood for its survival and growth. Still, the absence of livelier inflows of new capital crystallized the crypto rally that originally gained a broader footing when United States President Donald Trump won reelection there. New money needs to come in for the price to be driven higher, but when that doesn’t occur, it leads to digital asset stagnation or corrections. In crypto, liquidity has historically been a key driver of market cycles. Therefore, Bitcoin is the most dominant and widely adopted cryptocurrency and will be the first to bring in money. When Bitcoin’s price increases, it typically increases institutional and retail investor confidence. As the price of Bitcoin rises, money usually starts flowing into large-cap altcoins like Ethereum and Solana, which are considered more stable but still offer a much better risk-return ratio than Bitcoin. Over time, when market participants demand greater gains, capital rotates further up the risk curve into mid-cap and smaller-cap altcoins. More volatile than equities, these assets tend to have more outsized returns in strong bull cycles. But that cascading effect is halted without new liquidity, and market rotations slow down, preventing any broad altcoin run. Under these dynamics, the crypto market’s ability to regain bullish momentum will rely on the inflow of new capital, whether from institutional adoption, regulatory developments, or macroeconomic news that keeps investors in a risk-on mode. Until then, the market will likely trade in periods of consolidation and range-bound volatility, with Bitcoin’s moves still setting the overall trend. According to Master Ventures founder Kyle Chassé, Bitcoin prices are collapsing because hedge funds and institutional investors looking to profit from the difference between spot BTC prices and futures prices are being squeezed out of that trade as the price difference narrows. Bitcoin’s uptrend needs new, organic buyers who truly believe in the asset, and institutional investors chasing yield alone may not be enough, said Chassé. However, a new research report from Matrixport claims that Bitcoin’s ongoing correction may last through at least April, given persistent macroeconomic headwinds.

This decline is part of a broader correction that began on January 16, following a peak of $3.40. Several factors contribute to this downward trend, including ongoing legal challenges, significant liquidations in the derivatives market, and broader market volatility. Legal Challenges and Market Sentiment The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, alleging unregistered securities sales. In August 2024, a federal judge ruled partially in favor of Ripple, imposing a $125 million fine—substantially less than the SEC’s initial $2 billion demand—and affirming that XRP is not a security for retail sales. Despite this, the SEC appealed the decision in October 2024, prolonging legal uncertainties that continue to impact investor confidence and XRP’s market performance. Derivatives Market Liquidations The recent price drop has been accompanied by significant liquidations in the derivatives market. Over the past 24 hours, approximately $25.5 million worth of XRP futures positions were liquidated, with long positions accounting for $22.2 million. This wave of liquidations indicates strong bearish pressure, as leveraged traders are compelled to exit their positions, further intensifying the downward momentum. Technical Analysis and Support Levels From a technical perspective, XRP’s price is approaching a critical support level at $2.00. This psychological threshold coincides with the lower boundary of a descending parallel channel. A decisive break below this support could trigger further declines, potentially targeting the recent low of $1.76 observed on February 3, and the $1.50 level, which aligns with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Conversely, maintaining support above $2.00 could provide a foundation for a potential recovery, contingent on improved market sentiment and resolution of legal uncertainties. Broader Market Context The overall cryptocurrency market has experienced heightened volatility, influenced by macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments. The global crypto market capitalization has decreased by 6.6%, reaching $2.66 trillion. Events such as significant security breaches and geopolitical tensions have contributed to a risk-averse environment, prompting investors to reassess their positions across various digital assets, including XRP. Conclusion XRP’s recent price decline is the result of a confluence of factors, including ongoing legal challenges with the SEC, substantial liquidations in the derivatives market, and broader market volatility. The critical support level at $2.00 serves as a pivotal point for traders and investors. A breach below this threshold could lead to further losses, while successful defense may pave the way for stabilization and potential recovery. Market participants are advised to monitor legal developments and market dynamics closely when making investment decisions related to XRP.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-28 23:55:00

This guide highlights four cryptocurrencies—Web3Bay (3BAY), Avalanche (AVAX), Polkadot (DOT), and Litecoin (LTC)—that stand out for their solid foundations, growing ecosystems, and practical applications, presenting them as the top bullish cryptos to buy for 100x returns. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY) – Pioneering Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay ’s 3BAY token is at the forefront of decentralized e-commerce, built for sustained value growth. It incorporates deflationary tactics, staking incentives, and governance participation, appealing strongly to investors. 3BAY’s deflationary approach gradually reduces token supply, enhancing scarcity and long-term appeal, a strategy that has benefited coins like Binance Coin (BNB) with substantial growth. Staking offers additional value, rewarding holders with passive earnings while bolstering network security. This encourages longer-term investment and stabilizes the token price. Governance voting allows token holders to shape Web3Bay’s strategic decisions, promoting a user-led platform ethos. Web3Bay is transforming online shopping by cutting out excessive transaction fees. Unlike traditional platforms such as eBay and Amazon, where sellers lose much to various fees, Web3Bay leverages smart contracts for direct transactions, minimizing disputes and eliminating chargebacks, creating a more equitable marketplace for both sellers and buyers. The presale of Web3Bay has already raised $1.57 million and is now in Stage 4, with 3BAY priced at $0.005247 and over 390 million tokens sold. As the presale progresses, the token price is set to rise, positioning early investors for potential significant gains. With a robust ecosystem and a compelling use case, Web3Bay is among the top bullish cryptos to buy for achieving 100x returns. 2. Polkadot (DOT) – Bridging Blockchains for Enhanced Interoperability Polkadot is engineered to connect various blockchains into a single network, facilitating smooth interactions and data sharing—a distinct edge over other cryptocurrencies. The strength of Polkadot stems from its parachain auction system, which drives competition and innovation by allowing projects to secure network slots. Its scalable nature makes it a preferred choice for developers keen on crafting cutting-edge applications. As blockchain integration deepens, Polkadot’s role in fostering inter-chain collaboration will become ever more vital. With robust technical foundations and ongoing ecosystem growth, DOT is poised for significant value appreciation, making it one of the top bullish cryptos to buy for 100x gains. 3. Avalanche (AVAX) – A Leader in High-Speed Smart Contract Execution Avalanche is renowned as one of the quickest and most scalable blockchains, with a distinctive consensus method and specialized subnets catering to various applications, attracting both developers and big businesses. Its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second affordably makes it a go-to for decentralized apps and DeFi initiatives. Its expanding network, reinforced by significant institutional partnerships, underscores its potential for long-term growth. AVAX’s pricing trends indicate strong future growth, particularly as its network continues to be adopted widely. If this demand persists, Avalanche could well be among the top bullish cryptos to buy for 100x returns in the near future. 4. Litecoin (LTC) – A Proven, Secure Digital Payment Method For over a decade, Litecoin has been a reliable cryptocurrency, facilitating quick and secure transactions. Often considered the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, LTC has demonstrated enduring value and continues to draw investors seeking dependable, yet potentially lucrative assets. Recent enhancements, such as the MimbleWimble privacy protocol, have boosted Litecoin’s security and utility. These developments enhance LTC’s appeal for those valuing quick, private transactions. With a growing number of merchants accepting Litecoin, its potential for price increases is substantial. Given its proven track record and ongoing improvements, Litecoin stands out as one of the top bullish cryptos to buy for investors aiming for 100x returns. Key Highlights! Identifying top bullish cryptos to buy with the potential for 100x returns involves a thorough examination of their applications, adoption rates, and technological advancements. Web3Bay (3BAY), Avalanche (AVAX), Polkadot (DOT), and Litecoin (LTC) each bring unique strengths that set them up for exponential growth. Whether through Web3Bay’s e-commerce innovations, Avalanche’s swift processing capabilities, Polkadot’s blockchain unification, or Litecoin’s reliable payment solutions, these projects possess the foundational qualities necessary for substantial returns. Investors considering cryptocurrencies for major gains should weigh these assets as key components of their portfolios.

He’s alerting his massive fanbase about fraudulent memecoins popping up using his name. But here’s the kicker: Ronaldinho himself is teasing the launch of his official token ! Crypto enthusiasts and football fans alike are buzzing – is this the next big celebrity memecoin sensation? Let’s dive into what we know and what to watch out for in this exciting, yet risky, crypto space. Ronaldinho’s Crypto Warning: Fake Memecoins Alert! In a direct message to his followers on X, Ronaldinho didn’t mince words. He clearly stated that while he appreciates the enthusiasm, he hasn’t launched any official token yet. This is crucial news because, as the popularity of celebrity-backed cryptocurrencies explodes, so does the prevalence of scams and fake tokens trying to capitalize on the hype. Here’s what Ronaldinho had to say: [blockquote] Stay tuned, big news coming soon… but be careful with fake tokens! [/blockquote] This statement serves as both a warning and a tantalizing hint. Ronaldinho is acknowledging the existing fake tokens bearing his name, protecting his fans from potential scams, and simultaneously building anticipation for his legitimate entry into the crypto market. The Allure of Celebrity Memecoins: Why the Hype? Why are celebrity memecoins such a hot trend right now? The answer lies in a potent mix of factors: Instant Brand Recognition: Celebrities like Ronaldinho come with built-in global recognition and massive fan bases. This instantly translates to potential users and investors for a memecoin. Community Engagement: Fans are eager to connect with their idols in new and innovative ways. A celebrity memecoin offers a sense of ownership and participation in their favorite star’s ventures. Viral Potential: The internet thrives on trends and memes. Combining a celebrity with a memecoin creates a recipe for virality, driving rapid adoption and price surges (at least initially). Financial Gains (Potential): Early investors in successful memecoins have seen astronomical returns. This ‘get-rich-quick’ allure is a significant driver, although highly risky. However, the celebrity memecoin space is also fraught with peril. The very factors that make them attractive – hype and virality – can also lead to dramatic crashes and rug pulls. This is why Ronaldinho’s warning is so timely and essential. Navigating the Risks: Spotting Crypto Scams and Fake Tokens Ronaldinho’s caution about fake tokens is a vital reminder of the risks involved in the crypto world, especially with memecoins. Here’s how you can protect yourself from crypto scams and identify fake tokens: Red Flag Actionable Insight Unofficial Channels: Token announcements only on unofficial social media or Telegram groups. Verify Information: Always check the celebrity’s official social media accounts and website for announcements. Cross-reference with reputable crypto news sources. Lack of Transparency: No whitepaper, roadmap, or team information available. Do Your Research (DYOR): Legitimate crypto projects provide detailed information about their project, goals, and team. If it’s missing, be extremely cautious. Unrealistic Promises: Guarantees of massive returns or instant wealth. Skepticism is Key: Crypto investments are inherently risky. Promises that sound too good to be true usually are. Pressure to Buy Quickly: Urgent calls to action and fear of missing out (FOMO) tactics. Take Your Time: Never rush into an investment decision. Scammers often use urgency to pressure victims. Suspicious Contract Address: Contract address doesn’t match official announcements or is from an unknown source. Verify Contract: If a contract address is provided, double-check its authenticity on blockchain explorers like Etherscan or BscScan and compare it to official sources. Ronaldinho Memecoin Launch: What Could It Look Like? While details are still scarce, Ronaldinho hinting at an official memecoin launch opens up exciting possibilities. What could we expect from a Ronaldinho-backed crypto project? Here are some speculative, yet plausible, features: Fan Engagement Platform: The memecoin could be integrated into a platform that offers exclusive content, NFTs, or experiences for Ronaldinho fans. Charitable Initiatives: A portion of the token’s transactions or proceeds could be directed towards Ronaldinho’s charitable foundations, adding a layer of social impact. Gaming and Metaverse Integration: Given Ronaldinho’s background, the memecoin could be linked to sports-related games or metaverse experiences. Community Governance: Token holders might get a say in certain aspects of the project, fostering a sense of community ownership. Of course, these are just speculations. The actual utility and features of Ronaldinho’s memecoin will depend on the project’s specifics, which are yet to be revealed. However, the potential for innovation and fan engagement is definitely there. Stay Tuned and Stay Safe: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts Ronaldinho’s announcement is a potent reminder to approach the crypto space with both excitement and caution. Here are some actionable insights to keep in mind: Follow Official Channels: Keep a close eye on Ronaldinho’s verified social media accounts for official announcements about his crypto project. DYOR (Do Your Own Research): Before investing in any cryptocurrency, especially memecoins, conduct thorough research. Understand the project, its team, and its risks. Start Small: If you decide to invest in Ronaldinho’s memecoin (or any memecoin), start with a small amount you can afford to lose. Security First: Use secure crypto wallets and be wary of phishing scams and fake websites. Patience is a Virtue: Wait for official launch details and avoid rushing into buying tokens based on rumors or hype. Conclusion: The Ronaldinho Memecoin Saga – A Thrilling Chapter in Crypto? Ronaldinho’s entry into the crypto world with a teased official token launch is undoubtedly a significant event. His warning about fake memecoins underscores the importance of vigilance in this volatile market. As we await further details, the crypto community is on the edge of its seat, wondering what ‘big news’ Ronaldinho has in store. Will his memecoin be a game-changer, or just another flash in the pan? Only time will tell. But one thing is certain: Ronaldinho’s foray into crypto adds another layer of excitement and intrigue to the ever-evolving world of digital currencies.

The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is known for its volatility, but the latest news surrounding Virtual Protocol is sending shockwaves. This innovative AI agent platform, designed to revolutionize blockchain-based AI monetization, has experienced a breathtaking Virtual Protocol Revenue plunge. Daily earnings have plummeted a staggering 96.8% from a peak of over $1 million in early January to less than $35,000 by late February. Let’s dive deep into what’s fueling this dramatic downturn and what it means for the future of AI in crypto. The Alarming DeFi Revenue Decline: Numbers Don’t Lie The data, sourced from Dune Analytics and highlighted by Cointelegraph, paints a stark picture of DeFi Revenue Decline for Virtual Protocol. Let’s break down the key figures: Peak Revenue (Jan 2nd): Over $1 million daily Current Revenue (Feb 27th): Below $35,000 daily Percentage Decline: 96.8% This isn’t just a minor dip; it’s a cliff dive. The sheer scale of the revenue reduction raises serious questions about the platform’s sustainability and the broader market sentiment towards AI and crypto integrations. The decline is especially pronounced on Ethereum layer-2 Base, a network that was expected to be a growth engine for Virtual Protocol. Metric Jan 2nd (Peak) Feb 27th (Current) Change Daily Revenue >$1,000,000 -96.8% The table above clearly illustrates the severity of the DeFi Revenue Decline . For ten consecutive days leading up to February 27th, revenue on Base has languished below $1,000. This consistent underperformance on a key network is a major red flag. Base Network Crypto Struggles: What Went Wrong? Why is Base Network Crypto experiencing such a sharp downturn for Virtual Protocol? Base, an Ethereum layer-2 solution, was designed to offer lower transaction fees and faster speeds, making it attractive for DeFi applications. Several factors could be contributing to this disappointing performance: Reduced User Activity: A significant drop in user engagement on the Virtual Protocol platform on Base. Shifting Market Trends: Changing investor preferences or a move away from AI-focused crypto projects. Increased Competition: The emergence of rival platforms offering similar AI and blockchain monetization solutions on Base or other networks. Tokenomics Issues: Potential flaws in the Virtual Protocol tokenomics that are disincentivizing user participation or revenue generation on Base. It’s crucial to analyze these potential causes to understand if the issues are specific to Virtual Protocol’s implementation on Base Network Crypto , or if they reflect broader challenges within the Base ecosystem or the AI crypto niche itself. Blockchain AI Monetization: Solana Expansion – A Lifeline? In an attempt to mitigate the revenue slump, Virtual Protocol expanded its reach to Solana, another prominent blockchain known for its speed and scalability. The hope was that the Solana ecosystem could provide a fresh stream of users and revenue, offsetting the losses on Base. However, the initial results of this Blockchain AI Monetization strategy on Solana appear underwhelming. While expansion to new networks is generally a positive step, the numbers reveal a significant disparity in adoption: Solana Wallets Holding Virtuals Tokens: 11,000 Base Wallets Holding Virtuals Tokens: 170,000 The stark contrast in wallet numbers indicates that the Solana community has been slower to embrace Virtual Protocol compared to the Base community. This limited adoption on Solana means that, at least in the short term, it is unlikely to compensate for the substantial DeFi Revenue Decline experienced on Base. The Future of AI Crypto Platform Revenue: Is There Hope for Recovery? The dramatic revenue plunge raises critical questions about the sustainability of the AI Crypto Platform model and Virtual Protocol’s future. While the current situation looks bleak, it’s important to consider potential paths to recovery and growth: Platform Enhancements: Virtual Protocol could introduce new features, improve user experience, or refine its AI agent functionalities to attract more users and revenue. Community Engagement: Actively engaging with the community, addressing concerns, and building stronger relationships with users and developers could revitalize interest. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with other projects or platforms within the AI and crypto space could unlock new opportunities and revenue streams. Market Recovery: A broader market upturn in the crypto sector could lift all boats, including Virtual Protocol, and potentially boost revenue. However, without significant changes or a major shift in market sentiment, the current trajectory suggests a challenging road ahead for Virtual Protocol. The 96.8% revenue drop is a stark reminder of the risks and volatility inherent in the crypto world, especially for projects in emerging niches like AI Crypto Platform development. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for AI and DeFi Virtual Protocol’s staggering revenue decline serves as a potent wake-up call for both the AI and DeFi sectors. It highlights the challenges of building sustainable revenue models in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape and underscores the importance of user adoption, community engagement, and continuous innovation. While the future remains uncertain for Virtual Protocol, its story offers valuable lessons for other projects navigating the complexities of blockchain-based AI monetization. The dramatic Virtual Protocol Revenue plunge is a stark reminder that even promising projects can face sudden and severe downturns in the volatile crypto market. Investors and developers alike should heed this warning and prioritize robust strategies for long-term sustainability and growth.

40981249,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135503,1740787885,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent Warning: Bitcoin ETF Sales Could Trigger Terrifying BTC Crash, Says Peter Schiff",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-sales-crash-warning/,"Is the Bitcoin dream turning into a nightmare? Just when the crypto world was celebrating the Bitcoin ETF approvals, a chilling voice of caution has emerged. Peter Schiff, the CEO of Euro Pacific Capital and a notorious Bitcoin skeptic, has dropped a bombshell, suggesting that the very ETFs that were hailed as Bitcoin’s saviors might just trigger its downfall. Let’s dive deep into Schiff’s alarming prediction and understand what it could mean for your crypto portfolio. Decoding Peter Schiff’s Dire Bitcoin Crash Prediction Peter Schiff, known for his bearish stance on Bitcoin and preference for gold, didn’t mince words in his recent X (formerly Twitter) post. He argues that Bitcoin speculators, possibly caught up in the recent hype and going “all-in” above the $100,000 mark (a hypothetical future price point mentioned in his commentary), may have exhausted their funds. This leaves them vulnerable and unable to “buy the dip” if prices fall. His tweet essentially suggests: Speculator Exhaustion: Schiff believes many Bitcoin investors are overextended, having invested heavily at higher price levels, anticipating further gains fueled by ETF inflows. ETF Sales as Catalyst: He posits that if Bitcoin ETFs experience significant outflows or sales, it could initiate a downward spiral in BTC price. These sales would add selling pressure in the market. Deeper Crash Risk: The combination of exhausted buyers and ETF-driven selling pressure, according to Schiff, could lead to a more substantial and painful Bitcoin crash than many anticipate. Here’s the tweet that set the crypto community abuzz: While Schiff’s skepticism towards Bitcoin is well-documented, his warnings often resonate with a segment of the market that fears a potential crypto bubble burst. But is there any merit to his latest prediction? Let’s analyze the factors at play. The Double-Edged Sword of Bitcoin ETFs: Benefits and Risks Bitcoin ETFs were celebrated as a landmark achievement for the crypto industry, promising to open Bitcoin investment to a wider audience, particularly institutional investors who prefer regulated and traditional investment vehicles. And they have indeed brought significant inflows into the Bitcoin market. However, like any financial instrument, they come with their own set of potential risks: Benefits of Bitcoin ETFs Potential Risks of Bitcoin ETFs Increased Accessibility for Retail and Institutional Investors Market Volatility Amplification due to ETF trading Legitimization of Bitcoin as an Asset Class Potential for large outflows to exacerbate price drops Improved Liquidity in the Bitcoin Market Dependence on ETF market sentiment; influenced by broader financial markets Simplified Investment Process through Traditional Brokerage Accounts Regulatory scrutiny and potential changes in ETF rules As you can see, while Bitcoin ETFs offer numerous advantages, the risk of ETF sales triggering price declines is a valid concern. If investors, especially large institutional holders, decide to reduce their Bitcoin ETF holdings, it could inject significant selling pressure into the market, potentially leading to a BTC price correction. Could ETF Sales Really Trigger a Bitcoin Crash? Examining the Scenarios To understand if ETF sales could indeed lead to a Bitcoin crash , let’s consider a few scenarios: Profit Taking: Investors who bought into Bitcoin ETFs early might decide to take profits after a price surge. Large-scale profit-taking could lead to ETF outflows and downward pressure on the BTC price . Broader Market Downturn: If traditional financial markets experience a correction or recession, investors might reduce risk across their portfolios, including selling off Bitcoin ETFs . This correlation with traditional markets is a newly introduced factor with the advent of ETFs. Regulatory Concerns: Unexpected negative regulatory news or actions related to cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin ETFs could spook investors and trigger ETF sales, leading to a Bitcoin crash . Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events or economic shocks could trigger widespread panic selling across all asset classes, including Bitcoin and related ETFs. It’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs , while bringing in new capital, also introduces new dynamics and potential vulnerabilities. The extent to which ETF sales can impact the BTC price is still being observed and analyzed. Peter Schiff’s Perspective: A Contrarian View or a Valid Warning? Peter Schiff has consistently been a vocal critic of Bitcoin, arguing that it is a speculative bubble and lacks intrinsic value. His warnings should be viewed in the context of his long-held beliefs. However, even if we disagree with his overall stance, it’s prudent to consider the potential risks he highlights. Schiff’s perspective serves as a valuable contrarian viewpoint in a market often dominated by bullish narratives. His emphasis on the potential for ETF sales to trigger a Bitcoin crash encourages investors to consider the downside risks and not just focus on the potential for continued price appreciation. Navigating the Volatility: Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Investors So, what should Bitcoin investors do in light of Peter Schiff’s warning and the inherent volatility of the crypto market? Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk. Manage Your Risk: Invest only what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrencies are high-risk assets, and price corrections are a normal part of the market cycle. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and expert opinions, both bullish and bearish. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider DCA, which involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, reducing the impact of short-term price volatility. Have a Strategy: Define your investment goals and risk tolerance. Have a clear strategy for buying, selling, and holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: Heeding the Warning Signs in the Bitcoin Market Peter Schiff’s warning about Bitcoin ETF sales potentially triggering a Bitcoin crash is a stark reminder of the inherent risks in the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin ETFs have brought positive developments, they also introduce new dynamics and potential vulnerabilities. Whether Schiff’s specific prediction comes to pass remains to be seen, but his cautionary words serve as a valuable check against excessive optimism and encourage a more balanced and risk-aware approach to Bitcoin investment. The crypto market is known for its wild swings, and periods of exuberance are often followed by corrections. Staying informed, managing risk effectively, and considering diverse perspectives are crucial for navigating the volatile world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Don’t dismiss warnings outright; instead, use them as opportunities to re-evaluate your strategy and prepare for potential market shifts.

40981297,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135509,1740788091,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Revelation: Bitcoin Traders Face Steepest Unrealized Losses Since FTX Disaster,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-traders-face-losses-ftx/,"Are you holding Bitcoin and feeling a knot in your stomach? You’re not alone. Recent data reveals a potentially alarming trend for Bitcoin investors. CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno has dropped a bombshell on X, highlighting that Bitcoin traders are currently grappling with significant unrealized losses . In fact, these losses have plummeted to a staggering -18.86%, marking the most substantial downturn since the infamous FTX collapse in November 2022. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the broader crypto landscape. Why are Bitcoin Traders Experiencing Such Heavy Unrealized Losses? To understand the gravity of the situation, it’s crucial to grasp what “unrealized losses” signify. Essentially, these are losses that exist on paper. If you bought Bitcoin at a higher price than its current market value, you’re sitting on an unrealized loss. It only becomes ‘realized’ when you sell your Bitcoin at a loss. So, why are Bitcoin traders facing such deep unrealized losses now? Several factors could be at play: Market Correction: The crypto market is known for its volatility. After periods of upward momentum, corrections are natural. This could be a phase where the market is simply cooling off after a run-up. Broader Economic Concerns: Global economic uncertainties, inflation worries, and interest rate hikes often impact risk-on assets like Bitcoin. When traditional markets wobble, crypto markets often feel the tremors even more intensely. Negative News & Sentiment: Any negative news, regulatory concerns, or bearish predictions can quickly dampen market sentiment and trigger price drops, leading to increased unrealized losses . Whale Activity: Large Bitcoin holders (whales) making significant moves can also influence market prices, sometimes leading to sharp declines and increased losses for smaller traders. Unrealized Losses vs. The FTX Collapse: What’s the Connection? The comparison to the FTX collapse is particularly concerning. The FTX debacle was a catastrophic event that sent shockwaves through the entire crypto industry. It eroded trust, triggered massive sell-offs, and led to a significant crypto market downturn . The fact that unrealized losses are now mirroring levels seen during that period suggests a potentially serious situation. Let’s put this into perspective: Event Unrealized Losses (Bitcoin Traders) Market Sentiment Market Reaction Current Situation (Reported by CryptoQuant) -18.86% Cautious to Bearish Price Correction, Increased Volatility FTX Collapse (November 2022) Similar Levels (-18.86% or higher) Extreme Fear, Panic Massive Sell-offs, Market Crash As you can see, the current level of unrealized losses is a stark reminder of a period of extreme market stress. While it doesn’t necessarily mean we’re heading for another FTX-level event, it’s a red flag that demands attention. Is This a Crypto Market Downturn or Just a Temporary Dip? The million-dollar question on everyone’s mind is: are we entering a prolonged crypto market downturn , or is this just a temporary dip? Predicting the future of the crypto market is notoriously difficult, but we can analyze the indicators: On-Chain Data: Metrics like exchange flows, active addresses, and miner activity can provide clues about the overall health and direction of the market. Technical Analysis: Chart patterns, moving averages, and other technical indicators can help identify potential trend reversals or continuations. Fundamental Analysis: Evaluating the underlying technology, adoption rates, and real-world use cases of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offers a long-term perspective. Market Sentiment: Keeping an eye on news headlines, social media sentiment, and fear & greed indices can gauge the prevailing market mood. Currently, the -18.86% unrealized losses figure suggests caution. It indicates that a significant portion of Bitcoin traders are underwater on their investments. Whether this translates into a deeper downturn depends on how the market reacts in the coming days and weeks. Navigating Investment Risk in a Volatile Bitcoin Market For anyone involved in cryptocurrency, understanding and managing investment risk is paramount. The current situation with Bitcoin traders facing substantial unrealized losses underscores the inherent risks of this asset class. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate these turbulent waters: Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes to mitigate risk. Risk Management: Determine your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider DCA – investing a fixed amount at regular intervals. This can help smooth out volatility. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, analysis, and on-chain data. Knowledge is your best defense in a volatile market. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency markets are cyclical. Focusing on the long-term potential of Bitcoin and blockchain technology can help you weather short-term storms. The current level of unrealized losses for Bitcoin traders is undoubtedly a cause for concern, mirroring the market conditions seen during the FTX collapse. While it’s impossible to predict the future with certainty, this data point serves as a critical reminder of the volatility and investment risk inherent in the crypto market.

Will They Stage a March Recovery?,https://bitzo.com/2025/03/shina-inu-shib-and-dogecoin-doge-locate-vital-support-levels-will-they-stage-a-march-recovery,"The recent price action of Shina Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) shows that they are finding key support zones. These support levels could be crucial for determining their next moves. Coin enthusiasts and investors are keen to see if March will bring a turnaround. This article delves into whether these cryptos are poised for a comeback. Shiba Inu Price Volatility and Key Levels Shiba Inu experienced a sharp drop of about 26.6% in the past month, while the six-month decline is more subdued at nearly 4.7%. Price action appears turbulent in this short-term period, indicating increased selling pressure and a weaker market stance. Historical trends reflect a swing that contrasts rapid short-term drops with a milder longer-term sentiment. Current price moves between approximately 0.0000158 and 0.0000235 dollars, with immediate resistance around 0.0000281 dollars and support near 0.0000127 dollars. Bears dominate given the negative indicators and declining momentum, yet the price remains contained between these levels. Traders might consider trading within this range, looking for potential reversals close to the support level. Upward Momentum Amid Short-Term Setbacks in Dogecoin Last month, Dogecoin experienced a significant drop of nearly 42%. However, over the past six months, the coin has shown an impressive gain of 83%, indicating a long-term recovery trend despite recent fluctuations. The past half-year has been marked by volatility, with investors observing substantial price movements. This performance suggests a potential rebound phase, encouraging a closer examination of market conditions and sentiment surrounding Dogecoin. Current levels for Dogecoin are between $0.28 and $0.41, with immediate support at $0.23 and resistance around $0.49. Although bears are active after a 27% drop last week, indicators such as an oversold RSI suggest a possibility of buying interest. Traders may consider entering positions near support levels while monitoring resistance to assess any potential trend reversal. Conclusion SHIB and DOGE have identified key support levels. These points will be crucial in guiding potential price rebounds. If the current support holds, the coins might see a recovery in March. However, breaking below these supports could lead to further declines. Traders should watch these levels closely to gauge the next moves Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Are you ready for another sign that institutional adoption of Bitcoin is accelerating? Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently dropped a bombshell on X: BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has included its spot BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) in one of its model portfolios for the very first time. While the initial allocation might be modest, this move is a significant indicator of how traditional finance is increasingly embracing Bitcoin. Let’s dive into what this strategic decision by BlackRock could mean for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Why is BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Model Portfolio Inclusion a Big Deal? For those closely following the cryptocurrency space, the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States was a monumental event. However, the real game-changer is seeing these ETFs integrated into traditional investment frameworks. Model portfolios are pre-built investment strategies that financial advisors use to guide their clients. BlackRock, being a behemoth in asset management, offering a nod to Bitcoin through its IBIT ETF in these portfolios carries substantial weight. Here’s why this is noteworthy: Validation and Mainstream Acceptance: BlackRock’s decision signals a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class within mainstream finance. It’s no longer relegated to the fringes; it’s entering the portfolios of institutional giants. Increased Accessibility: Model portfolios influence investment decisions across a wide spectrum of advisors and clients. Including IBIT means more advisors will consider and potentially recommend Bitcoin allocation to their clients, broadening access to Bitcoin investment. Potential for Larger Allocations Down the Line: While the initial allocation in this particular model portfolio is described as ‘minimal’ within the alternative investment category, this is likely just the beginning. As institutions become more comfortable and confident with Bitcoin’s performance and regulatory landscape, we could see these allocations increase significantly over time. Ripple Effect on Other Institutions: BlackRock’s move can set a precedent for other major financial institutions. When a leader like BlackRock takes a step, others often follow, fearing being left behind in a potentially lucrative market. This could trigger a wave of institutional Bitcoin adoption . Understanding Model Portfolios and Their Significance for Bitcoin ETFs To truly grasp the impact of this news, it’s important to understand what model portfolios are and why their adoption of Bitcoin ETFs is crucial. Think of model portfolios as ready-made investment recipes. They are designed by investment experts to achieve specific financial goals with a certain level of risk. Financial advisors then use these models as starting points for building customized portfolios for their clients. Here’s a breakdown of their importance in this context: Aspect Significance for Bitcoin ETF Inclusion Guidance for Advisors Model portfolios provide advisors with a structured framework, making it easier to recommend Bitcoin ETFs to clients who might be new to crypto. Risk Management Framework Inclusion in a model portfolio suggests that BlackRock has assessed and incorporated the risk profile of Bitcoin within a broader portfolio context. Benchmarking and Performance Tracking Once IBIT is part of a model portfolio, its performance will be tracked and compared against benchmarks, further legitimizing it as a mainstream investment option. Scalability and Reach Model portfolios are used across vast networks of financial advisors, meaning the inclusion of IBIT has the potential to reach a massive investor base. IBIT: BlackRock’s Gateway to Bitcoin Exposure The specific Bitcoin ETF chosen by BlackRock for this initial foray into model portfolios is IBIT. Launched in January 2024, IBIT quickly became one of the most successful spot Bitcoin ETFs, attracting billions in assets under management. Its selection for model portfolios further solidifies its position as a leading vehicle for institutional Bitcoin investment. Key features of IBIT that likely contributed to its selection include: BlackRock’s Reputation and Expertise: BlackRock’s brand name and proven track record in asset management provide investors with a sense of security and trust. Liquidity and Trading Volume: IBIT has demonstrated robust liquidity and high trading volumes, making it easy for institutional investors to enter and exit positions. Competitive Fee Structure: IBIT’s competitive fee structure makes it an attractive option compared to other Bitcoin investment products. Efficient Bitcoin Exposure: As a spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT directly holds Bitcoin, providing investors with direct exposure to the underlying asset without the complexities of self-custody. What Does Minimal Allocation Mean and What to Expect Next? It’s crucial to acknowledge that the initial Bitcoin ETF model portfolio allocation is described as ‘minimal.’ This is not unexpected. Institutions typically take a cautious approach when incorporating new asset classes, especially volatile ones like Bitcoin. Think of this as a ‘toe in the water’ approach. BlackRock is testing the waters, observing performance, and gathering data. However, even a minimal allocation is a powerful signal. It suggests: Long-Term Vision: BlackRock is not just experimenting; they are strategically positioning themselves for the future of digital assets. This initial step lays the groundwork for potentially larger allocations as Bitcoin matures and market conditions evolve. Gradual Integration: Expect a phased approach. Institutions are likely to gradually increase their Bitcoin exposure over time as they gain confidence and see positive results. Focus on Risk-Adjusted Returns: The allocation size will likely be determined by risk-adjusted return considerations within the overall portfolio strategy. As Bitcoin’s volatility potentially decreases over time and its long-term growth narrative strengthens, allocations could rise. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin and Institutional Investment BlackRock adding IBIT to its model portfolio is more than just a minor portfolio adjustment; it’s a symbolic and practical step towards greater institutional involvement in Bitcoin. It signifies a shift in perception and a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a valuable asset class. While the journey of institutional Bitcoin adoption is still in its early stages, milestones like this pave the way for a future where Bitcoin is seamlessly integrated into mainstream investment portfolios. As we move forward, keep an eye on: Increasing Institutional Allocations: Watch for further announcements from BlackRock and other institutions regarding increased allocations to Bitcoin ETFs. Regulatory Developments: A clearer and more supportive regulatory environment will further encourage institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s Price Performance: Continued positive price performance and reduced volatility can build confidence and attract more institutional capital. This is a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. BlackRock’s strategic move underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market and the undeniable allure of Bitcoin for institutional investors. The inclusion of IBIT in model portfolios is a clear indicator that the walls between traditional finance and the digital asset world are continuing to come down, brick by brick.

40981499,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135511,1740788459,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Binance Unveils Truth: Denies Fueling Crypto Market Downturn Amidst Asset Sell-Off Rumors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-denies-market-downturn-rumors/,"The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to volatility, and with volatility comes speculation. Recently, whispers intensified, suggesting that Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, might have been a catalyst in the latest crypto market downturn. The rumor mill churned, fueled by Bitcoin’s price dip following events like the Bybit Exchange hack and significant Solana withdrawals. But has Binance truly been selling off assets, exacerbating the market’s woes? Let’s delve into the heart of the matter and uncover the truth behind these market rumors. Unpacking the Crypto Market Downturn Rumors When the crypto market experiences a dip, it’s natural for investors and enthusiasts to seek explanations. The recent market fluctuations, marked by Bitcoin’s decline, ignited discussions about potential triggers. Among the speculated reasons, a prominent rumor emerged pointing fingers at Binance, alleging that the exchange initiated a massive sell-off of its holdings, thereby deepening the market’s negative trajectory. This speculation gained traction after: Bitcoin’s Price Drop: Bitcoin, the bellwether of the crypto market, experienced a notable decrease in value. Bybit Exchange Hack: The $1.4 billion hack of Bybit Exchange injected uncertainty into the market. Large Solana Withdrawals: Market makers like Wintermute made substantial withdrawals of Solana, raising eyebrows and sparking concerns about potential sell-offs. These events, occurring in proximity, created a fertile ground for speculation, with some interpreting on-chain data and transaction patterns as evidence of Binance offloading assets. However, is there substance to these claims, or are they merely misinterpretations of complex market dynamics? Binance Denies Asset Selling: Setting the Record Straight In response to the swirling speculations, Binance Exchange swiftly and unequivocally denied the allegations. According to a report by Cointelegraph, Binance clarified its position, stating that it had not engaged in selling off its assets to trigger or worsen the recent market downturn. Binance emphasized its fundamental role as a platform that facilitates trades between users. Crucially, the exchange asserted that it does not exert control over the movement of user assets. This denial is critical because it directly addresses the core of the rumors. Binance’s statement aims to dispel the notion that the exchange was actively involved in pushing the market downwards through deliberate asset sales. Instead, Binance positions itself as a neutral intermediary, processing transactions initiated by its users, not as a market manipulator orchestrating sell-offs. Understanding Binance’s Role as a Cryptocurrency Exchange To fully grasp Binance’s denial, it’s essential to understand the operational mechanics of a cryptocurrency exchange like Binance. Binance functions primarily as a platform where buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies converge to execute trades. Here’s a breakdown of their role: Aspect Binance’s Function Trade Facilitation Binance provides the infrastructure and technology for users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. It matches buy and sell orders. Custodial Services Binance holds user assets in custody, ensuring their security and accessibility for trading. Marketplace Neutrality Binance, in its official statement, asserts it operates as a neutral marketplace, not directly controlling the direction of asset flows driven by user trading activities. Data Transparency Transaction data on blockchains is publicly accessible. Binance encourages the community to interpret this data accurately and avoid misconstruing ordinary trading activity as malicious sell-offs. Therefore, when large transactions are observed, they are typically reflective of user trading behavior on the platform, not necessarily actions initiated by Binance itself to deliberately impact market prices. Why Did Market Makers Like Wintermute Withdraw Solana? The large Solana withdrawals by market makers, such as Wintermute, contributed to the speculation surrounding market downturn triggers. But what could be the reasons behind such withdrawals? Market makers play a crucial role in providing liquidity to exchanges. Their withdrawal of assets could stem from various factors, including: Risk Management: In times of market uncertainty or increased volatility, market makers might reduce their exposure to certain assets to manage risk. Portfolio Rebalancing: Market makers regularly rebalance their portfolios based on market conditions, trading strategies, and risk assessments. Profit Taking: Withdrawals could be a result of profit-taking after periods of successful trading. External Factors: Broader economic conditions, regulatory changes, or specific news events related to Solana could also prompt withdrawals. Attributing these withdrawals solely to an impending sell-off orchestrated by Binance or as a direct cause of the market downturn is an oversimplification. Market dynamics are complex, influenced by a multitude of factors and participant behaviors. Actionable Insights: Navigating Crypto Market Rumors and Volatility The Binance rumor incident serves as a valuable lesson in navigating the often turbulent waters of the cryptocurrency market. Here are some actionable insights: Verify Information: Before reacting to market rumors, seek official statements and verify information from reputable sources like Cointelegraph and directly from exchanges like Binance. Understand Market Dynamics: Educate yourself on the factors that influence crypto market movements, including macroeconomics, regulatory news, technological developments, and investor sentiment. Exercise Caution with On-Chain Data: While on-chain data provides valuable insights, interpret it cautiously. Transaction patterns can be complex and require expert analysis to avoid misinterpretations. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of market uncertainty, refocus on the fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies you are invested in. Assess their long-term value proposition and resilience. Manage Risk: Implement robust risk management strategies, including diversification, setting stop-loss orders, and investing only what you can afford to lose. Dispelling Misinterpretations: The Path Forward Binance’s firm denial of asset selling to trigger the crypto market downturn is a crucial piece of information in clearing the fog of market speculation. It underscores the importance of critical thinking and due diligence in the crypto space. While market downturns are inherent to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, attributing them to unsubstantiated rumors can be misleading and detrimental to investor confidence. Binance has urged the community to avoid misinterpreting transaction data, advocating for a more informed and nuanced understanding of market events. In conclusion, the narrative that Binance deliberately sold off assets to cause a crypto market downturn appears to be unfounded. Binance has clarified its role as a trading platform and denied any manipulative actions. As the crypto market continues to evolve, staying informed, verifying information, and understanding market dynamics are paramount to navigating its inherent volatility and making sound investment decisions.

40981543,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135512,1740788534,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming SEC Decision: Crypto Regulation Faces Backlash After Coinbase Lawsuit Dismissal,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-coinbase-lawsuit-dismissal/,"The cryptocurrency world is once again buzzing with controversy, this time ignited by a dramatic turn in the ongoing saga between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and crypto exchange giant Coinbase. In an unprecedented move that has sent shockwaves through the digital asset space, the SEC decided to drop its lawsuit against Coinbase. This decision has drawn sharp criticism, most notably from within the SEC itself, with Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw leading the charge against her own agency’s action. But what does this dismissal truly mean for the future of crypto regulation and investor safety? Let’s delve into the heart of this contentious issue and unpack the implications. Why is the Coinbase Lawsuit Dismissal Causing Such a Stir? Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw didn’t mince words when expressing her disapproval of the SEC’s decision. She openly condemned the move, labeling it as a departure from established legal precedent and a dangerous precedent for future enforcement actions. Her core argument revolves around the belief that dropping the Coinbase lawsuit weakens the very foundation of securities law, potentially jeopardizing investor safeguards that have been meticulously built over decades. To fully grasp the gravity of Crenshaw’s dissent, let’s break down her key concerns: Erosion of 80 Years of Securities Law: Crenshaw argues that the SEC’s decision contradicts decades of established legal principles and enforcement practices related to securities. She suggests that this sudden shift creates uncertainty and casts doubt on the SEC’s commitment to consistently applying securities laws. Weakened Investor Protection: A central tenet of securities law is to protect investors from fraud and manipulation. By seemingly backing away from enforcing regulations in the crypto space, Crenshaw fears that the SEC is leaving investors vulnerable. This is particularly concerning in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies where risks are already amplified. Politicization of Enforcement Actions: Crenshaw raises a serious red flag by suggesting that dropping the Coinbase lawsuit could be perceived as a politicized decision. This implies external pressures might be influencing the SEC’s enforcement strategy, undermining its independence and credibility as a regulatory body. Regulatory Uncertainty: For businesses operating in the cryptocurrency sector, clear and consistent regulations are crucial. Dismissing the lawsuit, without a clear explanation or alternative approach, injects further ambiguity into the regulatory landscape. This uncertainty can stifle innovation and make it difficult for compliant businesses to thrive. Essentially, Crenshaw’s criticism paints a picture of an SEC seemingly abdicating its responsibility to oversee the crypto market effectively. Her dissent highlights the deep divisions and ongoing debate within regulatory bodies about how to approach the rapidly evolving world of digital assets. The SEC’s Evolving Stance on Crypto Regulation: A Source of Confusion? The SEC has been under immense pressure to provide clarity on how securities laws apply to cryptocurrencies. The challenge lies in the decentralized and novel nature of blockchain technology, which often blurs the lines of traditional financial definitions. While the SEC has maintained that many cryptocurrencies fall under its jurisdiction as securities, the application of these rules has been inconsistent and often criticized as unclear. Here’s a look at some key aspects of the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation that contribute to the current confusion: Aspect Description Impact on Crypto “Howey Test” Application The SEC uses the Howey Test to determine if an asset is an “investment contract” and thus a security. Applying this test to crypto tokens is complex and subjective. Creates uncertainty for crypto projects about whether their tokens are securities, impacting fundraising and operations. Enforcement Actions vs. Rulemaking The SEC has primarily relied on enforcement actions (lawsuits) to define crypto regulations, rather than proactive rulemaking. Leads to regulation by enforcement, which is criticized for lacking transparency and predictability. Businesses learn the rules through lawsuits, not clear guidelines. Differing Interpretations within SEC As evidenced by Commissioner Crenshaw’s dissent, there are varying opinions within the SEC itself on how to regulate crypto. Internal disagreements further contribute to regulatory ambiguity and inconsistent enforcement. Global Regulatory Landscape Different countries are adopting diverse approaches to crypto regulation. The lack of international coordination adds complexity. US crypto businesses face challenges in navigating a fragmented global regulatory environment, potentially hindering competitiveness. Commissioner Crenshaw’s criticism of the Coinbase lawsuit dismissal underscores the internal struggles and external pressures the SEC is facing in navigating the uncharted waters of crypto regulation. The agency is tasked with balancing investor protection with fostering innovation, a delicate act that requires clear, consistent, and well-reasoned policies. Investor Protection in the Crosshairs? Crenshaw’s Stark Warning At the heart of Commissioner Crenshaw’s passionate dissent is the concern for investor protection . Securities laws are fundamentally designed to safeguard individuals and institutions who invest their capital. These protections include requirements for disclosure, registration, and anti-fraud measures. Crenshaw fears that by stepping back in the Coinbase case, the SEC is signaling a weakening commitment to these crucial safeguards in the crypto market. Why is investor protection so critical in the crypto space? Consider these factors: Volatility and Risk: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods, exposing investors to significant risks. Strong investor protections are needed to mitigate these inherent risks and prevent manipulation. Information Asymmetry: Crypto markets often suffer from information asymmetry, where project developers and insiders possess far more information than public investors. Regulations are needed to ensure fair and transparent information disclosure. Prevalence of Scams and Fraud: Unfortunately, the crypto space has attracted its share of scams and fraudulent schemes. Robust enforcement is necessary to deter bad actors and protect investors from financial losses. Nascent Market: The crypto market is still relatively young and evolving. Many investors, particularly retail investors, may lack the experience and knowledge to navigate its complexities and risks without adequate regulatory oversight. Crenshaw’s warning is a stark reminder that effective investor protection is not just a regulatory ideal, but a practical necessity for a healthy and sustainable crypto market. Without it, confidence in the market can erode, and individual investors are left vulnerable to potentially devastating financial consequences. Caroline Crenshaw: A Lone Voice or Part of a Growing Chorus? Caroline Crenshaw ‘s vocal opposition to the Coinbase lawsuit dismissal positions her as a prominent voice within the SEC advocating for stricter crypto regulation and robust investor protection. But is she a lone voice in the wilderness, or does her dissent reflect a broader sentiment within the agency and among other regulators? While it’s difficult to gauge the exact internal dynamics of the SEC, several factors suggest that Crenshaw’s views may resonate with others: Past Dissents: Crenshaw has previously dissented on other SEC crypto-related actions, indicating a consistent stance on the need for stronger regulatory oversight. This suggests her current criticism is not an isolated incident but part of a pattern. Congressional Scrutiny: Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have expressed concerns about the lack of clarity and potential risks in the crypto market. This bipartisan pressure may be influencing the SEC’s internal debates and strategies. Investor Advocacy Groups: Investor protection organizations and consumer advocacy groups have consistently called for stronger regulations in the crypto space. Their voices add external pressure on the SEC to act decisively. Global Regulatory Trends: Many other jurisdictions are grappling with crypto regulation and are increasingly moving towards stricter frameworks. This global trend may be influencing the thinking of some within the SEC. While the SEC’s official decision to drop the Coinbase lawsuit might suggest a particular direction, Crenshaw’s outspoken dissent reveals that the debate within the agency is far from settled. Her perspective, focused on investor protection and adherence to established legal principles, likely represents a significant viewpoint within the broader regulatory landscape. The Future of Crypto Regulation: Navigating Uncertainty The dismissal of the Coinbase lawsuit , coupled with Commissioner Crenshaw’s sharp rebuke, has injected even more uncertainty into the future of crypto regulation in the United States. While the immediate implications of this specific case remain to be seen, the broader message is clear: the path forward for crypto regulation is far from smooth and consensus is elusive. Here are some potential future scenarios and challenges to consider: Continued Regulatory Ambiguity: The dismissal could embolden crypto exchanges and projects to push the boundaries of existing regulations, leading to prolonged legal battles and continued uncertainty. Increased Congressional Action: Frustration with the SEC’s approach could prompt Congress to take a more active role in defining crypto regulations through legislation. This could lead to a more prescriptive and potentially less flexible regulatory framework. Focus on Enforcement Priorities: The SEC might shift its enforcement focus to specific areas within the crypto market, such as stablecoins or decentralized finance (DeFi), while adopting a more cautious approach to exchanges. Global Regulatory Convergence (or Divergence): The US approach to crypto regulation will be closely watched globally. Depending on future actions, it could either contribute to greater international regulatory convergence or further fragmentation. Navigating this uncertainty requires a multi-faceted approach. For crypto businesses, proactive compliance and engagement with regulators are crucial. For investors, due diligence and a thorough understanding of risks are paramount. And for regulators, striking a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring investor protection remains the ultimate challenge. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto Regulation? Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s scathing critique of the Coinbase lawsuit dismissal is more than just an internal SEC disagreement. It’s a powerful signal that the debate over crypto regulation is intensifying, and the stakes for investor protection are higher than ever. This episode may well be remembered as a defining moment, one that shapes the future trajectory of how digital assets are governed in the US and potentially worldwide. The path forward is unclear, but one thing is certain: the conversation surrounding crypto regulation is far from over. The tension between innovation and investor protection will continue to drive policy decisions, legal battles, and market dynamics for years to come. Staying informed and engaged is crucial for anyone navigating this evolving landscape.

Technical indicators reveal that these two popular meme coins have recorded positive price movements, suggesting they are on the verge of parabolic breakouts. Shiba Inu coin aims to break its immediate resistance level at around $0.0000165, while Pepe has formed a falling wedge formation, a bullish reversal pattern. Amid this growing optimism, Remittix (RTX) has made headlines for its practical use in today’s economy. Its PayFi solution converts digital assets to local currencies, depositing funds directly into regular bank accounts. Some compare it to how XRP initially soared by simplifying cross-border transfers but argue its user-friendly design might reach a wider audience. Pepe Coin Battles To Halt Declines Recently, PEPE’s price has gained on its intraday time frame, which has triggered the formation of a falling wedge in the 4-hour chart. Typically, this is a bullish reversal pattern. However, an analysis of the crypto assets of this time frame reveals that PEPE is not yet ready to break out. This is because its Bull Bear Power (BBP) measures the strength of bulls (buyers) compared to bears (sellers). PEPE/USD 4-hour chart | Source: TradingView Bulls could have the upper hand when the BBP reading is positive and prices can increase. In this instance, the BBP on the PEPE price chart is negative, suggesting that the buying pressure is not dominant. Therefore, the meme coin could find it challenging to rise above the upper trendline of the wedge. If this is the case, Pepe Coin’s value could remain stagnant within the falling channel. Furthermore, it has also formed a rounding top pattern on the daily chart, which usually indicates a potential end to an uptrend. The meme coin has slipped below the $0.0000090 support as buying pressure remains weak. The PEPE token might continue to trade sideways if this remains the same. However, if the selling pressure increases, the token’s value could decline to $0.0000065. Shiba Inu Breaks The Resistance The most recent price action reveals that the Shiba Inu token has attempted to break the key resistance at $0.00000165. if it manages to close above this level with massive volume support, the meme coin could stage parabolic rallies toward more ambitious targets. If the breakout is confirmed, the SHIB coin could attract greater investor interest and record a massive increase in the short term. Shiba Inu price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap The recent attempt to break from the bearish trendline might signal a possible trend reversal. However, for the price of Shiba Inu to regain bullish momentum, its trading volume needs to skyrocket. An increase in demand could push SHIB tokens beyond critical levels and confirm the resumption of the bull trend. The next few weeks will be crucial to determine Shiba Inu's next big move. If the Shiba Inu surpasses the key resistance, it could stage the possibility of a bullish reversal . With a stable market capitalization and strong support community, SHIB could experience growth in the coming weeks, but trading volume and confirmation of the technical breakout will be determining factors. Remittix (RTX): A Practical Path to 1000x? While Pepe and Shiba Inu battle to halt declines, Remittix (RTX) has quickly gained ground in the market. Priced at just $0.0694, Remittix has already raised over $13 million in its presale, with more than 508 million tokens sold. Unlike speculative projects, Remittix addresses a multi-trillion-dollar remittance market. Its unique PayFi solution converts crypto-to-fiat instantly, depositing local currency in users’ bank accounts. Whether a freelancer in Mexico requires payment from a European client or a small business in Kenya ordering supplies in China, Remittix aims to lower hefty fees and longer processing times tied to traditional banking. By eliminating challenges for everyday people and businesses, the platform offers a direct, global utility that many crypto assets struggle to match. Since remittances are a massive, real-world market with consistent demand, RTX’s appeal grows beyond crypto enthusiasts. If adoption snowballs among e-commerce merchants, freelancers, or families sending money home, industry insiders believe Remittix might outpace other presales on sheer user volume. Security measures like an audited contract and locked liquidity also reassure buyers wary of scams. If the DeFi token secures widespread partnership, a 1000x run by 2025 may not be outlandish. After all, crypto assets that address real problems like XRP once did often see the most significant long-term gains. Remittix Takes The Crown Away From PEPE & SHIB for 1000x Potential Though Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin each hold promise since they are on the verge of a breakout, they face unfavorable market conditions that might cap their upside. Remittix (RTX), by contrast, offers real utility and dives straight into a daily financial challenge cross-border payments that affect billions worldwide.

For Solana, this means traders will be able to speculate on the future price of SOL without actually owning the underlying asset. This opens up a whole new world of trading strategies and risk management tools for both institutional and sophisticated retail investors. Think of it like betting on the future price of Solana. If you believe the price of SOL will go up, you can enter a long futures contract. If you anticipate a price decrease, you can go short. The beauty of futures contracts lies in their versatility and the leverage they offer. However, it’s crucial to remember that leverage amplifies both potential profits and losses, making it a tool best suited for experienced traders. CME Group and the Crypto Revolution: Why Solana Now? CME Group’s decision to introduce Solana futures is not a random one. As the world’s leading derivatives marketplace, CME Group has a track record of legitimizing and maturing asset classes. Their foray into Bitcoin and Ethereum futures was a pivotal moment for crypto, paving the way for increased institutional adoption. Now, they’re setting their sights on Solana, indicating a growing belief in SOL’s long-term potential and market maturity. Several factors likely contributed to this decision: Growing Market Demand: Solana has consistently ranked among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, boasting a vibrant ecosystem and strong community support. The demand for Solana-related investment products is undoubtedly on the rise. Institutional Appetite: Institutions are increasingly looking for regulated and established avenues to gain exposure to crypto assets. CME Group provides that trusted infrastructure, making Solana futures an attractive proposition for institutional investors. Diversification of Crypto Offerings: CME Group already offers Bitcoin and Ether futures. Adding Solana futures allows them to diversify their crypto derivatives portfolio and cater to a broader range of investor preferences. This move by CME Group can be seen as a powerful endorsement of Solana’s staying power in the crypto space. It’s a clear signal that Solana is graduating from being just another altcoin to a serious contender in the institutional crypto arena. Unpacking the Benefits: What Solana Futures Mean for the Crypto Market The launch of Solana futures on CME Group is not just about adding another trading product; it has far-reaching implications for the entire crypto ecosystem. Let’s explore some key benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: Futures markets typically bring in significant liquidity. Solana futures will likely attract a new wave of traders and investors, making the SOL market more liquid and efficient. Improved Price Discovery: Futures markets are known for their role in price discovery. The introduction of Solana futures can lead to more accurate and transparent price signals for SOL, benefiting all market participants. Hedging Opportunities: For institutional investors holding Solana in their portfolios, futures contracts provide a valuable tool for hedging against potential price downturns. This risk management aspect is crucial for attracting larger, more risk-averse investors. Increased Institutional Investment: The availability of Solana futures on a regulated exchange like CME Group lowers the barrier to entry for institutional investment . Pension funds, hedge funds, and other large institutions that were previously hesitant to invest directly in SOL may now find futures contracts a more palatable and compliant way to gain exposure. Mainstream Validation: CME Group’s backing further legitimizes Solana as a mainstream asset class. This validation can boost investor confidence and accelerate the adoption of SOL. To illustrate the potential impact, consider the example of Bitcoin futures. When CME Group launched Bitcoin futures in 2017, it marked a turning point for Bitcoin, contributing to its institutional acceptance and subsequent bull runs. Solana futures could potentially trigger a similar trajectory for SOL. Navigating the Challenges: Potential Downsides and Considerations While the launch of Solana futures is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Volatility Amplification: Futures trading, especially with leverage, can amplify price volatility. While volatility can create trading opportunities, it also carries increased risk, particularly for inexperienced traders. Regulatory Scrutiny: As crypto derivatives gain traction, regulatory scrutiny is likely to intensify. The crypto industry needs to work proactively with regulators to ensure responsible innovation and investor protection. Market Manipulation Concerns: While CME Group has robust surveillance mechanisms, concerns about market manipulation in crypto markets persist. Vigilance and strong regulatory oversight are essential to maintain market integrity. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do Now? The impending launch of Solana futures presents both opportunities and challenges. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on announcements from CME Group regarding the launch date and contract specifications for Solana futures. Educate Yourself: If you’re considering trading Solana futures, take the time to thoroughly understand futures contracts, leverage, and risk management strategies. Monitor Market Sentiment: Pay attention to market sentiment and analyst predictions regarding Solana’s price trajectory in light of this development. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Solana futures offer exciting possibilities, remember the importance of portfolio diversification and risk management. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider Long-Term Implications: Think about the long-term implications of institutional adoption of Solana and how it might impact the broader crypto market. The Future is Bright for Solana and Crypto Derivatives CME Group’s move to launch Solana futures is a landmark moment for both Solana and the broader crypto market. It signifies the increasing maturity of the crypto asset class and the growing acceptance of digital assets by traditional financial institutions. This development is poised to unlock new levels of liquidity, institutional investment, and market sophistication for Solana, potentially propelling it to even greater heights. As crypto derivatives continue to evolve and gain mainstream acceptance, we can expect to see further innovation and integration between traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies. The future is undeniably exciting, and Solana is firmly positioned at the forefront of this revolution.

The meme coin, which has consistently led most of the tokens in price performance in recent months, continues to face its toughest challenge amidst price slump and falling network activity. On the other hand, the Chainlink price movement has created interest among analysts and traders as the asset approaches a critical support and resistance zone, which might lead to prolonged consolidation or breakouts. Meanwhile, many investors are now betting on a PayFi token gearing up for even bigger returns in 2025. Remittix (RTX) has shown its real-world applicability as it will tackle the pricey mess of traditional remittances head-on. This has the RTX price rally by over 367% to hit $0.0694. Dogecoin Records 95% Dip In Network Activity According to Ali Martinez, Dogecoin recorded a massive 95% dip in active addresses on its network, suggesting a considerable decline in activity. Ali noted that the dip in DOGE network activity began three months ago. Meanwhile, the price of Dogecoin has declined substantially in the past few days, with a weekly dip of over 25%. Dogecoin records a dip in network activity | Source: X On February 23, it was noted that the Dogecoin network only recorded 30,815 new addresses, confirming the dip in network activity. The decrease in Dogecoin’s network activity was reflected in the DOGE price movement, which dipped from $0.4868 to around $0.1800. The bearish outlook on Dogecoin’s price and network activity has investors arguing that it is a sign of weak demand for Dogecoin. While the price of Dogecoin is currently down, a few investors expect a rebound soon. According to CryptoELITES, Dogecoin is set for a rebound, which could see the meme coin hit a new high. The analyst offered three unique price targets for the DOGE token, including $0.75, $1.5, and $5. Chainlink Price Shows TD Sequential Buy Signal Analyst Ali Martinez has identified a buying opportunity on the TD sequential indicator, which traders commonly employ to find potential reversal points. A rebound in Chainlink’s price might occur following a dipping trend based on this technical indicator. Chainlink TD sequential buy signal | Source: X The TD sequential indicator reveals selling and buying opportunities through numbered price chart signals. Currently, the indicator points to a “9,” a buying signal. The buy signal within the current crypto market conditions creates additional positivity that the Chainlink price could regain an uptrend movement. However, while the technical signal points toward a recovery, additional market factors must validate the upward trend. The Chainlink price trades above the $13 region and must also break past key resistance levels to record a significant rally, including the $15 and $16 levels. Remittix (RTX): Investors Smart Play for 2025 Remittix (RTX) is shaking up global payments with its unique PayFi system, turning crypto into cash fast and cheap. Remittix is built for real use, think of instant cross-border without the usual hassles. At just $0.0694, representing an over 362% rally, the RTX token has already raised over $13M in presale funding. Remittix also supports over 40-plus cryptos and 30-plus fiat currencies, making it the go-to for businesses and folks across the globe. Partnerships with payment providers boost its reach while tight security keeps the platform safe, making it a steady alternative to wild market swings. Its Pay API rollout allows businesses to embrace crypto payments, which can be converted into fiat currencies without volatility headaches. This is a practical edge that Dogecoin lacks. This has seen Dogecoin whales piling into the RTX’s presale. Security seals the deal for the project. BlockSAFU, SolidProof audits and a three-year team token lock encourage trust among investors. Remittix privacy is also an ace. Bank transfers hide the crypto roots, unlike Dogecoin’s loud trades. This attracts users seeking discretion, as Remittix seeks to tackle real-world finance, luring savvy Dogecoin holders. Can Remittix and LINK Outshine Dogecoin? Due to reduced investors' interest, the Dogecoin price continues to face a bearish outlook as Chainlink price movements showcase a recovery signal that could potentially lead to new highs. Meanwhile, investors continue to jump in, drawn by Remittix's practical edge and big plans, including listing on many centralized exchanges, which will improve exposure. With its presale well underway, traders still have a perfect chance to get the RTX tokens in anticipation of major returns post-listing.

40981791,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135528,1740788985,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Ethereum Price Could CRASH 30% If This Key Level Fails!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-price-crash-support-level/,"Is the Ethereum party coming to an abrupt end? The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), is flashing some serious red signals, leaving investors on edge. Whispers of a potential 30% price plunge are growing louder, and if you’re holding ETH, you need to pay close attention. Let’s dive into the critical factors that could trigger a significant Ethereum price correction and what it means for your crypto portfolio. Is a Devastating Ethereum Price Crash Imminent? According to recent analysis from Cointelegraph, Ethereum is at a precarious juncture. The dreaded double-top pattern has emerged on the weekly charts, a bearish technical indicator that often precedes significant price declines. This pattern, coupled with a sharp 24.5% drop in ETH price over the past week, paints a concerning picture for Ethereum bulls. If Ethereum fails to hold the crucial $2,000 support level, analysts predict a swift and painful 30% nosedive towards $1,500. The situation is undeniably tense. Ethereum is currently flirting with two-year lows, a stark contrast to the bullish fervor seen in previous months. A decisive close below $2,100 would unfortunately validate this bearish double-top setup, opening the floodgates for further downward pressure. Are we on the brink of a major crypto market crash , with Ethereum leading the charge? Decoding the Double-Top Pattern: A Recipe for Disaster? So, what exactly is this ominous double-top pattern, and why should Ethereum investors be worried? Formation: A double-top pattern forms when the price of an asset attempts to break through a resistance level twice but fails both times, creating two peaks at roughly the same price. Bearish Signal: This pattern is a classic bearish reversal signal, suggesting that the upward momentum is exhausted and sellers are taking control. Confirmation: The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks below the neckline, which is the support level between the two peaks. In Ethereum’s case, this neckline is currently around the $2,100 mark. Target Price: Technical analysts often project a price target for a double-top pattern by measuring the vertical distance between the peaks and the neckline and subtracting it from the neckline breakdown point. This is how the $1,500 target for Ethereum is being derived. Essentially, the double-top pattern suggests that buyers have repeatedly tried and failed to push Ethereum higher, indicating a weakening bullish sentiment. If this pattern plays out as anticipated, the Ethereum support level at $2,000 could crumble, triggering a cascade of sell orders. The $2,000 Support Level: Ethereum’s Last Stand? The $2,000 level is not just an arbitrary number; it represents a significant psychological and technical Ethereum support level . It has acted as a crucial buffer in the past, preventing steeper declines. However, the current market conditions are testing its strength like never before. Why is $2,000 so critical? Psychological Barrier: Round numbers often act as psychological support and resistance levels in trading. $2,000 is a significant round number that many traders and investors are watching. Technical Confluence: This level might coincide with previous price lows, moving averages, or Fibonacci retracement levels, further strengthening its significance as a support zone. Market Sentiment Indicator: If Ethereum decisively breaks below $2,000, it could trigger panic selling and further erode market confidence in ETH and potentially the broader crypto market. Losing this crucial Ethereum support level could indeed pave the way for the predicted 30% drop. However, it’s not all doom and gloom just yet. There are glimmers of hope on the horizon. Hope on the Horizon: Demand at Lower Levels While the technical charts paint a bearish picture, on-chain data from Glassnode offers a contrasting perspective. Glassnode’s data reveals robust demand for Ethereum around the $1,890 level. This suggests that there are still buyers eager to accumulate ETH at lower prices, which could potentially act as a strong Ethereum support level and prevent the anticipated Ethereum price crash to $1,500. Key Takeaways from Glassnode Data: Metric Data Point Implication Exchange Outflows Increased Suggests investors are moving ETH off exchanges, indicating accumulation rather than selling. Accumulation Addresses Rising More addresses are accumulating ETH, pointing to long-term holding sentiment. Strong Support Zone Around $1,890 Significant buying interest exists at this level, potentially limiting further downside. This data provides a crucial counter-narrative to the bearish technical outlook. If selling pressure eases and this demand at $1,890 proves strong enough, Ethereum could potentially bounce back and invalidate the double-top pattern altogether. The battle between bearish technicals and bullish on-chain data is currently underway. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Ethereum Holders So, what should Ethereum holders do amidst this uncertainty? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Monitor Key Levels: Keep a close watch on the $2,000 and $1,890 levels. A decisive break below $2,000 could signal further downside, while strong support at $1,890 could offer a potential buying opportunity. Manage Risk: Consider implementing risk management strategies such as setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the price drops further. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio to mitigate risks associated with individual asset volatility. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest market news, technical analysis, and on-chain data to make informed decisions. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in the long-term potential of Ethereum, consider DCA to gradually accumulate ETH over time, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. The current situation demands caution and vigilance. While the potential for a 30% Ethereum price drop is real, the strong demand at lower levels offers a glimmer of hope. The coming days and weeks will be crucial in determining Ethereum’s next move. Will the bears triumph, or will the bulls stage a comeback? Conclusion: The Fate of Ethereum Hangs in the Balance Ethereum is at a critical crossroads. The double-top pattern and recent price weakness are undeniable warning signs. The $2,000 Ethereum support level is under immense pressure, and a break below it could trigger a significant price correction. However, the underlying demand at lower levels, as indicated by Glassnode data, suggests that the story is far from over. Investors must remain vigilant, monitor key levels, and manage their risk wisely as the drama unfolds in the crypto market .

Analyst Issues Dire Warning,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/is-the-worst-yet-to-come-for-xrp-analyst-issues-dire-warning/,"While the XRP price is already down -42% since its peak at $3.40 on January 16, renowned technical trader Josh Olszewicz (@CarpeNoctom) warns that the next leg downward may be imminent. Sharing his daily chart analysis on X, Olszewicz writes, “1D XRP: H&S + bearish kumo breakout watch,” signaling that two significant technical developments could push XRP prices lower in the near future. Is XRP Poised To Crash Towards $1.24? The mention of an “H&S” refers to the Head and Shoulders pattern, a well-known reversal formation in technical analysis. The pattern typically emerges after a substantial upward rally and includes three successive peaks, with the middle peak (the “head”) higher than the flanking peaks (the “shoulders”). Related Reading: XRP Price Continuation After Crash Below $2.4? New Targets Emerge In the case of XRP, Olszewicz’s chart suggests that the central head formed around $3.40 in mid-January, while the shoulders appear to be topping out between $2.83–$2.90. Technical analysts pay close attention to the “neckline,” which generally runs along a key support level beneath the peaks. When the price decisively breaks below this neckline, it is viewed as confirmation that selling pressure has overwhelmed buying interest, often leading to further downside. Olszewicz’s comment also highlights the phrase “bearish kumo breakout,” referencing the Ichimoku Cloud system, another prominent tool for charting and forecasting price momentum. Ichimoku Cloud analysis projects multiple moving averages forward on the chart and creates a “cloud” of support or resistance levels. A bearish kumo breakout arises when the price action clearly drops below the Ichimoku Cloud and the future cloud itself shifts in a way that indicates weaker bullish momentum. The core idea is that once an asset’s price slips under the cloud, a further decline becomes more likely, since the cloud that previously acted as support is no longer providing a cushion. From the chart Olszewicz provided, the current price action around $2.18 sits just above a conspicuous support area in the $2.00 region, which he interprets as the neckline for the Head and Shoulders pattern. If that zone gives way, bears could potentially dominate the market, with Fibonacci levels marked on the chart pointing to a possible first stop near $1.94, followed by an even steeper target. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Down Below Key Demand – Analyst Expects A Drop To $1.65 The chart appears to highlight a 161.8% Fibonacci extension level at around $1.24, which could come into play if selling accelerates. The presence of these Fibonacci levels does not guarantee a breakdown to those lows, but notably, a typical breakdown from the h&s pattern could spell even more doom. The profit target for the pattern is generally the price difference between the head and the low point of either shoulder. This difference is then subtracted from the neckline which could position the XRP price even below $1.00. Despite the stark warning about an impending “massive” price crash, it is crucial to note that Olszewicz’s commentary, “1D XRP: H&S + bearish kumo breakout watch,” should be viewed as an alert for traders rather than an irreversible prediction. Technical setups can fail if bullish momentum returns or if broader market fundamentals shift, but for now the entire crypto market seems driven by extreme fear.

The fund, designed to offer investors exposure to the burgeoning world of smart contract platforms, is now supercharged with the inclusion of seven prominent cryptocurrencies. This update, revealed via Grayscale’s official X account, showcases a strategic diversification into a wider array of digital assets beyond Bitcoin and traditional cryptocurrencies. For crypto enthusiasts and investors alike, this news marks a pivotal moment, indicating growing institutional interest in the diverse landscape of smart contract technologies. Let’s dive deeper into what this exciting development means for the future of crypto investments. Grayscale Smart Contract Fund: A Powerhouse of Digital Assets The Grayscale Smart Contract Fund is engineered to provide investors with exposure to a portfolio of leading smart contract platforms, excluding Ethereum. However, the latest announcement brings a game-changing update: Ethereum (ETH) itself is now a cornerstone of this fund, alongside other heavy hitters like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Sui (SUI), Near (NEAR), and Polkadot (DOT). This strategic inclusion significantly broadens the fund’s scope and potential, tapping into a wider spectrum of innovative blockchain technologies. Here’s a breakdown of what makes this fund tick: Market Cap-Weighted: The fund’s composition is determined by the market capitalization of each included cryptocurrency. This means that assets with larger market caps will have a greater influence on the fund’s overall performance, reflecting the market’s current valuation of these digital assets. Quarterly Rebalancing: To maintain alignment with the dynamic crypto market, the fund undergoes rebalancing every quarter. This process ensures that the portfolio remains reflective of the current market cap weights and allows for adjustments based on market fluctuations and the emergence of new opportunities. 30% Cap Per Rebalance: To mitigate concentration risk and ensure diversification, Grayscale has implemented a 30% cap per asset during each rebalancing period. This rule prevents any single cryptocurrency from dominating the fund’s portfolio, promoting a more balanced and resilient investment strategy. This structured approach aims to offer investors a diversified and professionally managed avenue to participate in the growth of the smart contract ecosystem. The addition of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency and a foundational platform for countless decentralized applications (dApps), is a particularly noteworthy development, signaling a maturing perspective on the role of Ethereum within the broader crypto space. Ethereum and Altcoins: Diversifying the Smart Contract Landscape The inclusion of Ethereum and a selection of prominent altcoins in the Grayscale Smart Contract Fund represents a significant shift towards diversification within the digital asset realm. While Bitcoin has long been the dominant force in the cryptocurrency market, the rise of smart contract platforms has opened up a world of possibilities beyond simple digital currency. These platforms enable the creation of decentralized applications, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and a host of other innovative use cases. By incorporating Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Sui, Near, and Polkadot, Grayscale is acknowledging the multi-faceted nature of the smart contract ecosystem. Let’s take a closer look at why these specific altcoins are gaining traction: Cryptocurrency Key Features & Strengths Ethereum (ETH) The leading smart contract platform with the largest developer community, extensive dApp ecosystem, and strong network effects.

By strategically including these diverse altcoins , the Grayscale Smart Contract Fund offers investors a comprehensive and balanced exposure to the most promising platforms within the smart contract space. This approach mitigates the risk associated with investing in a single cryptocurrency and capitalizes on the collective growth potential of the broader ecosystem. Benefits of Investing in a Smart Contract Crypto Fund Why should investors consider a crypto fund focused on smart contracts? The advantages are manifold, particularly for those seeking exposure to the digital asset market without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership and management: Diversification: As highlighted by Grayscale’s fund, a smart contract fund inherently provides diversification across multiple digital assets. This reduces the risk associated with relying on the performance of a single cryptocurrency and spreads investments across a range of promising platforms. Professional Management: Funds like Grayscale’s are managed by experienced professionals who conduct in-depth research, monitor market trends, and handle the complexities of portfolio rebalancing and custody. This expertise can be invaluable for investors who may lack the time or knowledge to actively manage their own crypto portfolios. Ease of Access: Investing in a crypto fund often provides a more accessible and regulated pathway to the digital asset market, especially for institutional investors or those unfamiliar with the intricacies of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. It streamlines the investment process and reduces the technical barriers to entry. Exposure to Growth Sectors: Smart contract platforms are at the forefront of innovation in the blockchain space. Investing in a fund focused on these digital assets allows investors to gain exposure to sectors with significant growth potential, such as DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized applications.

The platform offers over 30 fiat currencies and 50 crypto pairs, offering flexible payment processing across regions. Since the remittance market is massive and consistently in demand, RTX’s appeal has grown beyond crypto enthusiasts. If the project witnesses adoption among families sending money home, freelancers, or e-commerce merchants, industry insiders believe it could outstrip other presales on the sheer user volume. Security measures like an audited contract and locked liquidity have assured buyers wary of scams. Remittix is priced at $0.0694 and already raised over $13 million in its presale, with more than 508 million tokens sold. If Remittix secures widespread partnership, a 1000x rub by 2025 is not farfetched. After all, projects that solve real problems like XRP once did often experience the greatest long-term gains.

40982043,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135532,1740789439,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unwavering Dollar: Investors Navigate Inflation Data and Trump’s Tariff Threat,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dollar-steady-inflation-tariff-plans/,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, where volatility is the norm, keeping an eye on traditional financial indicators can offer a crucial edge. The recent steadiness of the dollar steady , as investors keenly analyze incoming inflation data and the potential resurgence of Trump’s tariff policies, presents a fascinating case study for crypto enthusiasts and seasoned traders alike. Why should you care about the dollar’s pulse when you’re invested in Bitcoin or Ethereum? Because the ripple effects of these macroeconomic factors can significantly influence the broader financial landscape, including the crypto market. Let’s delve into the currents shaping the dollar’s trajectory and what it means for your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Dollar’s Stability Amidst Economic Crosswinds The US dollar has shown remarkable resilience, maintaining its ground against a basket of major currencies. But what’s fueling this steadiness in the face of significant economic uncertainties? Several factors are at play, creating a complex scenario that investors are meticulously dissecting. Inflation Data : The cornerstone of current market sentiment is the incoming inflation data . Traders and economists are hanging on every CPI (Consumer Price Index) and PPI (Producer Price Index) release, seeking clues about the future direction of interest rates and the overall health of the economy. Stronger-than-expected inflation figures could signal persistent price pressures, potentially prompting the Federal Reserve to maintain or even increase its hawkish stance on monetary policy. Conversely, cooling inflation might suggest a pivot towards rate cuts, influencing the dollar’s appeal. Trump’s Tariff Plans : The specter of renewed trade tensions looms large with former President Trump’s potential return to the political stage and his stated intentions to impose significant tariffs. These trump tariff plans are not just theoretical; they carry the weight of past actions and could reshape global trade dynamics. The mere mention of widespread tariffs introduces uncertainty into the economic outlook, impacting currency valuations and investor confidence. Global Economic Uncertainty : Beyond inflation and tariffs, the global economic landscape remains fraught with uncertainties. Geopolitical tensions, varying growth rates across major economies, and ongoing supply chain adjustments all contribute to a volatile environment. In times of uncertainty, the US dollar often benefits from its safe-haven status, attracting investors seeking stability. To better understand the interplay of these factors, consider the following table: Factor Potential Impact on Dollar Relevance to Crypto Market Strong Inflation Data Potential for Dollar appreciation due to expectations of higher interest rates. May lead to a risk-off sentiment, potentially impacting crypto prices negatively in the short term. Weak Inflation Data Potential for Dollar depreciation as rate cut expectations increase. Could boost risk assets like crypto as investors seek higher returns in a lower-rate environment. Trump Tariffs Implementation Uncertain impact; could initially strengthen the dollar as safe-haven but could weaken it long-term due to economic disruption. Increased market volatility across all asset classes, including crypto. Trade tensions can create economic uncertainty, impacting investor sentiment. Global Economic Slowdown Dollar may strengthen as a safe-haven currency. Mixed impact; could see some flight to safety into dollar-pegged stablecoins, while broader crypto market might face headwinds due to reduced risk appetite. Why Are Investors Weighing Inflation Data So Heavily? You might be wondering, why is everyone so fixated on investors weigh ing every piece of inflation data? The answer lies in its direct influence on central bank policies, particularly the Federal Reserve in the US. Inflation is the rate at which prices for goods and services are rising, and it’s a critical gauge of economic health. Central banks aim to maintain price stability, often targeting a specific inflation rate (like 2% in the US). Here’s why inflation data is such a market mover: Interest Rate Expectations : Inflation data directly shapes expectations about future interest rate movements. High inflation typically prompts central banks to raise interest rates to cool down the economy and curb price increases. Lower inflation can lead to rate cuts to stimulate economic activity. Bond Yields : Interest rate expectations drive bond yields. Higher expected rates push bond yields up, making bonds more attractive to investors. This can impact the relative attractiveness of other asset classes, including equities and crypto. Currency Valuation : Interest rate differentials between countries influence currency exchange rates. Higher interest rates in the US compared to other nations can make the dollar more appealing to foreign investors, increasing demand and potentially strengthening its value. Economic Growth Outlook : Inflation can be a leading indicator of broader economic trends. Sustained high inflation can erode purchasing power, dampen consumer spending, and potentially lead to slower economic growth or even recession. Conversely, very low inflation or deflation can also be detrimental, signaling weak demand. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding the inflation narrative is paramount. Inflation can erode the value of fiat currencies over time, which is often cited as a bullish argument for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as potential inflation hedges. However, in the short-term, the market’s reaction to inflation data and the resulting impact on the dollar and risk sentiment can create significant trading opportunities and risks. Tariff Threats and the Economic Outlook: A Balancing Act The prospect of trump tariff plans adds another layer of complexity to the economic outlook. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, can have far-reaching consequences. While proponents argue they protect domestic industries and jobs, the economic reality is often more nuanced. Let’s consider the potential impacts of widespread tariffs: Increased Consumer Prices : Tariffs can lead to higher prices for imported goods, which can be passed on to consumers, contributing to inflationary pressures. Retaliatory Tariffs : One country imposing tariffs often leads to retaliatory measures from trading partners, sparking trade wars. These trade disputes can disrupt global supply chains, harm businesses, and increase economic uncertainty. Impact on Corporate Earnings : Companies that rely on imported goods or export products can see their profitability squeezed by tariffs. This can negatively impact stock markets and overall investor sentiment. Economic Slowdown : Trade wars and increased protectionism can hinder global trade and economic growth. Reduced trade flows can lead to inefficiencies and stifle innovation. For the dollar, the impact of tariffs is not straightforward. In the short-term, during periods of heightened trade tensions, the dollar might experience some safe-haven demand. However, prolonged trade wars and the resulting economic disruptions can ultimately weaken the dollar and the US economy. For the cryptocurrency market, tariffs introduce another source of volatility and uncertainty. While some might see crypto as a hedge against trade-war-induced economic instability, the immediate market reaction can be unpredictable. Navigating the Current Economic Landscape: Actionable Insights for Investors So, how should investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, navigate this intricate economic environment where the economic outlook is shaped by inflation data and tariff uncertainties? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed : Keep a close watch on economic data releases, especially inflation figures (CPI, PPI) and trade policy announcements. Understand how these data points are influencing market sentiment and the dollar’s movement. Diversify Your Portfolio : Diversification is key in times of uncertainty. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A well-diversified portfolio across different asset classes can help mitigate risk. Understand Dollar Dynamics : Pay attention to the dollar index (DXY) and its movements. A strengthening dollar can sometimes put pressure on risk assets like crypto, while a weakening dollar might provide a tailwind. Risk Management is Crucial : Volatility is likely to persist. Employ robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing your position sizes. Long-Term Perspective : While short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, maintain a long-term perspective on your investments, especially in the crypto space. Focus on the fundamental value and long-term potential of your chosen assets. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging : In volatile markets, dollar-cost averaging (DCA) can be a prudent strategy. Investing a fixed amount at regular intervals can help smooth out entry points and reduce the impact of short-term price swings. Conclusion: Dollar’s Steadiness as a Barometer for Broader Market Trends The dollar’s current steadiness amidst crucial inflation data and potential tariff upheavals is more than just a forex market story. It’s a reflection of the broader economic uncertainties and the delicate balancing act that investors weigh as they try to decipher the future. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these dynamics is not just about following traditional finance; it’s about recognizing the interconnectedness of global markets and making informed decisions in a rapidly evolving landscape. By staying informed, adapting strategies, and maintaining a long-term perspective, investors can navigate these economic crosswinds and position themselves for potential opportunities in both the traditional and cryptocurrency realms.

Institutions are allocating capital, and a significant portion is being channeled into Bitcoin. Potential Bullish Signal: Large inflows into Bitcoin ETFs can be seen as bullish indicators. Increased demand can potentially drive up Bitcoin’s price, benefiting the entire crypto market. Long-Term Investment Strategy: BlackRock isn’t known for short-term speculation. This deposit suggests a long-term strategic allocation to Bitcoin, reinforcing its role as a store of value and a diversifying asset in institutional portfolios. Market Confidence Boost: Actions speak louder than words. BlackRock’s substantial deposit can instill confidence in the market, attracting further investment from both institutional and retail investors. To put the numbers in perspective, 2,397 BTC at a price of approximately $79,000 per Bitcoin (at the time of deposit) totals around $190 million. This isn’t a trivial amount, even for an institution of BlackRock’s size. BlackRock, Bitcoin ETF, and Coinbase Prime: A Powerful Trio? The combination of BlackRock , their Bitcoin ETF , and Coinbase Prime creates a powerful synergy. Let’s explore why this trio is noteworthy: Entity Role in the Ecosystem Significance BlackRock World’s largest asset manager, ETF issuer Brings credibility and institutional capital to Bitcoin. Their ETF provides a regulated and accessible investment vehicle. Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) Investment product providing Bitcoin exposure Facilitates institutional and retail investment in Bitcoin without direct ownership complexities. Coinbase Prime Institutional-grade crypto platform Provides secure custody and trading infrastructure for large Bitcoin holdings, essential for institutional players like BlackRock. This ecosystem is designed to streamline institutional access to Bitcoin. It addresses concerns around security, regulation, and operational complexities that previously hindered larger institutions from fully embracing crypto. The institutional investment landscape is evolving, and this trio is at the forefront of that change. Navigating the Institutional Investment Wave: What Should You Watch For? While BlackRock’s BTC deposit is exciting, it’s essential to maintain a balanced perspective. Here are some key aspects to monitor moving forward: ETF Inflow Trends: Track the daily inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT. Consistent inflows will reinforce the narrative of growing institutional adoption. Coinbase Prime Activity: Keep an eye on Coinbase Prime’s reported assets under custody and trading volumes. Increased activity on this platform will further validate institutional engagement. Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape for crypto is constantly evolving. Positive regulatory clarity can further encourage institutional participation, while negative developments could create headwinds. Market Sentiment and Price Action: While institutional investment is a positive long-term driver, Bitcoin’s price can still be volatile in the short term. Monitor overall market sentiment and price action alongside institutional activity. Actionable Insights: Capitalizing on Institutional Bitcoin Adoption So, how can you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, potentially benefit from this trend of increasing institutional investment ? Diversification: Consider Bitcoin as part of a diversified investment portfolio. Institutional adoption strengthens the long-term investment case for Bitcoin. Education: Stay informed about the developments in the Bitcoin ETF space and institutional crypto adoption. Knowledge is power in navigating this evolving market. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional investment often signifies a long-term outlook.

On-chain data trends suggest retail traders’ panic selling this was behind the latest BTC price downturn. Bitcoin (BTC) Plunges to Lowest Since November 2024 Bitcoin (BTC) price extended its February losses further on Friday, weighed down by political and economic turbulence. The majority of the bearish momentum stemmed from developments within the Trump administration, shaking investor confidence in risk assets. In the last quarter of 2024, BTC price outperformed major financial assets as Trump’s pro-crypto stance fueled bullish sentiment. His inauguration-day launch of a memecoin further amplified gains, driving Bitcoin price to new all-time highs in January. However, after posting double-digit growth in Q4 2024, BTC price has faced intense sell pressure in February, with multiple macroeconomic and geopolitical factors fueling the downturn. Bitcoin price action, Feb 2025 | TradingView BTC price dropped 8% on Friday, briefly hitting $78,256 on Binance—its lowest level in over 120 days. Having opened February at $102,429, BTC price has now plunged 25%, as it closed the month just below the $84,000 mark, as depicted in the TradingView chart above Why Did Bitcoin Price Plunge 25% in February 2025? Beyond a “sell-the-news” event following Trump’s inauguration, several new bearish catalysts emerged throughout February, further weighing on Bitcoin price action. 1. DeepSeek’s Emergence Unsettles AI Markets, Triggering Sell-Offs The AI sector’s turmoil has sent shockwaves across financial markets, contributing to BTC price volatility. DeepSeek, a major Chinese AI player, has challenged U.S.-based firms like OpenAI, raising fears of a prolonged AI arms race. This uncertainty escalated following NVIDIA’s positive earnings report on February 27, which paradoxically triggered a rapid sell-off in tech stocks. The bearish sentiment rippled into crypto markets, playing a crucial role in BTC price sinking to fresh 120-day lows within 24 hours. 2. Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E. Oversight Clashes With U.S. Regulators Elon Musk’s new role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) has stirred significant controversy, contributing to market instability. Tensions between Musk and key agencies such as USAID, the U.S. Treasury , and the SEC have intensified, leading to investor uncertainty. Financial markets have overheated as regulatory battles escalate, further undermining confidence in risk assets. The evidently contributed to Bitcoin’s 25% price dip in February 2025. 3. Trump’s Tariffs on Canada and Mexico Trigger Panic Selling Trump’s surprise announcement of 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico sent shockwaves through financial markets, prompting investors to retreat from volatile assets. Following the hotter-than-expected February 13 CPI report, inflation fears surged, exacerbating risk-off sentiment. Investors, bracing for further inflationary pressures, have begun offloading BTC in favor of safer assets. Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor (GMI) also echoed this sentiment in a recent post on X. “Everything happening in markets right now, especially in crypto, is a direct consequence of the tightening of financial conditions in Q4 last year. When financial conditions tighten, liquidity gets drained, and economic surprises start to slow.” Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), Feb 28, 2025 While BTC’s 25% decline in February aligns with tightening trends in global financial markets, on-chain data suggests that retail traders were the primary sellers during the latest downturn. Santiment ’s Daily Active Addresses (DAA) metric, which tracks unique addresses engaging in transactions, confirms increased retail sell pressure. BTC recorded 515,000 active addresses on February 23, but following Trump’s tariff announcement, this number surged dramatically. Bitcoin Price vs. BTC Daily Active Addresses (DAA) | Source: Santiment For context, BTC’s DAA has exceeded 880,000 daily transactions since February 25, reaching a new 2025 peak of 882,000 on February 27, before settling at 875,000 on Friday. Such heightened activity during a downtrend strongly suggests that retail traders are driving the sell-off, applying downward pressure on Bitcoin price. With BTC price consolidating near 120-day lows, investors are closely watching key support levels. If selling pressure persists, Bitcoin price could test the $75,000 level in the coming days. However, a potential rebound could emerge if macroeconomic conditions stabilize or institutional inflows resume. For now, retail-driven selling, geopolitical uncertainty, and inflation fears remain dominant themes shaping BTC price action in early 2025. BTC Price Forecast: Bulls Risks Deeper Correction Below $80K as More Sell Signals Emerge Bitcoin price forecast charts show BTC struggling near $84,344 after an extended downtrend, with sell signals intensifying. The Bollinger Bands have widened, indicating increased volatility, while Bitcoin trades below the midline at $93,607. A rejection from this level could confirm bearish continuation toward the lower band at $83,478. The Top Bottom Indicator recently flashed a sell signal, mirroring the previous instance in January that led to a steep correction. If history repeats, Bitcoin could extend losses further. Volume Delta also reflects sustained negative momentum, with declining green bars and increasing red, suggesting persistent selling pressure. BTC Price Forecast However, Bitcoin’s price has yet to break decisively below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating potential for a relief bounce. In the near-term in BTC price holds above $83,500, bullish momentum could push it back toward $90,000. However, failure to reclaim $86,000 could trigger another decline toward $80,000, especially as bearish sentiment is expected to intensify as Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico take effect on March 1.

The DTCC listing indicates that Solana is evolving as an asset class while gaining increasing legitimacy within traditional financial circles. The Cardano ETF journey also received a boost after the US SEC officially recognized the ETF filing by a leading investment firm, Grayscale. Meanwhile, Remittix(RTX) is stepping in to offer a tangible use case. Currently priced at around $0.0694, this project focuses on cross-border transactions, a domain in which Cardano has shown potential but failed to deliver immediate solutions fully. With over $13M raised in presale funding, Remittix seems to have captured the eyes of investors seeking a project that might see explosive growth in 2025. Solana ETF Development: Futures Fund Listed on DTCC Two Solana futures exchange-traded funds from Volatility shares have appeared on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation list. The Volatility Shares Solana ETF and the Volatility Shares 2x Solana ETF mark the first SOL-based products to be added to the list. DTCC list two of Solana Future ETFs | Source: DTCC This is being hailed as a significant step that might pave the way for the more anticipated approval of spot Solana ETF, mirroring the unique journey taken by Ethereum and Bitcoin. Earlier this month, the SEC acknowledged spot Solana ETF filings from different issuers, including 21 Shares, Canray, Bitwise and VanEck. Despite the progress in Solana’s ETF offerings, it's important to remember that the ETF launch is still in its early stages. Solana’s price is also experiencing a market-wide dip, trading around the $130 level . The long-term implications of the ETF could, therefore, significantly impact the Solana price movement in the coming days. Cardano ETF Launch Set To Trigger Massive ADA Revival Following the successful integration of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2024, community members have increased their anticipation for Cardano ETFs, poised to strengthen the ADA’s price. A new advancement from the US SEC also fuels the possibility of a spot Cardano ETF in 2025, as the SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s ETF filing. US SEC acknowledges Grayscale ETF application | Source: US SEC The acknowledgment places Grayscale’s ETF application ahead of competitors while further demonstrating the regulator’s interest in accommodating altcoins-based ETFs. Cardano price movement could greatly benefit from the long-term integration of Cardano-based ETF. Bitcoin recorded a massive jump in its price value following several BTC-based ETFs' inception in the previous year's first quarter. Similarly, Cardano could also stage a major uptrend movement with the ETF approval despite its recent bearish outlook, which has seen the price of Cardano dip by over 22% in a week. Why Remittix Could Be More Than Just A Presale Token In addition to its achievement, Remittix (RTX) is creating a robust blockchain-driven financial ecosystem. Remittix focuses on real adoption by partnering with companies, payment networks and financial institutions, unlike most altcoins, which rely solely on price speculations. Remittix is also a top player when it comes to cross-border remittances, providing a fast yet cost-effective alternative to traditional money transfers. One of the key features is its merchant integration solution, which tackles volatility issues that have slowed the application of cryptos. This solution will allow businesses to convert crypto payments into fiat currency. As financial institutions tighten regulations and monitor transactions more aggressively, users have been looking for a more secure alternative to manage their funds. Remittix provides an alternative, ensuring that the recipient receives a standard bank deposit without any trace that the payment originated from crypto. The project also supports over 40-plus cryptos and 30-plus currencies, making it the go-to project for businesses and people across the globe. This has seen investors flock to the Remittix presale, leading to the RTX price surging by over 362% to sell at $0.0694. This accessible entry point only adds fuel to the fire as interest increases, making Remittix one of the presale projects promising high investment returns. Top Altcoins For 2025: Solana, Cardano And Remittix The SOL price movement could benefit greatly from the recent listing of two futures funds on DTCC, as Cardano also anticipates a 2025 ETF approval. In the meantime, as Remittix steps up to carve out a large piece of the $190 trillion global payment sector, its instant crypto-to-fiat conversion and direct bank transfers could see the token become a top altcoin investment option for 2025.

The debate is heating up, especially within the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has ignited a firestorm by publicly criticizing the SEC’s recent staff guidance on meme coins. Is this guidance a step in the right direction, or could it inadvertently create a regulatory loophole that crypto firms might exploit? Let’s dive deep into Crenshaw’s concerns and what this could mean for the future of crypto regulation . Why is Caroline Crenshaw Concerned About Meme Coin Guidance? Commissioner Crenshaw didn’t mince words when she voiced her disapproval. She argues that the SEC’s guidance, which essentially suggests meme coins might fall outside the agency’s regulatory purview, is fundamentally flawed. Her core argument is that this stance is incomplete and potentially dangerous for investors. Here’s a breakdown of her key concerns: Incomplete Assessment: Crenshaw believes the guidance presents an oversimplified view of meme coins . It fails to fully consider the economic realities and motivations behind these digital assets. Regulatory Loophole: Her biggest fear is that crypto firms could exploit this guidance. By simply labeling their tokens as “meme coins,” they might attempt to sidestep crucial SEC regulation and oversight. Profit Motive: Crenshaw stresses a critical point often missed in the meme coin frenzy: these coins, regardless of their playful branding, are created to generate profit. They are not just for laughs; they are financial products designed to make money for their issuers and early investors. Essentially, Crenshaw is urging the SEC to look beyond the meme label and focus on the substance. Are these assets functioning like securities? Are they being marketed and sold to raise capital? If the answer is yes, she believes they should fall under the SEC’s regulatory umbrella, regardless of whether they are called “meme coins” or anything else. The SEC’s Stance: A Closer Look at the Guidance To understand Crenshaw’s criticism, it’s important to grasp the SEC’s current position. While the exact details of the staff guidance haven’t been made fully public, the general understanding is that the SEC is considering whether some meme coins might lack the characteristics that would classify them as securities under existing securities laws. This could be due to factors such as: Decentralization Claims: Some meme coin projects may argue they are sufficiently decentralized, reducing the likelihood of centralized control and therefore, potentially falling outside the traditional securities framework. Utility vs. Investment Contract: The SEC often examines whether a digital asset represents an “investment contract,” meaning investors are pooling money with the expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others. Some meme coin proponents might argue their coins are more about community and less about this profit-seeking structure. Lack of Formal Organization: Certain meme coin projects may operate in a less structured manner compared to traditional companies, which could complicate applying securities laws designed for more conventional entities. However, Crenshaw’s critique highlights the potential dangers of focusing too narrowly on these factors without considering the broader economic context and investor protection. Is it truly sufficient to say a coin is “just a meme” and therefore exempt from basic investor safeguards? Crypto Oversight : Why Does It Matter for Meme Coins? The question of crypto oversight is particularly crucial in the context of meme coins due to their inherent volatility and often speculative nature. Here’s why robust oversight is essential: Aspect Why Oversight is Critical for Meme Coins Investor Protection Meme coins are often marketed to retail investors, many of whom may be less experienced and more vulnerable to scams and market manipulation. Oversight can help ensure fair markets and prevent fraudulent schemes. Market Integrity The meme coin market is notorious for its price swings and susceptibility to pump-and-dump schemes. Effective regulation can promote market stability and reduce the risk of manipulation. Financial Stability While individual meme coins may seem insignificant, the collective market capitalization of the crypto space is substantial. Lack of oversight in one area, like meme coins, could have ripple effects and potentially pose systemic risks. Innovation vs. Regulation Finding the right balance is key. Excessive regulation can stifle innovation, but insufficient oversight can lead to chaos and harm investors. Thoughtful regulation can foster a healthy and sustainable crypto ecosystem. Caroline Crenshaw’s stance underscores the need for a balanced approach – one that acknowledges the novelty of meme coins but doesn’t compromise on fundamental principles of investor protection and market integrity. Ignoring the financial realities of these assets simply because they are labeled as “memes” could be a recipe for disaster. The Potential Impact on Crypto Firms and the Market Crenshaw’s criticism could have significant ramifications for crypto firms operating in the meme coin space. If the SEC reconsiders its guidance and takes a more assertive regulatory approach, we could see: Increased Scrutiny: Meme coin projects might face heightened scrutiny from the SEC, potentially leading to investigations and enforcement actions. Compliance Costs: Crypto firms might need to invest more in compliance infrastructure to meet regulatory requirements, which could be costly, especially for smaller projects. Market Correction: A stricter regulatory environment could lead to a market correction in the meme coin sector, as some projects may struggle to adapt or be deemed non-compliant. Legitimacy and Maturity: In the long run, stronger regulation could actually benefit the crypto market by fostering greater legitimacy and maturity, attracting more institutional investment and mainstream adoption. The debate surrounding meme coin regulation is far from over. Caroline Crenshaw’s vocal dissent signals a potential shift in the SEC’s approach. Whether this leads to a more robust regulatory framework for meme coins remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the playful facade of meme coins cannot mask the serious regulatory questions they raise. What’s Next for Meme Coin Regulation? The future of meme coin regulation is uncertain, but here are some key developments to watch out for: SEC Response: How will the SEC respond to Commissioner Crenshaw’s criticism? Will they revise their staff guidance or double down on their current approach? Legislative Action: Could Congress step in to provide clearer guidelines for crypto regulation, including meme coins? Legislative clarity could be crucial for the long-term health of the crypto market. Court Cases: As the SEC takes enforcement actions in the crypto space, court cases will play a vital role in shaping the legal landscape and defining the boundaries of regulation. Industry Dialogue: Ongoing dialogue between regulators, industry participants, and legal experts is essential to develop practical and effective regulatory frameworks. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a regulatory environment that protects investors without stifling innovation. Finding this delicate balance will be the key challenge in navigating the evolving world of meme coins and the broader crypto market. Conclusion: The Urgent Need for Clarity in Meme Coin Regulation Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s critique of the SEC’s meme coin guidance serves as a powerful reminder that labels don’t define substance. Meme coins, despite their lighthearted origins, are part of the complex financial ecosystem and demand careful regulatory consideration. Ignoring the potential risks and regulatory loopholes would be a disservice to investors and could undermine the integrity of the broader crypto market. The call for clearer, more comprehensive crypto regulation is growing louder, and the SEC’s response to Crenshaw’s warning will be critical in shaping the future of digital asset oversight.

Elixir Network, the innovative force behind a modular blockchain solution, has just dropped a thrilling trailer video announcing its highly anticipated Token Generation Event (TGE). This is a major development for anyone tracking projects aiming to redefine decentralized finance, and especially for those interested in how blockchain technology can solve the persistent issue of liquidity in decentralized exchanges. Let’s dive into what this announcement means for the future of decentralized trading and the broader crypto ecosystem. Decoding the Hype: What is Elixir Network? Before we get into the specifics of the TGE trailer and what it signifies, it’s crucial to understand what Elixir Network is all about. In essence, Elixir Network is engineered to tackle a significant bottleneck in the current decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape: fragmented liquidity. Many decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and order book platforms suffer from a lack of deep, readily available liquidity, leading to slippage, higher transaction costs, and a less than ideal trading experience. Elixir Network steps in as a modular blockchain solution designed to aggregate and enhance liquidity across various platforms. Here’s a breakdown of what makes Elixir Network stand out: Modular Blockchain Architecture: Unlike monolithic blockchains, Elixir Network adopts a modular design. This means it’s built with specialized, interchangeable modules that can be optimized for specific functions. This architecture promises greater scalability, flexibility, and efficiency compared to traditional blockchain structures. Decentralized Order Book Liquidity: The core mission of Elixir Network is to provide robust decentralized liquidity for order book exchanges. By creating a network that aggregates liquidity from various sources, Elixir aims to make decentralized trading experiences as seamless and efficient as those on centralized exchanges. Focus on User Experience: Elixir Network is not just about technology; it’s about improving the user experience in DeFi. By enhancing liquidity, it aims to reduce slippage, offer better prices, and create a more reliable trading environment for users. Community-Centric Approach: While details are still emerging, modular blockchains like Elixir often prioritize community governance and participation. This suggests that the Elixir Network ecosystem will likely be shaped by its users and token holders. The Token Generation Event (TGE) Trailer: What We Know The recently released trailer video is the first concrete signal of Elixir Network’s upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) . While the trailer itself is likely designed to build anticipation and excitement rather than reveal all the details, it serves several key purposes: Official Announcement: The trailer formally announces to the crypto community that the TGE is on the horizon. This is a crucial step in building momentum and attracting early participants. Brand Building: A well-produced trailer can significantly boost Elixir Network’s brand visibility and recognition. It’s a way to make a strong first impression and stand out in a crowded crypto market. Community Engagement: Trailers are inherently engaging. They pique curiosity and encourage viewers to seek out more information, follow Elixir Network’s social channels, and join the community. Setting Expectations: The trailer likely hints at the vision and potential of Elixir Network, setting the stage for what the project aims to achieve post-TGE. While specific details about the TGE, such as the date, tokenomics, and participation process, are still awaited, the trailer is a strong indication that these details will be released soon. Keep an eye on Elixir Network’s official channels for further announcements. Why Decentralized Liquidity Matters The concept of decentralized liquidity is central to Elixir Network’s mission and to the broader vision of DeFi. But why is it so important? Here are a few key reasons: Reduced Reliance on Centralized Exchanges: Decentralized liquidity solutions lessen the dependency on centralized exchanges (CEXs). CEXs, while offering high liquidity, are centralized entities that pose risks like regulatory scrutiny, single points of failure, and potential for manipulation. Enhanced Security and Transparency: Decentralized systems inherently offer greater security and transparency. By distributing liquidity across a decentralized network, risks are spread out, and operations become more transparent and auditable on the blockchain. Empowerment of Users: Decentralized liquidity empowers users by giving them more control over their assets and trading activities. It aligns with the core principles of crypto – decentralization, self-custody, and financial sovereignty. Fueling DeFi Growth: Robust decentralized liquidity is fundamental for the continued growth and maturity of the DeFi ecosystem. It enables more complex financial instruments, smoother trading experiences, and broader adoption of decentralized finance. Potential Benefits of Elixir Network If Elixir Network successfully delivers on its promise, the benefits could be substantial for various stakeholders in the crypto ecosystem: Stakeholder Potential Benefits Traders and DeFi Users Lower slippage on trades Better prices and execution More efficient trading experience Increased access to liquidity Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) Enhanced liquidity depth Attraction of more users and trading volume Competitive edge against CEXs Reduced operational overhead related to liquidity provision Elixir Network Token Holders Potential for token appreciation Governance rights in the network Possible staking or yield opportunities (depending on tokenomics) Participation in the growth of a potentially transformative project Challenges and Considerations While the potential of Elixir Network and its approach to modular blockchain and decentralized liquidity is promising, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that lie ahead: Execution Complexity: Building a modular blockchain and a robust decentralized liquidity network is technically complex. The team will need to navigate numerous engineering and design challenges. Adoption and Network Effects: For Elixir Network to succeed, it needs widespread adoption by DEXs, liquidity providers, and traders. Building strong network effects is crucial. Competition: The DeFi space is highly competitive. Elixir Network will face competition from other projects tackling liquidity issues, as well as from established centralized exchanges. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for crypto and DeFi is constantly evolving. Elixir Network will need to navigate these complexities to ensure compliance and long-term sustainability. Security Audits and Reliability: As with any blockchain project, rigorous security audits and a proven track record of reliability are essential for user trust and confidence. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts So, what should crypto enthusiasts and potential participants do in light of this Token Generation Event trailer? Stay Informed: Follow Elixir Network’s official channels (website, Twitter, Telegram, etc.) for updates on the TGE, tokenomics, and project roadmap. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on hype. Conduct thorough research into Elixir Network, its team, technology, and whitepaper. Understand the risks and potential rewards. Assess the Problem it Solves: Evaluate the significance of decentralized liquidity and whether Elixir Network’s approach is a viable solution to the challenges in the DeFi space. Community Engagement: Join the Elixir Network community to ask questions, participate in discussions, and get a feel for the project’s ethos and vision. Prepare for Potential Participation: If you’re interested in participating in the TGE, understand the requirements and be prepared to act quickly when the details are announced. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of DeFi Elixir Network’s TGE trailer is more than just a promotional video; it’s a beacon signaling a potential shift towards more efficient and truly decentralized trading in the crypto world. By focusing on decentralized order book liquidity and leveraging a modular blockchain architecture, Elixir Network is positioning itself to be a key player in the ongoing evolution of DeFi. While challenges undoubtedly exist, the project’s vision and the unveiling of the TGE trailer offer a compelling reason for crypto enthusiasts to pay close attention.

For years, the cryptocurrency industry has operated under a cloud of uncertainty regarding how existing securities laws apply to digital assets. Now, it seems the SEC is directly addressing these concerns with a series of roundtables designed to foster dialogue and understanding. Is this the dawn of a new era of clear rules for crypto, or just another step in a long, complex journey? Let’s dive into what we know about these crucial upcoming events. Unpacking the SEC’s “Spring Sprint Towards Crypto Clarity” According to a recent announcement by Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett on X (formerly Twitter), the SEC Crypto Task Force is initiating a five-part roundtable series aptly named “Spring Sprint Towards Crypto Clarity.” This initiative signals a direct effort from the regulatory body to engage with the crypto industry and address the pressing need for definitive guidelines. The inaugural session is scheduled for March 21st at the SEC’s headquarters in Washington, D.C., and will zero in on a fundamental question that has plagued the crypto world: defining security status for digital assets. Here’s what we know so far about this significant development: Five-Part Series: The “Spring Sprint” indicates a comprehensive approach, suggesting the SEC intends to cover various aspects of crypto regulation over these five sessions. While the first is focused on security status, the topics of subsequent roundtables are eagerly awaited. Focus on Security Status: The initial session’s focus is incredibly pertinent. The classification of a cryptocurrency as a security or not dictates the regulatory framework it falls under, impacting everything from registration requirements to compliance obligations. SEC Crypto Task Force Led: The involvement of the SEC Crypto Task Force underscores the seriousness of this initiative. This task force is specifically dedicated to cryptocurrency matters within the SEC, suggesting a concentrated effort to tackle these issues. March 21st Kick-off: The date is set, adding a tangible timeline to this development. The crypto community will be keenly watching for insights and outcomes from this first session. Location: Washington D.C.: Holding the roundtables at the SEC offices in the nation’s capital emphasizes the official and governmental nature of these discussions. Why Does Regulatory Clarity Matter for Crypto’s Future? The absence of clear crypto regulation has been a double-edged sword for the industry. On one hand, it has allowed for rapid innovation and the emergence of a decentralized financial system. On the other, it has created significant hurdles and uncertainties that hinder mainstream adoption and institutional investment. Let’s consider why this clarity is so vital: Benefits of Regulatory Clarity: Attracting Institutional Investment: Major institutional investors often require a well-defined regulatory landscape before committing significant capital. Clarity can unlock massive inflows of institutional money into the crypto market. Fostering Innovation and Growth: Clear rules provide a framework for businesses to innovate and grow within defined boundaries, reducing the fear of inadvertently running afoul of regulations. Enhancing Investor Protection: Well-defined regulations are crucial for protecting investors from fraud and manipulation within the volatile crypto market. Promoting Market Stability: Clarity can contribute to a more stable and predictable market environment, reducing extreme volatility driven by regulatory uncertainty. Legitimizing the Industry: Clear and sensible regulations can help legitimize the crypto industry in the eyes of the public and traditional financial institutions. Challenges of Regulatory Uncertainty: Stifled Innovation: Fear of regulatory crackdowns can discourage innovation and development within the crypto space. Compliance Burdens: Uncertainty makes it difficult for crypto businesses to comply with regulations, leading to costly and potentially ineffective compliance efforts. Enforcement Actions: Lack of clarity can result in retroactive enforcement actions, catching businesses off guard and creating a chilling effect. Limited Mainstream Adoption: Regulatory ambiguity can deter mainstream users and businesses from fully embracing cryptocurrencies. Brain Drain: Talent and businesses may move to jurisdictions with clearer and more favorable regulatory environments. Crypto Roundtables: A Deep Dive into Defining Security Status The first roundtable’s focus on defining security status is arguably the most critical issue facing the crypto industry. The question of whether a digital asset should be classified as a security is not merely academic; it has profound legal and operational consequences. What is “Security Status” in Crypto? In traditional finance, securities are financial instruments like stocks and bonds that are regulated to protect investors. The SEC applies the Howey Test to determine if an asset is an “investment contract” and thus a security. The Howey Test, derived from a Supreme Court case, generally defines an investment contract as a contract, transaction, or scheme whereby a person invests money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. Applying this test to cryptocurrencies is complex. Many tokens were initially sold in token sales (ICOs) with promises of future profits based on the development efforts of the project team. This can arguably fit the Howey Test. However, many cryptocurrencies are also intended to function as utilities or currencies, blurring the lines. Why is Defining Security Status Important? Registration Requirements: If a crypto asset is deemed a security, it may need to be registered with the SEC, which involves significant compliance costs and disclosures. Broker-Dealer Regulations: Platforms trading security tokens may need to register as broker-dealers and comply with securities laws. Investor Protection Laws: Securities regulations provide various investor protections, such as disclosure requirements and anti-fraud provisions. Tax Implications: The tax treatment of securities can differ from that of other assets. Global Regulatory Landscape: Different jurisdictions have varying approaches to classifying crypto assets, creating a fragmented global regulatory landscape. The SEC’s efforts to clarify this definition through roundtables could significantly shape the future of crypto projects, exchanges, and investors in the U.S. and potentially globally. The SEC Crypto Task Force: Decoding the Regulators Understanding who is behind this “Spring Sprint Towards Regulatory Clarity ” is crucial. The SEC Crypto Task Force is the driving force. While specific members might not be publicly named for these roundtables, understanding the task force’s general mandate is insightful. Established in 2017, the SEC Enforcement Division created the Cyber Unit (later evolved into a task force with broader scope) to focus on: Cybersecurity Threats: Initially focused on cybersecurity issues related to market infrastructure and trading platforms. ICOs and Digital Assets: Expanded to include enforcement actions related to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and digital asset offerings. Crypto Fraud and Manipulation: Combating fraud and manipulation in the cryptocurrency markets. Enforcement of Securities Laws: Applying existing securities laws to the crypto space, often leading to enforcement actions against projects deemed to have offered unregistered securities. The task force’s work has been both praised for protecting investors and criticized for stifling innovation through enforcement-led regulation. These roundtables suggest a potential shift towards a more collaborative and clarity-focused approach, rather than solely relying on enforcement actions. Navigating Crypto Regulation: What Should Stakeholders Expect? These crypto roundtables are a significant development, but what should crypto businesses, investors, and enthusiasts expect? Here are some actionable insights: For Crypto Businesses: Monitor Roundtable Outcomes: Closely follow the announcements and outcomes from each roundtable session. Public summaries or reports may be released. Engage with Industry Groups: Industry associations and legal experts will likely analyze and interpret the roundtable discussions. Engage with these groups to understand the implications. Review Compliance Strategies: Be prepared to adjust compliance strategies based on any new clarity or guidelines emerging from the SEC’s initiative. Consider Legal Counsel: Seek legal advice to understand how your specific projects or businesses might be affected by evolving regulations. For Crypto Investors: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news and analysis related to the SEC roundtables and regulatory developments. Understand Security Status Risks: Be aware of the risks associated with investing in crypto assets that might be classified as securities and the implications for trading and holding those assets. Diversify Investments: As always, diversify your crypto portfolio and be mindful of regulatory risks when making investment decisions. The SEC’s “Spring Sprint Towards Crypto Clarity” roundtables represent a potentially pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Whether these discussions will truly lead to the desired regulatory clarity remains to be seen, but the initiative itself is a positive sign. By engaging directly with the industry and focusing on crucial issues like security status, the SEC is taking a necessary step towards creating a more stable, predictable, and ultimately, more innovative crypto ecosystem.

After an over 18% and 21% price drop, respectively, in the past month, market insiders are wondering if these two altcoins might recover from their ongoing woes. While XRP and SOL coins face extreme selling pressure, Remittix presale continues to hit new levels. Remittix (RTX) , on the other hand, has become the talk of the town, currently priced at $0.0694, and has raised more than $13 million. While countless tokens emerge each week, experts are pointing to Remittix as the next breakout contender. Let’s uncover XRP and Solana market trends and how projects like Remittix are the best crypto to buy right now. Solana Flashes Similar Setup to 2022 Bear Market For the first time since 2024, Solana's price dipped below $135 briefly before staging a recovery above $140. The sharp decline comes after the crypto asset failed to notch a new all-time high. Instead, the SOL coin slid by 43% in the past months. Based on historical patterns, Solana's price action reveals a deeper pullback that could be close. Its technical indicators appear similar to that of the 2022 bear market. During that period, Solana's price reached $260 in November 2021 and crashed below $10. It was during this time that the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossed above the 12 EMA, which validated the extended bearish phase. If the same thing happens, sustained crossover and negative MACD readings might suppress the SOL price. USD/SOL chart | Source: TradingView Another sign that SOL could be heading towards the 2022 bear market is the total value locked. In January, Solana’TVL neared $12 billion but has dropped to around $6 million. During the 2021 to 2022 period, the same metric collapsed. Amid this downturn, Solana investors have seen the current downturn as an opportunity to buy the dip in the hope that it might regain its bullish momentum in the coming months. XRP Price Loses Bullish Momentum The XRP token has made headlines after losing the bullish momentum it displayed in the fourth quarter and is now at a more profound risk of a deeper meltdown . The ongoing decline is primarily attributed to macroeconomic uncertainty in the United States as President Trump imposed new hefty tariffs . These tariffs have led to stagflation and forced the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates prematurely. XRP price chart| Source: CoinMarketCap Despite the decline, XRP’s fundamentals remain solid. The odds of the U.S SEC withdrawing its lawsuit against the Ripple network have improved now that the regulatory watchdog has dropped its cases against Coinbase and Uniswap. Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger ecosystem has continued to draw more developers, and speculation regarding a potential spot XRP ETF has increased. If approved, an XRP ETF could trigger billions in inflows, driving higher demand for the XRP token. Technical indicators reveal a strong bearish breakout in the coming days, as the XRP coinhas entered a danger zone. The token could crash below the $2.00 level if a bearish breakout is confirmed. Given these factors, the altcoin might decline further towards $1.6230, where it may experience a reversal. Remittix (RTX): Next Breakout Contender While Solana and Ripple carry strong brand recognition and market share, Remittix has shifted attention thanks to its disruptive PayFi platform that merges cryptocurrencies with everyday finance. By enabling users to convert crypto into fiat current and deposit funds directly to any bank account worldwide, Remittix addresses a multi-trillion-dollar industry, a sector where overhead costs, exclusion of unbanked populations, and transfer delays remain unsolved issues. For someone who works in Southeast Asia intending to send funds home to a family could experience steep fees from conventional remittance services. The transaction might even take days to process. Remittix aims to cut these costs drastically to offer a near-instant transfer at affordable rates. Users can convert over 40+ crypto pairs into 30+ fiat currencies. This tangible utility distinguishes Remittix from speculative tokens that are currently bleeding red due to market turbulence. While offering these tangible benefits to millions of unbanked individuals, Remittix promises real-world adoption. Its presale is a testament to the project’s growth potential. Remarkable, it has accumulated more than $13 million in funding as investors continue to be bullish about it. Meanwhile, early adopters have already enjoyed over 362% return after a price increase to $0.0694 from its starting price of $0.015. While no investment is without risk, market insiders believe Remittix could be the next big thing, potentially outperforming Ripple and Cardano in terms of returns. With both utility and potential for exponential gains, the RTX token has emerged as the best crypto to watch in 2025. Can Remittix Outpace XRP and Solana? While XRP and Solana continue to navigate market volatility, Remittix has quickly emerged as the next breakout contender. With strong fundamentals and high growth potential, this new PayFicoin could outshine Solana and Ripple in this cycle. For anyone seeking a better crypto investment alternative, Remittix looks promising.

Unlocking Perpetual Futures on Berachain DEXs The core announcement revolves around enabling perpetual futures trading on Berachain-based DEXs. But what are perpetual futures, and why are they important? Perpetual futures, often called ‘perps’ in the crypto world, are derivative contracts that mimic traditional futures contracts but without an expiry date. This means traders can hold positions indefinitely, speculating on the price movements of assets without the need to roll over contracts. Here’s a breakdown of why perpetual futures are a game-changer for DEXs and traders: Enhanced Trading Options: Perpetual futures expand the trading toolkit available on DEXs. Users can now not only spot trade but also engage in leveraged trading and hedging strategies using perps. Increased Liquidity: The introduction of perpetual futures can attract more liquidity to DEXs. Traders who prefer derivatives trading will find Berachain DEXs more appealing with this new offering. Sophisticated Trading Strategies: Perpetual futures enable more complex trading strategies, such as longing, shorting, and hedging, which are essential tools for experienced traders and institutions. 24/7 Markets: Like the broader crypto market, perpetual futures markets operate 24/7, offering continuous trading opportunities. By supporting perpetual futures , Orderly Network is essentially equipping Berachain DEXs with the firepower to compete with more established centralized exchanges (CEXs) and other advanced DeFi platforms in terms of trading product offerings. This is a major step in maturing the DeFi ecosystem on Berachain. Benefits of Orderly Perps for Berachain Users So, how does this integration directly benefit users within the Berachain ecosystem? The advantages are manifold and cater to various types of crypto participants: For Traders: More Trading Opportunities: Access to perpetual futures opens up new avenues for profit generation and risk management. Leverage Trading: Perps allow traders to amplify their trading positions through leverage, potentially increasing profits (and losses). Hedging Capabilities: Traders can use perps to hedge against price volatility in their spot holdings, protecting their portfolios. Deeper Liquidity: Orderly Network’s robust order book infrastructure contributes to deeper liquidity for perpetual futures on Berachain DEXs, leading to better execution and reduced slippage. For DEXs on Berachain: Attract More Users: Offering perpetual futures can attract a broader user base, including sophisticated traders and institutions seeking advanced trading tools in a decentralized environment. Increase Trading Volume: The addition of perps is likely to boost trading volume on Berachain DEXs, generating more fees and revenue for the platforms. Competitive Edge: DEXs that integrate Orderly perps gain a competitive advantage by offering a more comprehensive suite of trading products compared to those that only offer spot trading. For the Berachain Ecosystem as a Whole: Ecosystem Growth: The availability of advanced trading infrastructure strengthens the overall appeal of Berachain as a DeFi hub, attracting more projects and users. Increased TVL (Total Value Locked): As trading activity and user adoption grow, the Total Value Locked in Berachain’s DeFi ecosystem is expected to increase. Innovation Catalyst: This integration sets the stage for further innovation and development within the Berachain ecosystem, potentially leading to more sophisticated DeFi products and services. In essence, the integration of Orderly Network ‘s perpetual futures on Berachain is a synergistic move that benefits everyone involved – traders, DEXs, and the entire Berachain ecosystem. Omnichain Order Book: The Technology Behind Orderly A key aspect of Orderly Network ‘s offering is its ‘omnichain’ nature. But what does ‘omnichain order book’ really mean? It refers to an order book infrastructure that is designed to operate seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks. This is in contrast to traditional DEXs that are typically confined to a single blockchain. Here’s why the omnichain approach is crucial in today’s fragmented DeFi landscape: Cross-Chain Liquidity Aggregation: Omnichain order books can potentially aggregate liquidity from various blockchains, creating deeper and more robust markets. This addresses the issue of fragmented liquidity that often plagues DeFi. Interoperability: By being chain-agnostic, Orderly Network enhances interoperability within the DeFi space. It facilitates the flow of assets and information across different blockchains. Wider Reach: DEXs leveraging an omnichain order book can tap into a broader user base and asset pool, as they are not limited to a single blockchain’s ecosystem. Future-Proofing: The omnichain design positions Orderly Network and its integrated DEXs to adapt to the evolving multi-chain future of DeFi, where interoperability will be paramount. The technology underpinning Orderly’s omnichain capabilities is complex, involving cross-chain messaging protocols and sophisticated infrastructure to maintain order book consistency and efficiency across different chains. However, the end result is a more connected and efficient DeFi trading environment. The Future of DEX Trading with Orderly and Berachain Looking ahead, the integration of Orderly Network with Berachain marks a significant step in the evolution of decentralized exchange (DEX) trading. It’s not just about adding perpetual futures; it’s about building a more robust, versatile, and user-friendly DeFi ecosystem on Berachain. Here are some potential future implications: Expansion of Trading Products: Beyond perpetual futures, we can expect to see more sophisticated derivative products and trading instruments being introduced on Berachain DEXs, powered by Orderly Network. Increased Institutional Adoption: The availability of professional-grade trading infrastructure, like Orderly’s order book, can attract institutional investors to the Berachain DeFi ecosystem. Competition and Innovation: This integration is likely to spur further competition and innovation among DEXs, driving the development of even better trading platforms and user experiences. Broader DeFi Adoption: By making DeFi trading more accessible and feature-rich, initiatives like this contribute to the overall growth and mainstream adoption of decentralized finance. The partnership between Orderly Network and Berachain is a testament to the collaborative spirit of the crypto space. By combining their respective strengths – Orderly’s advanced trading infrastructure and Berachain’s innovative blockchain – they are paving the way for a more sophisticated and interconnected DeFi future. Conclusion: A New Era for Berachain DeFi The announcement of Orderly Network supporting Berachain is more than just a simple integration; it’s a strategic move that unlocks a new chapter for DeFi on Berachain. By enabling perpetual futures trading on Berachain DEXs, Orderly Network is empowering these platforms to offer a more comprehensive and competitive trading experience. This benefits traders with enhanced opportunities, DEXs with increased user engagement and volume, and the entire Berachain ecosystem with stronger foundations for growth and innovation.

40982634,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135564,1740790463,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking SEC Delay: Fidelity Ethereum ETF Options Approval Postponed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-fidelity-ethereum-etf/,"Just when crypto enthusiasts were gearing up for another leap in Ethereum investment accessibility, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has thrown a curveball. Solid Intel, a prominent voice in crypto news on X, has reported that the SEC has decided to delay its verdict on allowing options trading for the highly anticipated Fidelity Spot Ethereum ETF. This news has sent ripples through the crypto community, leaving many investors and market watchers wondering what’s next. Let’s dive into the details of this unexpected development and explore what it means for the future of Ethereum ETFs and the broader crypto market. Understanding the SEC ETF Delay and Its Implications The delay in approving options trading for the Fidelity Spot Ethereum ETF is a significant setback, especially considering the momentum behind spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. For those new to the ETF world, options trading adds another layer of sophistication and flexibility for investors. Essentially, options contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset (in this case, shares of the Fidelity ETH ETF) at a predetermined price within a specific timeframe. The introduction of options typically boosts trading volume and investor interest in ETFs. Here’s a breakdown of what this SEC ETF delay means: Reduced Investor Flexibility: Without options, investors are limited to simply buying and selling ETF shares. Options provide tools for hedging risk, generating income, and leveraging market movements in more complex ways. Potential Dampening of ETF Demand: While the spot Ethereum ETF itself is still a major step forward, the absence of options might make it less attractive to sophisticated traders and institutional investors who rely on options strategies. Uncertainty in Regulatory Landscape: This delay underscores the ongoing uncertainty surrounding crypto regulation in the US. It signals that the SEC is still proceeding cautiously with crypto-related investment products, even after approving spot Bitcoin ETFs. Impact on Market Sentiment: News of regulatory delays can sometimes create negative sentiment in the market, at least in the short term. Traders may interpret this as a sign of increased regulatory hurdles for crypto assets. Why the Delay? Decoding the SEC’s Crypto Regulation Stance The SEC hasn’t explicitly stated the reasons for this specific delay concerning options for the Fidelity ETH ETF. However, we can infer some potential factors based on the SEC’s general approach to crypto regulation and previous statements: Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC has consistently voiced concerns about potential market manipulation in the crypto space. Options markets, with their leverage and complexity, could be seen as adding another layer of risk in this regard. The SEC might be taking extra time to ensure sufficient safeguards are in place to prevent manipulation in Ethereum ETF options trading. Novelty of Crypto ETFs: While spot Bitcoin ETFs are now approved, the SEC is still navigating the relatively new territory of crypto-based investment products. Ethereum, while similar to Bitcoin, has its own unique characteristics and technological nuances. The SEC may be conducting further due diligence specific to Ethereum ETFs and their associated options. Broader Regulatory Framework: The SEC, along with other regulatory bodies, is likely working towards establishing a more comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Delays in specific product approvals could be part of a broader strategy to ensure that new crypto investment vehicles fit within this evolving framework. Political and Public Pressure: Regulatory decisions are often influenced by political and public sentiment. The SEC might be facing internal and external pressures to proceed cautiously with crypto approvals, especially given ongoing debates about investor protection and market stability. Fidelity ETH ETF and the Promise of Options: What’s at Stake? Fidelity’s Spot Ethereum ETF is a landmark product in itself, offering mainstream investors direct exposure to Ethereum without needing to hold the digital asset directly. The introduction of options trading on this ETF was expected to amplify its appeal and utility. Let’s consider what’s at stake with this delay: Aspect Impact of Options Trading Impact of Delay Investor Participation Wider range of investors, including sophisticated traders and institutions. Potentially limits participation to primarily buy-and-hold investors initially. Market Liquidity Increased liquidity in the ETF market due to options trading activity. May result in slightly lower initial liquidity compared to ETFs with options. Investment Strategies Enables diverse investment strategies like hedging, covered calls, and spreads. Restricts investment strategies to basic buying and selling of ETF shares. Market Efficiency Options markets can contribute to price discovery and overall market efficiency. Potentially slower price discovery and less efficient market dynamics in the short term. Navigating the Crypto Regulation Maze: What Can Investors Do? For investors closely watching the developments around the Fidelity Ethereum ETF and crypto regulation in general, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news and updates from reliable sources like Solid Intel and official SEC announcements. Understanding the evolving regulatory landscape is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes and crypto investments can help mitigate risks associated with regulatory uncertainties. Understand Risk Tolerance: Crypto investments are inherently volatile and subject to regulatory risks. Assess your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Options trading, when eventually approved, will add another layer of complexity and risk that needs careful consideration. Engage with the Community: Participate in discussions and forums within the crypto community. Sharing insights and perspectives can help you better understand market sentiment and potential future developments. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Regulatory processes can be lengthy and unpredictable. Focus on the long-term potential of Ethereum and the underlying technology, rather than getting overly fixated on short-term regulatory delays. The Future of Ethereum ETF Options: A Hopeful Outlook? While this delay is undoubtedly a setback, it’s important to maintain a balanced perspective. The SEC’s decision is a delay, not a definitive rejection. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year demonstrates a growing, albeit cautious, acceptance of crypto investment products by regulators. It is plausible that the SEC is taking a measured approach to ensure investor protection and market integrity as this new asset class matures. The demand for Ethereum ETFs and related investment vehicles is undeniable. As the crypto market continues to evolve and mature, and as regulatory frameworks become clearer, the eventual approval of options trading for Ethereum ETFs seems more like a matter of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’. Investors should remain patient, stay informed, and prepare for potential opportunities as the regulatory landscape for crypto assets continues to unfold. In conclusion, the SEC’s delay on Fidelity Ethereum ETF options is a notable development, highlighting the ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the crypto space. While it introduces a temporary hurdle, it doesn’t diminish the long-term potential of Ethereum ETFs or the broader crypto market. By staying informed and adaptable, investors can navigate these regulatory complexities and position themselves for future growth in this exciting and transformative asset class.

40982681,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135582,1740790577,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Market Relief? Trump Hints at Russia-Ukraine War End,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-market-war-end-trump/,"In a surprising turn of events that sent ripples through global markets, former U.S. President Donald Trump has declared that the protracted Russia-Ukraine conflict is approaching its conclusion. During a recent high-profile meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump’s statement has ignited a spark of optimism, particularly within the volatile cryptocurrency market. But what does this declaration truly signify for the future of digital assets? Let’s delve into the potential implications of this announcement and explore how it might reshape the crypto market landscape. Why is the Crypto Market Watching the Russia-Ukraine War? The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has been more than just a regional conflict; it’s a global event with far-reaching economic consequences. The cryptocurrency market, known for its sensitivity to geopolitical events, has been particularly reactive. Here’s why: Economic Uncertainty: Wars breed uncertainty. This uncertainty often drives investors towards safe-haven assets, but also sometimes into volatile assets like crypto for potential high returns amidst chaos. The end of the war could signal a shift towards more stable economic conditions, influencing investment strategies in the crypto market . Sanctions and Financial Flows: The conflict led to unprecedented sanctions against Russia, impacting global financial flows. Cryptocurrencies have been discussed as a potential tool to circumvent sanctions, adding another layer of complexity to the crypto market dynamics. De-escalation could alter these dynamics. Global Inflation and Interest Rates: The war exacerbated global inflation and influenced central banks’ interest rate policies. These macroeconomic factors directly affect the attractiveness of different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. A move towards peace could have implications for inflation and interest rate expectations, thus affecting the crypto market . Investor Sentiment: Geopolitical tensions significantly impact investor sentiment. War creates fear and risk aversion. Any indication of de-escalation can boost investor confidence and potentially trigger a shift towards risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Decoding the Potential War Impact on Crypto The war impact on the crypto sphere has been multifaceted. We’ve witnessed: Increased Volatility: The crypto market has seen heightened volatility in response to war-related news. Price swings have become more pronounced, reflecting the uncertainty and speculative trading around geopolitical events. Donations in Crypto: Cryptocurrencies emerged as a significant tool for donations to support Ukraine, showcasing their utility in cross-border transactions and humanitarian aid. This highlighted a practical application of crypto amidst crisis. Regulatory Scrutiny: The war and the use of crypto for sanctions evasion have intensified regulatory scrutiny of the crypto industry globally. Governments are keen to understand and regulate crypto to prevent illicit activities. Shift in Investment Narratives: The conflict has subtly shifted investment narratives around crypto. From being purely speculative assets, cryptocurrencies are increasingly being viewed through the lens of geopolitical hedging and alternative finance. Geopolitics and Crypto: A Lasting Relationship? The Russia-Ukraine war has undeniably underscored the intricate relationship between geopolitics and the crypto market. It’s no longer just about technology and finance; cryptocurrencies are now firmly in the realm of international relations and global power dynamics. Consider these points: Geopolitical Event Potential Crypto Market Reaction Escalation of Conflict Increased volatility, potential flight to safety or speculative spikes De-escalation/Peace Talks Positive market sentiment, potential price rallies in anticipation of stability New Sanctions Uncertainty, potential for increased use of crypto for alternative finance Regulatory Changes Post-Conflict Long-term shifts in market structure and compliance landscape As geopolitics continues to evolve, so too will its impact on the crypto ecosystem. Investors and enthusiasts must stay attuned to global events to navigate the crypto markets effectively. Trump’s Statement: A Turning Point? When Trump , a figure known for his market-moving pronouncements, states that the Russia-Ukraine war is “nearing an end,” it’s bound to capture attention. His remarks, delivered during a meeting with President Zelensky, suggest a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape. While details remain scant, the mere suggestion of de-escalation from a prominent global leader can have a significant psychological impact on markets. Is this wishful thinking or a grounded assessment? The market’s reaction will likely offer some clues. What Does This Crypto News Mean for You? This crypto news , stemming from Trump’s statement, carries several actionable insights for crypto enthusiasts and investors: Stay Informed: Geopolitical news is now crypto news. Keep abreast of developments related to the Russia-Ukraine situation and other global events. Manage Risk: Expect continued volatility, but be prepared for potential positive shifts if de-escalation becomes more concrete. Diversification and risk management are crucial. Watch Market Sentiment: Monitor crypto market sentiment closely. News of peace talks or de-escalation could trigger rallies. Conversely, skepticism or renewed conflict could lead to pullbacks. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is expected, consider the long-term implications. A peaceful resolution could lead to a more stable global economic environment, potentially benefiting the crypto market in the long run. The Road Ahead: Hope and Cautious Optimism Donald Trump’s assertion injects a dose of hope into a world weary of conflict. For the crypto market, it presents a glimmer of optimism amidst persistent volatility. However, it’s crucial to approach this news with cautious optimism. Statements are not guarantees, and the path to peace is rarely linear. The crypto market, while potentially poised for a relief rally, will remain sensitive to further developments. Investors should remain vigilant, informed, and prepared for all eventualities. The end of war would be a welcome development for global stability and could pave the way for a more constructive phase for the crypto market and the world at large.

Ripple’s price also failed to trade above the $2.35 resistance zone, which has seen the XRP price movement start a fresh dip. On the other hand, Binance Coin has shown impressive resilience amid the recent market downturn. Meanwhile, a new DeFi is already attracting massive interest from investors. The blockchain-based payment platform Remittix (RTX) maintains its position as a potential top altcoin to buy by addressing real-world payment hurdles globally. Its PayFi features and functional orientation have seen the RTX price rally to $0.0694, having surged by over 362%. Ethereum Price Prediction: Will ETH Fall Below $2,100 As the second largest crypto by market cap, Ethereum's attempts to hold its current range are failing as analysts predict more incoming dips. Following the recent Bybit hack, the crypto sector market experienced a market correction that sent many cryptos below key support levels. Bitcoin price dipped below the $90,000 level for the first time since November 2024. Ethereum, a top altcoin, was also not left out, recording a weekly dip of over 22% and it failed to sustain its key $2,600 support level after the market crash resumed on Monday. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez had previously warned that this support level was key for the altcoin’s bullish trend continuation, and failing to hold it could send the price of Ethereum to the $2,400 mark and below. Ethereum bearish flag risks dipping to $2,100 | Source: Carl Runefelt on X After the dip, the analyst stated that the $2,345 level was Ethereum’s next critical support zone. However, the ETH token failed to hold this level on Wednesday, dropping to $2,300. Analyst Carl Runefelt also cautioned about the top altcoin dipping nature, suggesting that Ethereum risked dropping below the $2,180 level with support near the $2,000 level. Ripple Price Wobbles at $2.00: Will Bulls Step In? The price of XRP has dipped below the $2.12 support level to enter a bearish zone. A low has been formed at $2.02 as the altcoin price struggles to remain above the $2.00 level. This Ripple price movement points at many bearish signals that could see the XRP token deep even further. XRP price movement | Source: CoinMarketCap On the upside, the price of XRP could face resistance near the $2.12 level, with the first major resistance near the $2.20 level. However, there is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.20 on the hourly chart. If XRP fails to clear this resistance level, it could continue dipping further with support near the $2.02 level with major support at $2.00 If the downside break and a close below the $2.00 level is achieved, the price of Ripple might witness another decline towards the $1.96 support. However, crypto analyst Ali Martinez also suggests that the altcoin could be gearing up for a relief rally as the TD sequential indicator flashes a buy signal. Binance Coin Shows Resilience Amid Market Dip Despite a significant dip in Binance Coin price movement after struggling to surpass the $700 level earlier this month, the BNB token has demonstrated key indicators that suggest it might be primed for a rebound. In the 2024 bull market, BNB faced several key market events, including the Grayscale GBTC sell-off and the Federal Reserve policy adjustments. Despite these hurdles, Binance Coin demonstrated resilience. Recently, the price of Binance Coin faced significant selling pressure, as its price dropped below the $600 level, touching a low of around $578, with Ali Martinez's previous post suggesting it could retrace to $380 or drop to $214. However, buyers quickly stepped in, pushing the price above the $580 level. Binance Coin price movement | Source: CoinMarketCap If the price of Binance Coin maintains the $580 level, there could be a rally towards higher resistance levels, such as the $647 and $685. However, the RSI has dipped to 36, suggesting the altcoin is nearing an oversold threshold. If the selling pressure intensifies and the BNB price fails to sustain a move above $565, a critical support level, it could face more dips toward $500. Remittix (RTX) Price Records An Over 362% Rally While crypto was meant to redefine global finance, spending digital assets in the real world is still a challenge. Financial institutions globally are tightening restrictions on crypto transactions, making it hard for users to access funds. However, Remittix (RTX) offers a solution that will ensure users can easily move their crypto tokens into fiat without the existing banking limitations. Remittix holds the potential to operate outside centralized financial control. Moreover, businesses also get to benefit from Remittix Pay API. This feature will allow businesses to embrace crypto payments and convert them to over 30-plus fiat currencies. This move could position Remittix as a top altcoin in 2025, having already recorded an over 362% price rally. Moreover, Remittix distinguishes itself through its functional merits. The asset delivers real-tangible service besides holding a significant market value. This platform exists to provide meaningful benefits to users who need its services. To start with, it eliminates intermediaries from international money transfers while delivering faster and more affordable services. Its presale success demonstrates the project’s rising consumer base. With such momentum, Remittix price could record 5000% gains in 2025, with over 500M RTX tokens already sold. Its scalability also makes it stand out from other altcoins, including Ethereum, which suffers from network congestion. With a current price tag of $0.0694 and over $13M in presale funding, Remittix is set to continue recording more gains in 2025, offering early investors the opportune chance to earn higher ROI. Will Remittix Grab The Top Altcoin Throne from Ethereum Ripple, and Cardano Ethereum and Ripple's bearish outlook could lead to more dips in the coming days as the two altcoins near an oversold level. However, Binance Coin's market resilience despite the bearish outlook could help the token regain an uptrend momentum backed by its bulls. Similarly, Remittix presents itself as the ideal choice among elite altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple and Binance coins, as it delivers both promising value and real-world usefulness.

The Bitcoin market just witnessed a massive movement that has everyone talking. In a jaw-dropping hour, over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin vanished from major cryptocurrency exchanges. According to data from CryptoQuant, a staggering 9,148.64 BTC – equivalent to a cool $1 billion – was pulled out of these platforms. This isn’t just pocket change; it’s a monumental shift that’s got analysts and investors alike scratching their heads and wondering, “What does this mean for Bitcoin?” Let’s dive into the details of these significant Bitcoin withdrawals and explore the potential implications for the crypto market. Why are These Massive Crypto Exchange Outflows Happening? The numbers are truly eye-opening. CryptoQuant’s data reveals a breakdown of where this Bitcoin leaving exchanges action originated: Coinbase Prime: A hefty 3,074 BTC departed from Coinbase Prime. Binance: Binance saw 2,652 BTC move out. Coinbase Advanced: Another 1,827 BTC was withdrawn from Coinbase Advanced. These aren’t your average retail traders making small withdrawals. CryptoQuant suggests that these large-scale crypto exchange outflows from platforms that don’t typically handle custody or OTC (Over-The-Counter) trading could indicate new wallet transfers. But what does that actually mean? Here’s a simplified breakdown of potential reasons behind such significant BTC withdrawals : Institutional Accumulation: Large entities or institutions might be accumulating Bitcoin, moving it off exchanges into their own secure wallets for long-term holding. This is often seen as a bullish signal, suggesting strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future. Shifting to Cold Storage: Investors might be moving their Bitcoin to cold storage solutions for enhanced security. Cold storage, like hardware wallets, keeps your crypto offline, significantly reducing the risk of online hacks. OTC Deals: While CryptoQuant mentioned exchanges not supporting OTC, it’s still possible that these withdrawals are related to larger OTC deals being settled off-exchange. De-risking from Exchanges: In light of past exchange collapses and security concerns, some investors may be proactively removing their Bitcoin from exchanges to minimize potential risks associated with platform vulnerabilities or regulatory uncertainties. What Does a Billion Dollar Bitcoin Outflow Signify for the Market? A billion dollar Bitcoin outflow in a single hour is not just a blip on the radar; it’s a seismic event that can ripple through the entire crypto market. So, what are the potential implications? Reduced Selling Pressure: When Bitcoin is withdrawn from exchanges, it’s generally considered to be moving into longer-term storage, effectively reducing the immediate supply available for trading. This decrease in supply can potentially lead to reduced selling pressure and, consequently, upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Bullish Sentiment Indicator: Large withdrawals are often interpreted as a sign of bullish sentiment. Investors wouldn’t move significant amounts of Bitcoin off exchanges unless they anticipated holding it for the long term and potentially expecting price appreciation. Potential Price Volatility: While reduced supply can be bullish, such large movements can also contribute to price volatility, especially in the short term. The market may react to these outflows with uncertainty before settling into a new equilibrium. Institutional Interest Confirmation: Sustained periods of large Bitcoin withdrawals could be a strong indicator of growing institutional interest and adoption. Institutions tend to make larger, longer-term investments, and moving Bitcoin into custody solutions is a characteristic of their investment strategy. Could This Be a Bullish Signal for Bitcoin? Many analysts are indeed viewing these massive Bitcoin withdrawals as a potentially bullish signal. The logic is straightforward: if large holders are removing Bitcoin from exchanges, they are likely not planning to sell it anytime soon. This reduces the available supply on exchanges and signals a longer-term holding strategy. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is complex and influenced by numerous factors. While these crypto exchange outflows are noteworthy, they are just one piece of the puzzle. Other factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and overall market sentiment, also play significant roles in Bitcoin’s price action. Actionable Insights: Monitor Exchange Balances: Keep an eye on exchange balances and withdrawal trends. Significant and sustained outflows can be an indicator of shifting market sentiment and potential price movements. Track Institutional Activity: Look for news and data related to institutional Bitcoin adoption and custody solutions. Increased institutional involvement often correlates with bullish market phases. Stay Informed, Stay Vigilant: The crypto market is dynamic. Stay updated on market news, analyze data from reputable sources like CryptoQuant, and make informed decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of the market landscape. Conclusion: A Billion Dollar Question – Where is Bitcoin Headed? The billion dollar Bitcoin question remains: where is all this Bitcoin going, and what does it truly mean for the future? While the immediate impact of these Bitcoin leaving exchanges is still unfolding, the sheer magnitude of these withdrawals cannot be ignored. It’s a potent reminder of the ever-evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market and the significant shifts that can occur in the blink of an eye. Whether this is the start of a new bullish phase, a strategic repositioning by large holders, or something else entirely, one thing is certain: the crypto world will be watching closely to see what happens next. This massive outflow certainly injects a dose of excitement and speculation into the market, leaving us all pondering the next chapter in Bitcoin’s incredible journey.

As Tesla Inc.’s stock has plummeted, so too have the fortunes of many retail investors in South Korea, who placed their bets on exchange-traded products (ETPs) designed to amplify gains. Tesla, which had become a beloved stock among South Korean investors, has seen its value decrease significantly in recent months. This has affected thousands of retail investors who were banking on ETPs that mirror Tesla’s daily price movements—particularly the Leverage Shares 3x Tesla product. According to data from South Korea’s top three brokerages, as of February 21, Korean investors owned a significant share of this product, which seeks to triple Tesla’s daily returns. That strategy, however, has not paid off, as the leveraged product is down over 80% from its high in December, while Tesla stock itself has “only” dropped by 41% in that time. Leveraged ETPs — designed to maximize gains by utilizing derivatives and rebalance daily — frequently incur deadly losses when the market moves against them. These products at times will lag their underlying assets during volatile periods. That’s precisely what we’re seeing right now, with Tesla-linked products and other high-risk assets such as Bitcoin and Chinese market-linked structured notes also plunging sharply. Korean investors reel from heavy losses in risky leveraged ETPs The huge losses among Korean investors highlight their appetite for high-risk trading that, at times, has alarmed regulators and brokers. In response to the big losses in some of the riskiest leveraged ETPs listed overseas, Mirae Asset Securities Co., one of South Korea’s largest brokerages, said it would suspend orders for such ETPs last week. Another leveraged exchange-traded fund, listed in the U.S. and offering twice the daily return on Tesla shares, has lost nearly 70% of its value since peaking on Dec. 17. According to depository data, Korean investors owned about $1.5 billion of the fund on Wednesday, or 43% of its total assets. Leveraged ETPs have become all the rage worldwide, issued in huge numbers by Wall Street firms after post-U.S. election market euphoria. But after a recent pullback in the so-called “Magnificent Seven” stocks — over the summer, stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet surged on a wave of economic uncertainty and competition from Chinese tech companies — many of these speculative products are souring. South Korean retail investors, who make up a large share of the trading volume in these kinds of instruments, are feeling the pinch amid this downturn. Many have already suffered painful losses on speculative assets, including Bitcoin and structured notes linked to the Chinese market. Tesla has been particularly popular with South Korean investors since the onset of the pandemic. As of February 21, local traders held approximately 358 billion won ($245 million) in the London-listed Leverage Shares 3x Tesla product. This represented over 90% of the fund’s assets that day. Tesla mania persists in Korea despite heavy losses in leveraged ETPs Some experts believe that despite this downturn, the appetite for leveraging Tesla-specific products remains strong. “Tesla has always been one of the most favourable stocks among Korean investors, and this craze has also naturally led to the purchase of leveraged Tesla products such as TSL3,” said Bora Kim, APAC head of strategy of ETP provider Leverage Shares. He also said the extreme volatility of Tesla shares makes them appealing to short-term traders. Tesla-linked ETPs are not alone in struggling, as leveraged ETFs across the board have had a tough time. The T-REX 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF (MSTU), an exchange-traded fund that offers investors leveraged exposure to the stock of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), is also down about 81% since its November peak, according to The Kobeissi Letter . In just three trading days, it was down 40%—the same devastating trend plaguing funds tied to Tesla. Source:Kobeissi Letter Leveraged ETFs are always riskier, and in volatile periods, they do worse than plain old ETFs because of the costs associated with daily rebalancing and the use of derivatives instead of the underlying stocks. In a study by GSR Markets, leveraged ETFs often lag similar strategies in volatile markets by more than 20%. South Korean traders face reckoning as Tesla’s decline tests high-stakes bets With pressure on Tesla’s stock, South Korean retail investors may have to re-evaluate their highly leveraged trading habits. The maker of electric vehicles is in choppier waters, facing headwinds that include increased competition, patchy demand, and macroeconomic pressures. With regulators taking more precautionary steps and brokerages pulling back on risky products, South Korean investors may need to reassess their approach. Will they double down on their aggressive bets on Tesla and other leveraged assets, or will they seek safer, more conservative investments moving forward? If the slide continues, more Korean investors may be staring at steep losses, adding to wider concern about speculative trading in the country. With regulatory scrutiny mounting and brokers taking preventative measures, it will be interesting to see if South Korean investors will continue their all-out assault on leveraged bets on Tesla or temper their approach for more conservative investments.",OP-ED|South Korea|Tesla,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|ASIA|BTC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-01 01:07:34

Forget waiting for federal mandates – Lummis believes individual states will take the initiative, establishing strategic Bitcoin reserves long before any national-level policy materializes. This isn’t just about states dipping their toes into crypto; it’s a potential paradigm shift in how governments view and utilize Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Let’s delve into why this state-led revolution in Bitcoin reserves could be on the horizon and what it means for the future of cryptocurrency in the U.S. Why State-Level Bitcoin Reserves First? Senator Lummis’s prediction, shared by Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, hinges on a crucial factor: the current level of understanding and acceptance of Bitcoin among federal lawmakers. According to Lummis, there simply isn’t sufficient comfort or consensus within the House and Senate to drive federal-level Bitcoin reserves at this juncture. This hesitancy at the federal level opens a window of opportunity for states to pioneer this innovative approach. But why are states potentially more agile and receptive to the idea of holding Bitcoin? Smaller Scale, Greater Flexibility: States often operate with more budgetary and regulatory flexibility than the federal government. This allows them to experiment with new asset classes like Bitcoin without the immediate scrutiny and bureaucratic hurdles of federal policy-making. Economic Diversification at the State Level: States are constantly seeking ways to diversify their economies and attract investment. Embracing Bitcoin reserves could position a state as a hub for technological innovation and attract businesses and individuals interested in digital assets. This forward-thinking approach can be a significant economic differentiator. Competition Among States: Just as states compete for businesses and residents, they also compete for economic relevance. If one state takes the plunge and establishes successful Bitcoin reserves , others may feel compelled to follow suit to remain competitive and avoid being left behind in the burgeoning digital economy. Grassroots Crypto Adoption: In many parts of the U.S., grassroots movements and local communities are already embracing cryptocurrencies. This groundswell of support at the state level adoption can create political pressure and pave the way for state governments to consider Bitcoin more seriously. The Strategic Importance of Bitcoin Reserves What exactly does it mean for a state to hold “strategic Bitcoin reserves,” and why is this significant? The concept draws parallels to national gold reserves or strategic petroleum reserves, assets held to ensure economic stability and security. In the digital age, Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a similar kind of strategic asset. Let’s break down the potential benefits: Potential Benefits of State Bitcoin Reserves Benefit Description Economic Diversification Holding Bitcoin diversifies a state’s treasury beyond traditional assets like fiat currency and bonds. Bitcoin’s uncorrelated nature to traditional markets can act as a hedge against economic downturns and inflation. Technological Innovation Hub States embracing Bitcoin signal a commitment to technological innovation and attract businesses and talent in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. This can foster economic growth and create high-paying jobs. Future-Proofing State Finances As the world becomes increasingly digital, holding digital assets like Bitcoin can position a state for the future of finance and potentially provide long-term appreciation as Bitcoin adoption grows globally. Attracting Younger Demographics Embracing Bitcoin can appeal to younger, tech-savvy demographics, potentially attracting them to live and work in states that are perceived as forward-thinking and innovative in the digital space. Challenges and Considerations for State-Level Bitcoin Adoption While the potential benefits are compelling, establishing Bitcoin reserves at the state level is not without its challenges. States considering this move must carefully navigate a complex landscape. Here are some key considerations: Navigating the Challenges of Crypto Regulation Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving, both at the federal and state level adoption . States need to ensure compliance with existing and future regulations, which can be a moving target. Volatility Management: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a well-known characteristic. States need robust risk management strategies to mitigate potential losses due to price fluctuations. This might involve dollar-cost averaging, secure storage solutions, and clear guidelines for reserve management. Security and Custody: Securely storing and managing Bitcoin reserves is paramount. States must invest in robust cybersecurity infrastructure and consider using reputable custodians to safeguard their digital assets from theft or loss. Public Education and Transparency: Public understanding of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is still limited. States need to educate their citizens about the rationale behind holding Bitcoin reserves and ensure transparency in their management of these assets to build public trust and acceptance. Political Will and Support: Implementing such a novel policy requires strong political will and bipartisan support within state legislatures. Overcoming skepticism and securing the necessary legislative approvals can be a significant hurdle. Examples from Around the Globe: Learning from Others While no U.S. state has yet officially declared holding Bitcoin as part of its strategic reserves, other countries and regions have already begun exploring this path. El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender and its Bitcoin reserves are perhaps the most prominent example. While controversial, it offers valuable lessons in both the opportunities and challenges of integrating Bitcoin into a national economy. Furthermore, companies like MicroStrategy have demonstrated the potential of holding Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset, providing a model that states could potentially adapt. Cynthia Lummis: A Champion for Digital Assets Senator Cynthia Lummis’s advocacy for Bitcoin and digital assets is well-documented. She is one of the most vocal and informed voices in the U.S. Senate on cryptocurrency matters. Her prediction about state level adoption of Bitcoin reserves isn’t just a casual observation; it’s likely based on her deep understanding of the political landscape and the growing momentum behind crypto adoption at various levels. Lummis’s continued efforts to educate her colleagues and promote sensible crypto regulation are crucial for fostering a more favorable environment for digital assets in the U.S. Actionable Insights for States Considering Bitcoin Reserves For states contemplating following Senator Lummis’s predicted path and establishing Bitcoin reserves , here are some actionable insights: Form a Crypto Task Force: Create a dedicated task force comprising experts in cryptocurrency, finance, cybersecurity, and law to study the feasibility and implications of holding Bitcoin reserves. Conduct a Pilot Program: Start with a small-scale pilot program to acquire and manage a modest amount of Bitcoin reserves. This allows for learning and refinement of strategies before committing to larger holdings. Develop Robust Security Protocols: Prioritize the development of top-tier security protocols for storing and managing Bitcoin, potentially partnering with established custodians. Engage in Public Education: Launch public education initiatives to inform citizens about Bitcoin, its potential benefits and risks, and the state’s rationale for considering it as a reserve asset. Collaborate with Other States: Share knowledge and best practices with other states exploring similar initiatives to create a collaborative ecosystem for state level adoption of digital assets. The Dawn of State-Level Bitcoin Strategies? Senator Lummis’s prediction paints a compelling picture of a bottom-up approach to Bitcoin adoption in the U.S., driven by individual states taking the lead. While federal crypto regulation and acceptance may still be on the horizon, the agility and economic incentives at the state level could indeed pave the way for a decentralized and innovative approach to integrating Bitcoin into government treasuries. Whether Lummis’s forecast proves accurate remains to be seen, but it undoubtedly sparks an important conversation about the strategic role of Bitcoin in the future of state finances and the broader U.S. economy. The potential for states to become pioneers in digital assets is a fascinating prospect, and one that the crypto world – and indeed, the financial world – will be watching closely.

Recent data from IntoTheBlock, a leading crypto market intelligence platform, is hinting at a potentially pivotal moment for Bitcoin. A surge in Bitcoin active addresses , reaching levels not seen since December 2024, has caught the attention of analysts. Could this be a mere blip, or is it a significant indicator of something bigger brewing in the Bitcoin market? Let’s dive deep into what this on-chain activity spike could mean for you and the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the Surge in Bitcoin Active Addresses IntoTheBlock’s recent X (formerly Twitter) post highlighted a compelling trend: Bitcoin active addresses have reached their highest daily count since December 2024. But what exactly does this mean? Active addresses refer to the number of unique wallet addresses participating in Bitcoin transactions on a given day. A spike in this metric typically indicates increased network utilization and can be triggered by various factors, both bullish and bearish. In this instance, IntoTheBlock suggests it might be pointing towards a specific, often dramatic market event: capitulation. To understand the significance, let’s break down what active addresses tell us: Increased Network Activity: More active addresses directly translate to more transactions happening on the Bitcoin blockchain. This could be due to increased buying, selling, or simply movement of Bitcoin between wallets. Market Interest: A surge can suggest renewed interest in Bitcoin, either from new entrants or existing holders becoming more active. Potential Turning Points: Historically, spikes in on-chain activity, including active addresses, have coincided with both market peaks and troughs. This is because significant market movements often drive increased transactional activity as investors react to price changes. However, it’s crucial to not look at this metric in isolation. Context is key. Let’s explore why IntoTheBlock is specifically pointing towards a market capitulation scenario. Is Market Capitulation Imminent? Unpacking the Signal Market capitulation is a dramatic and often painful phase in a market cycle. It typically occurs at the end of a downtrend and is characterized by: Panic Selling: Investors, overwhelmed by fear and losses, sell off their assets aggressively, often regardless of price. Price Bottoms: Capitulation often marks or closely precedes the bottom of a price decline. The intense selling pressure can purge weak hands from the market, paving the way for a potential recovery. High Volume: Capitulation events are usually accompanied by exceptionally high trading volume as masses rush to exit their positions. IntoTheBlock’s analysis suggests that the spike in Bitcoin active addresses could be a signal of this capitulation phase. Why? Because capitulation events are inherently high-activity periods. Think about it: if many holders are panicking and selling, you’d expect to see a significant jump in on-chain transactions and, consequently, active addresses. (Replace “image-url.jpg” and adjust caption ID as needed. This is a placeholder for an image depicting the relationship between Bitcoin active addresses and price, if available). However, it’s essential to approach this interpretation with caution. While historical data shows correlations, correlation doesn’t equal causation. Let’s consider other factors that could contribute to increased on-chain activity . Beyond Capitulation: Other Drivers of On-Chain Activity While market capitulation is a compelling interpretation, it’s not the only possible explanation for a surge in on-chain activity . Other factors can also drive up Bitcoin active addresses: Bull Market Peaks: Conversely, market tops in bull runs also see high on-chain activity. As prices reach new highs, investors might be taking profits, moving funds to exchanges, or engaging in increased trading, all contributing to higher active addresses. Network Upgrades or Events: Significant network upgrades or anticipated events (like the Bitcoin halving) can increase activity as users prepare their wallets or move funds in anticipation of changes. Whale Activity: Large transactions from whales (major Bitcoin holders) can significantly impact active address counts. A few large entities moving substantial amounts of BTC can skew the daily numbers. Increased Adoption: Gradual, organic growth in Bitcoin adoption over time will naturally lead to a higher baseline of active addresses. Therefore, to accurately interpret the current spike, we need to consider the broader crypto market signals and context. Are we seeing widespread panic across the crypto market? Are other indicators, like exchange inflows, also pointing to selling pressure? Or are there other events that could be inflating on-chain metrics? Navigating Crypto Market Signals: Actionable Insights for You So, what should you, as a crypto investor or enthusiast, take away from this analysis of Bitcoin active addresses ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed, Don’t Panic: The increase in active addresses is an interesting data point, but it’s not a definitive prediction of capitulation. Use it as a signal to dig deeper, not to trigger impulsive decisions. Look at Multiple Indicators: Don’t rely solely on one metric. Analyze other on-chain data (exchange flows, transaction volume, miner activity), price charts, and broader market sentiment to form a holistic view. Assess Market Sentiment: Is there widespread fear and negative sentiment in the crypto market? News headlines, social media discussions, and crypto fear & greed indices can provide clues. Consider Your Strategy: Whether this is capitulation or not, have a clear investment strategy. Are you a long-term holder? A trader? Your approach will dictate how you react to market signals. Prepare for Volatility: Regardless of whether capitulation is truly happening, heightened on-chain activity often precedes periods of increased volatility. Be prepared for potential price swings. The Turning Point for BTC? A Cautious Conclusion IntoTheBlock’s observation of surging Bitcoin active addresses is a valuable piece of the puzzle in understanding the current state of the crypto market. It raises the possibility that we might be approaching a significant BTC turning point , potentially a market capitulation event. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is just one indicator. A comprehensive analysis requires considering a range of factors and market signals. While the data is intriguing and warrants attention, it’s not a definitive call to action in itself. Instead, it serves as a prompt to exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and remain vigilant as the crypto market continues to unfold. The coming days and weeks will be crucial in confirming whether this surge in active addresses truly signals a capitulation moment or if it’s driven by other underlying dynamics.

40983302,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135609,1740791778,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Claim: Trump Declares Zelensky ‘Not Ready for Peace’ – Crypto Market Impact?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-zelensky-peace-talks-crypto/,"In a dramatic turn of events that could send ripples across global markets, including the volatile crypto sphere, former U.S. President Donald Trump has made a startling claim about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to Trump, Zelensky is ‘not ready for peace’ despite significant U.S. intervention in the ongoing conflict. This revelation, shared on Trump’s social media platform Truth Social, raises critical questions about the future of Ukraine peace talks and the potential ramifications for international stability and financial markets. Is Zelensky’s Peace Stance a Setback for Global Stability? Trump’s statement directly challenges the prevailing narrative of Ukraine’s eagerness for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. He asserts that despite a ‘meaningful meeting’ at the White House, Zelensky’s demeanor and negotiating position indicate a lack of readiness for genuine peace. This is particularly noteworthy considering the substantial US intervention Ukraine has provided, including billions in aid and military support, which Trump suggests should give Ukraine a stronger hand at the negotiating table. Here’s a breakdown of Trump’s key assertions: Direct Meeting: Trump confirms a recent meeting with Zelensky at the White House, implying a direct and personal assessment of the Ukrainian leader’s mindset. Peace Readiness Questioned: Trump explicitly states Zelensky ‘does not seem ready for peace yet,’ casting doubt on Ukraine’s current diplomatic approach. US Leverage Ignored: Trump claims Zelensky has ‘ignored the U.S.,’ suggesting a disregard for American influence and advice in the peace process. Open Door for Future Engagement: Despite the current impasse, Trump leaves the door open for future dialogue, stating Zelensky ‘can come back when he is ready for peace.’ This isn’t the first indication of potential friction between the two leaders. Reports of a ‘heated argument’ during their meeting further fuel speculation about disagreements on strategy and objectives. The core question now is: what does this mean for the already fragile geopolitical landscape, and how might it impact the crypto market impact Ukraine conflict? Analyzing the Potential Impact of Trump’s Statement Trump’s pronouncements, especially on international matters, carry significant weight. His assertion about Zelensky peace stance not only affects diplomatic relations but could also have broader consequences: Eroding Confidence in Peace Prospects: If a major global player like Trump believes peace is not imminent due to Zelensky’s stance, it could dampen international optimism and efforts towards a negotiated settlement. Shifting Geopolitical Dynamics: This statement might signal a potential shift in U.S. policy or approach towards the Ukraine conflict, especially if Trump were to regain political power. Market Volatility: Geopolitical instability is a known driver of market volatility. Uncertainty surrounding the Ukraine peace talks could trigger fluctuations in traditional financial markets and, notably, in the cryptocurrency market, which often reacts sharply to global events. Investor Sentiment: Negative news regarding peace prospects can impact investor sentiment. In the crypto market, which is heavily influenced by sentiment, this could lead to increased selling pressure or a shift towards safer assets. A visual representaton of the tense meeting between Trump and Zelensky. Source: AI Generated Image Navigating Crypto Investments Amidst Geopolitical Uncertainty For cryptocurrency investors, understanding the interplay between global politics and market movements is crucial. Events like stalled Trump Zelensky peace discussions introduce uncertainty, which can translate into both risks and opportunities in the crypto market. Here are some actionable insights for crypto enthusiasts: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of geopolitical developments and their potential market implications. News aggregators, crypto news platforms, and financial analysis sites can be valuable resources. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification remains a key strategy in volatile times. Spreading investments across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes can mitigate risk. Manage Risk: Employ risk management tools like stop-loss orders and consider adjusting your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and market outlook. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that the crypto market is known for its cyclical nature. Focus on long-term investment strategies rather than getting swayed by short-term market fluctuations driven by geopolitical news. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Peace and Markets Trump’s assertion that Zelensky is ‘not ready for peace’ marks a potentially critical juncture in the Ukraine conflict and its global repercussions. For the cryptocurrency market, already navigating its own inherent volatility, this adds another layer of complexity. Investors need to remain vigilant, informed, and adaptable as the situation unfolds. The path to peace, and its impact on the global financial landscape, including the crypto world, remains uncertain, demanding careful observation and strategic decision-making.

Here’s what Polymarket predictions say,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/doge-major-goals-polymarket-predictions/,"Elon Musk’s DOGE has devised strategies to cut the federal budget, from auditing Fort Knox gold reserves to creating a DOGE dividend. However, sentiment on betting markets like Polymarket suggests that these plans may be too ambitious. DOGE has taken extreme measures to fulfill its goals, such as major layoffs from several government agencies and the shutdown of the US Agency of International Development. According to DOGE’s official savings tracker , the organization has saved $65 billion of the government’s budget to date. However, this achievement has not won bettors’ confidence in DOGE’s future promises. Overall, their hopes seem to be low based on Polymarket data. Polymarket bettors aren’t positive about the budget being cut by 5% in 2025 Elon Musk aimed for budget cuts of up to $2 trillion. He said reaching half that amount would be “an epic outcome.” Federal government spending reached $6.9 billion in 2024, which means that DOGE will have to cut $345 billion to hit the 5% mark in 2025. According to Polymarket’s predictions, Musk’s 5% cut is unlikely to happen, as 74% of bettors predicted against it. Chances of Elon musk cutting the budget by at least 5%.

What a time. https://t.co/hrhZmO5N6u pic.twitter.com/Ws9wI3Cxej — Deva Hazarika (@devahaz) February 10, 2025 A user on X @electricfutures revealed the number of mistakes made by DOGE when logging in the FPDS database, and mentioned that the agency is now doing “damage control.” The user said that despite making the corrections, DOGE still claims to have saved $55 billion. He added that the actual total savings would be around 32.5 billion, which is still “a huge overestimate.” And despite applying most of the changes I called for in my original thread, they STILL CLAIM TO HAVE SAVED $55B. The savings listed dropped from $16.5B to $6.5B! If this is 20% of the total, like they also claim, the total would be $32.5B! (In reality still a huge overestimate!) — Momentum Chaser (@electricfutures) February 20, 2025 The agency also allegedly counted one contract three times to reach $2 billion in savings. It also reported another IT contract’s saving of $1 billion, but its spending was already at 80%. DOGE has already corrected these errors. However, @Electricfutures on X says that despite correcting these errors, DOGE “did NOT change the underlying flaws in how they were estimating savings for any of the other contracts.” Post by @Electricfutures on X.

This clause should not be interpreted as a lack of commitment, but rather as a pragmatic approach to ensuring the long-term health and sustainability of the BNB Chain ecosystem growth . The Impact on BNB Chain and Beyond What are the potential ripple effects of CZ’s initiative? The weekly liquidity support is poised to have a multi-faceted impact: Impact Area Potential Benefits DeFi Ecosystem Enhanced stability for DeFi protocols, increased trading volumes, and reduced slippage. Developer Activity More attractive environment for developers to build and deploy applications, leading to innovation. User Experience Smoother transactions, better prices, and increased confidence in the BNB Chain network. BNB Token Value Potential positive impact on BNB price due to increased ecosystem activity and demand. Market Perception Reinforces Binance’s commitment to the BNB Chain, strengthening its reputation in the crypto space. This strategic move by CZ Binance is not just about injecting funds; it’s about injecting confidence, stability, and growth potential into the BNB Chain. It’s a testament to the power of proactive ecosystem support and community engagement in the ever-evolving world of blockchain technology. Actionable Insights for the BNB Chain Community So, what does this mean for you, the BNB Chain community member? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official Binance and BNB Chain channels for updates on the liquidity injection program and any adjustments. Engage with the Community: Participate in discussions and provide feedback on initiatives like the returned funds allocation. Explore BNB Chain Opportunities: With increased liquidity and ecosystem growth, now might be an opportune time to explore DeFi projects, NFTs, and other applications within the BNB Chain ecosystem. Monitor Market Trends: Observe how this liquidity injection impacts BNB price and overall market sentiment towards the BNB Chain. By staying informed and actively participating, you can maximize the benefits of this exciting development within the BNB Chain ecosystem. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Brighter BNB Chain Future CZ’s commitment to providing weekly BNB liquidity is a bold and commendable step towards fostering a more robust, vibrant, and sustainable BNB Chain ecosystem.

Chinese mining machine manufacturer Intchains just dropped their 2024 fiscal year earnings report, and the numbers are absolutely mind-blowing. Buckle up, because it seems the Dogecoin craze, fueled by none other than Elon Musk and Donald Trump, has sent Doge mining rig orders into orbit. Let’s dive into the details of this explosive growth and what it means for the crypto landscape. Why the Sudden Explosion in Doge Mining Rig Orders? Intchains, a key player in the altcoin mining hardware market, specifically pointed to the influence of two major figures: U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Both personalities are known for their vocal support and sometimes meme-driven engagement with Dogecoin. This endorsement appears to have directly translated into a massive spike in interest and demand for Doge mining rig equipment. Think about it – when Elon Musk tweets about Dogecoin, the crypto market often reacts. Similarly, any positive mention or association from a figure like Donald Trump can amplify interest, especially among retail investors. This celebrity-driven hype, combined with the inherent speculative nature of cryptocurrency, has created a perfect storm for Doge mining rig manufacturers like Intchains. Intchains’ Staggering Growth: By the Numbers The earnings report speaks for itself. Intchains isn’t just seeing a slight uptick; they’re experiencing a full-blown surge. Let’s break down the key figures that highlight this incredible growth: Sales Revenue Soars: Intchains reported a staggering $38.6 million in sales. Net Income Rockets: Their net income reached $8.3 million. Year-over-Year Growth: This represents a jaw-dropping 242% increase in net income compared to the previous year. ASIC Chip Sales Explode: They sold 2.68 million ASIC chips. Increase in ASIC Chip Sales: This is an impressive 84% jump in ASIC chip sales from the year before. These numbers paint a clear picture: the demand for mining machine orders , particularly for Doge mining, is through the roof. Intchains is struggling to keep up with the overwhelming influx of orders, indicating a supply-demand imbalance in the market. The Power of ASIC Chips in Doge Mining ASIC chips, or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, are the workhorses of modern cryptocurrency mining. For Dogecoin mining, specialized ASICs are far more efficient than using general-purpose CPUs or GPUs. Intchains’ success is directly linked to their ability to produce and sell these high-performance ASIC chips . Here’s why ASIC chips are so crucial for profitable Doge mining: Efficiency: ASICs are designed specifically for one task – in this case, solving the complex cryptographic algorithms required for mining. This specialization makes them incredibly energy-efficient compared to general-purpose hardware. Hash Rate Dominance: ASICs deliver significantly higher hash rates (the speed at which a miner can solve calculations) than CPUs or GPUs. A higher hash rate means a greater chance of successfully mining blocks and earning rewards. Profitability: In the competitive world of crypto mining, efficiency and hash rate directly translate to profitability. ASICs give miners a competitive edge, making Doge mining more economically viable, especially when Dogecoin prices are favorable. The surge in mining machine orders and ASIC chip sales reported by Intchains underscores the continued importance of specialized hardware in the crypto mining ecosystem. Challenges and Opportunities in the Doge Mining Boom While the surge in demand for Doge mining rig equipment is undoubtedly positive for Intchains and the broader mining industry, it also presents some challenges and opportunities. Challenges: Supply Chain Constraints: Meeting the soaring demand can strain supply chains. Manufacturing ASIC chips is complex and relies on global semiconductor supply chains, which can be vulnerable to disruptions. Competition: The profitability of Doge mining attracts competitors. As more manufacturers enter the market or existing players ramp up production, competition could intensify, potentially impacting profit margins in the long run. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Dogecoin prices can fluctuate dramatically, impacting the profitability of mining. A significant price drop could dampen enthusiasm and reduce demand for mining equipment. Environmental Concerns: Crypto mining, particularly using energy-intensive ASICs, raises environmental concerns about energy consumption. The industry is under increasing pressure to adopt more sustainable practices. Opportunities: Technological Innovation: The Doge mining boom can drive innovation in ASIC chip technology, leading to even more efficient and powerful mining hardware. Market Expansion: Increased interest in Doge mining can attract new participants to the crypto space, expanding the overall market. Revenue Diversification: For companies like Intchains, the surge in demand provides an opportunity to diversify revenue streams and solidify their position in the market. Increased Adoption of Dogecoin: A thriving mining ecosystem can contribute to the overall health and adoption of Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors What can we learn from Intchains’ explosive growth and the mining machine orders surge? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Market Trends: Pay close attention to market signals, including social media trends, celebrity endorsements, and technological advancements in mining hardware. These factors can significantly impact crypto prices and mining profitability.

Brace yourselves, crypto enthusiasts, because Whale Alert, the crypto transaction watchdog, has reported a massive USDT mint . A staggering 1,000 million USDT , yes, you read that right – one billion – has been freshly minted at the Tether Treasury. This monumental injection of Tether has sent ripples across the digital asset landscape, leaving many wondering: What does this mean for the volatile crypto market ? Let’s dive deep into this fascinating development and unpack the potential implications. Why a 1 Billion USDT Mint is Big News for the Crypto Market For those new to the crypto space, understanding what USDT and Tether are is crucial. Tether is the issuer of USDT , a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. In simple terms, one USDT is designed to be worth one US dollar. This stability makes USDT a cornerstone of the crypto market , acting as a bridge between traditional fiat currency and the often-turbulent world of cryptocurrencies. Think of it as the digital dollar within the crypto ecosystem. Now, when we see a billion-dollar USDT mint , it’s not just another day in crypto. It’s a significant event that can signal various market movements and strategies. Let’s break down why this is such a big deal: Increased Liquidity: A massive USDT mint injects substantial liquidity into the crypto market . This fresh capital can potentially fuel buying pressure across various cryptocurrencies, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to altcoins. Potential Market Uptrend: Historically, large USDT mints have sometimes preceded or coincided with bullish phases in the crypto market . Traders often interpret it as a sign that there’s anticipated demand for buying cryptocurrencies. Exchange Readiness: Cryptocurrency exchanges require USDT to facilitate trading pairs. Minting such a large amount could indicate that exchanges are preparing for increased trading volume and user activity. Institutional Interest: Significant USDT mints can also hint at growing institutional interest and investment in the crypto market . Institutions often use stablecoins like USDT to enter and exit crypto positions efficiently. Decoding the USDT Mint: Is it a Bullish Signal for Stablecoin and Crypto? So, is this billion-dollar USDT mint definitively a bullish signal? While it’s tempting to jump to conclusions and shout “bull run!”, the reality is more nuanced. Let’s explore both the potential positives and factors that warrant a cautious approach. Potential Benefits of a Large USDT Mint Market Expansion: The influx of USDT can act as rocket fuel for the crypto market . More capital available means more potential for growth, innovation, and wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): While it might seem counterintuitive, increased liquidity from stablecoin injections can sometimes reduce extreme volatility. A more liquid market can absorb larger trades without causing drastic price swings. Opportunities for Traders: For seasoned crypto traders, a large USDT mint can present exciting opportunities. It could signal the start of upward price movements, allowing for strategic entries into various crypto assets. Growth of the Stablecoin Ecosystem: The continued minting and adoption of USDT reinforces the importance of stablecoins within the crypto ecosystem. They are vital for trading, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), and remittances. Challenges and Considerations around USDT and Stablecoins Despite the potential upsides, it’s crucial to approach this USDT mint with a balanced perspective. There are challenges and considerations to keep in mind when dealing with Tether and stablecoins in general: Transparency Concerns: Tether has faced scrutiny in the past regarding the reserves backing USDT . While they have increased transparency in recent years, questions about the full backing of USDT have lingered. Regulatory Landscape: Stablecoins are under increasing regulatory attention globally. Future regulations could impact the operations of Tether and the broader stablecoin market. Market Manipulation Risks: Due to its significant market cap and influence, USDT and its minting activity are sometimes scrutinized for potential market manipulation. It’s important to be aware of these discussions, although no direct evidence of manipulation related to this specific mint is presented here. De-pegging Risks: Although designed to be stable, stablecoins can, in rare instances, de-peg from their intended value. While USDT has largely maintained its peg, the risk, however small, always exists. Examples of Past USDT Mints and Market Reactions To gain a better understanding of how the crypto market typically reacts to large USDT mints, let’s look at a few past examples. Analyzing historical data can offer insights, though past performance is never a guarantee of future results. Date of Mint Amount (USDT) Subsequent Market Reaction (Approx. within 1-2 weeks) Context/Market Sentiment at the Time Early 2021 Multiple large mints (billions) Significant Bull Run Growing institutional adoption, DeFi boom Mid 2022 Large mints amidst market downturn Market stabilization attempts, mixed reactions Bear market, liquidity concerns Late 2023 Moderate mints Gradual market recovery Signs of market bottoming, renewed optimism These examples show a correlation, but not necessarily direct causation, between USDT mints and crypto market movements. Market sentiment, broader economic factors, and other news events also play crucial roles. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Enthusiasts Do? So, what should you, as a crypto enthusiast, do with this information about the billion USDT mint ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on crypto market news and analysis. Follow reputable sources like Whale Alert and other crypto news outlets to stay updated on market developments. Monitor Market Sentiment: Gauge the overall market sentiment. Are analysts and traders generally bullish or bearish following this USDT mint ? Social media and crypto forums can provide sentiment indicators. Review Your Portfolio: Consider how this news might impact your existing crypto portfolio. Are you positioned to benefit from a potential market uptrend? Should you rebalance your holdings? Exercise Caution: While a large USDT mint can be exciting, always exercise caution. The crypto market is inherently volatile. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, and diversify your portfolio. DYOR (Do Your Own Research): Never rely solely on news headlines. Conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Understand the projects you are investing in and the broader market dynamics. Conclusion: A Billion USDT Mint – A Potential Catalyst or Just Noise? The minting of 1,000 million USDT is undoubtedly a noteworthy event in the crypto market . It’s a significant injection of liquidity that could potentially act as a catalyst for market growth. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is complex and influenced by numerous factors. While history suggests a possible bullish correlation, this USDT mint alone doesn’t guarantee a bull run. It’s essential to consider the broader market context, regulatory developments, and inherent risks associated with stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, this billion-dollar USDT mint serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the crypto market . Stay vigilant, stay informed, and navigate this exciting space with a blend of enthusiasm and prudence.

Could these memecoins be getting ready for a big climb? Concurrent with this is a newcomer known as Remittix (RTX) , upsetting the cross-border payments industry. Some believe it might be the next 1000x crypto story. Analyzing the most recent price movement of Dogecoin and PEPE, this article exposes significant support levels and professional projections. You will also discover why Remittix is becoming popular among investors since it presents a novel approach to transfer money internationally. Dogecoin's (DOGE) Wild Ride: A Bumpy But Hopeful Path Over the past week, the Dogecoin price has dropped sharply— over 27% . The fall did not follow any consistency. The Dogecoin price chart instead shows ups and downs before a major negative move. The price first stayed between $0.262 and $0.232. Then, a large breakout sent it down into the $0.180 zone. Over the past month, the meme coin lost more than 44% of its value. Still, the Dogecoin community hopes for a bullish reversal. Some observers believe this fall follows a more widespread pattern. Notable trader Trader Tardigrade notes that Dogecoin is acting historically. He counsels seeing the whole picture rather than emphasizing temporary declines. Meanwhile, technical indications produce conflicting signals. The trend-based indicator MACD points to a purchasing opportunity. However, the Momentum Oscillator tracks the rapidity of price fluctuations and shows selling pressure. PEPE at a Critical Level: A Make-or-Break Moment Over the previous week, the PEPE price has declined drastically and has now fallen over 24% . However, the fall wasn't consistent. The PEPE coin first consolidated between $0.0000102 and $0.0000089, according to the PEPE price chart. The PEPE price then dropped to $0.0000073 as a result of the bearish breakout. PEPE has dropped more than 40% of its value throughout the past month. The community is still hopeful, nonetheless, thinking a comeback is just around the corner. The support around the $0.0000073 zone strikes analysts as a crucial zone. Based on the current market structure, a massive rally could be ahead, claims Rose Premium Signals . Meanwhile, mixed signals from technical indicators also reflect on the PEPE price chart. Moving Averages—which track market trends over time—suggest selling pressure. Tracking price speed, the Momentum Oscillator also suggests weakness. Remittix (RTX) Is Transforming Cross-Border Payments For individuals looking for significant gains in the quickly expanding cross-border payments industry, Remittix is becoming the best crypto investment. It offers rapid, low-cost crypto-to-fiat conversions employing superior blockchain technology. Moreover, Remittix charges a flat 1% price with no hidden fees or delays, unlike conventional services like Stripe and Wise. Additionally, Remittix supports more than a hundred cryptocurrencies, therefore facilitating user conversion of digital assets into fiat. By its innovation, which removes the inefficiencies of past banking systems, Remittix is positioned as a leader in the $150 trillion global payments market. Among investors, Remittix is greatly sought after. After already raising more than $13 million, only a few months have seen sales of almost 510 million RTX tokens. At a current price of $0.0694, RTX offers early adopters an unmatched entrance point. As Remittix gets ready for listing on tier-1 centralized and decentralized exchanges, its market presence and liquidity will increase. By use of a BlockSAFU-certified smart contract, the platform assures security and openness. This makes RTX not only the best crypto investment but also a major player in the direction of digital finance going forward. Dogecoin, PEPE, or Remittix? The Smartest Move Right Now Though their near-term trajectories are yet uncertain, Dogecoin and PEPE may have great returns ahead. Remittix is stealthily positioned as the next great thing in the meantime. Unlike speculative memecoins, RTX is tackling a real-world problem—fast, cheap cross-border payments. With a nominal 1% charge, strong investor demand, and upcoming exchange listings, Remittixcould be the next 1000x crypto success story. Don't wait till RTX skyrockets. With almost 510 million tokens sold and over $13 million raised within a few months, early adoption is swiftly closing. Meanwhile, the presale is fast selling out, and the total RTX token supply is limited.

Though there are plenty of opportunities in the industry, where should you concentrate your efforts given so many choices? Despite the uncertainties of the current market, in this article, we look at the top altcoinsthat might be set for a significant rise. You will learn which initiatives are viable in the long term. From SUI's turbulent but exciting price action to Toncoin's possible comeback, Sonic's ecosystem development, Hedera's breakthrough possibility, and Remittix's game-changing financial solution, we dissect what makes these five cryptocurrencies unique and why you might wish to add them to your portfolio. SUI Faces Volatility but Holds Long-Term Potential Over 24% of the SUI price was lost last week. According to the SUI price chart, the altcoin first consolidated between $3.60 and $3.10 before declining. This bearish breakout drove the SUI coin to $2.50. SUI has dropped more than 28% of its value throughout the past month. Traders still have hope despite this decline, though. Based on a chart analysis, analyst PROFIT BLUE implied that SUI might rally above $40 in the long term following this downturn. Technical indications contradict one another. Moving averages show purchase suggestions when tracking trend changes over time. Though it measures price speed, the Momentum Oscillator nevertheless shows selling pressure. A similar weakness is indicated by the Commodity Channel Index (CCI). Though there is always some short-term volatility, analysts see SUI's long-term prospects as positive. Toncoin Faces Decline but Analysts See Bullish Potential Over the past week, the Toncoin price decreased by more than 11% . This fall has not been constant, though. Struggling to find direction, the Toncoin price chart reveals the altcoin to have been fluctuating between $3.87 and $3.12. Toncoin dropped nearly 33% of its value over the last month. Still, the Toncoin community remains positive. Some analysts think Toncoin offers great growth potential and may revisit its all-time high (ATH) of $8.24 later this year. Meanwhile, earlier in February, it was identified that 1.43 million TON tokens had moved from whale wallets. Ali Martinez commented that he was watching closely to see how this plays out. Technical indicators show current weakness. Tracking momentum shifts, the MACD indicates selling pressure. Additionally pointing to more downside is the Momentum Oscillator, which gauges price speed. Analogously, the Moving Averages—which help to smooth market trends—show a negative phase. Although the short-term Toncoin price chart displays uncertainty, experts still view Toncoin as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Sonic Dips, but Ecosystem Growth Stays Strong Though its ecosystem is still flourishing, the Sonic price dropped more than 29% last week. The Sonic price chart shows the altcoin trading between $0.93 and $0.77 before a bearish breakout occurred. Though there was a slight drop, the past month was positive; Sonic scored about 34%. The great success of projects created on Sonic mainnet piques developer curiosity. Miles Deutscher says this growing environment is creating a positive feedback cycle that attracts even more creativity. Technical signals point to the Sonic price perhaps rallying shortly. Tracking momentum changes, the MACD points to a purchasing opportunity. Additionally, leaning bullish is the Momentum Oscillator, which tracks price movement speed. Furthermore, supporting an increasing trend is the 50EMA. A bullish community sentiment still exists, and many believe Sonic to be among the best cryptos to buy now. Hedera Shows Strength After Long Accumulation For 620 days, the Hedera price has been rounding bottom at below $0.10. This protracted buildup points to a great possibility for a breakout. CryptoBullet finds from the Hedera price chart that the main resistance level is $0.20. Should it break, Hedera might aim for $0.44 in the mid-term; long-term estimates for an aggressive rally point to either $1.25 or perhaps $3.25. This arrangement makes Hedera among the best cryptos to buy now for those seeking long-term gains despite recent swings. Prices have moved temporarily and erratically. First falling from $0.233 to $0.177, the Hedera price then rebounded above $0.202. Still, revived selling pressure drove it down to $0.185. Technical signs show a turnaround even though Hedera lost more than 39% of its value throughout the past month. The MACD's and Moving Averages' purchase signals point to possible positive momentum soon to reappear. If Hedera breaks significant resistance levels, it will be a great choice for investors since a significant surge could follow.

Paul Prager, CEO of TeraWulf, believes 2024 was a good year for the company, saying their achievements helped to solidify its leadership role in digital infrastructure. He added that their firm is at the “convergence of Bitcoin mining and HPC hosting.” claiming they will continue to lead in the next generation of digital solutions. TeraWulf Bitcoin holdings have exceeded 1800 BTC TeraWulf’s increased revenue was mostly attributed to the rise in the amount of Bitcoin mined and overall BTC prices. Following the revenue rise, the company even cleared its long-held debt, paying off almost $140 million in 2024. Moreover, the firm’s on-GAAP adjusted EBITDA jumped from $31.9 million in 2023 to $60.4 million, and by the end of the year, it had cash and cash equivalents of $274.1 million and about 1801 BTC. CEO Prager expects the company to scale up its high-performance commute (HPC) capacity by 100-150MW annually, adding that they are targeting to execute roughly 72.5 MW of HPC hosting capacity by the year’s close. However, Bitcoin is showing no signs of a price recovery in February, with some predicting the token will close the month with a 21% dip. Some analysts have blamed the lack of positive catalysts for the price fall in the last few weeks, as well as the lack of technical support levels at $80,000 and $95,000. Bitcoin price correction could easily influence TeraWulf’s 2025 revenue earnings. CFO Patrick Fleury claims the company sold some of its equity Patrick Fleury, Chief Financial Officer, stated that they had about $500 million in oversubscribed convertible debt offering. He claimed the debt offering helped increase their liquidity and provide funds for their HPC hosting. Additionally, he said that the sale of their 25% equity interest in Nautilus, helped them get back $85 million which they reinvested in Lake Mariner’s HPC hosting capacity. Prager even added: We expanded our self-mining capacity to 9.7 EH/s, secured long-term data center lease agreements with a credit-worthy counterparty that are expected to generate significant recurring revenue, providing a stable foundation for long-term growth, and enhanced our financial flexibility through strategic asset monetization and capital raises.

Investors often focus on major players, but hidden gems like these can surprise the market. Delving into the specifics of DYDX, KAS, and GNO reveals why they might lead the pack in recovery. Discover which coins are set for growth this month. DYDX: Downward Price Movement Amid Key Support and Resistance Levels Past month and half-year performance show notable declines with a 32.43% drop over the last month and a 27.68% fall over six months. Price fluctuations between $0.80 and $1.54 and a steep weekly loss of 17.20% point to persistent bearish pressure. The data reflects a consistent downward drift, suggesting recent market sentiment has been far from buoyant. Current price action centers around a support level at $0.52 and a key resistance near $2.00, with a secondary hurdle at $2.74. Bears remain in command as indicators like the Awesome Oscillator, Momentum, and RSI hint at an oversold zone. Traders might consider light buying near support with careful stops while awaiting a decisive break above resistance. Kaspa Price Action: Recent Decline Highlights Bearish Trends Kaspa experienced a steep fall over the last month and six months, with price drops of around 37% and 54% respectively. The coin has shown a notable shift in movement characterized by a rapid decrease in momentum and persistent selling pressure. Strength indicators like a low RSI near 28.56 and negative oscillator readings reinforced the downward trend. Bearish forces have dominated, significantly dragging the coin’s value lower over time. Kaspa currently trades between approximately 0.1063 and 0.1543 dollars, with key support noted around 0.0827 dollars and resistance near 0.1787 dollars. Bears remain strong as the coin struggles to break above resistance. Traders may monitor the support level for potential bounce-back signals or a continuation of the downtrend within this range. Gnosis GNO Oversold State Hints Recovery Potential in Cryptomarket Gnosis saw a decline of nearly 30% over the past month, while its six-month performance slipped by about 5%. Weekly losses reached almost 21%, indicating significant short-term volatility compared to its steadier half-year trend. The price fluctuations have been sharp in recent weeks, showcasing unstable behavior amid broader market conditions. Current price levels range between approximately 184 and 272 dollars, with key support at 149 dollars and resistance at 325 dollars. The RSI sits at 27, indicating oversold conditions. Bears have recently dominated, but these oversold signals could attract bull interest. Traders might consider short-term plays near support and look for upward moves above resistance as potential reversal cues. Conclusion DYDX , KAS, and GNO show promise for an early recovery in March. Market trends and trading activity suggest potential growth for these coins. DYDX focuses on decentralized trading, KAS on privacy, and GNO on prediction markets. Each addresses unique needs in the crypto space. Close attention to these altcoins may reveal early recovery patterns. Market movements in March could favor these options.

The sudden price swings are nothing new in the meme coin space, where sentiment drives action, and the market can shift in an instant. While some tokens battle price drops, BTFD Coin is pulling in major investor interest with its explosive presale performance. With over $6.21 million raised, a 100% bonus code offer, and a 3650% ROI potential, it has emerged as one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week . Unlike typical meme tokens, BTFD offers a fully launched Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, 90% APY staking rewards, and an exclusive referral program, adding serious long-term value to its bullish momentum. BTFD Coin’s 3650% ROI Potential Draws Investors to Its Presale Meme coins come and go, but few pack the kind of long-term earning potential that BTFD Coin is delivering. Right now, investors who jump into Stage 14 of its presale at $0.00016 per token could be looking at major gains, considering that BTFD will list at $0.0006 and has a projected moon price of $0.006. That kind of jump translates into a staggering 3,650% ROI for early adopters. The latest presale figures prove that interest in BTFD Coin isn’t slowing down. With over 70 billion tokens sold and 11,100 holders already on board, demand is accelerating. A major presale milestone was hit when the team burned all unsold Stage 13 tokens, creating an even tighter supply, which could drive higher demand post-listing. To add fuel to the fire, BTFD Coin is currently offering a 100% bonus code (LAUNCH100), meaning every token purchase is doubled. That means an investor putting in $8,000 right now would receive 50 million BTFD tokens, and at the $0.006 moon price, that would be worth an eye-watering $300,000. With its Play-to-Earn game already live, users can earn additional tokens through in-game competitions while also taking advantage of 90% APY staking rewards. It’s no surprise that investors are calling BTFD Coin one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week as FOMO builds around its growth potential. How to Buy BTFD Coins? Getting into BTFD’s presale is simple. Investors set up a wallet using MetaMask or Trust Wallet, fund it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and purchase BTFD tokens directly on the presale page . By using the LAUNCH100 bonus code, buyers instantly double their tokens, making this one of the biggest meme coin opportunities of 2025. Toshi Battles 10.8% Price Drop Amid Market Fluctuations Toshi, a pet-themed meme coin built on Base, an Ethereum layer-two blockchain, has faced a 10.8% decline in the last 24 hours, reflecting broader market uncertainty. As a community-driven token, Toshi has built a strong following, but the current price action suggests profit-taking or lower demand in the short term. Despite the dip, Toshi’s connection to Coinbase’s layer-two ecosystem keeps it in the spotlight, with many believing that long-term scalability on Base could strengthen its use case. However, short-term investors are watching closely to see whether support levels hold or if further declines are ahead. MELANIA Slides 5.15% as Investors Look for Stability MELANIA, a meme coin inspired by digital collectibles representing engagement with symbolic artwork, has dropped 5.15% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.8363. While its non-political stance and community-driven approach have helped it attract an audience, the latest price action suggests market caution. Some investors see MELANIA’s dip as a natural correction, while others are waiting for signs of renewed buying interest. As with most meme coins, MELANIA’s future will likely be driven by community engagement and broader market trends. Final Words Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin has emerged as one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week, with its 3650% ROI potential, Play-to-Earn game, and high staking rewards. While Toshi battles a 10.8% drop and MELANIA sees a 5.15% decline, BTFD’s presale momentum continues to build, with over $6.21 million raised and a 100% bonus code doubling investor holdings. With a current presale price of $0.00016 and a listing target of $0.0006, early buyers could see a massive 275% gain on launch day alone. And if BTFD Coin reaches its $0.006 moon price, those same investors could be looking at a game-changing 3,650% return. BTFD or get left behind—the choice is yours. Join the BTFD Coin presale today . FAQs Why is BTFD Coin considered one of the best meme coin presales to buy this week?

The Singapore-based, Nasdaq-listed Bitdeer purchased 100 Bitcoin this week in two operations. It bought 50 BTC at $90,280 on Feb. 25, the same day its fourth-quarter 2024 financial report was released. On Feb. 27, it purchased another 50 BTC at $81,475 each, for a total outlay of $8,587,750. On Feb. 23, before the purchases, Bitdeer held 911 BTC. Bitdeer buys the dip, announces repurchase On Feb. 28, the company announced the completion of a $9 million share buyback program and the launch of a $20 million share repurchase program that will run through Feb. 28, 2026. The new round of repurchasing will be carried out gradually and funded with the company’s cash on hand. These actions come against the backdrop of two quarters of falling revenue. Bitdeer Technologies Group, which includes Bitdeer AI, showed healthy revenue growth in the first half of 2024. Total revenue reached $119.5 million in Q1, compared to $72.6 million in the same quarter of 2023. It also registered net income of $600,000, compared to a net loss of $9.5 million a year earlier. Q2 2024 brought in $99.2 million against $93.8 million in Q2 2023. It showed a net loss of $17.7 million, versus a net loss of $40.4 million in 2023. Halving and market trends hit Bitdeer hard The fourth Bitcoin halving in April 2024, when the reward for mining a block was reduced from 6.26 BTC to 3.125 BTC, rocked the gross profit margins of the entire mining industry. Bitdeer revenue fell to $62.0 million in Q3, down from $87.3 million the previous year. Q4 showed $69 million in revenue, down from $114.8 million in Q4 2023. Net loss skyrocketed from $5.0 million in Q4 2023 to $531.9 million. In a statement at the release of the Q3 report, Bitdeer chief business officer Matt Kong attributed the declining indicators to the halving, as well as the increased global hash rate, decreased hosting revenue and one-time research and one-time development costs. The last month has also seen a downturn in miners’ stock in line with broader stock and crypto market trends. Bitdeer was the loss leader among them, losing 55% of its value as the industry overall lost $13 billion. Bitdeer has gone into ASIC design The R&D outlay Kong referred to was connected with its SEAL02 chip development. The company announced a roadmap for designing application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) in June. Also in June, Bitdeer paid $140 million in stock for chip designed DesiweMiner and integrated its staff into Bitdeer’s ASIC design team. At that time, the first generation, SEAL01, had been released and was expected to go into mass production in the Q4 2024. SEAL02 was expected to be released in the Q3 2024, and SEAL03 in Q4 2024. SEAL04 should be released in in Q2 2025 for mass delivery in Q4 2025. At the time of writing, Bitdeer has 1,380,679 reservations for its SEAL A2 model and plans to begin shipping in March. Also this week, the company’s CEO Jihan Wu committed to the sale of up to 4 million ordinary shares between March and June 15, 2025 under a plan finalized in December. The company stressed that the plan complies with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Rule 10b5-1 on insider trading. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

As we watch that unfold, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could step up with a hybrid Layer-2 solution that could fix Bitcoin’s slow transactions and hefty fees. Let’s check out the deets. XRP Price Prediction: Can XRP Bounce Back and Surge to $10 as Analysts Urge Investors to “Buy the Dip”? XRP is currently priced at $2.44, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours, with a trading volume of $4.86 billion over the same period. The price has ranged between $2.34 and $2.49 during this period. The SEC’s closed-door meeting today could have a major impact on Ripple and XRP, with key topics including the agency’s ongoing appeal in the Ripple case and the possible approval of a Grayscale XRP-spot ETF. At the same time, whistleblower group Empower Oversight is pressuring the SEC to release information about potential conflicts of interest in its crypto-related decisions. Meanwhile, analysts have spotted a rare price pattern that sets XRP apart from Bitcoin (BTC). This movement means that XRP could be on the verge of a major rally. Crypto analyst ProjectSyndicate has projected a potential 40% surge in XRP’s price, identifying the recent dip as a “perfect entry” point for investors. Hugo , another analyst, believes XRP has confirmed a breakout and expects it to surge to at least $10 once the bull run resumes. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Brings The Hybrid Layer-2 Solution That Could Upgrade Bitcoin With Faster Transactions, Lower Fees, and Seamless DeFi Integration Bitcoin is one of the most secure and decentralized cryptocurrencies, but it has major drawbacks — slow transactions and high fees. This makes Bitcoin impractical for daily use, especially for small payments. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might solve these issues with a hybrid Layer-2 scaling solution that could make Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and more versatile. By offering block times of just 2 seconds on its own Layer-2 chain, PlutoChain could eliminate long wait times and allow Bitcoin to be used for quick payments, microtransactions, and global transfers. Beyond speed, PlutoChain is designed to lower fees and stabilize costs and could make Bitcoin more practical for businesses and individuals. Instead of just being a store of value, Bitcoin could finally function as a real payment network. PlutoChain also brings Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility and could open the door for DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and AI-powered blockchain applications. This would bridge the gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum, enabling features Bitcoin alone can’t support. Security remains a top priority. PlutoChain has passed multiple audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , alongside regular code reviews and stress tests. During the testnet phase, the platform has already processed over 43,200 transactions in a single day, which proves it can handle high volumes efficiently. Unlike Bitcoin’s miner-controlled governance, PlutoChain encourages the community to propose and vote on network changes, which makes it more transparent and adaptable. With these advancements, PlutoChain could help Bitcoin reach its full potential as a fast, efficient, and widely used digital currency. The Bottom Line With XRP at a critical moment, investors are watching closely as the SEC’s closed-door meeting unfolds. Many are seeing the current pullback as a chance to get in before a potential breakout and urging investors to “buy the dip”. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might gain attention with its Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin. With 2-second block times and full DeFi integration, PlutoChain could help turn Bitcoin into more than just a store of value.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse sees this as a sign the agency might be backing off its strict enforcement tactics. Beyond regulatory changes, StratoVM ($SVM) might be making a name for itself as a powerful new Bitcoin Layer-2. Unlike traditional scaling solutions, StratoVM is built to potentially bring smart contracts, meme coins, AI, and DeFi directly to Bitcoin—something BTC has struggled with for years. Here’s what you need to know about projects. Ripple CEO Reacts to SEC’s Surprise Decision – Can XRP Bounce Back? Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has weighed in on the SEC’s unexpected move to drop its case against Coinbase, calling it a sign that the agency is shifting away from its aggressive “regulation by enforcement” approach. Many in the XRP community see this as a turning point. If the SEC is backing off from targeting crypto firms, Ripple could be next. In addition, the SEC recently acknowledged a proposal for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) from the New York Stock Exchange and Grayscale. While this doesn’t mean immediate approval, it’s a major step toward institutional acceptance. Garlinghouse called it “inevitable,” despite the SEC’s past resistance. The review process could take months, but the possibility of an XRP ETF is optimistic for the community. Right now, XRP is trading at $2.17, down 2.4% in the last 24 hours. The price has seen a daily high of $2.36 and a low of $2.16. In his recent post on X, analyst Tylie E suggested that XRP has likely completed its correction phase and could see a slight dip before making a move toward the $10-$15 range. StratoVM ($SVM): The Bitcoin Layer 2 That Could Supercharge BTC DeFi in 2025 StratoVM ($SVM) is a rising Bitcoin Layer 2 solution that could bring smart contracts, meme coins, AI, and DeFi directly to the Bitcoin network. SVM is currently trading at $0.06365, but it has surged by 2,240% in just a month, according to CoinGecko. This rapid growth shows there’s strong demand and confidence in its potential to enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and utility. SVM 30-day chart, Source: CoinGecko With its mainnet launch coming soon, StratoVM has potential. CoreDAO, another Bitcoin Layer 2, holds a $990 million fully diluted valuation, while StratoVM sits at just $6.3 million. If its mainnet rollout is successful, it could help the protocol grow further. The broader Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) market is blowing up. DeFiLlama data shows that the total value locked (TVL) in BTCFi surged from $307 million in January 2024 to $6.6 billion by February 2025. StratoVM might be well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. Plus, its recent Uniswap listing adds further credibility. StratoVM’s network is expanding fast, with 50+ strategic partners and nearly 100,000 community members across X, Telegram, and Discord. Rumors of a CEX listing are also circulating, which could provide an additional boost. The testnet already shows promise by recording 113,312 wallets and 56,200+ daily transactions. Closing Words As XRP’s regulatory outlook improves with potential SEC policy shifts and ETF discussions, the market continues to push past old limitations. On the other hand, StratoVM ($SVM) might be a game-changer for Bitcoin. Its goal is to bring DeFi, smart contracts, and new blockchain applications directly to Bitcoin. The upcoming mainnet launch could be a turning point that makes StratoVM a key player in Bitcoin’s evolution. The information in this article does not represent financial or investment advice.

The analyst also raised the possibility of ADA reaching $10. Cardano Price To Reach New ATH Of $8.11 In a TradingView post, Master Ananda predicted that the Cardano price could rally to a new ATH of $8.11 as it records “massive growth” this year. The analyst affirmed that ADA is officially in bull market territory following the completion of the first wave of the initial bullish breakout. In line with this, he predicts a new wave that could send Cardano to this $8 price target. Related Reading: Cardano Price Bounces From Key Support Level, But There’s Still A Risk To Crash To $0.85 Master Ananda further explained that the initial bullish breakout peaked very early in December last year. The analyst noted that such a strong bullish wave will always lead to a correction, which explains why the Cardano price is witnessing a significant crash alongside the broader crypto market. The crypto analyst assured that the present correction doesn’t mean much for the market. He further remarked that this is just a period of rest while the players, traders and market participants consolidate all previous gains. Master Ananda added that the market needs to adapt to the previous massive phase of growth. Further Analysis Of ADA’s Bull Market Price Action Master Ananda noted that in a bullish market, a correction will always end in a higher low. According to him, the higher the low of the higher low, the stronger the chart or pair is considered. He gave an example of the ADA/USDT paid which launched the previous bullish wave from a baseline of $0.3000. Related Reading: Cardano Price Breaks Down From Ascending Channel, Here Are Two Ways It Could Go The correction higher-low ended at around $0.6000 for the Cardano price, which the analyst noted is 100% higher than the baseline price. Master Ananda remarked that this means that Cardano is super strong. He also revealed that the first peak ended around $1.35, which he claimed is “awesome.” Furthermore, the crypto analyst noted that from a low of $0.2756 in August 2024, this move adds up to a total growth of around 375%. However, he asserted that there will be more for the Cardano price this time around in this 2025 bull run. Alluding to his accompanying chart, Master Ananda highlighted $2, $4.84, $8.11 and even $10.5 as the new 2025 peak potential. Master Ananda stated that he is sharing this Cardano price action analysis now because he believes that ADA is witnessing the establishment of a short-term higher low. The first low happened in early February and now the second is happening. He asserted that the second higher low will launch the next bull market bullish wave. At the time of writing, the Cardano price is trading at around $0.59, down over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Despite this bullish prediction, Ethereum has recently been under bearish pressure, falling 15% in the last week alone. While ETH regains footing and prepares to climb, another altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is gaining traction. Analysts predict the new DeFi predict the new token is on the verge of a 3900% rally, far exceeding Ethereum’s 550% growth potential. The project is currently in phase 2 of its presale, priced at $0.015. It has raised over $1.8 million and attracted more than 3400 holders within just days. In the upcoming phase 3, the price of tokens will increase by 33.33% to $0.02, meaning buyers have a limited opportunity before the prices increase. Mutuum Finance could hit $2.28 from the launch price with the 38x prediction. Why Ethereum Could Hit $15,000 Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest crypto by market cap and is expected for a major rally during the 2025 bull run, with analysts predicting a rise to $15,000. The coin is currently trading at $2,296 where it is predicted to climb 550% supported by factors like, growing institutional adoption, Ethereum transitioning to a deflationary model through staking and the expansion of Layer 2 scaling. The altcoin’s dominant position in the DeFi market positions it for strong growth, not just in 2025 but in the years to come too. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Its Presale Success Mutuum Finance is currently in the second phase of its presale, giving investors an opportunity to buy MUTM tokens at $0.015. This is the cheapest available price, with gradual increase set to take place over 11 stages until a launch price of $0.06. This growth guarantees a 300% return for investors joining the presale today. And if analysts are right, MUTM could skyrocket past $2.28 the moment it is listed, making it one of the top cryptos in DeFi this cycle. So far, the presale has exceeded $1.8 million raised and, 3400 unique investors. Mutuum Finance’s Role in Revolutionizing Crypto Lending Mutuum Finance is making borrowing and lending simpler and smarter with a two-model system: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model allows investors to lock stablecoins like USDT in lending pools fueled by smart contracts and earn passive returns while borrowers borrow instant loans against crypto as collateral. Side by side, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network has no intermediaries at all and enables borrowers to set up their own interest rate, term of loans and dates of repayments for the entire decentralized process. With either one, Mutuum Finance is facilitating crypto lending in a better way, easier, more convenient, and less bureaucratic. Project’s Growth and Community Rewards Mutuum Finance project team is also worried about the sustainability of the project. Token presale prefers early investors because they can participate at a considerably lower price than the exchange listing price. The project also launched a $100,000 giveaway to reward 10 individuals $10,000 each. Members of the campaign can also increase their winning chances by inviting family and friends to the project. Mutuum Finance will be among the best performers during the upcoming bull run in the DeFi space. With its sophisticated DeFi technologies, sound tokenomics and growing investor base. Experts predict a powerhouse comeback for crypto’s second-largest asset, Ethereum, to grow by 550% to $15,000. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Provides a better chance of making a profit with its presale. Mutuum Finance has already achieved $1.8 million raised from more than 3400 investors in phase 2. Don’t miss the chance, invest now before phase 2 closes and 3 arrives with a 33.33% price increase.

Those keeping an eye on the market are taking note of its rapid progress. Among many blockchain projects competing for attention, BlockDAG stands out by offering something tangible. With an ongoing presale reaching $199.7 million, 18.6 billion coins sold, and an impressive 2,380% ROI, this project is not just aiming to ride the crypto wave—it’s creating a solid foundation for long-term growth. The moves it is making now could push it to the top tier of Layer 1 blockchains. Many Layer 1 projects struggle to differentiate themselves, but BlockDAG’s approach is comprehensive. Instead of using technical jargon to attract buyers, it has built a leadership team with industry experience, developed infrastructure for long-term expansion, and is on track for 10 centralized exchange (CEX) listings that could significantly impact its coin price. Key Industry Leaders Steering BlockDAG’s Growth A project’s success depends on the people shaping its direction, and BlockDAG has assembled a leadership team filled with experts from top firms. Nicolaas David van den Bergh has taken on the role of Chief Marketing Officer, bringing over 20 years of experience from DFY Studios. His task is to make sure BlockDAG stays in the spotlight, and with the current presale success, he has a strong foundation to build upon. Marcus Xavier, previously at Uber Academy, is developing BlockDAG Academy—a platform designed to simplify blockchain knowledge for developers, buyers, and businesses, making technology more accessible. On the technical front, Robert Radek steps in as Product Manager, focusing on developing solutions that institutions can easily adopt. With a background that includes handling nearly a billion dollars in DeFi transactions at CLSTG2A, Radek understands how to make blockchain technology practical for widespread use. Mining operations play a key role in BlockDAG’s ecosystem, and Joshua Sack is overseeing this sector. With 16,000 mining units sold and $6.5 million earned from hardware sales, the mining infrastructure is already substantial. Sack’s responsibility is to refine the efficiency of operations while addressing the growing demand for sustainable mining solutions. Running a large-scale operation isn’t just about technology—it requires a structured organization. Liza van den Berg’s experience in IT recruitment and startup operations ensures that BlockDAG’s expanding workforce stays well-managed, keeping up with the company’s ambitious objectives. Upcoming Exchange Listings Could Drive Market Growth The upcoming listings are a major turning point. With 10 exchanges preparing to list BlockDAG, the potential for price shifts increases significantly. In past instances, listing on top-tier exchanges has led to major price jumps, offering early buyers strong opportunities. Increased liquidity and easy access for a larger user base often drive demand, making these listings a crucial moment for BlockDAG. Currently, BlockDAG’s coin price is at $0.0248 in Batch 27, but once these listings go live, that number could become outdated quickly. Previous projects such as Solana and Avalanche saw substantial growth after getting listed on major platforms, and BlockDAG could follow a similar path. As visibility and liquidity rise, the possibility of price increases becomes more apparent. What Sets BlockDAG Apart in the Layer 1 Space? Competition among Layer 1 blockchains is intense. Ethereum dominates, Solana is known for its fast transactions, and Avalanche is recognized for its interoperability. BlockDAG, however, is taking a well-rounded approach. Instead of prioritizing a single feature, it is developing an ecosystem that integrates technology, education, infrastructure, and community expansion. Its blockchain architecture is designed for scalability while maintaining decentralization, tackling one of the biggest challenges in the industry. Unlike projects focused on short-term growth, BlockDAG’s leadership is working on long-term adoption strategies. Another key point is its practical applications. The mining infrastructure is already generating revenue, and its educational academy is set to onboard a new wave of users. BlockDAG is not just preparing for a successful launch—it is building the foundation for a sustainable blockchain ecosystem. Time is Running Out to Join Before Major Listings! The upcoming few months for BlockDAG are crucial. With the mainnet launch approaching, a growing community, and a marketing campaign supported by top hires, the window for entering before major exchange listings is closing fast. The crypto market moves at an incredible pace. Wealth is created and lost in short periods. BlockDAG’s combination of high-profile hires, a robust crypto presale , and upcoming exchange listings signals that it could be on the verge of something big. The only question is whether people will act now or look back later, realizing they missed out on an early opportunity. History has shown that Layer 1 projects with strong momentum don’t stay unnoticed for long.

With Solana grappling with a 15% weekly drop and Dogecoin facing a 20% slide, many are wondering where to find the best crypto to buy 2025. While these market giants navigate uncertain waters, Web3Bay is making a compelling case as a fresh and promising alternative. Web3Bay is more than just another crypto project—it’s blending decentralized finance (DeFi) with e-commerce, creating a financial ecosystem where 3BAY tokens drive real utility. As Solana and Dogecoin work to regain their footing, Web3Bay’s presale momentum and strategic roadmap could position it as a top pick for those seeking stability and growth in a volatile market. Why Web3Bay Could Be the Best Crypto to Buy 2025 Web3Bay is setting itself apart by integrating DeFi principles with decentralized e-commerce. Unlike typical platforms, Web3Bay empowers users to earn, stake, and trade 3BAY tokens, turning everyday transactions into financial opportunities. As Solana and Dogecoin wrestle with market volatility, Web3Bay offers a clear vision and practical utility through its upcoming DeFi features like lending, borrowing, and staking. The Web3Bay presale is off to a strong start, raising over $1.5 million so far. With 3BAY tokens currently priced at $0.00524 and a projected launch price of $0.1959, early participants have a real shot at notable returns. This presale isn’t just about early access—it’s about joining a project with a comprehensive roadmap that includes staking rewards, cross-chain support, and an NFT marketplace. As Solana struggles with a declining SOL price, Web3Bay is presenting a forward-thinking approach that aligns well with those seeking the best crypto to buy 2025. By combining DeFi with practical e-commerce solutions, Web3Bay is not only offering potential gains but also introducing real-world utility that could sustain its growth long after the presale buzz fades. SOL Price Faces Pressure as Market Dynamics Shift Solana’s SOL price has been under pressure recently, with a sharp 15% drop over the past week. The coin, now at $137.18, has experienced volatility, hitting intraday highs of $161.23 and lows of $134.04. This downturn is part of a broader market sell-off impacting many major assets. Adding to the challenge, Solana’s on-chain activity has decreased, with daily active addresses hitting a three-month low of 3.5 million. While these trends are concerning, Solana isn’t out of the game. BlackRock’s interest in a Solana ETF could offer a path to recovery, bringing institutional interest and market stability. However, issues like network saturation from memecoins could hold it back. As Solana strategizes its next move, Web3Bay is stepping into the spotlight, offering a fresh perspective in a crowded market. DOGE News: Market Sell-Off Hits Dogecoin Hard Dogecoin is also feeling the squeeze, with its price down to $0.204188—nearly 20% lower than last week. The DOGE news mirrors Solana’s struggles, as a broad market downturn has led to significant losses. Reduced whale transactions and lower active addresses indicate a cooling of Dogecoin’s recent momentum. However, Dogecoin is not without potential. The launch of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust could open new doors, offering more mainstream exposure to the coin. Additionally, emerging memecoin-focused ETFs might drive future interest. Yet, as Dogecoin works to maintain its relevance, Web3Bay’s innovative approach to DeFi could be the fresh opportunity that many are looking for. Key Takeaways The SOL price downturn and mixed DOGE news reflect the challenges even established cryptos face in today’s market. While Solana manages on-chain slowdowns and Dogecoin tackles reduced network activity, Web3Bay is offering a fresh perspective—one rooted in innovation and tangible use cases. Web3Bay’s strategic blend of DeFi and e-commerce, along with its ambitious roadmap, makes it a strong contender for the best crypto to buy 2025. With a presale price of $0.00524 and a potential launch price of $0.1959, the upside for early adopters is clear. As the market seeks stability, Web3Bay is stepping up with a new model—one that promises not just speculative gains but real, lasting value in the crypto space.

Some analysts even say this could push a massive rally, with its price skyrocketing to the $30 mark. Meanwhile, StratoVM (SVM) could gain attention in the BTCFi sphere with its new Layer-2 solution. CoinGecko reports a 1300% surge in the past week, showing strong demand even as the market remains in the red. Let’s check out the details! Ripple Price Prediction: Could Trump’s Support Send XRP to $30? Despite XRP facing major setbacks over the past weeks, traders are still watching for a big breakout. Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto points to a double-bottom (“W”) pattern, saying that if XRP holds above the neckline, it could push toward $30+. Meanwhile, Donald Trump just doubled down on Ripple, sharing two posts on Truth Social that highlight the company’s growth under his administration. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse called it the “Trump effect,” saying U.S. deals surged in late 2024 – more than in the previous six months combined. He also revealed that 75% of Ripple’s new hires are now based in the U.S., a huge shift from years of regulatory uncertainty that drove business overseas. With technicals aligning and political momentum building, XRP could be gearing up for the next big move. If buyers step in and the W breakout holds, Steph Is Crypto’s $30 target might not be far off. StratoVM (SVM) Could Grab a Major Share of BTCFi Market with New Layer-2 Solution StratoVM (SVM) is emerging as a Layer 2 blockchain built on Bitcoin that could enable smart contracts, meme coins, AI, and DeFi applications directly on the Bitcoin network. Currently trading at $0.06324, SVM has shown amazing growth with a 2553% increase from the previous week, according to CoinGecko data. This impressive surge might indicate its resilience amid market volatility, possibly powered by its idea to potentially solve Bitcoin’s scalability problems. The project is expected to launch its mainnet soon, which may represent a significant development milestone. When compared to other Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions like CoreDAO (around $990M Fully Diluted Valuation), StratoVM currently stands at a relatively modest valuation of nearly $6.3 million. A successful mainnet launch could potentially be bullish news for the project, and if implementation goes well, StratoVM might be undervalued at its current price point. According to DefiLlama , the total value locked in BTCFi protocols has dramatically increased from around $307 million in January 2024 to around $6.6 billion in February 2025. StratoVM could leverage this growth with its innovative approach. Furthermore, SVM’s listing on UniSwap might improve its credibility as a project worth watching in the weeks ahead. The StratoVM ecosystem appears to be developing with support from over 50 strategic partners, which could help drive innovation and growth. There are speculations about a possible upcoming centralized exchange (CEX) listing, which might provide additional bullish momentum. The community seems to be taking notice, with nearly 100,000 followers across StratoVM’s official X , Telegram , and Discord channels. While Bitcoin’s use could expand beyond being “digital gold,” StratoVM’s scalability and security features might position it to become a leader in the BTCFi field, possibly capturing a significant portion of this emerging market. With the mainnet launch just ahead of us and many new features being incorporated, SVM could secure a CEX listing after its official launch. The Verdict If XRP stays above its key resistance, Steph Is Crypto’s $30 price target might actually happen, especially with all the talk about Trump backing Ripple. With U.S. business picking up and regulators changing their tune, XRP is definitely worth keeping an eye on. Meanwhile, StratoVM (SVM) looks to be making serious moves in the BTCFi sphere with its Layer-2 solution. That 1300% jump last week shows that even in this choppy market, investors are still hungry for innovative blockchain projects.

As of today, March 1, 2025, ADA has gained 2% and is currently trading near $0.63, fluctuating within a tight range between $0.625 and $0.64. Cardano (ADA) Short-Term Price Analysis With modest upside momentum, ADA is still trading below its key level of $0.65. Over the past 24 hours, the price attempted to rally but failed to gain traction. According to expert technical analysis, ADA remains in a bearish zone, continuing to trade below the critical $0.65 level. Despite these factors, if the asset breaks out of its ongoing consolidation and closes four consecutive candles above $0.6425, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 5.50%, reaching the $0.67 level. Source: Trading View Additionally, if the asset fails to breach the upper boundary of consolidation and closes a daily candle below the $0.62 mark, ADA could see a 7% price drop to $0.58, with the potential for further decline. Bullish On-Chain Metrics Looking at the current market sentiment, it appears that bulls are returning to support the asset. Amid this, traders and investors have been engaging in bullish activity, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Over-Leveraged Levels Data from Coinglass reveals that ADA traders betting on long positions are over-leveraged at $0.618, holding $5.90 million worth of long positions. Meanwhile, $0.645 is another over-leveraged level, where traders betting on short positions have built $3.67 million worth of positions. Source: Coinglass When combining these on-chain metrics, it appears that a shift in market sentiment has begun. This notable participation on the bullish side could push ADA in an upward direction. $14.65 Million Worth of ADA Outflow Meanwhile, investors and long-term holders have been accumulating tokens during the same period, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $14.65 million worth of ADA tokens.

On-chain data suggests Ethereum ETFs influence on the market downtrend could intensify as fresh altcoin ETF approvals edge closer. Ethereum (ETH) Declines 33% in February 2025 Ethereum (ETH) experienced intense selling pressure throughout February, reflecting broader bearish sentiment in financial markets. While major altcoins like XRP and Solana gained momentum following progress in their respective ETF filings, ETH price has struggled to retain investor interest. Ethereum Price Forecast ETH price chart above highlights a significant downturn, with ETH losing over 22% this week alone. The price tumbled from $2,800 on Monday to close near $2,220 on Friday. Zooming out, Ethereum’s closing price of $2,220 represents a staggering 33% decline from its February 1 opening price of $3,200. Ethereum ETFs See $300M Outflows as Traders Rotate to LTC, SOL ETFs Ethereum ETFs have seen a relentless wave of outflows, with institutional investors pulling over $300 million in the past seven trading days. The selling spree, which began last week, has now extended into this week, marking a period of sustained capital flight from ETH-based funds. A detailed breakdown of the outflows according to Fairdside data shows that February 26 witnessed the largest single-day withdrawal at $94.3 million. The preceding days also recorded heavy selling: February 24: $78 million February 25: $50.1 million February 27: $71.2 million No ETF inflows were recorded throughout this week, making it the first week in 2025 where Ethereum ETFs saw only outflows. This trend suggests institutional investors are either reallocating capital or hedging against further downside risk in ETH. Ethereum (ETH) ETFs Flows Feb 2025 | Source: SosoValue The persistent selling pressure has aligned with Ethereum’s sharp price decline, with the asset falling 22% this week and extending its monthly losses to 33%. Market analysts attribute the downturn to a combination of macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting investor focus toward alternative crypto ETFs. Rival Layer-1 altcoin projects such as Litecoin and Solana have gained momentum. Bitwise has filed for an Aptos ETF , while CME Group is moving forward with Solana futures ETFs. With Polymarket odds suggesting a 90% chance of LTC ETF approval, capital rotation away from Ethereum appears to be accelerating. Unless ETH sees renewed institutional interest, continued ETF redemptions could reinforce its bearish trend in the coming weeks. Investors Eye Alcoin ETFs Amid Ethereum Uncertainty Ethereum’s ETF exodus coincided with increasing traction for alternative cryptocurrency ETFs. Recent SEC filings indicate a growing interest in Litecoin (LTC) and Solana (SOL) ETFs, driving speculation about near-term approvals. Key developments include: Bitwise’s Aptos ETF Filing : This filing intensified investor interest in newer blockchain projects. Polymarket Betting on Litecoin ETF Approval : Forecast markets currently price a 90% probability of an LTC ETF gaining SEC approval. CME Group’s Solana ETF Speculation : The derivatives giant’s move toward Solana futures suggests growing institutional interest in SOL-based ETFs. These developments hint at a potential reallocation of capital from Ethereum ETFs to emerging crypto ETFs, as traders seek higher growth opportunities. Ethereum price action remains under pressure amid heavy ETF redemptions and shifting investor interest toward alternative assets. While the final trading day of February saw a net ETF inflow, the prior weeks’ sell-off underscores the broader uncertainty surrounding Ethereum’s network and market positioning. With institutional traders pivoting toward Litecoin and Solana ETFs, Ethereum’s dominance in crypto ETF markets could face increased competition. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether ETH price can regain upward momentum or if capital rotation into alternative crypto ETFs will persist. Ethereum Price Forecast: Bulls Face Deeper Correction Risks if $2,200 Support Caves Ethereum price forecast charts suggests further downside risk as the market struggles to reclaim lost ground following a decisive breakdown. The chart shows ETH trading within the Donchian Channel’s lower band, signaling persistent selling pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 29.53, confirming oversold conditions, yet the lack of a strong rebound implies that bearish momentum remains dominant. Ethereum Price Forecast A bullish scenario requires ETH to defend the $2,200 level, where minor accumulation appears. If buyers step in, a move toward the midline of the Donchian Channel at $2,466.80 becomes possible, aligning with prior resistance. A bearish continuation would see ETH lose $2,200, exposing $2,076 as the next target. Failing to hold there could accelerate selling toward $2,000. The declining RSI below its signal line suggests weak buyer commitment. Until ETH decisively reclaims resistance, the trend remains bearish despite oversold conditions.

White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks and Bo Hines, the executive director of a working group on digital assets, will run the meeting, though Trump will speak at the summit, a late Friday press release said. ""Attendees will include prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto industry, as well as members of the President's Working Group on Digital Assets,"" the release said. The summit will come just about a month after Sacks, alongside congressional leaders, gave his first public remarks as Trump's crypto czar. ""We want to keep that innovation onshore in the U.S.,"" he said at the Feb. 4 press conference. ""Financial assets are destined to become digital, just like every analog industry has become digital, and we want that value creation to happen in the United States, rather than giving it away to other countries."" The White House did not name the summit's other attendees. Friday's announcement ends a busy week for the crypto industry. Earlier in the day, a federal judge signed off on the Securities and Exchange Commission's motion to withdraw its case against Coinbase. Joe Lubin, the CEO of Ethereum incubator ConsenSys, and Cameron Winklevoss, the co-founder of exchange Gemini, both said earlier in the week that the SEC informed their respective companies that it would shutter its investigations into those firms. The SEC also filed to pause its case against the Tron Foundation and founder Justin Sun.

The withdrawals came after a major announcement by CME Group regarding Solana futures trading. According to Lookonchain observations: The AHdUMw…qMnj wallet withdrew 54,544 SOL (approximately $7.46 million) from Binance two hours ago. The 7i6FUR…kp5J wallet withdrew 41,096 SOL (approximately $6.96 million) from Binance an hour ago. The whale activity appears to be a reaction to CME Group’s announcement that it plans to launch futures contracts on Solana on March 17, 2025. CME, a leading global derivatives market, plans to launch two types of Solana futures contracts: A standard contract representing 500 SOL. A micro-scale contract representing 25 SOLs. “We are responding to increasing client demand for a broader set of regulated products to manage cryptocurrency price risk,” said Giovanni Vicioso, Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products at CME. Related News: Chinese Company Can't Keep Up With Demand for Mining Devices in This Altcoin After Trump Wins Election If approved, the launch of Solana futures could pave the way for Solana-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Firms such as VanEck, 21Shares and Franklin Templeton have already filed for spot Solana ETFs with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the earliest filings set for June 2024. Industry experts suggest the SEC may want to observe several months of trading activity in a regulated Solana futures market before granting ETF approvals. The launch of CME’s futures contracts “significantly increases” the likelihood of ETF approval, said Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, noted that CME’s Solana futures will be cash-settled, which is seen as a positive factor for ETF applications. The futures will be based on the CME CF Solana USD Reference Rate, which is used as the reference for daily SOL/USD pricing and is calculated each day at 4:00 p.m. London time. *This is not investment advice.

There are digital currencies priced under a dollar that hold immense potential for growth. This article delves into five affordable cryptos that could be the key to substantial wealth, revealing opportunities that might just be waiting to explode in value. XYZ’s Rise to Glory: The Meme Coin Fighter Punching Through the Crypto Arena XYZVerse is the next heavyweight champion of meme coins. Crowned Best NEW Meme Project , it blends the electric energy of sports with meme culture, drawing in millions of fans who want to be part of something bigger. Every great story needs a hero. Not the biggest, not the strongest—just the one crazy enough to keep pushing forward. That’s XYZepe , the masked fighter, the die-hard believer, and the relentless holder of $XYZ . His mission is to bring XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap and carve XYZ into crypto history. In response, the CMC community is totally behind this future champ: 95% are super bullish on $XYZ. But greatness isn’t handed out—it’s earned in the ring. $XYZ has already passed through 10 out of 15 presale stages, and the thriving community helps it build momentum for a mindblowing take off. Undervalued at $0.0025, $XYZ is a bet worth making. By the end of presale, it’s set to soar to $0.1. The fight isn’t over, but the path to glory is clear. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who know this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the start of something legendary. XYZepe is fighting for glory. Are you ready to join the ring? LUNC: Terra Classic’s Journey to Stable Global Payments Terra is a blockchain platform aiming to make global payments fast and affordable. It uses stablecoins, digital currencies tied to traditional money like the U.S. dollar or South Korean won. This means their value stays steady, making them useful for everyday transactions. By blending the stability of regular money with the benefits of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Terra offers quick and secure payments without the usual price swings. In May 2022, Terra launched a new chain, and the original became Terra Classic. Its main token was renamed LUNA Classic (LUNC). This shift is similar to the split of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic in 2017. The change followed significant challenges with Terra’s stablecoin earlier that year. Now, LUNC continues to support stablecoins linked to various currencies, focusing on stable and efficient global transactions. In a market where many cryptocurrencies face high volatility, LUNC’s approach to combining fiat stability with blockchain technology offers a unique path. As the crypto landscape evolves, projects like LUNC highlight the potential for digital currencies to become a regular part of everyday finance. XLM Shines Bright: Stellar’s Role in Today’s Crypto Market Stellar Lumens (XLM) is a digital coin that’s changing the way people send money around the world. Since 2014, Stellar has helped move billions of dollars quickly and cheaply. It doesn’t favor any one country’s money. Instead, it lets people send any kind of money, whether it’s dollars, euros, or even other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Big companies have partnered with Stellar because it helps them make fast, low-cost payments. People can use Stellar apps to send money globally, and businesses can build their own apps on the network. Stellar stands out because it wants to work with existing financial systems, not replace them. This makes it different from many other cryptocurrencies. The Stellar Development Foundation supports the network, helping it grow and add new features like smart contracts and NFTs. In the current market, where some cryptocurrencies are struggling, Stellar’s focus on real-world applications makes it attractive. It’s building bridges between different kinds of money, which could be a big advantage. Compared to other coins that are just digital assets, Stellar offers practical tools for people and businesses. This could help it shine brighter in the crypto world. Kaspa: The Lightning-Fast Cryptocurrency Aiming to Change the Game Kaspa is a new cryptocurrency that’s turning heads. It’s built on proof-of-work, like Bitcoin, but with a clever twist. Instead of following a single chain of blocks, Kaspa lets multiple blocks exist together. This means it doesn’t waste any blocks created at the same time. As a result, Kaspa can produce blocks very quickly—currently one every second. The goal is to reach 10 blocks per second, and the dream is 100. This speed could make transactions much faster and smoother for users. Kaspa’s technology has the potential to shake up the crypto world. Its ability to handle many blocks at once without slowing down is impressive. It also includes features that make future improvements easier, such as support for additional layers on top of the main network. In a market where speed and efficiency matter, Kaspa stands out. Compared to other coins, its focus on rapid block production and quick confirmations could make it attractive to investors. With trends favoring scalable and efficient cryptocurrencies, Kaspa might be one to watch in the current market cycle. TRON (TRX): Empowering Creators in the Decentralized Internet TRON is a blockchain platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. It aims to give content creators full control over their work. Instead of relying on big companies like YouTube or Facebook, creators can connect directly with their audience. This means they earn more rewards without sharing profits with middlemen. TRX, the digital coin of TRON, started on the Ethereum network but moved to its own in 2018. TRON supports smart contracts and apps that run without a central authority. Developers can build diverse applications on it. Users can share content freely without worrying about fees. Compared to Ethereum, TRON offers faster and cheaper transactions. In today’s market, where there’s a push for decentralization, TRX stands out. Its focus on helping creators sets it apart from other coins. As people look for direct connections online, TRON could play a key role in the internet’s future. Conclusion LUNC, XLM, KAS, and TRX are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely combines sports and meme culture, aiming for significant growth as a community-driven ecosystem.

Toncoin & Hedera Price Shows Recovery,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-whales-pump-200k-into-web3bay-in-just-48-hours-toncoin-hedera-price-shows-recovery/,"Is smart money signaling a shift in the crypto market? Toncoin price has held steady despite a recent dip, with investors still holding 54% unrealized profit, as reported by Glassnode. Meanwhile, Hedera price has bounced back from a key support level, hinting at a possible breakout. As both coins respond to market changes, interest is growing in Web3Bay’s presale, which is catching the eye of large-scale investors. The whales are making decisive moves, not hesitating to act! Within just 48 hours, Web3Bay has seen over $200,000 in large-scale investments, demonstrating substantial confidence from major buyers. When deep-pocketed investors begin to accumulate, it often suggests they perceive opportunities that others might miss. With 3BAY still in its presale phase, it stands out as a top crypto pick for February, potentially before prices begin to rise further. Whales Drive Web3Bay Demand: Presale Crosses $1.5M! Crypto whales are moving fast, pouring over $200,000 into 3BAY coins within just 48 hours. Large-scale purchases often signal that whales see future growth. With Web3Bay still in presale, early buyers are locking in lower prices before potential gains. The project has already crossed $1.5 million, with more than 395 million coins sold, indicating strong demand. Each presale stage raises prices, motivating investors to secure their share before costs increase. Now in its fifth presale phase, Web3Bay offers 3BAY coins at $0.00524, with a projected launch price of $0.1959. The platform aims to create a decentralized e-commerce network that removes middlemen, reducing fees while offering transparency. Features include DAO governance, multi-currency support, and staking rewards, making it more than just a typical presale. As whale activity intensifies, the presale remains an entry point for potential gains. Recent buying trends suggest Web3Bay could be one of the top altcoins to buy now before prices climb further. Will you secure your position before the next stage begins? Toncoin Holds Steady Despite Recent Price Drop Even with a recent market dip, the Toncoin price remains above its Realized Price of $2.43, meaning most holders are still in profit. Glassnode data reveals that investors are holding 54% unrealized gains despite the pullback. Historically, the Realized Price has acted as a solid support level, often leading to buying activity during corrections. If this trend holds, further declines could be limited, encouraging more accumulation. Currently trading near $3.77, Toncoin has faced bearish pressure, but indicators suggest that selling momentum may be weakening. The MVRV ratio has fallen to 1.54, signaling a cooling phase that could lead to a recovery. Yet, recent spikes in Realized Loss indicate some traders who bought at higher levels have exited. Whether this marks the end of the correction or signals a buying opportunity remains uncertain. Hedera Price Rebounds: Will It Break Key Resistance? After dropping 28% in the past month, Hedera price is showing signs of recovery, bouncing off crucial support at $0.18. This movement aligns with a Broadening Wedge pattern, which often precedes breakouts. Recent gains have pushed Hedera to $0.2375, and if upward momentum continues, the next challenge is the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Clearing this level could confirm a shift toward bullish territory. Technical indicators are turning positive, with the MACD showing a bullish crossover, suggesting buying pressure is increasing. However, broader market trends will influence whether this rebound holds. If Bitcoin dominance continues to drop and altcoins gain strength, Hedera could see further upside. The next few trading sessions will be key to confirming whether this recovery has long-term potential. Wrapping Up! Toncoin remains above its Realized Price of $2.43, with investors holding 54% unrealized profit despite recent selling pressure. Sustained buying momentum could help stabilize prices around $3.77. Meanwhile, Hedera has rebounded from $0.18, with a potential breakout if it surpasses the 100-day SMA. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether this recovery continues. As market attention shifts, Web3Bay’s crypto presale stands out, with Whales investing over $200,000 in 48 hours. With the project still in presale, early buyers are positioning themselves before the next price increase. The question is—will you secure your share before the price climbs further?

Solana Has Plunged To The Realized Price Recently In a new post on X, CryptoVizArt.₿, senior analyst at the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, has discussed about the Realized Price of Solana. The “Realized Price” refers to an indicator that, in short, keeps track of the cost basis of the average investor or address on a given cryptocurrency network. Related Reading: Don’t Call Bitcoin Bottom Just Yet, CryptoQuant Head Says: Here’s Why When the value of this metric is under the spot price of the asset, it means the holders as a whole can be assumed to be in a state of profit. On the other hand, it being under the coin’s value suggests the overall market is carrying a net loss. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the trend in the Realized Price for Solana over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, Solana had been trading above its Realized Price during the last year or so, which means the cryptocurrency’s holders had been enjoying profits on average. In the last few days, however, the entire digital asset has been shocked by a crash, and SOL has been no exception. As a consequence of this plunge, the coin’s price has retraced to the Realized Price, implying the holders are now sitting around their break-even level. Historically, the Realized Price has been a critical level for not just Solana but cryptocurrencies in general. This is because of the fact that investors tend to react more strongly to movements that relate to their cost basis. During bullish trends, the level can act as support for the asset’s price, as investors are keen on buying ‘dips.’ If the level is lost, however, it signals that the holders are no longer accumulating at their break-even. From the chart, it’s apparent that the last time this type of breakdown took place was in 2022. Back then, Solana fought to stay above the level for around five months before the bulls finally gave out and the coin slipped under it, kicking off the bear market. It wasn’t until the last quarter of 2023 that optimism around the token returned, and the price was able to recover above the line.

Polkadot & Mantra Price Trends Show Rally,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-whales-pour-over-200k-into-web3bay-polkadot-mantra-price-trends-show-rally/,"Is Polkadot (DOT) on the verge of a breakout, or will it encounter resistance? Currently, DOT is at a pivotal point, with $5.50 serving as a critical resistance level. If it surpasses this threshold, we could see prices ranging from $7 to $8. However, failing to break through could send it tumbling to $3.60. Meanwhile, MANTRA crypto has seen a remarkable 35% increase within 24 hours, soaring past $7 with robust trading volume supporting its ascent. With top cryptocurrencies rapidly shifting, the pressing question is—where will the next significant opportunity emerge? Whales are making a big splash in Web3Bay’s crypto presale , investing over $200K in just two days, eager to secure positions before prices rise in the next phase. As the presale progresses and prices increase, early investors are swiftly locking in their stakes. The opportunity is here—will you seize it? Web3Bay Presale Gains Speed as Whales Secure Positions— 2000K+ Raised in 24! Whales are actively securing their stakes in Web3Bay, with over $200K invested in just two days—a clear sign of their strong belief in the project’s potential. With each presale phase leading to a price hike, early investors are locking in their tokens now to capitalize before costs escalate. Currently priced at $0.00524, the tokens are set to launch at $0.1959, presenting a substantial upside for early participants. Web3Bay’s presale has already surpassed $1.5 million with over 395 million tokens sold, drawing those aiming to make the next big move in top crypto assets. As demand mounts, the cost of waiting could mean paying a significant premium later. This rush isn’t merely about securing a favorable price; it’s about getting in before the real wave of FOMO begins. The platform itself is turning heads with its decentralized e-commerce model , which eliminates intermediaries, reducing costs and enhancing security. Backed by strong fundamentals, Web3Bay is poised to become a key player in blockchain-powered commerce. As investment continues to flow, the pressing question remains: will you buy now, or face higher prices in the next stage? Polkadot (DOT) Approaches Key Resistance: Will It Break Through? Polkadot (DOT) is at a critical level, with traders eyeing the $5.50 resistance. A breakout above this point could drive DOT toward $7-$8, especially if buying volume increases. However, if prices fail to hold above this level, DOT might slide back to $4.00-$3.60, with a drop below $3.60 signaling deeper losses. Although DOT is still in a downtrend, breaking above its descending resistance could turn the outlook positive. Volume remains low, meaning DOT needs stronger buying pressure to sustain its bullish momentum. If that happens, prices could push toward $10-$12. On the flip side, failing to break resistance could increase selling pressure. Traders are watching the $5.00-$5.50 range closely—whichever side breaks first will set the tone for DOT’s next move. Mantra (OM) Rally Continues After 35% Price Surge OM price soared 35% within 24 hours, climbing above $7 and reaching a new all-time high. This rally pushed Mantra’s market cap to $7.3 billion, surpassing several Real-World Asset (RWA) competitors. Trading volume jumped 455% to $851 million, showing strong market interest, with many expecting further gains. The ADX indicator rose to 24.8, signaling that the uptrend is still strong and may continue. Technical indicators support the rally, with OM trading above the Ichimoku Cloud. The next key target is $8, with a move above $7.3 confirming the trend. However, if momentum slows, $6.48 is the main support level, followed by $5.26 and $4.37 if a pullback occurs. Wrapping Up! Polkadot (DOT) is on the verge of a breakout, but it must surpass $5.50 to confirm bullish momentum. If buying volume increases, prices could climb to $7-$8, while a failure could lead to a drop toward $4.00-$3.60. Meanwhile, OM price jumped 35%, reaching a high above $7, with traders eyeing $8 as the next target. Holding $6.48 is key to avoiding a deeper pullback. With major moves among top crypto assets, Web3Bay’s presale is drawing attention fast. Over $200K was secured in just two days as buyers locked in before prices rise. With 3BAY tokens priced at $0.00524 and a projected launch price of $0.1959, early buyers could see strong gains.

Solana’s SOL: Speeding Ahead in the World of Blockchain Among the numerous projects in the blockchain space, Solana is making a name for itself. Unlike its competitors, Solana offers the perfect mix of speed and scalability, ensuring that you never have to sacrifice one for the other.

At the heart of the Solana ecosystem is SOL, the native cryptocurrency that powers everything from lightning-fast transactions to program execution and rewarding dedicated network supporters.

The summit will feature prominent CEOs, investors, and key members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, including David Sacks and Bo Hines. This event marks a major milestone in the United States’ pro-crypto government stance. With regulatory agencies like the SEC now supporting the digital asset space, this summit is seen as a major step towards formalizing the government’s relationship with the cryptocurrency industry. Industry experts view this as incredibly bullish news for the crypto market. As more regulatory bodies show their support, the momentum for cryptocurrencies continues to grow. The summit will provide an opportunity for crypto industry leaders to engage directly with government officials, further solidifying the industry’s position. “The White House announced today that President Trump will host and deliver remarks at the first ever White House Crypto Summit on Friday, March 7. Attendees will include prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto industry, as well as members of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. The Summit will be chaired by the White House A.l. & Crypto Czar David Sacks, and administered by the Working Group’s Executive Director Bo Hines,” the statement read. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1895652998774456737 In addition to the summit, there is also news of the Trump Organization filing a trademark for the launch of a Metaverse and NFT trading platform. This move reflects Trump’s recognition of the potential of NFTs and the Metaverse, signaling a new era for digital assets. While NFTs gained popularity during the last market cycle, their use cases are expected to extend far beyond artwork. Experts predict that NFT technology will eventually revolutionize sectors like real estate, contracts, and even government identification, driving widespread adoption.

While artificial intelligence-driven tokens have dominated the headlines, real utility is where the future of blockchain lies. Story (IP) recently surged to $7.33 before cooling off, showing the power of AI-driven intellectual property. Meanwhile, SEI has cemented itself as a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, fine-tuned for DeFi trading, offering speed and efficiency unmatched in the market. But nothing is making waves quite like Qubetics . Unlike many blockchain projects that promise innovation but lack real-world application, Qubetics is delivering a game-changing decentralized VPN, revolutionizing online privacy and security. As digital finance evolves, these three projects are proving why they are the top crypto coins to buy now. Qubetics ($TICS): Decentralized VPN & Secure Transactions Privacy concerns are at an all-time high, and centralized VPN services are riddled with trust issues. Enter Qubetics—a decentralized VPN built on blockchain, ensuring absolute privacy and security without reliance on centralized servers. Qubetics’ decentralized VPN isn’t just another privacy solution. It ensures user anonymity by eliminating central points of failure, protecting professionals, businesses, and individuals from cyber threats. Imagine a journalist in a politically restrictive country, a business executive safeguarding sensitive data, or an everyday internet user tired of invasive tracking—Qubetics provides real, blockchain-backed protection. Right now, the crypto presale is in full swing, with $TICS tokens available at $0.0888. Over 21,600 buyers have already seized the opportunity, and analysts predict an ROI explosion. With projections soaring post-mainnet launch, the window to secure $TICS at a bargain price is closing fast. Story (IP): AI-Powered Intellectual Property on Blockchain Story Protocol is revolutionizing how intellectual property is managed. As an AI-powered blockchain project, it enables creators to tokenize and protect their work, ensuring rightful ownership and fair monetization. Since its February 13 launch, Story’s utility token, IP, has surged 115%, peaking at $7.33 before retracing. Social dominance initially spiked above 1%, reflecting massive market interest, though it has since dropped. With AI transforming multiple industries, Story is positioning itself as a leader in securing digital rights in a decentralized manner. IP’s retracement to $6.17 has traders on edge, with indicators like MACD and Bull Bear Power pointing to bearish momentum. If bulls defend the $5.64 support, a rebound to $8 could be imminent, making Story one of the most-watched crypto projects today. SEI: High-Performance DeFi Trading Blockchain SEI is a powerhouse for traders. This Layer 1 blockchain was built for speed, efficiency, and seamless DeFi trading, tackling high transaction costs and network congestion head-on. Latency and inefficiencies have long plagued decentralized trading platforms. SEI solves these problems with lightning-fast transactions and deep liquidity, making it the go-to platform for high-frequency traders and institutional players. Unlike most blockchains, SEI enhances cross-chain trading by providing seamless liquidity pools across different networks. This interoperability is crucial for traders seeking efficiency and cost savings, positioning SEI as a top choice in the DeFi sector. Conclusion The best crypto projects don’t just follow trends—they set them. Qubetics, with its decentralized VPN, is reshaping online security. Story Protocol is protecting intellectual property like never before, and SEI is driving efficiency in DeFi trading. These three powerhouses are the top crypto coins to buy now , each offering groundbreaking solutions in their respective fields.

The surge in Pi’s price has outpaced Bitcoin and other altcoins, generating excitement within the community. At the time of writing, Pi price is down by more than two percent and is trading at $2.32. There are speculations that Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, is set to list Pi Network, and this has caused a surge in market sentiment. Binance recently conducted a community poll on Twitter, asking users if Pi Network should be listed on the platform. With an overwhelming 86% voting in favor, investors and supporters are awaiting that Pi Network will soon be available for trading on Binance. This alleged listing is expected to send Pi’s price soaring, with many speculating that it could double or even triple following the listing, as coins listed on Binance tend to experience massive price gains due to the platform’s market power. Crypto influencers are already predicting that Pi could reach $10 shortly after its Binance listing. Despite a bearish overall market, Pi has already approached $3, and experts believe it could hit $5 by the end of April. Another factor contributing to Pi’s price surge is the ongoing public dispute between ByBit’s CEO and Pi Network’s founder, Nicholas K. This controversy has sparked increased attention, which in turn is positively impacting Pi’s market trajectory. With the Binance listing rumours and the ongoing market interest, Pi Network’s future looks promising. Traders and investors are eagerly awaiting the official announcement and the potential price explosion that could follow.

PS: I'll be in San Francisco next week for the American Banker Payment Forum. Say hello. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. New era The narrative The crypto industry racked up a number of early wins in the first month (and week) of Donald Trump's second term as U.S. president. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced it would drop or close half a dozen open investigations and ongoing cases, and asked courts to pause two more. Why it matters The crypto industry clearly won big during the 2024 election, and it's only just beginning to see what that means. Questions of how it actually should or shouldn't be regulated are now up in the air. Breaking it down Over the last week and change, the SEC filed to withdraw its case against crypto exchange Coinbase, pause its cases against Binance and Tron and informed ConsenSys, OpenSea, Robinhood, Uniswap and Gemini it would close its cases or investigations into those platforms. These announcements come on the heels of SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce announcing she would head up a new crypto task force at the regulatory agency and publishing a number of open questions to the general public about how securities law might apply to different types of cryptocurrencies and defining how the SEC would oversee this industry. The SEC also withdrew staff accounting bulletin 121, an accounting standard much of the industry hated. While there are a number of investigations or cases still outstanding, it's clear the SEC has taken a sharply diverging tack under Acting Chair Mark Uyeda from when former Chair Gary Gensler helmed the agency. Commissioner Hester Peirce said the SEC was now working to develop more policy that would guide the Division of Enforcement's future actions, rather than have these enforcement actions ""write regulatory policy."" ""We're really trying to get back to using our enforcement division for its intended purpose, and letting the regulatory divisions do the hard work of figuring out how to craft rules, guidance [and] interpretations,"" she told CoinDesk in an interview. ""And then enforcement has a role after that, of course, to enforce the rules that are on the books. But this has just been an area where we've kind of gone about it backwards, and we're trying to right the ship here."" The industry has been taking a victory lap with the withdrawals and dropped cases (and to be clear, it's not just the SEC withdrawing enforcement actions and investigations). Amanda Tuminelli, the chief legal officer at DeFi Education Fund, a decentralized finance-focused lobbying group, said any groups in the crypto sector should be more confident they would not be sued ""for a mere registration violation."" ""I don't think that we've won. I won't think that we have won until there are clear final rules on the books that make it clear, that are durable wins that make it clear that the industry is going to be able to innovate and exist for years in the future,"" she said in an interview. On the other side of this argument, the SEC — and Congress — are ""actively welcoming"" chaos from the crypto sector to the broader financial system, said Corey Frayer, the director of Investor Protection for the Consumer Federation of America and a former SEC senior adviser to Gensler. ""The SEC is not just abandoning enforcement actions, it's actively building an unregulated market for crypto assets,"" he said in an interview. This could create risk for contagion, he said, referencing FTX and Silicon Valley Bank's collapses. FTX had an issue with leverage (and the various FTX-affiliated tokens, which were used as collateral but lost their value following the exchange's collapse). ""As we’ve learned from prior financial crises, ramping up leverage risks that any single bad bet or any significant move in the value of one asset or intermediary will crash the entire crypto sector,"" Frayer said. Congress's efforts may take some time. Earlier this week, lawmakers with the Senate Banking Committee's new digital assets subcommittee convened its first hearing focused on future legislation. Lewis Cohen, an attorney who's long been active in the crypto sector and a witness at the hearing, said developers had ""raced ahead of the legal and policy frameworks designed decades ago."" ""Perhaps most critically, this uncertain regulatory environment has left consumers and users of digital assets at risk,"" he said. ""A clear, practical and flexible federal statutory regime is urgently needed to address activity involving digital assets in both the primary and the secondary markets."" Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Timothy Massad suggested Congress should focus on stablecoins and hold off on any kind of market structure legislation, at least until his former agency and the SEC have had a chance to work on rulemakings and guidance first. Tuminelli said she was worried that some builders might take these recent signs to mean ""it's just open season,"" even though she expects law enforcement agencies to continue cracking down on outright criminal activity. Other recent incidents, like Bybit's $1.5 billion hack, are also poor signs for the industry. ""We have things like Bybit to worry about, and we do have to worry about national security concerns and things like that,"" she said. ""So there are still going to be compliance issues that people need to pay attention to, even as there is a much greater runway in front of us.""

I'm told it's unlikely his account is compromised though. ETF bonanza Outside of enforcement actions, the crypto industry is looking to the SEC for another purpose: Approving a broad swath of new exchange-traded products backed by, or tracking the prices of digital assets that weren't under significant discussion a year ago.

The integration of AI (artificial intelligence) into blockchain technology is not just a trend or a narrative. It’s now a paradigm shift that is reshaping the crypto industry in profound ways. The rise and unexpected fall of AI agents in crypto Autonomous AI agents have become indispensable in the cryptocurrency world. They can process massive amounts of data, execute trades and make quick decisions. These sophisticated software systems are designed to perform specific tasks within the blockchain ecosystem without direct human oversight. By early 2025, the market capitalization of AI agent tokens will reach $14 billion, indicating rapid expansion. This growth is driven by the increasing integration of AI-powered solutions in the crypto space, including trading strategies and DeFi (decentralized finance) applications. Meanwhile, the integration of AI into the cryptocurrency landscape has taken an unexpected turn in 2025. While initial projections were optimistic, at the time of writing, recent data from Delphi Digital paints a different picture. AI frameworks and platforms have experienced the steepest decline, with an average drop of 84%. This sharp decline has caught many investors off guard, especially given the high expectations for AI-driven projects in the crypto space. Agent-based projects, which were touted as the next big thing in crypto innovation, didn’t fare much better. These projects have seen an average decrease of 73% year-over-year, a significant drop that raises questions about the long-term viability and adoption of AI agents in the crypto ecosystem. AI agents – B eyond simple bots However, it’s important to understand that AI agents are not just advanced versions of traditional trading bots. While bots operate according to predefined rules, AI agents can adapt to new information and change course based on market conditions. This flexibility allows them to do the following. Analyze blockchain data, social media trends and market patterns Identify investment opportunities Execute trades and manage portfolios autonomously The integration of AI into cryptocurrency has far-reaching implications. Advanced trading strategies AI agents can analyze real-time market data to identify trends, predict cryptocurrency price movements and optimize trading strategies – a capability that is particularly valuable in the volatile crypto markets , where quick decisions can make all the difference. Enhanced security AI-powered systems are being used to monitor blockchain transactions, detect irregularities and prevent fraud. As cases of cryptocurrency fraud have skyrocketed and scams such as phishing and scam schemes have become more sophisticated, the importance of AI-driven security solutions cannot be overstated. Democratizing advanced trading tools No-code platforms enable individuals without technical expertise to build complex AI tools, democratizing innovation in the crypto space. This accessibility is likely to drive broader adoption and foster a more connected ecosystem. The future of AI in crypto Looking ahead, we can expect to see the following. Exponential growth – Projections suggest that the number of AI agents could reach one million by the end of 2025, indicating widespread adoption across multiple platforms. Diversification – AI agents are expanding beyond DeFi into various sectors, including social media influence, financial analysis and interactive applications. AI-themed tokens – The convergence of AI and meme culture has given rise to AI-themed meme coins, adding a new dimension to the crypto market. Integration with traditional exchanges – Major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, Kraken and MEXC are integrating AI solutions to improve security, risk assessment and the trading experience for their users. While the potential for AI in crypto is immense, we must also be mindful of the challenges. Regulatory concerns – As AI-driven systems become more autonomous, questions of accountability and regulatory oversight become more pressing. Market manipulation – The power of AI could potentially be used to manipulate markets, raising concerns about fairness and transparency. Data privacy – As AI agents process vast amounts of data, ensuring the privacy and security of user information becomes paramount. In conclusion, I see the integration of AI into the cryptocurrency landscape as both an opportunity and a challenge. As industry leaders, it’s our responsibility to harness the power of AI to create more efficient, secure and accessible crypto markets, while also addressing the potential risks and ethical considerations. The future of crypto is undoubtedly intertwined with AI, and those who can successfully navigate this convergence will be well positioned to lead in the evolving digital economy.

USDT has established itself as the primary asset for value transfers and trading. In fact, CryptoQuant’s latest analysis revealed the overwhelming dominance of USDT on the Tron network, which accounts for 98.5% of the total stablecoin supply. USDT’s Market Share on Tron With a circulating supply of $62.76 billion out of nearly $64 billion in stablecoins on the network, USDT has established itself as the cornerstone of Tron’s stablecoin ecosystem. Competing stablecoins hold only marginal shares, with USDC representing 0.06%, USDD at 1.15%, TUSD at 0.26%, and USDJ making up just 0.01% of the supply, as per the on-chain analytic platform’s findings . Notably, the supply of other stablecoins has remained stagnant since March 2024. The same cannot be said for USDT which continued to expand while solidifying its market dominance. Beyond supply, USDT also plays a crucial role in Tron’s liquidity. Its daily on-chain volume from centralized exchanges ranges between $4 billion and $5 billion, spiking during periods of high TRX price volatility. This indicates that USDT not only dominates the network’s stablecoin supply but also serves as a critical pillar for trading activity and value transfers across the Tron blockchain. Data from IntoTheBlock further revealed that the Tron network currently processes over 14 million USDT transactions per week, which represents 69% of all USDT activity. This figure is a notable increase from 61% in late January. Zero-Fee USDT Transactions on Tron Tether’s USDT stablecoin is set to introduce commission-free transactions on the Tron blockchain, according to Tron founder Justin Sun’s recent post on X. The Gas Free feature will allow USDT transfers without requiring TRX tokens for gas fees, making transactions more accessible. Sun invited wallets and projects to integrate the feature through JustLend, which happens to be Tron’s official lending platform. Tron has been known for its low-cost USDT transfers compared to Ethereum, but recent data shows it has become one of the most expensive networks for USDT, with gas fees ranging between $3.06 and $6.22 – significantly higher than Ethereum’s $0.14 fees. As such, the new Gas Free feature aims to restore Tron’s position as a cost-effective stablecoin network by eliminating the need for users to hold TRX for transactions.

Back in 2013, no one took it seriously—until it skyrocketed. Early buyers who snagged DOGE for mere fractions of a cent are now sitting on millions. Missed that train? Don’t worry, because Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is offering a golden opportunity for those who regret not investing in Dogecoin’s early days. Dogecoin’s Early Days – The Ultimate Missed ICO Dogecoin was launched in December 2013 at an initial price of around $0.00026. At the time, it was considered nothing more than a fun meme coin. Fast forward to 2021, and DOGE soared past $0.70, delivering mind-blowing gains. Investors who put in just $100 in Dogecoin’s early days walked away with over $250,000 at its peak. The lesson? The best investments often look like jokes at first. Dogecoin proved that meme coins can explode, and now Arctic Pablo Coin is set to follow that path. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Big Meme Coin with Massive ROI Potential Arctic Pablo Coin is rewriting the rules of meme coin presales.

Not only that, but Arctic Pablo Coin also has a powerful token burn mechanism that permanently removes unsold tokens every week during the presale. This scarcity-boosting feature increases the coin’s value over time, just like what happened with DOGE when supply became a concern. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Staking & Rewards System – Passive Income for Holders Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just about price appreciation; it also offers an APY of 66% during the presale. This means investors can stake their tokens and earn even more, making it one of the top new meme coins for exponential returns . On top of that, the project features referral incentives and community competitions, ensuring early adopters get the most out of their investments. Time is Running Out – Get in Before the Next Price Jump Dogecoin’s early investors had years to accumulate. Arctic Pablo’s meme coin presale , however, is moving at lightning speed. It has already raised over $1.64 million, and as it moves to the next location, the price will only go up. If you want to lock in at $0.000067, now’s your moment. Once it hits exchanges at $0.008, the window for life-changing gains will have closed. Final Thoughts – Arctic Pablo Coin is the Next Meme Coin to Watch Dogecoin proved that meme coins can make millionaires. Arctic Pablo Coin is taking that legacy and adding higher rewards, staking, a strategic burn mechanism, and a thrilling presale journey. If you regret missing DOGE at $0.00026, this is your second chance. Get in before Arctic Pablo Coin leaves Penguinopolis and the price shoots up!

What The UTXO Data Is Telling Us,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-finding-a-bottom-what-the-utxo-data-is-telling-us/,"Bitcoin’s price recently experienced another significant downturn, falling below $80,000 earlier today—a nearly 20% decrease in just the past week. This prolonged slump highlights the broader challenges facing the market, with minimal signs of recovery in sight. Amid this turbulent price activity, insights from tugbachain, a contributor to the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, have shed light on an intriguing trend within the Bitcoin market: the shifting patterns of UTXO Realized Price Age Distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s 60-Day CDD Spikes: A Warning Sign or Buying Opportunity? UTXO Realized Price Age Distribution: Uncovering Key Support Levels The UTXO Realized Price Age Distribution metric provides a detailed look at realized prices across various age bands, effectively illustrating the holding patterns of different investor groups. By calculating the realized price—derived by dividing the Realized Cap by the total Bitcoin supply—this metric offers a snapshot of how both long-term holders and newer market entrants are behaving under current market conditions. Historically, certain realized price levels have functioned as key support zones during market corrections. In particular, the realized price levels for 1-month and 3-month periods often hold significance in bull markets. These levels are where fear-driven selling from smaller investors tends to peak, potentially creating an environment for larger players to stabilize the market. However, as tugbachain highlighted, these 1-3 month realized price levels have now fallen below their typical support thresholds. The next potential support area lies in the 3-month to 6-month range, approximately around $75,875. This shift signals that the market may still be searching for a solid foundation before any meaningful recovery can begin. Bitcoin: Analyzing the Bigger Picture In a separate analysis, tugbachain delves into the Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross metric, which serves as a key tool for identifying local market peaks and troughs. The NVT Golden Cross measures the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to its daily transaction volume. When this ratio exceeds certain thresholds, it can signal whether the market is overbought or oversold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Are Hoarding Their Crypto Despite Plunge—Here’s What It Means Currently, the NVT value is below -2.4, placing Bitcoin firmly in the oversold territory. Historically, oversold conditions at such levels have often coincided with local market bottoms. NVT Golden Cross and Market Conditions “An NVT value below -1.6 indicates a possible market bottom, pointing to oversold conditions. Currently, the NVT value is below -2.4.” – By @tugbachain Full analysis 👇https://t.co/VuIHzc6liT pic.twitter.com/eTXIrwjOo7 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 27, 2025 Should a rebound materialize from this oversold zone, tugbachain suggests that the 111-day moving average, currently at $96,895, may act as a resistance point during any price recovery. This perspective offers investors a potential roadmap for understanding and navigating the ongoing market plunge.

This area has proven to be a crucial level for the coin’s price, and any attempts to rally higher are likely to face resistance here. If XRP does experience a short-term bounce, traders should watch for resistance within this range. Current Support Levels: XRP has found some support around the $1.95 to $2 range. This is an important zone that has been acting as a price floor for XRP in recent weeks. In fact, the price recently bounced from exactly $1.95, which has been a recurring support level. Short-Term Outlook: On the smaller timeframes, XRP has triggered an oversold signal, indicating potential short-term relief. Historically, when XRP’s RSI has been oversold, it has resulted in some bullish relief over the next 1-3 days. However, this does not guarantee a long-term reversal. Bearish Divergence and Larger Trend: Despite some short-term bounces, the broader market structure for XRP remains bearish. There is still a larger bearish divergence visible on the chart, and no signals have emerged to invalidate this trend yet. This suggests that XRP is still in a downtrend, characterized by lower highs and lower lows. Critical Support Levels: On the flip side, the $1.95-$2.00 range continues to act as a key support area for XRP. If the price were to break below this level, it would invalidate the current bullish short-term setup. The next key support to watch would be $1.77, which is an important level. Medium-Term Scenario: If XRP holds above the $1.95-$2.00 range, there is still a potential for the price to climb in the medium term. However, the outlook remains cautious as the larger trend is still down. A significant breakout would require a move above $2.36, and ultimately $2.83, to signal a true reversal.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-01 05:01:15

Judge Carol Bagley Amon said the charges against Heart are not tied to the United States. Heart is the creator of the HEX token , the PulseX asset trading platform and the PulseChain blockchain. The SEC filed a suit against him in July 2023, alleging the three tokens — Hex (HEX), PulseChain (PLS) and PulseX (PSLX) — were unregistered securities and that Heart spent $12.1 million of investor money on sports cars, Rolex watches and the world’s largest black diamond. The SEC throws the book at Heart, doesn’t quite reach him The SEC suspected Heart of raising over $1 billion with his three tokens. According to Dexscreener.com, PLSX has gained 70.60% in value in the last 24 hours at the time of writing to reach $0.00004790 and had a market cap of $6.59 billion. HEX rose by 65.67% to $0.01619 with a $6.59 billion market cap. Both tokens saw large jumps in trading volume. “The alleged misappropriation occurred through digital wallets and crypto asset platforms, none of which were alleged to have any connection with the United States,” Amon found . The SEC was unsuccessful in having papers served to Heart in Finland in November 2023. In December 2024, lawyers for Heart were unsuccessful in getting the SEC’s case thrown out. Heart has legal troubles in Finland too Heart is an American citizen but has lived in Finland for a number of years. In Finland, he was charged with income tax evasion to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars between June 2020 and April 2024 and assault in September. Local press reported that the tax charges were related to the launch of the tokens. The assault charge comes from an incident in February 2021 and involves a minor. The Finnish police believe that he has left Finland. An Interpol red notice was issued for Heart in December. In January, Finnish authorities seized 20 luxury watches from an uninvolved third party that purportedly belonged to Heart. All the while the law enforcement has searched for him, Heart has maintained a presence on social media. “If the haters really wanted to get me down they could raise more than the $27M I did for medical research. Write free self help books better than my sciVive and Fix The World. Work in the courts for legal precedent for P2P publishing software. Found things that work flawlessly and become valuable,” he wrote on X in December. “Case dismissed. Thank you Judge Amon,” he posted on Feb. 28. Heart has posted close to 500 videos on his YouTube channel Heart Pulse Radio, starting in January 2022, but the channel has been inactive for the last two months.

The operation, conducted on February 25-26, 2025, spanned over 60 locations, including major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru.

The bill also calls for federal oversight for issuers with over $10 billion market cap.

March 1, 2025 05:46:46 UTC SEC’s Shift in Strategy Signals Bright Future for Crypto Industry The SEC has recently dropped multiple cases against major crypto platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and ConsenSys, signaling a more favorable environment for the industry under Acting Chair Mark Uyeda. While some analysts see this as a win, others caution that the lack of clear rules could still lead to future risks. The SEC is focusing on policy development, rather than using enforcement as regulation. Debate continues in Congress on stablecoins and market structure. March 1, 2025 05:44:17 UTC Federal Judge Dismisses SEC Lawsuit Against HEX Founder Richard Heart A U.S. federal judge has dismissed the SEC’s lawsuit against Richard Heart, the founder of HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX, ruling that the agency lacked jurisdiction. Judge Carol Bagley Amon stated that Heart’s online communications were “untargeted, globally available information” and not specifically aimed at U.S. investors. The court found that the SEC failed to prove Heart intentionally engaged with the U.S. market. The SEC can appeal or amend the ruling within 20 days.

Simon’s Cat Token and Book of Meme are dealing with some serious dips, as Simon’s Cat is down 7.12% in the last 24 hours and 15.7% over the past week, while BOME has lost 7.9% in a day and 15.3% in seven days. Trading volume for Simon’s Cat is also slipping, down 4.6%, showing signs of lower engagement from traders. On the other hand, BTFD Coin is in full bull mode, with a presale that has already raised over $6.21 million and a projected 3,650% ROI potential. The launch of its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game on January 1, 2025, combined with 90% APY staking and a 100% bonus code offer, has turned it into one of the best new meme coins to buy today . BTFD Coin’s Play-to-Earn Game Brings a New Era for Meme Coins Why settle for a meme coin that just rides the hype when there’s one that actually pays players to play? That’s the game-changing model behind BTFD Coin’s P2E ecosystem , which is already live and rewarding users for engaging in battles, completing quests, and climbing leaderboards. Unlike most projects still in development, BTFD’s P2E game is fully operational, attracting a growing community of players eager to stack up BTFD tokens. The most bullish part? Tokens earned in-game can be staked for 90% APY, meaning players not only enjoy the game but also multiply their holdings while they play. With Stage 14 of its presale in motion, a current price of $0.00016, and over 70 billion BTFD tokens sold, this meme coin is proving why it’s one of the best new meme coins to buy today. Investors are watching closely because once BTFD lists at $0.0006, early buyers could be sitting on 275% gains—and if it hits the $0.006 moon price, that’s a wild 3,650% ROI. An investment of $8,000 at the current $0.00016 price gets you 50 million BTFD tokens. If the price climbs to $0.0006, that’s already worth $30,000. But if BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 moon price, that same $8,000 turns into a life-changing $300,000. Buying BTFD is simple. Set up a wallet using MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head to the BTFD presale page . Connect your wallet, enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code, buy your tokens, and claim them before listing. With the presale speeding toward its final stages and a 100% bonus code doubling tokens, BTFD is the biggest meme coin opportunity on the market right now. Simon’s Cat Sees Market Dips but Holds Strong Brand Power Simon’s Cat Token might be going through a 7.12% daily drop and a 15.7% weekly decline, but it still holds a strong cultural presence. Backed by the official Simon’s Cat brand with over 1.6 billion YouTube views, this memecoin is unique in its approach—combining meme culture with real-world cat rescue initiatives. Its short-term price action shows some hesitation in the market, with trading volume also slipping by 4.6%. However, long-term believers in the Simon’s Cat IP integration into Web3 are watching closely to see if the token can regain momentum. With a growing NFT presence and an expanding social media following, Simon’s Cat could turn things around, but for now, it remains in a downward trend. Book of Meme Faces Price Struggles Despite Strong Web3 Vision Book of Meme (BOME) is an experimental Web3 project that aims to merge memes, decentralized storage, and tokenized communities. Despite this ambitious goal, BOME has taken a hit, with a 7.9% daily drop and a 15.3% decline over the past seven days. One interesting aspect of BOME is its focus on decentralized meme preservation, using Solana, Arweave, and IPFS to permanently store memes on the blockchain. This approach aligns with the future of decentralized social media, making memes resistant to censorship or deletion. Even with a slight 1.75% trading volume increase, BOME still struggles to keep price stability. The project’s success will likely depend on its ability to attract more adoption from the meme community in the coming weeks. Final Words Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is dominating the meme coin space with its P2E game, presale growth, and massive earning potential. While Simon’s Cat and Book of Meme are dealing with short-term price dips, BTFD’s 90% staking APY, 100% bonus code, and Play-to-Earn model are fueling investor demand. With a presale price of $0.00016, a listing target of $0.0006, and a projected $0.006 moon price, BTFD’s 3,650% ROI potential is turning heads. Add in the fact that the LAUNCH100 bonus code doubles token purchases, and this could be the last major chance to get in before prices explode. BTFD or get left behind—the choice is yours. Join the BTFD Coin presale today . FAQs What makes BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to buy today? BTFD Coin offers a fully launched Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY staking, and a presale that has already raised over $6.21 million, making it stand out from the typical meme coin crowd. How does the LAUNCH100 bonus work for BTFD Coin? When investors use the LAUNCH100 bonus code during the presale, they receive double the amount of BTFD tokens, making this one of the most lucrative opportunities in crypto right now. What is the potential return on investment for BTFD Coin? At the current presale price of $0.00016, BTFD will list at $0.0006, offering 275% immediate gains. But if it reaches its $0.006 moon price, investors could see a massive 3,650% ROI.

Ukrainian lawmakers are working on a crypto tax bill, with the final version expected by mid-2025. The proposed tax rates range from 5% to 10%, but for undocumented crypto holdings, the tax could go as high as 23%. Ukraine Moves Closer to Crypto Taxation As Ukraine continues to legalize cryptocurrency, officials are drafting a bill that would introduce a 5% to 10% tax on crypto transactions. The goal is to use these funds to support the state budget and strengthen military operations amid the ongoing conflict with Russia. According to Danylo Hetmantsev, head of the Verkhovna Rada’s Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy, the primary text of the bill has already been finalized. However, discussions are ongoing about how authorities will monitor and regulate crypto transactions. Hetmantsev further noted that the bill is expected to pass its first reading by March 2025, but full implementation might take longer. Debate Over Tax Structure Meanwhile, Taras Kozak, deputy of the Kyiv City Council, believes the process could extend into 2026. He noted that Ukrainians widely support a 5% crypto tax which could be a fair rate. However, the government is also considering a more traditional tax structure. Under current rules, individuals pay an 18% income tax plus a 5% military tax, bringing the total to 23%. If applied to crypto income, investors could face significantly higher tax burdens. 23% Tax for Undocumented Crypto Holdings One of the key provisions of the bill is a 23% tax rate on undocumented crypto assets. Investors who fail to provide proof of their initial investment sources may be required to pay this higher tax. As Ukraine pushes ahead with crypto legalization, the final decision on tax rates will play a crucial role in shaping the country’s digital asset growth.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-01 05:19:10

The major agenda of the summit is to address the infrastructure and regulatory challenges faced by the crypto industry while encouraging innovation in this space. What to Expect from First Crypto Summit? The official White House press release shows that President Donald Trump will deliver remarks at the first-ever White House Crypto Summit, set to take place on Friday, March 7. Chaired by David Sachs, the White House’s “Crypto Czar” and hosted by Bo Hines, the group’s Executive Director, the event will have crypto leads coming together including founders, CEOs, investors, and members of the President’s Digital Asset Working Group. As America’s First Crypto President, Donald Trump will set the tone for his policy approach with Executive Order 14178. The order states that the Trump administration would prioritize “the healthy growth and use of digital assets in all sectors of the economy”. Furthermore, as opposed to the previous regulatory challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry, the Trump administration will introduce clear frameworks, encourage innovation, and uphold economic freedom. Will Working Group, David Sacks Push Crypto Policy Ahead? The digital assets working group includes the US Treasury, the Justice Department, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Earlier this week, the US SEC dropped lawsuits against crypto exchange Gemini, and has delayed decisions in the Binance lawsuit for 60 days, as the securities regulatory agency is working on a crypto task force. The Crypto Summit next week will probably offer greater insights into the crypto task force’s working under the leadership of Hester Peirce and key initiatives that are ahead of schedule. Earlier this month, crypto czar David Sacks confirmed that significant announcements regarding U.S. cryptocurrency policy are on the horizon. In preparation, the inter-agency Digital Asset Working Group has intensified its efforts, collaborating closely with the SEC and CFTC on joint initiatives. During a press conference, Crypto Czar David Sacks announced that his team is actively exploring the creation of a Bitcoin Reserve . Sacks stated that this initiative is among the top priorities being evaluated by the administration’s internal digital asset working group.

40992439,https://invezz.com/?p=2594664,1740807900,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Experts compare this altcoin to Ethereum (ETH) in 2021, is MUTM the next major investment?",https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/01/experts-compare-this-altcoin-to-ethereum-eth-in-2021-is-mutm-the-next-major-investment/,"Ethereum’s early investors saw life-changing returns, and now analysts believe a new opportunity may be emerging with Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Unlike speculative tokens, MUTM is a DeFi lending protocol designed for real financial utility, allowing users to supply, borrow, and earn passive income. Its presale is moving fast, with over 3,050 holders securing their tokens at $0.015, as investors anticipate significant price growth post-launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance ’s presale is drawing massive interest, with over $1,543,653.32 raised in less than 18 days. The project has already completed 26% of the second phase in just 96 hours, making it one of the fastest-growing presales of 2025. Investors are taking advantage of the low entry price before the next increase, positioning themselves for potential high returns. With a launch price set at $0.06, early investors are already looking at a 400% gain before the token even hits exchanges. However, experts believe that as the platform gains adoption and exchange listings go live, MUTM could surpass $1–$2 in the coming months, following a trajectory similar to Ethereum’s early days. Mutuum Finance stands out from the crowd because it isn’t just another altcoin, it’s a decentralized lending protocol with real-world use cases. Instead of relying on speculation, MUTM offers a practical way for users to earn passive income while maintaining asset ownership. Lenders can deposit assets like USDT, ETH, or BTC into liquidity pools, earning interest based on demand. Borrowers, on the other hand, can use their assets as collateral to access funds without a fixed repayment schedule, only paying interest according to the platform’s APY model. The platform provides two lending options: Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Direct lending agreements give borrowers access to tokens that aren’t normally available in liquidity pools, such as lower-cap assets and meme coins like DOGE and SHIB. Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Users contribute assets to liquidity pools, earning passive income while borrowers obtain funds directly from the platform. This model establishes a balanced ecosystem, guaranteeing long-term price growth and sustainable token demand. Mutuum Finance also features a buy-and-distribute mechanism designed to support token price stability. A portion of the platform’s revenue is used to buy back MUTM tokens, creating constant buy pressure. These acquired tokens are then distributed to mtToken holders, further rewarding long-term investors. mtTokens represent user deposits, acting as interest-bearing assets that grow in value over time. For example, an investor supplying 10,000 USDT will receive mtUSDT, which increases in value as interest accrues. Because of this, customers can profit without actively trading, which makes MUTM a great choice for those looking for passive income. To increase the platform’s use cases, the team is also creating an overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will offer consumers more liquidity choices while maintaining price stability because it will be backed by assets provided through Mutuum’s lending mechanism. With the presale price at $0.015 and an expected launch price of $0.06, early investors are already positioned for solid gains. However, analysts predict MUTM could surge beyond $1 or even $2, reflecting a minimum 45x increase from its presale price. For example, an investor who buys 300,000 MUTM tokens at the current presale price of $0.015 would invest $4,500. If MUTM reaches $2, as analysts predict, that same investment would grow to $600,000. With strong fundamentals, real-world utility, and growing demand, many see this as a rare opportunity to enter early before the price surges. Mutuum Finance is proving itself as a strong DeFi contender, with a rapidly growing presale and real-world financial applications. Those who missed early Ethereum have an opportunity to secure a high-utility altcoin before its price surges. With the presale still open but moving fast, investors looking for long-term gains and stable DeFi opportunities should consider joining before the next price jump.

The firm points to macroeconomic factors like a strengthening US dollar and shifting central bank policies as key drivers of Bitcoin’s struggle. Bitcoin Dips Below $80K Amid Market Sell-Off Bitcoin’s recent decline follows a broader financial market shift, with the US dollar strengthening due to tighter liquidity conditions. The US Dollar Index (DXY) has been rising, making risk assets like Bitcoin more vulnerable. Matrixport analysts suggest that this correction could be part of a natural 13-week cycle observed in past Bitcoin price movements Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy remains a key factor, with a more hawkish stance anticipated due to rising inflation expectations. Market analysts also note the increasing correlation between Bitcoin and traditional financial markets, making it susceptible to macroeconomic shifts Hence, there is a strong chance that mid-April will mark the lowest point of the year for Bitcoin. This goes against the prevailing expectation that the market will pump and change its current course. Even if such a pump occurs, it will likely be short-lived, creating a false sense of strength. While most people anticipate a rally in mid-April, it may turn out to be a trap. Only from that point will the market begin a healthy recovery, following the “natural” cycle toward the expected highs in Q3. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today : March 1st – Whitehouse Crypto Summit, Bitcoin News, Pi Coin Price , Bulls Still Betting on a Rebound Despite these bearish signals, some traders remain positive. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs , which have brought in $39 billion since their launch in early 2024, continues to shape market sentiment. However, Markus Thielen from 10x Research suggests that over half of these inflows are likely tied to arbitrage strategies rather than long-term investments. Even after shedding all election gains, BTC is back to square one. Still, some traders believe that “buying the dip” is a golden opportunity at this stage. Santiment data shows that mentions of “buy the dip” have surged to their highest level since July 2024. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investment, believes the market may be nearing a short-term bottom, while CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju maintains that the bull cycle isn’t over—though he warns that a drop below $75,000 could change that outlook. For now, Bitcoin remains under pressure, but with strong bullish sentiment still in play, traders are watching closely to see if the correction extends or if a rebound is on the horizon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ukraine has decided to move forward with the legalization of digital assets, and legislation is expected to be completed by mid-2025. Ukrainian local media reported on Feb. 28th that the country’s lawmakers were expected to vote on a long-awaited bill in the coming months, but uncertainty over how digital assets will be taxed remained a key issue that could impact the country’s growing crypto sector. According to the report, the issue of legalization and taxation of crypto in the country has long been in ‘limbo’, but it is assumed that ‘people’s deputies will vote for the corresponding bill already in the first quarter of 2025’. Taras Kozak, the president of the investment group UNIVER and deputy of the Kyiv City Council, said that the problem with the legality of the digital assets market will be solved by the summer, although what happens with income tax is still unclear. Chairman Hetmantsev disclosed that he was doing everything possible to fast-track the adoption of a bill on the legalization of crypto. Hetmantsev predicts first reading by the end of March JUST IN: UKRAINE IS MOVING FORWARD WITH THE LEGALIZATION OF CRYPTO WITH LAWMAKERS EXPECTED TO VOTE ON A BILL IN THE COMING MONTHS. Source: @News_Crypto https://t.co/B9k739hp5y pic.twitter.com/Kpsc5HxssA — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) March 1, 2025 Chairman Hetmantsev forecasted that the first reading would take place by the end of March, and the second reading in the parliament would follow immediately after. He noted that the law should be adopted by the summer, although Kozak disagreed with him, saying that he expected these procedures to be completed in 2026. Kozak added that he was an optimist and believes that the draft law will pass all readings in the Verkhovna Rada, be signed, and that crypto will be legalized and income from it will be taxed from 2026. According to Kozak, investors and businesses that use crypto in their activities were not against replenishing the state budget, but the final rate was very important. The consensus of this community is 5%, so many Ukrainians are ready to pay with income, he added. However, the state was still discussing standard taxation with a proposed 18% tax on the income of individuals plus 5% military levy. Ukrainians who invest before the law comes into force will pay 23% of the entire asset and not from the income received because they will not be able to prove the origin of their original finances. “I am inclined to the fact that there should be a small tax – about 5% to 10%. All incomes of citizens should be taxed, because our state lives on this money, our army fights, we buy weapons and maintain security.” -Taras Kozak Hetmantsev previously cautioned that ‘Ukrainians should have no illusions about the introduction of benefits’. He added that the crypto market was not going to receive a low rate, but there would be ‘an ordinary model of taxation of operations from securities’ when all investment profits were taxed. People’s Deputy says no preferential taxation conditions for crypto after legalization Hetmantsev stated at the EP forum “Prospects for Investments Within the Country” that while Ukraine was most likely to legalize crypto in Q1 of 2025, ‘one should not count on preferential taxation conditions’. He also said that there will be no tax breaks for crypto, and taxation will be applied according to the securities model, where profits will be taxed when assets are converted into currency. The head of the Verkhovna Rada Tax Committee explained that Ukrainian officials were in consultations with European experts and the IMF, and they were cautious about using crypto with tax benefits due to the possibility of tax evasion in traditional markets. Hetmantsev emphasized the urgency of passing the crypto legislation, arguing that delays could hinder Ukraine’s ability to attract foreign investment in crypto-based industries. According to Hetmantsev, if the law is enacted, Ukraine will join a growing list of countries formally integrating crypto into their financial and tax systems. However, industry leaders stressed that taxation policies will play a crucial role in determining whether the crypto market will flourish or struggle under regulatory pressure.

The Summit will feature prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto ecosystem. The White House Crypto Summit will also be attended by the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. The White House AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks will chair the Summit, while the Working Group’s Executive Director Bo Hines will administer the event in White House. The Working Group on Digital Assets also includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other key officials tasked with shaping the digital asset framework. President Trump plans to host the first-ever Crypto Summit next Friday First-ever White House Crypto Summit • Date: March 7 • Host: President Trump • Attendees: Crypto founders, CEOs, investors, and officials • Chair: White House A.I. & Crypto Czar David Sacks pic.twitter.com/BodE9OGmcQ — Terminus (@terminus_pos) March 1, 2025 The White House revealed that it will host the White House Crypto Summit on Friday, March 7. President Trump is set to deliver remarks during the Summit as he pledged to be “America’s first crypto president.” The event is set to bring together industry leaders, CEOs, investors, and members of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets in a bid to shape the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in the United States. David Sacks, the White House’s AI & Crypto Czar, shared that he was looking forward to “seeing everyone there!” Sacks will chair the Summit, with Bo Hines serving as Executive Director at the event. The White House highlighted plans to introduce a clear regulatory framework for the crypto industry while supporting innovation and promoting economic liberty. The Summit aligned with Trump’s Executive Order 14178, signed in his first week in office, which outlined his administration’s commitment to the “responsible growth and use of digital assets…across all sectors of the economy.” The order also directed federal agencies to prioritize policies encouraging crypto adoption while addressing fraud and money laundering risks. Trump’s administration pressed on its predecessor for having “unfairly prosecuted” the cryptocurrency industry. The event will mark a strong departure from the previous administration’s stricter regulatory stance, which led to heightened legal challenges for the digital asset industry. The White House Summit will not be just a policy meeting for the President but a political statement. Trump’s campaign actively engaged with crypto advocates, which positioned him as a pro-innovation leader in contrast to what he refers to the Biden administration as “war on digital assets.” His predecessor enforced regulatory crackdowns on crypto firms and exchanges, which drew ire from industry advocates who argued it stifled innovation in the financial industry. Sarah Jennings, CEO of CryptoPulse blockchain analytic firm, believes that the meeting “could be a game-changer if they deliver on the promise of clarity.” Jennings also highlighted that the last four years were a regulatory minefield and “businesses need predictability to thrive.” Sacks wants to create a golden age for cryptocurrencies. The President established a working group for digital currencies to propose Federal regulatory frameworks governing the issuance and operation of cryptocurrencies. In his first press conference on Bitcoin and digital assets, Sacks said the first thing industry experts wanted from Washington was regulatory clarity. “They just want to know what the rules of the road are so they can abide by them. We’re coming off frankly four years of arbitrary prosecution and persecution of crypto companies where the SEC wouldn’t tell founders what the rules were and then they would prosecute them.” -David Sacks, AI & Crypto Czar. Sacks added that many founders told him stories of “being debunked personally just because they had founded a crypto company.” The lawmaker also noted that he was looking forward to working with the politicians hosting the conference alongside him in “creating a golden age for digital assets.” Senator Tim Scott highlighted that this “golden age has begun” and that “the good news is that it’s going to get better.” Scott added that he will “work synergistically with the House and the Senate, with the White House leading the way” when it comes to passing bills on virtual currencies.

40994429,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135653,1740811736,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unstoppable DeepSeek AI: Challenging US Dominance in the Chatbot Race,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/unstoppable-deepseek-ai-chatbot/,"The AI world is buzzing, and the spotlight is firmly on DeepSeek. This Chinese AI lab has seemingly appeared out of nowhere, yet its AI Chatbot App has skyrocketed to the top of app store charts, sparking intense debate. Is the US losing its grip on AI leadership? Will the demand for AI chips continue to surge? Let’s dive into the story of DeepSeek, exploring its origins and its meteoric rise to global recognition. DeepSeek’s Intriguing Origins: From Trading Floors to AI Frontiers DeepSeek’s roots are in the world of finance. It’s backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese hedge fund leveraging AI for trading decisions. Liang Wenfeng, a passionate AI enthusiast and former Zhejiang University student, co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. By 2019, High-Flyer was a dedicated hedge fund, deeply invested in AI algorithms. In 2023, DeepSeek emerged as a separate AI research lab under High-Flyer, eventually spinning off as its own entity, also named DeepSeek. From its inception, DeepSeek prioritized building its own data centers for model training. However, like other Chinese AI innovators, it has navigated the complexities of US export restrictions on advanced hardware. To train its cutting-edge models, DeepSeek reportedly utilized Nvidia H800 chips, a less powerful alternative to the H100 chips more readily available to US-based companies. Interestingly, DeepSeek’s team is known for its youth and dynamism, actively recruiting PhD holders from top Chinese universities and even individuals from non-computer science backgrounds to broaden the AI’s understanding across diverse subjects. This blend of expertise and fresh perspectives appears to be a key ingredient in DeepSeek’s rapid ascent. Unveiling DeepSeek’s Powerful Generative AI Models DeepSeek burst onto the scene in November 2023 with its initial suite of models: DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat. However, it was the spring of 2024 that truly turned heads when the company launched its next-generation DeepSeek-V2 family. This powerful system, capable of analyzing both text and images, excelled in AI benchmark tests and boasted remarkable cost-efficiency compared to its contemporaries. DeepSeek-V2’s impact was immediate, pushing domestic competitors like ByteDance and Alibaba to drastically reduce prices or even offer some of their models for free. The subsequent release of DeepSeek-V3 in December 2024 further solidified DeepSeek’s growing reputation. DeepSeek’s internal testing indicates that V3 outperforms both open-source models like Meta’s Llama and closed models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Adding to its arsenal, DeepSeek introduced the R1 “reasoning” model in January. DeepSeek asserts that R1 matches OpenAI’s o1 model in performance on crucial benchmarks. Reasoning models like R1 are designed to fact-check themselves, mitigating common errors. While they may take slightly longer to process, their enhanced reliability in fields like physics, science, and mathematics is a significant advantage. Here’s a quick comparison of DeepSeek’s key models: Model Description Key Features DeepSeek Coder Code generation model Efficient code generation, supports multiple languages DeepSeek LLM Large Language Model General-purpose text understanding and generation DeepSeek Chat Chatbot model Conversational AI, user interaction DeepSeek-V2 General-purpose text and image analysis High performance, cost-effective, multi-modal DeepSeek-V3 Advanced LLM Outperforms Llama and GPT-4o in internal benchmarks DeepSeek R1 Reasoning Model Self-fact-checking, high reliability in complex domains However, there’s a crucial aspect to consider. As a Chinese-developed AI, DeepSeek’s models are subject to content regulation by China’s internet authorities. This means its responses are assessed to align with “core socialist values.” For instance, DeepSeek’s chatbot app with R1 will not engage with topics deemed sensitive, such as Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. This content filtering is a significant factor differentiating DeepSeek from Western AI models. A Disruptive Force in the AI Industry Disruption DeepSeek’s business strategy remains somewhat enigmatic. It offers its products and services at prices significantly below market averages, even providing some for free. DeepSeek attributes this to breakthroughs in efficiency, enabling extreme cost competitiveness. While some experts question these claims, developers are flocking to DeepSeek’s models. Although not strictly open source, DeepSeek offers permissive licenses allowing commercial use. Clem Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, notes that developers on their platform have created over 500 derivative models of R1, amassing 2.5 million downloads. DeepSeek’s impact on the AI landscape is undeniable. Its success against larger, more established competitors has been described as both “upending AI” and “over-hyped.” Notably, DeepSeek’s rise contributed to an 18% drop in Nvidia’s stock price in January and prompted a public statement from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Microsoft has integrated DeepSeek into its Azure AI Foundry service, highlighting its enterprise-level appeal. When questioned about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI investments, CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized that AI infrastructure spending remains a “strategic advantage” for Meta. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,” pointing out that reasoning models like DeepSeek’s are beneficial for Nvidia due to their high compute demands. Conversely, DeepSeek faces growing scrutiny. Some companies, and even entire countries like South Korea and governments like New York state, have banned DeepSeek on government devices, signaling concerns about its origins and potential influence. The Future of DeepSeek and the China AI Race What lies ahead for DeepSeek? Continued model improvements are a given. However, the increasing wariness from the US government regarding perceived foreign influence adds a layer of complexity. DeepSeek’s journey is intertwined with the broader China AI Race and the global competition for AI dominance. Its innovative models and disruptive pricing are forcing established players to react and adapt. Whether DeepSeek can maintain its momentum amidst geopolitical tensions and regulatory hurdles remains to be seen. One thing is clear: DeepSeek has undeniably shaken up the AI world and ignited a crucial conversation about the future of AI leadership and accessibility.

40994556,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135663,1740811934,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary ChatGPT Sora Integration: Unleashing AI Video Generation Power,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chatgpt-sora-ai-video/,"Get ready for a game-changing update in the world of artificial intelligence! OpenAI, the company behind the groundbreaking ChatGPT, has announced its ambitious plan to weave its cutting-edge AI video generator, Sora, directly into the ChatGPT experience. Imagine creating stunning, cinematic videos simply by typing prompts into your favorite chatbot. This integration promises to democratize video creation, bringing powerful AI video tools to a much wider audience, including the crypto and tech-savvy community. Exciting News: ChatGPT to Get AI Video Generation Power with Sora Integration In a recent office hours session on Discord, OpenAI leaders unveiled their vision to embed Sora into ChatGPT. Currently, Sora exists as a standalone web application launched in December, allowing users to generate short, twenty-second video clips. However, Rohan Sahai, OpenAI’s product lead for Sora, confirmed that the company is actively working to expand Sora’s reach, with ChatGPT integration being a key priority. This move signals OpenAI’s intent to make AI video generation more accessible and user-friendly, moving beyond its initial focus on creative professionals and video production studios. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: Direct Integration: OpenAI is developing a method to directly integrate Sora into ChatGPT, merging the capabilities of both platforms. Broader Accessibility: This integration aims to make Sora’s powerful video generation accessible to ChatGPT’s vast user base. Timeline Undefined: While the plan is confirmed, OpenAI has not yet provided a specific timeline for when this integration will be rolled out. Unlocking Creative Potential: Benefits of Sora in ChatGPT The integration of OpenAI Sora into ChatGPT holds immense potential, offering a plethora of benefits for users. Imagine the possibilities: Simplified Video Creation: No need to switch between different platforms. Generate videos directly within the familiar ChatGPT interface using simple text prompts. Enhanced User Experience: ChatGPT Sora integration promises a seamless and intuitive video creation experience, making it accessible to users of all skill levels. Content Creation Revolution: From explaining complex crypto concepts visually to creating engaging social media content, the applications are virtually limitless. Potential Premium Features: Integrating Sora into ChatGPT could also incentivize users to upgrade to premium ChatGPT subscriptions, potentially offering higher video generation limits and advanced features. While the exact feature set of Sora within ChatGPT remains to be seen, it’s likely that the initial version might offer a streamlined experience compared to the dedicated Sora web app. Sahai hinted that the ChatGPT version might not have the same level of granular control as the web app, where users can edit and stitch footage. This suggests OpenAI might be prioritizing ease of use and accessibility for the ChatGPT integration. Navigating the Challenges: Control and Accessibility of Sora within ChatGPT While the prospect of Sora AI in ChatGPT is exciting, there are considerations to keep in mind regarding control and accessibility: Feature Sora Web App Potential ChatGPT Integration Control Level High (editing, stitching) Potentially Lower (simplified interface) Complexity Potentially Steeper Learning Curve Likely More User-Friendly Target Audience Creatives, Video Professionals Broader ChatGPT User Base One of the reasons OpenAI initially launched Sora as a separate web app was to maintain ChatGPT’s simplicity. Introducing complex video editing features directly into ChatGPT could potentially overwhelm users. Therefore, a more streamlined version of AI video tools within ChatGPT makes sense for wider adoption. Beyond Video: Sora’s Future Image Generation and Mobile App Ambitions The ambition for Sora extends beyond video. OpenAI is reportedly developing an AI image generator powered by Sora. This could be a significant leap forward in image generation, potentially surpassing the photorealism of images created by DALL-E 3, which currently powers ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities. Imagine creating hyper-realistic images alongside cinematic videos, all within the same AI ecosystem. Furthermore, OpenAI is exploring a standalone mobile app for Sora. Sahai mentioned they are actively seeking mobile engineers for the Sora team, indicating a serious consideration for a dedicated mobile experience. This suggests a future where Sora could be accessible across multiple platforms – web, chatbot, and mobile – further expanding its reach and utility. What This Means for Crypto and Tech Enthusiasts For those in the cryptocurrency and tech space, the integration of Sora into ChatGPT represents a significant advancement in accessible AI. Imagine: Creating engaging educational content about blockchain, NFTs, or DeFi with visually stunning videos generated effortlessly. Developing marketing materials for crypto projects with high-quality video explainers and promotional clips. Visualizing complex data and trends in the crypto market through dynamic and informative video presentations. The possibilities are vast, and as AI video tools become more integrated into everyday platforms like ChatGPT, we can expect a surge in creative applications across various sectors, including the innovative world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Conclusion: The Dawn of AI-Powered Video Creation for Everyone OpenAI’s plan to integrate Sora into ChatGPT is a bold step towards making advanced AI video generation accessible to everyone. While the exact implementation and timeline are still under wraps, the potential impact is undeniable. This move promises to democratize video creation, empowering users to unleash their creativity and communicate ideas in visually compelling ways. As we await the arrival of Sora within ChatGPT, one thing is clear: the future of content creation is becoming increasingly visual and AI-driven.

CZ has claimed that this will help boost the BNB ecosystem . He said , “I will add a few hundred BNB in liquidity to the BNB Chain weekly winners until no funds are left.” The crypto community supports CZ’s decision to strengthen the BNB project’s liquidity CZ has maintained that he wants to provide consistent liquidity to the BNB chain ecosystem. In an X post on February 28, the former CEO claimed he would donate BNB from his own address until the funds were fully exhausted. Some analysts agree that Zhao’s weekly BNB injections could stabilize the meme projects’ liquidity and even mitigate price volatility. This could help build a more predictable space for developers and users. Not to mention, Zhao has claimed that they will probably expand their initiative to include more crypto assets and not just meme coins. Multiple X users have already expressed gratitude to Zhao, saying that the liquidity program is a great initiative. One user even stated that Zhao deserved the gains from every project that would see increased liquidity. CZ says he will not return tokens that are sent to his address However, in his X post, CZ asked the crypto community not to send any funds to his BNB address. According to Zhao, once he donated 150BNB, about $100,000, he received over $1 million back. He warned those sending him tokens to his address, hoping they’d have an interaction with him once he sends the tokens back, that he wouldn’t return the tokens. He even called them out for being “greedy.” He further argued that returning tokens would be more tedious for him. Moreover, he plans to either leave the tokens or burn them, adding that he has no intention of promoting them. He also stated that he considered selling them to BNB, like Vitalik. However, he claimed that doing so could harm crypto projects and alter crypto prices. He even claimed that selling the tokens would be more work for him, saying he’d choose the “least amount of work.” Nevertheless, Zhao has maintained that he doesn’t know when he’ll have time to deal with those tokens; however, he reserves his right to change his plans regarding them.

However, DOGE managed to remain north of a key support line on the daily scale. This suggests an upcoming rally, according to analysts, and a potential surge by triple digits. The massacre that took place within the past week was nothing short of mindblowing, and meme coins were hit the hardest. Recall that DOGE stood above $0.26 last Friday before the Bybit hack, Trump’s escalating trade war, and the overall market crash started to push it south hard. The culmination came a week later as the largest and oldest meme coin plunged to just over $0.18. This represented a 30% slump within the span of a week. Moreover, DOGE had dumped by 60% since the 2025 peak of $0.44. However, the asset didn’t spend much time below $0.19 and actually managed to reclaim it within hours. This is of particular significance as the $0.19 support line has been described multiple times as crucial for DOGE. If broken, it could result in a price drop to $0.06, which would essentially invalidate the entire bull market narrative. In contrast, a rebound from it could mean a surge to $0.5, as Ali Martinez and other analysts noted on X. To do so, though, DOGE has a long way to go as it needs a 150% surge from this point on in a time when all the hype in the crypto market has evaporated. Still, Dogecoin has proven before that it is able of spectacular price rises in relatively short times. #Dogecoin $DOGE holds above a critical support level! pic.twitter.com/jDNo5aoAdw — Ali (@ali_charts) March 1, 2025 The post Good News for Dogecoin (DOGE) Investors: Is $0.5 Still in Play? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|DOGEBTC|DOGEUSD|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,DOGE|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-03-01 07:03:53

Kiyosaki slams Bitcoin ETF as ‘bankster’s money’,https://finbold.com/r-kiyosaki-slams-bitcoin-etf-as-banksters-money/,"Renowned investor and author Robert Kiyosaki has expressed his distrust of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds ( ETFs ), branding them as tools of the financial elite. The ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ author labeled the Bitcoin ( BTC ) investment product as “bankster’s money,” stressing that it undermines the cryptocurrency’s independent spirit, according to an X post on March 1. He grouped Bitcoin ETFs with gold and silver ETFs , dismissing them as extensions of the same alleged corrupt financial machine he has long criticized. As previously reported by Finbold, Kiyosaki had vowed not to invest in Bitcoin ETFs, terming them ‘fake. ’ Instead, Kiyosaki urged investors to protect wealth by holding physical gold, silver, and Bitcoin itself, free from what he views as manipulative intermediaries. “Please protect yourself from the banksters. Buy real gold, silver, and Bitcoin. No gold, silver or Bitcoin ETFs…. Which are bankster’s money,” he said. Bitcoin and centralized financial systems His philosophy of investing in alternative assets aligns with his longstanding skepticism about centralized systems. In this case, the financial educator took aim at the U.S. dollar, the Federal Reserve, and the broader banking industry. Kiyosaki suggested that Bitcoin might have questionable aspects, but it pales compared to the flaws he sees in the traditional financial system. For instance, he accused the Fed and banking leaders of shielding their failures, bailing out institutions after massive losses instead of facing consequences. At the same time, Kiyosaki concluded his outlook by warning of a possible imminent collapse of the financial system and encouraging people to take steps to shield themselves from the fallout. Is BITCOIN a SCAM? It might be…. But not a big a scam as the US Dollar and the US Banking System…. Starting with the Fed. They are BANKSTERS. For example…. When they F. U. and lose billions…. The criminals at the Fed bail them out. They should go to jail. That’s… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) March 1, 2025 Interestingly, Kiyosaki has long predicted market crashes but has faced scrutiny because some of his projections failed to materialize. The S&P 500 price chart with Rober Kiyosaki’s crash predictions up to 2021. Source: @fintwit_news Overall, Kiyosaki believes that Bitcoin, gold, and silver can be used to protect investor wealth during market crashes. Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin outlook His latest remarks come when Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market are witnessing significant capital outflows, with the leading digital asset losing key support levels. To this end, the author noted that declining Bitcoin prices should be viewed as a ‘sale’ and an opportunity to accumulate more of the asset, as he maintains a bullish outlook. In particular, Kiyosaki sees Bitcoin hitting a new record high in 2025, predicting that the cryptocurrency will likely trade between $175,000 and $350,000 this year. Notably, this outlook appears to be a downgrade compared to his prediction for November 2024, when he projected that BTC would reach $500,000 in 2025 while leveraging an unnamed artificial intelligence (AI) tool. Considering Bitcoin’s current rough path, Kiyosaki’s prediction might seem ambitious. However, given underlying fundamentals such as the current pro-cryptocurrency administration, how the asset will trade remains to be seen. Featured image via Cavaleria Com YouTube The post R.

Recent reports indicate that the Ukrainian government is seriously contemplating imposing an income tax of up to 10% on crypto investors. This news, sourced from CryptoSlate, signals a potential shift in the country’s approach to digital assets and has sparked discussions within the global crypto community. Let’s dive into what this could mean for you and the future of crypto in Ukraine. Why is Ukraine Considering a Crypto Income Tax? Ukraine’s journey with cryptocurrencies has been quite remarkable. Initially embracing the digital asset space, the nation even legalized crypto in 2022 amidst global recognition for its innovative use of crypto donations during challenging times. However, like many governments worldwide, Ukraine is now grappling with the complexities of regulating and taxing this burgeoning sector. The primary driver behind this proposed crypto tax Ukraine seems to be twofold: Revenue Generation: In the current global economic climate, governments are constantly seeking new avenues for revenue. The crypto market, despite its volatility, represents a significant pool of potentially taxable income. Imposing a tax on crypto Ukraine could bolster the national budget, providing much-needed funds for various public services and infrastructure projects. Regulatory Alignment: As crypto adoption grows, international bodies and organizations are pushing for standardized regulatory frameworks. Implementing a crypto income tax would bring Ukraine more in line with global trends in crypto regulation, potentially fostering greater international cooperation and legitimacy within the financial world. What Does a 10% Crypto Tax Rate Actually Mean for Investors? The proposed tax rate of 5% to 10% might seem modest compared to income tax rates in some other sectors, but it’s crucial to understand its potential impact on crypto investors tax liabilities. Let’s break down what this could entail: Taxable Events: It’s likely that the tax will apply to capital gains realized from selling or trading cryptocurrencies. This means that if you buy Bitcoin and later sell it for a profit, that profit would be subject to the Ukraine crypto regulation . Tax Calculation: The exact methodology for calculating the taxable amount will be crucial. Will it be based on the difference between the purchase price and the selling price? Will there be allowances for expenses related to crypto trading or mining? These details will be outlined in the legislative process expected to conclude in the first half of 2025. Compliance and Reporting: Investors will need to meticulously track their crypto transactions to accurately calculate and report their taxable income. This might necessitate using specialized crypto tax software or seeking professional accounting advice to ensure compliance with the new regulations. Potential Benefits of Crypto Tax in Ukraine While taxes are rarely welcomed with open arms, a well-structured Ukraine crypto regulation , including taxation, can bring certain benefits to the crypto ecosystem and the nation as a whole: Increased Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Clear tax regulations can legitimize the crypto industry in the eyes of traditional financial institutions and the broader public. This could pave the way for greater mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and related technologies in Ukraine. Attracting Investment: A defined and predictable regulatory environment, even with taxes, can be more attractive to serious crypto businesses and investors than a completely unregulated space. Clarity reduces uncertainty and encourages long-term investment. Funding Innovation and Development: Tax revenues generated from the crypto sector could be reinvested into developing Ukraine’s digital infrastructure, supporting blockchain innovation, and fostering growth in the tech industry. Challenges and Concerns for Crypto Investors Despite the potential benefits, the introduction of a crypto income tax also raises some concerns and challenges for crypto investors: Compliance Burden: Navigating crypto tax regulations can be complex, especially for individuals unfamiliar with tax laws. The need for detailed record-keeping and potentially complicated calculations could create a compliance burden for investors. Impact on Innovation: Excessive or poorly designed taxation could stifle innovation and drive crypto businesses and investors to more tax-friendly jurisdictions. Finding the right balance is crucial to avoid hindering the growth of the crypto sector. Enforcement Challenges: Crypto transactions can be complex and cross-border, making tax enforcement a significant challenge for governments worldwide. Ukraine will need to develop effective mechanisms to ensure compliance and prevent tax evasion in the crypto space. What Can Crypto Investors in Ukraine Do Now? With the legislative process expected to conclude in the first half of 2025, crypto investors in Ukraine have some time to prepare. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in Ukraine crypto regulation . Follow reputable crypto news sources and official government announcements to stay updated on the proposed tax laws and their implementation. Review Your Crypto Holdings: Assess your crypto portfolio and understand your potential tax liabilities under the proposed regulations. Consider seeking advice from a tax professional specializing in crypto to understand the implications for your specific situation. Maintain Detailed Records: Start meticulously tracking all your crypto transactions, including purchase prices, sale prices, dates, and transaction fees. Good record-keeping will be essential for accurate tax reporting. Engage with the Community: Participate in discussions within the Ukrainian crypto community and voice your opinions and concerns regarding the proposed tax regulations. Collective feedback can influence the final legislative outcome. The Road Ahead for Crypto in Ukraine Ukraine’s consideration of a crypto income tax marks a significant step in the evolution of its crypto landscape. While the specifics are still being developed, it’s clear that the government is moving towards a more regulated approach. The key to success will lie in striking a balance – creating a tax framework that generates revenue and ensures compliance without stifling innovation and driving away crypto talent and investment. As Ukraine navigates this evolving regulatory landscape, the global crypto community will be watching closely to see how this develops and what lessons can be learned.

This marks the biggest monthly withdrawal since launch as macro uncertainties, the Trump trade war have escalated crypto market panic over the past week. Investors are curious whether March will be better or are we heading for another month of correction. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Resume After February Bloodbath During the last month of February 2025, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net outflows of $3.546 billion, or 40,000 BTC, from the market. This marked the first month where every BTC ETF reported negative inflows, coinciding with an 18% drop in Bitcoin’s price from $102,400 to $84,300. Top funds like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw its first ever monthly outflows, shedding off 9,470 BTC worth a $721 million outflow. Now, the fund holds a total of 573,136 BTC. Similarly, the Fidelity Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) experienced a $1.202 billion outflow while Grayscale’s two Bitcoin funds – GBTC and BTC – clocked a cumulative outflow of $585 million. Source: TraderT After eight consecutive days of outflows, Bitcoin ETFs finally recorded net inflows on Friday. As per the data from Farside Investors , yesterday’s inflows stood at a total of $94.9 million amid the broader crypto market recovery . While BlackRock’s IBIT continued with net outflows of over $243 million, Ark Invest’s ARKB and Fidelity’s FBTC made up for it with $193.70 million and $176.03 million worth of inflows respectively. It seems that the crypto market is finally taking a sigh of relief after key corrections in February. Will March Be Better for Bitcoin and Altcoins? February 2025 proved to be the toughest on record for the crypto market. Bitcoin price crashed more than 17.39% all the way to $82,000, making it the worst February performance for BTC over the past decade. However, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) faced even steeper fall correcting 31.95%, making it its worst February since inception. Blockchain analytics platform SpotonChain showed that historically, negative trends in February have often carried over into March, raising concerns about whether the market will rebound or if the downturn will continue. Analysts are closely watching for signs of recovery as March unfolds. Source: SpotonChain The latest Matrixport report suggested that hedge funds, and not traditional investors, have been behind the current Bitcoin sell-off. Furthermore, the report shows that the current Bitcoin price correction can continue even further until March or April, before the upward journey resumes again. Thus, it’s a wait and watch to see whether institutional inflows return to Bitcoin ETF moving ahead.

The crypto world was going wild, and BabyDoge Coin stormed onto the scene, wagging its tail to a 5,000% surge in just two weeks. Inspired by Dogecoin, this adorable token wasn’t just another meme coin—it was a viral sensation backed by Elon Musk himself. At its peak, early investors saw eye-watering gains, turning a few hundred bucks into six-figure fortunes. And yet, many were caught watching from the sidelines, wishing they had aped in before it skyrocketed. But here’s the thing about crypto: it always gives you another shot. Enter BTFD Coin , a next-gen meme coin bringing Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming, high-yield staking, and an insanely engaged community. This isn’t just a hype train—it’s a meme coin revolution with 1000X potential. The best part? You’re still early. BabyDoge’s Wild Ride to Success: A Meme Coin Fairytale If you were in the crypto space in 2021, you remember the BabyDoge mania. The coin launched with a mission to improve upon Dogecoin, promising faster transactions and community-driven growth. But let’s be real—what sent it to the moon was Elon Musk’s tweet: “Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo…” That one tweet was all it took. BabyDoge went parabolic, hitting an all-time high in July 2021 with a market cap exceeding $1.6 billion. The hype was unreal. Investors who bought in early reaped life-changing profits, while those who hesitated were left watching from the sidelines. Since then, BabyDoge has remained a major player in the meme coin world, continuing to expand its ecosystem. But for those who missed its golden entry point, the question remains: Where’s the next BabyDoge-level opportunity? BTFD Coin: One of the Best New Meme Coins with 1000X Potential Meet BTFD Coin, the meme coin that’s turning heads with its P2E game, high-APY staking, and explosive presale success.

P2E Gaming: The Future of Meme Coins Forget just holding and hoping—BTFD Coin is flipping the script with its four-level P2E game . Players can earn real BTFD tokens just by playing, which means there’s constant demand for the token. With gaming revenue projected to exceed $321 billion by 2026, integrating P2E into a meme coin ecosystem is a genius move.

This is gaining serious momentum. Investors are piling in before prices jump in Stage 15, and with every stage, the entry price increases. Wait too long, and you’ll be kicking yourself. Investment Example: What Happens If You Buy $7,000 Today? If you grab $7,000 worth of BTFD tokens at $0.00016, you’ll be holding 43.75 million tokens. If BTFD Coin reaches $0.0006 (its projected listing price), your investment becomes $26,250. If it hits $0.006 (a realistic moonshot), you’re sitting on $262,500. That’s a 3650% return—the kind of gains meme coin legends are made of. Final Thoughts: You Don’t Want to Miss This One History repeats itself in crypto. First, it was Dogecoin. Then BabyDoge. Now, BTFD Coin is setting up for its legendary run—but the window to get in early is closing fast. The difference this time? BTFD Coin isn’t just relying on hype—it’s packing a full ecosystem of staking, gaming, and a devoted community of Bulls.

The White House is reportedly gearing up to host its first-ever crypto summit on March 7th, a development first brought to light by Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett via a post on X (formerly Twitter). This news has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, sparking intense speculation and anticipation about what this high-level meeting could signify for the future of the industry. What is the White House Crypto Summit and Why Should You Care? For anyone invested in or curious about the world of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and the evolving landscape of digital finance, this crypto summit is a pivotal event to watch. Think of it as a crucial dialogue between the highest levels of the U.S. government and key stakeholders within the crypto industry. But why is this so significant? First of its Kind: This marks the inaugural crypto summit hosted by the White House, signaling a potential shift in the government’s approach and engagement with the digital asset sector. High-Level Attention: Hosting a summit at the White House itself underscores the growing importance and recognition of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology on a national level. It moves the conversation from niche tech circles to the heart of policy-making. Potential Policy Implications: The discussions held at this summit could directly influence future regulations, policies, and the overall legal framework governing cryptocurrencies in the United States. Industry Direction: Insights gleaned from the summit could provide valuable clues about the government’s stance on innovation, consumer protection, and the role of digital assets in the American economy. In essence, this isn’t just another meeting; it’s a potential landmark moment that could shape the trajectory of the crypto industry for years to come. For investors, developers, businesses, and even casual observers of the crypto space, understanding the outcomes of this summit is paramount. Decoding the White House’s Crypto Agenda: What’s on the Table? While the exact agenda for the White House crypto summit remains under wraps, we can speculate on some key areas likely to be at the forefront of discussions. Given the current regulatory landscape and ongoing debates surrounding digital assets, several critical topics are expected to be addressed: Potential Discussion Topics Why It Matters Regulation and Compliance Establishing clear rules for crypto exchanges, DeFi platforms, and stablecoins is crucial for mainstream adoption and investor protection. Innovation and Competitiveness Balancing regulation with fostering innovation is vital to ensure the U.S. remains a leader in the burgeoning blockchain and crypto space, preventing innovation from moving overseas. Consumer Protection Addressing risks associated with crypto investments, including scams, market volatility, and lack of understanding, is paramount for safeguarding consumers. National Security Concerns Examining the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit activities, money laundering, and sanctions evasion is a significant national security consideration. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) The potential development and implications of a U.S. CBDC, and its interplay with private cryptocurrencies, is a topic of intense global interest. It’s reasonable to anticipate that the summit will bring together policymakers, industry leaders, regulatory bodies (like the SEC and CFTC), and potentially even tech innovators. The goal is likely to foster a productive dialogue that can inform future policy decisions and provide a clearer path forward for the crypto industry within the U.S. Navigating Crypto Regulation: Benefits and Challenges for the Industry The topic of crypto regulation is arguably the most pressing issue for the digital asset space. While many in the crypto community initially resisted the idea of government oversight, there’s a growing recognition that well-defined regulations are essential for long-term growth and mainstream acceptance. Let’s consider both the potential benefits and challenges: Potential Benefits of Clear Crypto Regulation: Increased Institutional Investment: Clear regulatory frameworks can provide the necessary clarity and security for institutional investors to confidently enter the crypto market, injecting significant capital. Reduced Uncertainty: Defined rules reduce the legal and operational ambiguities that currently plague the crypto industry, fostering a more stable and predictable environment. Enhanced Consumer Trust: Regulations aimed at consumer protection can build trust in the crypto space, encouraging wider adoption by the general public. Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Regulatory clarity can legitimize the crypto industry in the eyes of traditional financial institutions and the broader public, paving the way for mainstream integration. Potential Challenges of Overly Restrictive Crypto Regulation: Stifling Innovation: Overly burdensome or poorly conceived regulations could stifle innovation and drive crypto businesses and talent to more favorable jurisdictions. Increased Compliance Costs: Complex and stringent regulations can significantly increase compliance costs, particularly for smaller crypto startups, potentially hindering competition. Reduced Decentralization: Certain regulatory approaches might inadvertently undermine the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, which is a core principle for many in the space. Unintended Consequences: Regulations implemented without a thorough understanding of the technology could lead to unintended negative consequences for the industry and its users. The key is to strike a balance – regulations that are robust enough to protect consumers and maintain financial stability, yet flexible enough to allow innovation to flourish. The White House summit presents an opportunity to move closer to achieving this delicate equilibrium. Digital Assets in Focus: Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum While Bitcoin and Ethereum often dominate headlines, the world of digital assets is far broader and more diverse. The White House summit is likely to encompass discussions that extend beyond these two giants to include the entire spectrum of digital assets, such as: Stablecoins: These cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies (like the US dollar) are gaining traction as a means of payment and a bridge between traditional and crypto finance. Regulatory clarity around stablecoins is crucial. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): As mentioned, the potential for a US CBDC is a major topic. The summit might explore the potential benefits, risks, and design considerations of a digital dollar. Security Tokens: Representing ownership in traditional assets (like stocks or real estate) on a blockchain, security tokens have the potential to revolutionize capital markets. Regulatory frameworks are still evolving. Utility Tokens: These tokens provide access to a product or service within a blockchain ecosystem. Their regulatory classification remains a subject of ongoing debate. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): While initially associated with digital art and collectibles, NFTs have broader applications in areas like ticketing, gaming, and intellectual property. Their legal and regulatory status is still being defined. By taking a holistic view of digital assets , the White House can formulate policies that are comprehensive and adaptable to the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. This summit could be a crucial step towards recognizing the diverse potential of blockchain technology and its applications beyond just cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Policy and the Future of Finance: What to Expect Ultimately, the White House crypto summit is about more than just cryptocurrencies; it’s about shaping blockchain policy and defining the future of finance in the digital age. The discussions and outcomes of this summit could have far-reaching implications for various sectors beyond just the crypto industry, including: Financial Services: Blockchain technology has the potential to transform payments, lending, trading, and other financial services, making them more efficient, transparent, and accessible. Supply Chain Management: Blockchain can enhance supply chain transparency and traceability, reducing fraud and improving efficiency. Healthcare: Blockchain can be used to securely store and manage patient data, improve clinical trial processes, and enhance pharmaceutical supply chains. Intellectual Property: Blockchain can provide a secure and transparent way to manage and protect intellectual property rights. Government Services: Blockchain can enhance transparency and efficiency in government operations, such as voting systems, land registry, and identity management. As governments worldwide grapple with how to approach blockchain and digital assets, the White House summit could position the United States as a leader in fostering responsible innovation and shaping global blockchain policy . The outcomes will be closely watched by industries, investors, and policymakers around the globe. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto The upcoming White House crypto summit on March 7th represents a potentially crucial juncture for the digital asset industry. It signals a significant step towards increased dialogue and engagement between the government and the crypto sector. While the specific outcomes remain to be seen, this summit offers a hopeful opportunity to address critical issues, foster responsible innovation, and pave the way for a clearer and more constructive future for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology within the United States. The world will be watching to see if this summit truly marks a landmark shift in digital asset policy.

The speculation arose from widespread allegations that major crypto firms, including Binance, were liquidating large amounts of tokens through OTC deals. However, Binance has categorically denied these accusations, emphasizing that the company has no control over independent market makers and their strategies. Addressing concerns over the transfer of a significant amount of SOL tokens by well-known market maker Wintermute, a Binance spokesperson explained that such firms operate according to their own trading strategies. “We have no way of understanding the decisions of our users, including market makers who transfer their assets according to their own strategies. Therefore, while blockchain transparency is one of the biggest advantages of cryptocurrencies, it is important not to jump to conclusions based on transaction screenshots,” he said.

Global cryptocurrency exchange BYDOXE has just announced a significant milestone that could reshape its presence in the United States. For crypto enthusiasts and investors in the US, this is a development you definitely want to understand. Let’s dive into what this means for BYDOXE and the broader crypto landscape. BYDOXE Secures Key MSB License: A Game Changer for US Crypto Services BYDOXE, a prominent global cryptocurrency exchange, has officially announced the acquisition of a U.S. Money Services Business (MSB) financial license. This isn’t just another piece of paper; it’s a crucial regulatory clearance that allows BYDOXE to operate legally and offer a comprehensive suite of crypto services across all 50 states of the United States. This move signifies BYDOXE’s commitment to regulatory compliance and its ambition to tap into the vast potential of the U.S. cryptocurrency market. But what exactly is an MSB license, and why is it such a big deal for a crypto exchange like BYDOXE? Understanding the MSB License: Your Gateway to Compliant Crypto Services In the United States, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency businesses is primarily overseen by agencies like FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) and state-level regulators. The MSB license, issued by FinCEN, is a fundamental requirement for businesses dealing with money transmission, currency exchange, and other financial services – which naturally includes cryptocurrency exchanges. Think of it as a stamp of approval from the U.S. financial authorities. Obtaining an MSB license means BYDOXE has met stringent regulatory requirements, demonstrating its commitment to anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) standards. This not only builds trust with users but also positions BYDOXE as a compliant and reliable platform in a sometimes murky crypto world. Key aspects of the MSB license include: Legal Compliance: Operating without proper licensing can lead to severe penalties, including fines and even operational shutdowns. The MSB license ensures BYDOXE operates within the legal framework of the U.S. Enhanced Trust and Credibility: For users, knowing that an exchange is licensed provides a greater sense of security and trust. It signals that the platform is serious about regulatory obligations and user protection. Access to the U.S. Market: The U.S. is one of the largest and most influential cryptocurrency markets globally. The MSB license effectively unlocks access to this market for BYDOXE, allowing it to offer its services to millions of potential users. Banking Relationships: Licensed entities often find it easier to establish and maintain relationships with traditional financial institutions, which is crucial for the smooth operation of a crypto exchange. In essence, the MSB license is a vital piece of the puzzle for any crypto exchange aiming to establish a significant presence in the United States. It’s a testament to BYDOXE’s dedication to operating within regulatory boundaries and providing a secure environment for its users. Why is this MSB License a Triumph for BYDOXE Crypto Exchange? For BYDOXE, securing the MSB license is more than just a regulatory checkbox ticked off. It represents a strategic victory with far-reaching implications. Let’s explore the key benefits: Benefits for BYDOXE: Expanded Market Reach: Operating across all 50 U.S. states instantly broadens BYDOXE’s potential customer base exponentially. This allows them to tap into diverse markets and demographics within the US. Competitive Edge: In a competitive crypto exchange landscape, regulatory compliance can be a major differentiator. The MSB license gives BYDOXE a competitive advantage over exchanges that are not yet fully compliant in the U.S. Attracting Institutional Investors: Institutional investors are increasingly interested in the crypto space, but they prioritize regulatory compliance and security. The MSB license can make BYDOXE more attractive to institutional capital. Platform Growth and Expansion: With a solid regulatory foundation in place, BYDOXE can confidently plan for further expansion of its services and product offerings within the U.S. market. Brand Reputation Boost: Obtaining the MSB license enhances BYDOXE’s reputation as a trustworthy and legitimate crypto exchange on a global scale. Benefits for Users of BYDOXE Crypto Services in the US: Increased Security and Trust: Users can have greater confidence in using BYDOXE, knowing it operates under U.S. regulatory oversight. Wider Range of Services: With the MSB license, BYDOXE is positioned to offer a full spectrum of crypto services in the U.S., potentially including trading, staking, lending, and more. Access to a Compliant Platform: For users who prioritize regulatory compliance, BYDOXE becomes a go-to platform for their crypto activities. Potential for Enhanced Features: As BYDOXE establishes itself in the U.S. market, users can expect the platform to evolve with new features and improved services tailored to the U.S. regulatory environment and user needs. In essence, the MSB license acts as a catalyst, paving the way for BYDOXE to become a major player in the U.S. crypto market and offer enhanced services to its users. Navigating US Regulation: Challenges and Opportunities for BYDOXE While the MSB license is a significant achievement, navigating the U.S. regulatory landscape for crypto is an ongoing process. BYDOXE, like all crypto businesses operating in the US, will face both challenges and opportunities. Challenges: Evolving Regulatory Landscape: Crypto regulations in the U.S. are still developing and can vary at the federal and state levels. BYDOXE needs to stay agile and adapt to any future regulatory changes. Compliance Costs: Maintaining MSB compliance involves ongoing costs related to reporting, audits, and adherence to AML/CFT requirements. Competition: The U.S. crypto market is highly competitive, with numerous established exchanges and new entrants. BYDOXE needs to differentiate itself through its services, user experience, and competitive pricing. State-by-State Nuances: While the MSB license allows federal operation, specific state regulations may still apply to certain aspects of crypto services. BYDOXE needs to navigate these state-level nuances effectively. Opportunities: Market Leadership: By demonstrating a strong commitment to compliance, BYDOXE can position itself as a leader in the U.S. crypto market, attracting users and partners who value regulatory adherence. Innovation and Growth: A clear regulatory framework provides a foundation for innovation. BYDOXE can confidently explore new crypto products and services within the U.S. market, knowing it operates within legal boundaries. Strategic Partnerships: Compliance can open doors to partnerships with traditional financial institutions and other businesses seeking to enter the crypto space through regulated channels. First-Mover Advantage (in some areas): As the regulatory landscape evolves, exchanges that proactively embrace compliance can gain a first-mover advantage in offering new regulated crypto products and services. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Users and Investors? The BYDOXE MSB license news offers several actionable insights for crypto users and investors, particularly those in the United States: For Crypto Users: Consider Compliant Platforms: When choosing a crypto exchange, prioritize platforms that demonstrate a commitment to regulatory compliance, like BYDOXE. This offers greater security and peace of mind. Explore BYDOXE’s Offerings: With the MSB license in hand, keep an eye on BYDOXE as they expand their services in the U.S. market. They may offer competitive trading options and innovative crypto products. Stay Informed on Regulations: The crypto regulatory landscape is dynamic. Stay informed about developments in U.S. crypto regulations to make informed decisions about your crypto activities. For Crypto Investors: Regulatory Compliance as a Key Indicator: For investors evaluating crypto exchanges or crypto-related businesses, regulatory compliance, like obtaining an MSB license, should be a positive indicator of long-term viability and stability. BYDOXE as a Potential Investment Opportunity (indirectly): While you may not directly invest in BYDOXE as a private company, its success in the U.S. market, driven by regulatory compliance, can contribute to the overall growth and maturity of the crypto ecosystem, which benefits crypto investors in general. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Regulatory clarity and positive regulatory signals, such as the granting of MSB licenses, can be bullish for the crypto market as a whole. Keep an eye on regulatory news as it can influence market sentiment and investment strategies. Conclusion: A Powerful Step Forward for BYDOXE and US Crypto BYDOXE securing the U.S. MSB license is undoubtedly a significant milestone. It’s a testament to their commitment to regulatory compliance, a strategic move to expand their reach in the lucrative U.S. market, and a positive signal for the broader cryptocurrency industry.

40995601,https://coinpedia.org/?p=426298,1740813849,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,XRP News Today: SBI’s Report Shows XRP’s 7X Surge & Growing Market Presence,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-today-sbis-report-shows-xrps-7x-surge-growing-market-presence/,"The post XRP News Today: SBI’s Report Shows XRP’s 7X Surge & Growing Market Presence appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News SBI Holdings, a major Ripple partner, has just dropped a financial report that reveals eye-opening details about XRP. From its circulation supply to its soaring market value, the report highlights XRP’s impressive rise . Even more surprising, XRP’s value has multiplied over time, reflecting its strong position in the market. XRP Supply Breakdown: Circulation, Escrow, and Burn Mechanism According to SBI’s financial report for the fiscal year ending March 2025, as of February 2, 2025, about 57.76 billion XRP are circulating in the market. With a maximum supply of 100 billion XRP, this means a significant portion is still held in reserve. The report also states that Ripple currently holds 4.79 billion XRP, while 37.43 billion XRP remains locked in escrow. This escrow system ensures that XRP is released gradually to prevent excessive market supply. Another key aspect discussed in the report is the burning of XRP through transaction fees. So far, 0.01 billion XRP have been burned , reducing the total supply over time. Meanwhile, this burning mechanism helps in maintaining the efficiency and security of the XRP Ledger by preventing spam transactions. SBI’s XRP Rewards for Shareholders The report also provides insights into SBI’s shareholder benefits distributed in XRP. Since March 2020, SBI has rewarded its shareholders with XRP on five occasions, amounting to a total of 796 XRP per shareholder. Initially, the value of these distributions was around 8,000 Japanese Yen, calculated at an average of 50.2 Yen per XRP. However, as of February 6, 2025, the value surged to 354.6 Yen per XRP, nearly seven times the original value. This increase reflects XRP’s strong market performance and growing adoption. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For March 1 , Growing Partnership with Ripple Furthermore, the long-standing partnership between SBI and Ripple continues to expand. SBI, which owns a 9% stake in Ripple, has been instrumental in promoting XRP adoption. The two companies formed SBI Ripple Asia in 2016 to enhance cross-border payments in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2021, SBI Remit introduced Japan’s first international remittance service using XRP. The collaboration is now set to extend into the NFT space , with plans to issue NFTs on the XRP Ledger at Expo 2025 in Osaka, Japan. Additionally, SBI recently launched RLUSD, a stablecoin linked to the US dollar, further strengthening its presence in the digital asset space. The strong partnership between SBI and Ripple continues to push XRP forward, making it a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

One day, optimism reigns supreme, with prices soaring to new heights. The next, fear can grip the market as prices plummet, leaving investors in a state of uncertainty. To help gauge this ever-shifting sentiment, tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index have emerged as invaluable resources. Let’s delve into the latest readings and understand what they signify for the current state of the crypto landscape. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Should You Care? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me, is a metric designed to assess the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100. A reading of 0 indicates “Extreme Fear”, suggesting investors are highly anxious and potentially selling off their holdings. Conversely, a reading of 100 signifies “Extreme Greed”, implying excessive optimism and a potential market bubble. A neutral reading of 50 would suggest a balanced market sentiment. Why is this index important? Because market sentiment is a powerful driver in the crypto world. Extreme fear can often lead to undervaluation, presenting potential buying opportunities for savvy investors. On the other hand, extreme greed can signal an overheated market ripe for correction. By monitoring the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , you gain insights into the prevailing emotions driving market movements, helping you make more informed decisions. Think of it as a weather vane for the crypto market’s emotional climate. It doesn’t predict the future, but it provides a snapshot of the current mood, allowing you to understand whether the market is driven by panic selling or exuberant buying. Extreme Fear Persists: Index at 20 Despite Slight Increase As of March 1st, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 20. This marks a slight uptick of four points from the previous day. While any increase might seem positive, it’s crucial to note that a reading of 20 still firmly places the market in the “Extreme Fear” zone. This indicates that despite a minor improvement in sentiment, a significant level of anxiety and apprehension continues to dominate the crypto market. This “Extreme Fear” reading suggests that: Investor Caution: Market participants are still largely risk-averse, likely hesitant to invest heavily due to prevailing uncertainties. Potential Undervaluation: Historically, periods of extreme fear can sometimes precede market rebounds. Assets might be undervalued if fear is driving prices down excessively. Bearish Momentum: While there’s a slight improvement, the overall trend still leans towards bearish sentiment. It’s essential to remember that the index is a sentiment indicator, not a precise predictor of price movements. However, consistently low readings like 20 highlight the prevailing cautious mood within the crypto community. Decoding the Factors: What Drives the Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on guesswork. It’s calculated using a weighted average of six different market factors, providing a comprehensive view of market sentiment. Let’s break down these components: Factor Weight Description Volatility 25% Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin and compares it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 and 90 days. Unusually high volatility is often a sign of fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares the current market momentum and volume with the last 30 and 90-day averages. Strong buying volume and positive momentum can indicate greed. Social Media 15% Analyzes social media sentiment, particularly on platforms like Twitter and Reddit, for crypto-related hashtags and engagement rates to gauge public opinion. Surveys 15% Conducts weekly crypto polls to directly gauge investor sentiment and expectations. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin dominance relative to the broader cryptocurrency market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal a flight to safety during periods of fear, as investors move away from riskier altcoins. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google Trends data for crypto-related search queries. Increased search interest in terms like “Bitcoin” or “crypto crash” can indicate fear. As you can see, the index is a multifaceted measure, taking into account a range of quantitative and qualitative data points to provide a holistic view of crypto sentiment . Market Volatility: A Key Driver of Fear? One of the most significant factors influencing the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , as highlighted in the component breakdown, is market volatility . The crypto market is renowned for its price swings, and periods of high volatility can understandably trigger fear among investors. When prices fluctuate dramatically and unpredictably, it creates uncertainty and anxiety. High market volatility often leads to: Increased Risk Perception: Investors perceive greater risk during volatile periods, making them more inclined to reduce exposure or sell assets. Emotional Trading: Volatility can exacerbate emotional trading, leading to panic selling during downturns and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) buying during surges. Market Instability: Extreme volatility can contribute to overall market instability and uncertainty, further fueling fear. Currently, even with the slight increase in the index, the persistent “Extreme Fear” reading suggests that market volatility , among other factors, is likely still playing a significant role in shaping investor sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance: What Does it Tell Us About Fear? Another crucial component of the index is Bitcoin dominance . Bitcoin dominance refers to the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Changes in Bitcoin dominance can offer insights into market risk appetite and sentiment. In periods of heightened fear and uncertainty, Bitcoin dominance often tends to increase. This is because: Flight to Safety: Bitcoin is generally perceived as the “safest” and most established cryptocurrency. During times of fear, investors may move their funds from riskier altcoins into Bitcoin, seeking relative stability. Altcoin Sell-offs: Fear can trigger sharper sell-offs in altcoins compared to Bitcoin, as investors become more risk-averse and liquidate their more speculative holdings. Market Contraction: In a fearful market, the overall crypto market cap may contract, but Bitcoin’s relative share can increase as altcoins decline more significantly. Therefore, monitoring Bitcoin dominance in conjunction with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can provide a more nuanced understanding of the prevailing market sentiment. A high fear reading coupled with rising Bitcoin dominance could suggest a strong “flight to safety” dynamic is at play. Navigating Extreme Fear: Opportunity or Further Downturn? The million-dollar question is: what does “Extreme Fear” mean for investors? Is it a signal to stay away, or does it present a potential opportunity? The answer, as with most things in crypto, is nuanced and depends on individual risk tolerance and investment strategies. Potential Opportunities in Extreme Fear: Buying the Dip?: Historically, periods of extreme fear have sometimes been followed by market recoveries. “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,” as Warren Buffett famously said. Extreme fear can create buying opportunities if you believe in the long-term potential of crypto. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Investing gradually over time, especially during periods of fear, can be a prudent strategy. DCA helps mitigate the risk of trying to time the market bottom and allows you to accumulate assets at potentially lower average prices. Focus on Fundamentals: Extreme fear can shake out weaker projects and highlight fundamentally strong cryptocurrencies. It’s a good time to reassess your portfolio and focus on projects with solid technology, strong teams, and real-world use cases. Cautions During Extreme Fear: Risk Management is Key: Extreme fear can also be a precursor to further market downturns. It’s crucial to manage risk effectively, diversify your portfolio, and avoid over-leveraging. Emotional Control: Fear can lead to impulsive decisions. Avoid panic selling based on short-term price fluctuations. Stick to your long-term investment plan and make rational decisions based on research and analysis, not emotions. Market Uncertainty: “Extreme Fear” signifies significant uncertainty. Be prepared for continued volatility and potential further price declines. Conclusion: Staying Informed in a Fearful Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , currently lingering in “Extreme Fear” at 20, serves as a valuable reminder of the prevailing cautious sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. While a slight increase from the previous day offers a glimmer of potential improvement, the overall mood remains apprehensive. Understanding the factors driving this index, such as market volatility and Bitcoin dominance , empowers investors to make more informed decisions. Whether “Extreme Fear” presents a buying opportunity or signals further downturn is a matter of perspective and strategy. However, staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining emotional control are paramount in navigating these uncertain times. By monitoring sentiment indicators like the Fear & Greed Index, you can better understand the market’s emotional landscape and position yourself to make strategic moves in the dynamic world of crypto.

This unexpected decision raises significant questions about the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation and the future of digital assets. Let’s dive into the details of this shocking dismissal and understand what it means for the crypto landscape. SEC Lawsuit Against HEX Founder Dismissed – What Really Happened? On February 28th, a federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, delivered a blow to the SEC’s enforcement efforts in the crypto space. The lawsuit against Richard Heart, which accused him of securities fraud and selling unregistered securities , was thrown out. According to reports from Bloomberg, the judge stated that the SEC failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the alleged fraudulent activities occurred within the United States. Here’s a breakdown of the key points: The Charge: The SEC initially charged Richard Heart with securities fraud and the illegal sale of unregistered securities related to his cryptocurrency project, HEX. The Allegations: The SEC claimed Heart misappropriated investor funds, using the money to fund a lavish lifestyle, including the purchase of luxury watches, high-end cars, and even a massive 555-carat black diamond known as “The Enigma.” The Dismissal: The judge dismissed the lawsuit, stating the SEC “failed to allege specific facts” proving the alleged misconduct took place within U.S. jurisdiction. Jurisdictional Issue: The core reason for dismissal was the SEC’s inability to sufficiently link Heart’s actions to U.S. territory, a crucial element for U.S. courts to assert jurisdiction. Who is Richard Heart and What is HEX Crypto? For those unfamiliar, Richard Heart is a somewhat controversial figure in the cryptocurrency space, known for his outspoken personality and marketing prowess. He launched HEX, a cryptocurrency project that positions itself as a “high-interest blockchain certificate of deposit.” HEX crypto operates on the Ethereum network and is designed to reward users for staking their tokens for a set period. It gained significant attention, and also scrutiny, for its high yield promises and complex tokenomics. Critics have often raised concerns about its sustainability and potential Ponzi-like structure, while proponents tout its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). Here’s a quick look at HEX: Feature Description Type Cryptocurrency, ERC-20 Token Purpose Decentralized Certificate of Deposit Network Ethereum Key Mechanism Staking for Yield Controversy Sustainability, Ponzi scheme accusations Crypto Regulation in the US: Is This a Setback for the SEC? This dismissal comes at a time when crypto regulation is a hot topic globally, and especially in the United States. The SEC has been actively pursuing enforcement actions against various crypto projects and companies, aiming to bring the digital asset space under traditional securities laws. This case against Richard Heart was seen as a significant test of the SEC’s reach and authority in the crypto domain. The dismissal can be interpreted in several ways: Procedural Setback: It’s primarily a procedural setback for the SEC, highlighting the importance of establishing clear jurisdictional links in cross-border crypto cases. Not an End to Scrutiny: This dismissal doesn’t necessarily mean Richard Heart or HEX are in the clear. The SEC could potentially refile the lawsuit with more concrete evidence of U.S. nexus, or pursue other avenues of investigation. Impact on SEC Strategy: It might force the SEC to refine its approach to regulating global crypto projects, emphasizing the need for stronger evidence of U.S.-based activities. Broader Regulatory Debate: This case underscores the ongoing debate about how to effectively regulate decentralized and global cryptocurrency projects within existing legal frameworks. Unregistered Securities and the Ongoing Crypto Conundrum The core of the SEC’s argument against Richard Heart and HEX revolved around the allegation of selling unregistered securities . This is a recurring theme in SEC enforcement actions within the crypto industry. Securities laws are designed to protect investors by requiring companies issuing securities to register them with the SEC and provide detailed disclosures. In the context of crypto, the question of what constitutes a security is complex and often debated. The SEC applies the Howey Test, derived from a Supreme Court case, to determine if an asset qualifies as an investment contract and therefore a security. Many cryptocurrencies and crypto-related products fall into a gray area, leading to legal battles and regulatory uncertainty. Key considerations regarding unregistered securities in crypto: Howey Test Application: The SEC uses the Howey Test to assess if a crypto asset involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others. Decentralization vs. Centralization: The level of decentralization in a crypto project is a factor. More centralized projects are often seen as having a higher likelihood of being classified as securities. Investor Protection: The SEC’s primary goal is investor protection. They argue that many crypto offerings lack the transparency and disclosures required under securities laws, putting investors at risk. Industry Pushback: The crypto industry often argues for clearer guidelines and a more tailored regulatory approach, claiming that applying traditional securities laws is ill-suited to the unique nature of digital assets. What’s Next for Richard Heart, HEX, and the SEC? The dismissal of the SEC lawsuit is undoubtedly a victory for Richard Heart and the HEX community, at least in the short term. However, the legal saga might not be over. The SEC has the option to appeal the dismissal, or potentially refile the lawsuit with additional evidence addressing the jurisdictional concerns raised by the judge. For HEX crypto, this news could be seen as a positive development, potentially boosting investor confidence and market sentiment. However, the underlying regulatory questions and criticisms surrounding the project remain. Looking ahead: SEC Appeal: The SEC could appeal the judge’s decision, leading to further legal proceedings. Refiled Lawsuit: The SEC might choose to refile the lawsuit with strengthened evidence to establish U.S. jurisdiction. Continued Scrutiny: Regardless of this specific case, HEX and Richard Heart will likely remain under regulatory scrutiny. Wider Crypto Regulation Impact: This case will likely influence the ongoing development of crypto regulations in the U.S. and globally. In conclusion, the dismissal of the SEC lawsuit against Richard Heart is a significant development in the ongoing story of crypto regulation. While it marks a win for Heart and HEX in this particular instance, it also highlights the complexities and challenges the SEC faces in regulating the decentralized and global nature of the cryptocurrency industry. The future remains uncertain, and the crypto world will be watching closely to see the SEC’s next move.

This transpired in February 2025 as many market observers, as well as historical performances, hinted at substantial gains. That didn’t come to fruition, though. Worst February Since ’14 There was a lot of hype for February 2025. Perhaps deservingly so as bitcoin’s price movements since 2013 had been highly bullish within the second month of the year. In fact, only on two occasions – 2014 and 2020, the asset had charted losses. Moreover, Februaries after a halving year, which was the 2025 one, brought double-digit gains (62% in 2013, 23% in 2017, and 37% in 2021). So, the stage was set for another rally and perhaps a fresh all-time high above $110,000. After all, BTC had charted a 9.3% gain in January, according to CoinGlass data, and had neared the aforementioned level but never managed to break it. However, BTC never actually managed to go beyond January’s closing price, which was at around $102,500. It briefly managed to challenge it at the beginning of the month, but overall, it spent most of the month below $100,000. The landscape worsened in the last week of the month when it plummeted by double digits to a multi-month low of $78,000 amid Trump’s escalating trade war. It managed to recover some ground by February’s closing time and ended the month at around $84,000. This still meant a substantial decline of 17.39% within the second month of the year, making it the worst February since 2014. Bitcoin Monthly Returns. Source: CoinGlass What’s Next in March? March has been historically a controversial month for BTC. After a mindblowing rally of 173% in 2013, the month delivered declines for six out of the next seven, with the latest being in March 2020, when the entire world was struck by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the trend changed once again for the next four years as BTC saw gains of 29.84% in March 2021, 5.39% in 2022, 22.96% in 2023, and 16.81% last year. The good news for March 2025 is that bitcoin doesn’t have to register some big gains to end the month in the green, as it started after a severe correction in what is still considered a bull market. Still, history doesn’t always rhyme as February 2025 proved.

In a recent memo that’s making waves across Silicon Valley, Brin emphasized a seemingly old-school approach to cutting-edge AI development: Return To Office (RTO) . Yes, you heard that right. As companies worldwide grapple with hybrid and remote work models, Brin is betting big on in-person collaboration to propel Google to the forefront of the AGI revolution. Let’s dive into why this tech titan believes physical presence is the secret weapon in the fiercely competitive AGI race . Why Return To Office is Google’s Secret Weapon in the AGI Race? For many, the idea of mandatory office returns feels like a step back in time, especially in the tech industry, which has long championed remote flexibility. However, Brin’s memo, as reported by The New York Times, paints a different picture. He’s not just asking for employees to clock in; he’s urging them to be in the office “at least every weekday,” suggesting a commitment beyond the current three-day-a-week policy. But what’s the rationale behind this push, especially when discussing something as futuristic as AGI? Boosting Collaboration and Innovation: Brin’s core argument hinges on the power of in-person synergy. He believes that the spontaneous interactions, brainstorming sessions, and quick problem-solving that happen organically in an office environment are irreplaceable for tackling complex challenges like building AGI. Intensified Work Hours: The memo reportedly mentioned a “sweet spot” of 60-hour workweeks. While this might raise eyebrows about work-life balance, it underscores the intensity and dedication Brin believes is necessary to win the AGI race . It signals a wartime-like urgency, where every hour counts. Catching Up in the AI Arena: Let’s not forget the context. Google, once the undisputed king of AI, found itself playing catch-up after OpenAI’s ChatGPT took the world by storm in 2022. Brin’s return to Google and this RTO push are clear indicators of the pressure Google feels to reclaim its AI leadership. Belief in Google’s AGI Potential: The memo itself is a powerful statement of intent. It reveals Brin’s conviction that Google is capable of building AGI – a system with human-level intelligence. This isn’t just about incremental AI improvements; it’s about achieving a monumental leap in artificial intelligence. Is 60 Hours the New 40? Decoding AI Productivity in the RTO Era Brin’s mention of a 60-hour workweek as a productivity “sweet spot” is bound to spark debate. In an era increasingly focused on work-life balance and employee well-being, such long hours might seem counterintuitive. However, within the context of the AGI race , it reflects a high-stakes, high-pressure environment. Let’s break down what this could mean for AI productivity and the future of work at Google and beyond: Aspect Implications of 60-Hour Workweeks Innovation & Speed Potentially faster progress in AGI development due to increased time investment and focus. Employee Burnout Risk of increased stress and burnout if not managed sustainably. Google needs to consider employee well-being alongside productivity goals. Collaboration Intensity More hours together in the office could amplify collaborative efforts, but also demands effective team dynamics. Industry Trendsetter? Google’s move might influence other tech companies in the AI space to reconsider RTO for competitive advantage. It’s crucial to remember that Brin’s memo isn’t an official policy change yet. Google’s current hybrid model of three days in office remains. However, the memo is a strong signal – a glimpse into the mindset of a co-founder deeply invested in Google’s AI future. It highlights the immense pressure Silicon Valley giants are under to not just keep up but to lead in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Beyond the Memo: What Does This Mean for the Future of Google AI and the Broader Industry? Sergey Brin’s memo is more than just an internal communication; it’s a bellwether. It reflects a critical juncture in the tech industry, where the pursuit of AGI is becoming the new space race. Here’s what we can infer from this development: AGI is the Ultimate Prize: The memo unequivocally underscores the importance of AGI as the ultimate goal in AI research and development. It’s not just about incremental improvements in existing AI models; it’s about achieving a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence. RTO as a Strategic Tool: While remote work offers flexibility, Brin’s stance suggests that for certain highly complex and competitive endeavors like AGI development, the benefits of in-office collaboration are deemed indispensable. This could lead to a re-evaluation of remote work policies, at least for core innovation teams within tech giants. Heightened Competition in AI: The urgency in Brin’s memo reflects the intense competition in the AI space. Google, OpenAI, and other players are locked in a high-stakes battle for AI dominance, and every strategic lever, including work models, is being considered. Focus on Foundational AI Research: Winning the AGI race requires deep, foundational research. Brin’s return to Google and the RTO emphasis could signal a renewed focus on fundamental AI breakthroughs, moving beyond applied AI and towards the core science of intelligence. The Bottom Line: Will RTO Really Help Google Win the AGI Race? The effectiveness of RTO as a strategy to win the AGI race remains to be seen. It’s a bold move, a counter-narrative to the prevailing trend of remote work. Sergey Brin’s memo is a clear message: Google is not just playing to participate; it’s playing to win. Whether this bet on in-person intensity pays off will be a story to watch closely. One thing is certain: the race for AGI is on, and the stakes are higher than ever. For the crypto and tech world, this development signifies a renewed commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI, which could have profound implications across industries, including blockchain and decentralized technologies. The innovations in AI, particularly AGI, may very well shape the future of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technologies.

Recently, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance and a prominent figure in the crypto space, offered some grounded advice for navigating these turbulent waters. His message? Sometimes, less is more, especially when it comes to your mental well-being during crypto market dips . Why is Mental Stability Crucial During Market Volatility? Imagine riding a rollercoaster – the initial climb is exciting, the drops can be thrilling, but prolonged extreme ups and downs can leave you feeling nauseous and disoriented. The crypto market, particularly during periods of high market volatility , can feel very similar. It’s an emotional rollercoaster where your portfolio’s value can fluctuate dramatically in short periods. This constant fluctuation can take a significant toll on your mental health. Here’s why maintaining mental stability is paramount, especially for crypto investors: Emotional Decision Making: Fear and greed are powerful emotions that market volatility amplifies. When your mental state is compromised, you’re more likely to make impulsive decisions, such as panic selling at market bottoms or FOMO-buying at market tops – often detrimental to your long-term investment strategy . Stress and Anxiety: Watching your investments plummet can induce significant stress and anxiety. Chronic stress impacts sleep, focus, and overall well-being, extending beyond just your portfolio. Long-Term Perspective: A stable mental state allows you to maintain a long-term perspective. Crypto investing, especially in emerging projects, is often a long game. Short-term volatility should ideally be viewed as noise rather than a reason to abandon your strategy. Health and Relationships: Unmanaged stress from market volatility can spill over into other areas of your life, affecting your physical health and relationships with family and friends. CZ’s Shocking Advice: Reduce Holdings for Peace of Mind? Changpeng Zhao (CZ), with his vast experience in the crypto industry, understands the psychological pressures of market volatility firsthand. His recent post on X wasn’t about chasing quick gains or predicting the next bull run. Instead, it was a pragmatic suggestion focused on investor well-being: if market dips are causing you significant stress, consider reducing your investment size. This might seem counterintuitive to some. Isn’t the goal to ‘buy the dip’? Yes, strategic buying during dips can be a sound investment strategy . However, CZ’s advice targets a different, equally important aspect: risk management from a psychological perspective. Here’s a breakdown of CZ’s rationale: Personal Risk Tolerance: Everyone has a different risk tolerance – the amount of financial and emotional risk they can comfortably handle. What might be a manageable dip for one investor could be a source of immense anxiety for another. Investment Size vs. Comfort Level: Sometimes, the size of your crypto holdings might simply be too large relative to your comfort level. If you’re constantly checking prices and feeling panicked during dips, it’s a sign your position size might be impacting your mental stability negatively. Proactive Stress Reduction: Reducing your holdings during periods of high market volatility isn’t about admitting defeat; it’s about proactively managing stress and regaining control over your emotional state. It’s a strategic move to protect your mental health, which, in the long run, can lead to better investment decisions. How to Implement CZ’s Advice: Actionable Steps for Investors CZ’s advice isn’t a blanket recommendation for everyone to sell their crypto at the first sign of a dip. It’s a nuanced suggestion to consider adjusting your portfolio based on your individual emotional response to crypto market dips . Here are actionable steps to implement this advice: 1. Self-Assessment: Understand Your Emotional Response to Market Volatility The first step is honest self-reflection. Ask yourself: How do I typically react when the crypto market experiences a significant dip? Do I feel anxious, sleepless, or constantly preoccupied? Am I making impulsive decisions based on fear or panic during these times? Is my crypto investment strategy causing more stress than it’s worth? If the answer to these questions leans towards negative emotional impact, it’s a strong indicator that adjusting your approach might be beneficial. 2. Define Your Comfort Zone and Risk Tolerance Before making any investment decisions, clearly define your financial and emotional risk tolerance. Consider: Financial Risk Tolerance: What percentage of your total investment portfolio are you comfortable allocating to crypto? What level of potential loss can you stomach without significant financial distress? Emotional Risk Tolerance: How much market volatility can you handle emotionally? At what point does market fluctuation become overwhelmingly stressful? Your comfort zone is where your financial risk tolerance intersects with your emotional risk tolerance. Ideally, your crypto investments should operate within this zone. 3. Strategic Portfolio Adjustment During Market Dips If you determine that market volatility is negatively impacting your mental stability , consider a strategic portfolio adjustment. This doesn’t necessarily mean selling everything. It could involve: Reducing Exposure: Decrease the percentage of your portfolio allocated to crypto. This could involve selling a portion of your holdings to reduce overall risk exposure. Diversification: If you’re heavily invested in a few volatile assets, diversify into less volatile cryptocurrencies or even traditional assets to mitigate risk. Taking Profits: During bull runs, consider taking some profits and rebalancing your portfolio. This provides a buffer for potential future dips and reduces the emotional sting of drawdowns. 4. Focus on Long-Term Investment Strategy and Education Shift your focus from short-term price fluctuations to your long-term investment strategy . This involves: Due Diligence: Thoroughly research the projects you invest in. Understand their fundamentals, technology, and long-term potential. Informed decisions are less likely to be swayed by short-term market noise. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider using DCA, where you invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price. This strategy can smooth out the impact of market volatility and reduce emotional decision-making. Continuous Learning: Stay informed about the crypto market, but avoid obsessively tracking minute-by-minute price charts. Focus on understanding broader trends and developments. 5. Prioritize Mental and Physical Well-being Remember that your mental and physical health are paramount. During periods of market volatility , prioritize self-care: Limit Screen Time: Reduce the time spent constantly checking crypto prices. Set specific times to review your portfolio rather than constant monitoring. Exercise and Mindfulness: Engage in physical activity and mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing to manage stress and anxiety. Healthy Lifestyle: Ensure you’re getting enough sleep, eating well, and maintaining social connections. A healthy lifestyle provides a stronger foundation for managing stress. The Benefits of Prioritizing Mental Stability in Crypto Investing Adopting CZ’s advice and prioritizing mental stability in your crypto journey offers several significant benefits: Benefit Description Improved Decision Making A calm and rational mind makes better investment decisions, avoiding impulsive actions driven by fear or greed. Reduced Stress and Anxiety Managing your portfolio in a way that aligns with your comfort level significantly reduces stress and anxiety associated with market volatility . Enhanced Long-Term Focus Mental clarity allows you to stay focused on your long-term investment strategy , weathering short-term fluctuations with greater resilience. Better Overall Well-being Prioritizing mental health positively impacts your overall well-being, extending beyond just your financial life to improve relationships and physical health. Sustainable Investing Investing becomes more sustainable and enjoyable when it’s not a constant source of stress, leading to a healthier and more balanced approach to wealth building. Challenges and Considerations While CZ’s advice is valuable, there are challenges and considerations to keep in mind: Missing Potential Gains: Reducing holdings during dips might mean missing out on potential rebounds if the market recovers quickly. This is a trade-off you need to be comfortable with in exchange for mental stability . Timing the Market: Knowing when to reduce holdings and when to reinvest is challenging. Market timing is notoriously difficult, and emotional decisions can sometimes lead to selling low and buying high. Individual Circumstances: CZ’s advice is general. Your financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance are unique. What works for one person may not be suitable for another. Understanding Market Cycles: It’s crucial to understand crypto market cycles and historical trends. Dips are a normal part of these cycles, and panic selling during every dip can be detrimental in the long run. Conclusion: Investing in Your Mental Peace is Investing Wisely In the exhilarating yet often nerve-wracking world of cryptocurrency investing, CZ’s advice serves as a crucial reminder: your mental well-being is paramount. Navigating crypto market dips isn’t just about technical analysis or market predictions; it’s about understanding your emotional response to market volatility and crafting an investment strategy that aligns with your personal comfort level and promotes mental stability . By taking proactive steps to manage stress, define your risk tolerance, and adjust your portfolio accordingly, you can approach crypto investing with greater confidence and peace of mind. Remember, investing wisely isn’t just about maximizing returns; it’s about building wealth in a way that supports your overall well-being and allows you to thrive, even amidst the inevitable ups and downs of the crypto market. Changpeng Zhao ‘s insightful advice encourages us to prioritize mental health as a cornerstone of successful and sustainable crypto investing.

40996129,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135847,1740814658,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling Mistral AI: The Audacious European Challenger to OpenAI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/mistral-ai-openai-european-challenger/,"In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, a new contender has emerged, capturing global attention and sparking discussions about the future of AI development. This audacious player is Mistral AI, a French startup that has quickly risen to prominence, positioning itself as a formidable OpenAI competitor . But what exactly is Mistral AI, and why is it being touted as Europe’s best hope against the giants of the AI industry? Let’s dive into everything you need to know about this fascinating company. What Exactly is Mistral AI and Why Should You Care? Founded in 2023, Mistral AI isn’t just another tech startup; it’s a beacon of European innovation in the AI landscape. With a bold mission to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone,” Mistral AI is making waves by championing openness and accessibility in a field often dominated by closed-door developments. Think of it as a refreshing breeze in the sometimes stuffy atmosphere of AI monopolies. This ambition to democratize advanced AI is a core part of what makes Mistral AI stand out as a unique French AI startup . Its flagship product, Le Chat, is designed as a direct alternative to ChatGPT, and is now conveniently available on both iOS and Android platforms. The mobile app launch was a resounding success, hitting 1 million downloads within just two weeks and even topping the free app charts in France. Imagine the French President, Emmanuel Macron himself, recommending Le Chat over ChatGPT – that’s the kind of buzz Mistral AI is generating! Beyond Le Chat, Mistral AI offers a suite of powerful AI models designed for various applications: Mistral Large 2: The powerhouse large language model, succeeding the original Mistral Large, designed for top-tier performance. Pixtral Large: A multimodal model introduced in 2024, expanding the Pixtral family’s capabilities to handle more than just text. Codestral: A specialized generative AI model crafted specifically for coding tasks, a boon for developers. “Les Ministraux”: A family of efficient models optimized for use on edge devices like smartphones, bringing AI power to your pocket. Mistral Saba: A model with a focus on the Arabic language, demonstrating Mistral’s commitment to linguistic diversity in AI. Who are the Masterminds Behind this OpenAI Competitor? The team at Mistral AI is nothing short of an AI dream team. The three founders bring a wealth of experience from the very heart of AI research at major U.S. tech companies, all with significant operations in Paris. CEO Arthur Mensch is a DeepMind alumnus, while CTO Timothée Lacroix and Chief Scientist Officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta heavyweights. This pedigree gives Mistral AI serious credibility and technical prowess right from the start. It’s like assembling a basketball team with all-star players – you expect them to compete at the highest level, which is exactly what Mistral AI is doing as an OpenAI competitor . Adding to their impressive roster, co-founding advisors include Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve and Charles Gorintin from the health insurance innovator Alan, and even former digital minister Cédric O. While Cédric O’s involvement raised eyebrows due to his political background, it underscores the significant connections and ambitions Mistral AI holds within the French and European tech ecosystem. Open Source or Proprietary? Understanding Mistral AI’s Model Strategy One of the intriguing aspects of Mistral AI is their nuanced approach to open source. Unlike some AI labs that operate strictly behind closed doors, Mistral AI differentiates between its top-tier models and its more accessible offerings. Their premier AI models are not open source for commercial use, safeguarding their competitive edge and revenue streams. However, they do offer free models with weights accessible under the Apache 2.0 license. This includes research-focused models like Mistral NeMo, developed in collaboration with Nvidia and open-sourced in July 2024. This balanced strategy allows Mistral AI to contribute to the open AI community while also protecting its core business. Here’s a simple breakdown: Model Type Open Source? Commercial Use Premier Models (e.g., Mistral Large 2) No (Weights not available) Commercial via API/Licensing Free Models (e.g., Mistral NeMo) Yes (Apache 2.0 license) Permitted How Does Mistral AI Actually Generate Revenue? While many of Mistral AI’s offerings are freely accessible, the company has a clear plan for monetization. Le Chat, their ChatGPT alternative, features paid Pro tiers, launched in February 2025 and priced at $14.99 per month. This subscription model is a direct revenue stream from individual users. For businesses, Mistral AI monetizes its premium AI models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these advanced models for their internal applications. Strategic partnerships also play a crucial role in their revenue generation, as highlighted during the Paris AI Summit. Despite these efforts, reports suggest Mistral AI’s revenue is still in the eight-digit range, indicating significant growth potential ahead. Strategic Partnerships: Fueling Mistral AI’s Ascent Strategic alliances have been instrumental in Mistral AI’s rapid growth. In 2024, a landmark deal with Microsoft included both a strategic partnership to distribute Mistral’s AI models via Microsoft Azure and a €15 million investment. Although the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority quickly waved it through, the deal did raise some eyebrows within the EU, underscoring the geopolitical sensitivities around AI technology. This partnership with Microsoft provides Mistral AI with significant cloud infrastructure and market reach, essential for competing with established giants. In January 2025, Mistral AI further solidified its position by partnering with Agence France-Presse (AFP), granting Le Chat access to AFP’s vast text archive dating back to 1983. This access enhances Le Chat’s knowledge base and positions it as a powerful tool for information retrieval and analysis. Other notable strategic partnerships include collaborations with the French army and job agency, German defense tech firm Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis, showcasing the breadth of Mistral AI’s applications and appeal across diverse sectors. Funding Frenzy: The Billion-Dollar Startup Mistral AI’s funding journey is nothing short of meteoric. As of February 2025, the company has raised approximately €1 billion, or $1.04 billion, through a mix of equity and debt financing. This rapid accumulation of capital underscores investor confidence in Mistral AI’s vision and potential to disrupt the AI landscape. Even before launching its first AI models , Mistral AI secured a record $112 million seed round in June 2023, valuing the then-one-month-old startup at a staggering $260 million – Europe’s largest seed round ever. Just six months later, a Series A round of €385 million ($415 million) followed, catapulting its valuation to $2 billion. This round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and included participation from existing investors and new heavyweights like BNP Paribas and Salesforce. The $16.3 million convertible investment from Microsoft was considered a Series A extension, maintaining the $2 billion valuation. In June 2024, another €600 million (around $640 million) was raised in a mix of equity and debt, led by General Catalyst, rocketing the valuation to $6 billion. Investors in this round included tech giants like Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, and Samsung Venture Investment Corporation. This phenomenal funding trajectory highlights Mistral AI’s status as a unicorn startup with serious momentum. What’s Next for Mistral AI? IPO or Acquisition? Despite the swirling acquisition rumors, Mistral AI CEO Arthur Mensch has firmly stated, “Mistral is ‘not for sale.’” An IPO is the clearly stated plan. Given the massive amounts of funding raised, an IPO makes strategic sense to deliver returns to investors and maintain the company’s independence, especially considering the sensitive nature of AI technology and European sovereignty concerns. However, to justify its near $6 billion valuation, Mistral AI needs to significantly scale its revenue. The path ahead is challenging but filled with immense potential. Keep a close watch on this dynamic French AI startup – its journey is just beginning, and it promises to be a thrilling one in the ever-evolving AI narrative.

It will be led by David Sacks, known as the White House’s “Crypto Czar,” and hosted by Bo Hines. https://twitter.com/davidsacks47/status/1895660834799698008 The main goal is to discuss crypto regulations , improve the industry’s infrastructure, and encourage new ideas. With President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President attending, the event could bring big changes to U.S. crypto policies . This is a very important event as this will mark a new era for crypto assets in the U.S. Trump’s Pro-Crypto Vision President Trump will be in the center stage at the summit to brief his new administration’s views on digital assets. His first executive order 14178, after his inauguration, confirms that his administration will prioritize the “healthy growth and use of digital assets in all sectors of the economy.” Unlike the previous administration’s strict regulatory approach, Trump’s team aims to introduce clear and structured policies to support the industry while ensuring economic freedom. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Recovered: Is this a Rebound or a Bull Trap? , Crypto Task Force and Regulatory Shifts The Digital Asset Working Group, which includes key agencies such as the U.S. Treasury, SEC, CFTC, and Justice Department, is expected to play a major role in shaping policy. Recently, the SEC dropped its lawsuit against crypto exchange Gemini and postponed decisions in the Binance case for 60 days , signaling a shift in its enforcement strategy. The summit will likely provide deeper insights into the ongoing work of the crypto task force , led by SEC Commissioner hester peirce hester peirce Hester Peirce of the Securities and Exchange Commission, often known as ""Crypto Mom,"" is one of the most outspoken supporters of cryptocurrency at the government level in the United States.

She was born in Ohio and graduated from Yale Law School. Prior to joining the Securities and Exchange Commission, she worked in a variety of capacities evaluating and creating financial regulations. She worked at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, a libertarian-leaning think tank, most recently before becoming commissioner, where she produced, among other things, critiques of legislation like the Dodd-Frank Act. As chairman Jay Clayton steps out and a Joe Biden nominee takes his place, Republican Peirce will find herself in the minority. Clayton, on the other hand, was not particularly forward-thinking when it came to digital assets. President Biden has declared his intention to select Gary Gensler, a crypto expert who would presumably be more prepared to deal with Peirce than Clayton was. The SEC's approval of initial public offerings for crypto businesses like Coinbase, the first U.S.-authorized Bitcoin ETF, and, of course, the ICO safe harbour are all obvious targets for Peirce. We won't know what Peirce thinks about the SEC's pursuit of Ripple until after the fact, per SEC protocol, but the outcome of that case will almost certainly serve as a springboard for more clarity. Peirce told guests at the Crypto Finance Conference in January that the future SEC chairman's priority should be supporting innovation and giving regulatory clarity: ""We need to embrace innovation and figure out how to create a regulatory framework that encourages it, which, in our field, I believe means providing clarity.""

One of the biggest announcements expected from the summit is the potential establishment of a Bitcoin Reserve. David Sacks confirmed that this initiative is among the administration’s top priorities, and discussions are taking place within the inter-agency digital asset working group. If implemented, this move could dramatically change Bitcoin’s role in the U.S. economy. What to Expect Moving Forward With the White House actively shaping crypto regulations, the summit is expected to lay the groundwork for a more structured and supportive regulatory environment. If Trump follows through with his pro-crypto policies, it could accelerate institutional adoption and provide much-needed clarity for businesses operating in the space.

A major red flag has been raised in the digital asset world. The Bybit exchange is grappling with the aftermath of a significant security breach, and the perpetrator is now making moves. On-chain data reveals an alarming development: a staggering $32.2 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) has been laundered by the Bybit hacker in just the past 24 hours. Let’s dive into the details of this developing crypto security saga and understand the implications for the broader blockchain ecosystem. What We Know About the Bybit Hack and ETH Laundering According to prominent on-chain analyst @EmberCN, the Bybit hacker initiated a massive ETH laundering operation. Over a single day, a whopping 14,300 ETH, valued at $32.2 million, was moved through complex transactions aimed at obscuring the funds’ origin. This information, revealed on X (formerly Twitter), sent ripples through the crypto community, highlighting the ever-present risks in the digital asset space. The hacker’s activity, however, seems to have paused. @EmberCN reported that the ETH transfers and laundering ceased around 06:00 UTC yesterday. Key Highlights of the Bybit ETH Laundering Incident: Massive Sum Laundered: $32.2 million in ETH moved in 24 hours. Analyst Alert: On-chain analyst @EmberCN first reported the suspicious activity. Hacker’s Stash: Despite the laundering, the hacker’s wallet still holds a colossal 218,000 ETH. Value of Remaining ETH: This remaining ETH is currently worth approximately $486.6 million. Laundering Pause: ETH transfers and laundering actions have stopped since 06:00 UTC yesterday. Why is ETH Laundering a Major Concern in Crypto Security? Cryptocurrency, while offering decentralization and transparency through blockchain technology, is not immune to illicit activities. ETH laundering , in this context, refers to the process by which hackers attempt to conceal the origins of illegally obtained Ethereum. This often involves a series of complex transactions across multiple wallets and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to break the traceable link back to the original source of the stolen funds. Challenges of ETH Laundering in Crypto Security: Obfuscation of Funds: Laundering makes it significantly harder for law enforcement and exchanges to track and recover stolen assets. Enables Further Criminal Activity: Successfully laundered funds can be used to finance other illegal activities, further harming the crypto ecosystem’s reputation. Erosion of Trust: High-profile incidents of crypto security breaches and subsequent laundering erode trust in digital assets among potential investors and the general public. Regulatory Scrutiny: Such events often lead to increased regulatory pressure on the cryptocurrency industry, potentially stifling innovation. Understanding the Scale of the Bybit Hack and Remaining Funds The fact that the Bybit hack resulted in the theft of such a large amount of Ethereum is concerning. Even after laundering $32.2 million, the hacker’s wallet still contains a staggering $486.6 million in ETH. This massive remaining balance underscores the scale of the initial security breach and the potential ongoing threat. Let’s put the numbers into perspective: Metric Value ETH Laundered (Past 24 Hours) 14,300 ETH Value of Laundered ETH $32.2 Million ETH Remaining in Hacker’s Wallet 218,000 ETH Value of Remaining ETH $486.6 Million These figures highlight the urgent need for robust crypto security measures within exchanges and the broader blockchain infrastructure. Incidents like the Bybit hack serve as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that exist and the sophistication of malicious actors in the crypto space. What Does This Mean for Ethereum and the Blockchain Ecosystem? The incident of ETH laundering following the Bybit hack has broader implications for the Ethereum network and the entire blockchain ecosystem. It emphasizes the critical importance of ongoing vigilance and improvements in security protocols across all platforms handling digital assets. Impact on Ethereum and Blockchain: Need for Enhanced Security: Exchanges and wallet providers must continually upgrade their security infrastructure to prevent breaches. Improved On-Chain Monitoring: Advanced analytics and monitoring tools are crucial for detecting and tracking suspicious transactions in real-time. Collaboration is Key: Exchanges, blockchain analysis firms, and law enforcement agencies need to collaborate effectively to combat crypto crime. User Awareness: Educating users about crypto security best practices, such as using strong passwords and being wary of phishing attempts, is essential. Actionable Insights: Protecting Yourself in the Crypto World While large-scale exchange hacks are beyond the control of individual users, there are proactive steps you can take to enhance your own crypto security and protect your assets: Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Employ robust and unique passwords for all your crypto accounts. Consider using a password manager. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Always activate 2FA for an extra layer of security on your exchange and wallet accounts. Be Cautious of Phishing: Be wary of suspicious emails, links, and messages that may be attempts to steal your login credentials or private keys. Use Hardware Wallets: For long-term storage of significant crypto holdings, consider using a hardware wallet for cold storage. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest crypto security news and best practices to stay ahead of potential threats. Conclusion: Crypto Security – A Constant Battle The Bybit hack and subsequent ETH laundering incident serve as a stark reminder that crypto security is an ongoing battle. As the digital asset space evolves, so too do the tactics of cybercriminals. Exchanges, developers, and users must remain vigilant, proactive, and collaborative in strengthening security measures to safeguard the future of cryptocurrency. The sheer scale of the remaining funds in the hacker’s wallet – nearly half a billion dollars – underscores the urgency and importance of addressing these vulnerabilities head-on. The crypto world must learn from these incidents and continuously innovate in security to build a safer and more trustworthy ecosystem.

Meanwhile, the rising dominance of memecoins raised some concerns, as a couple of rug pulls adversely impacted the SOL price rally. The selling pressure escalated heavily over the token, which prevented the bulls from reviving a notable rebound. The SOL price experienced a strong upswing, preventing the token from dropping below a pivotal support zone at $133. Now the question arises: whether the latest rebound can be considered as a trend reversal or if it’s a trap laid for the bulls. One of the major reasons for the recent upswing is said to be a huge whale activity. As per the update shared by LookonChian, whales withdrew a massive amount of SOL from a popular CEX, Binance, worth over $7.5 million. https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1895496538488758713 With this, the SOL price quickly gained momentum as the market participants became hopeful of the next price action. The token surged above the psychological resistance at $145 but failed to clear the $150 range. Now, when the price is holding above the resistance-turned-support at $145, yet another whale activity occurred, which may circulate bearish clouds over the token. Lookonchain shared another update wherein 5 whale accounts unstaked 5.52 million SOL worth $810 million in the past 12 hours. Among them, 3.54 million SOL was deposited into Coinbase Prime. With this, the possibility of a major selling pressure hovers over the token, as whenever the whales move such a huge amount of crypto to CEXs, it heavily alters the value of the token. So, what’s next for the SOL price rally? Solana (SOL) Price Analysis The Solana price witnessed a massive pullback in the past few weeks that dragged the levels by more than 57% from the highs. Meanwhile, the whale accumulation is seen to have changed the trajectory of the token. However, the growth trajectory does not appear to be strong enough, which suggests that the SOL price may undergo an extended consolidation between $138 and $145 for a while. As seen in the above chart, the SOL price has triggered a rebound from the local lows close to $125. However, the upswing appears to be short-lived, as the bulls failed to push the price beyond the pivotal resistance but helped to keep up the trend above the pivotal support. On the other hand, the RSI displayed bearish divergence while the CMF failed to rise above 0, suggesting the bulls are holding significant strength regardless of the rebound. Being a little diverse, the MACD shows a drop in the selling volume while the levels are heading towards a bullish crossover. Therefore, the Solana (SOL) price is believed to remain consolidated for a while, and if the MACD undergoes a bullish crossover, the price could experience a notable rise. Until then, the token may remain within an accumulation phase.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|SOL|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-01 07:46:03

CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has ignited a firestorm of discussion by proclaiming that Strategy stock (MSTR), formerly MicroStrategy, is significantly undervalued . This isn’t just casual market chatter; it’s a strong statement from a respected figure in blockchain analytics, hinting at a potentially lucrative opportunity for savvy investors. Let’s dive deep into why Ki Young Ju believes Strategy stock is a steal and what this could mean for the future of crypto-related investments. Why Does CryptoQuant CEO See Strategy Stock as Undervalued? Ki Young Ju, the head honcho at CryptoQuant CEO , didn’t mince words. His recent post on X (formerly Twitter) stating that Strategy stock is undervalued has sent ripples through both the crypto and traditional finance communities. But what’s the rationale behind such a confident assertion? It stems from a comparison with the tech titans known as the “Magnificent 7” and a deep understanding of Strategy ‘s unique position in the market. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors fueling this undervalued crypto narrative: Bitcoin Exposure: Strategy , under the leadership of its former CEO Michael Saylor , has become synonymous with Bitcoin. It holds a massive amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet, making it a publicly traded company with significant exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. As Bitcoin’s price fluctuates, so does the perceived value of Strategy . Magnificent 7 Comparison: Michael Saylor himself alluded to the potential of Strategy surpassing even the “Magnificent 7” – a group comprising Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, Alphabet, and Tesla. These companies are market giants, but Saylor’s bold claim suggests he sees Strategy on a similar trajectory, especially considering its Bitcoin strategy. Market Perception Lag: The traditional stock market may not fully grasp the implications of Strategy ‘s Bitcoin-centric approach. This lag in understanding could be contributing to the stock being undervalued . CryptoQuant CEO ‘s statement might be a wake-up call for investors to re-evaluate Strategy in the context of the evolving digital asset landscape. Potential for Bitcoin Upside: If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, then Strategy stock becomes an indirect, yet accessible, way to gain exposure in the traditional stock market. Should Bitcoin’s value surge, Strategy ‘s holdings would appreciate significantly, potentially driving its stock price upwards. This future growth potential might not be fully priced in currently, leading to the undervalued assessment. At the close of trading on Friday, Strategy ’s stock price (MSTR) stood at $255.58. Is this price point truly reflective of the company’s potential, especially considering its massive Bitcoin holdings and the bullish outlook from figures like CryptoQuant CEO and Michael Saylor ? Decoding Michael Saylor’s “Magnificent 7” Challenge Michael Saylor , the visionary behind Strategy ‘s bold Bitcoin adoption, has never been one to shy away from ambitious statements. His post, “you need a @Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7,” isn’t just marketing bravado. It’s a calculated assertion rooted in his belief in Bitcoin’s transformative power and Strategy ‘s unique positioning. Let’s unpack what Michael Saylor might mean by this challenge: Beyond Tech Growth: The “Magnificent 7” are predominantly tech companies, driven by innovation in software, hardware, and digital services. Saylor might be suggesting that the next wave of significant growth will be driven by digital assets and the companies strategically positioned within this space, like Strategy . Bitcoin as the Ultimate Asset: Saylor is a staunch Bitcoin maximalist. He views Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value and a superior asset class compared to traditional commodities and even some equities in the long run. By aligning Strategy so closely with Bitcoin, he’s betting on this long-term appreciation to outpace even the impressive growth of the “Magnificent 7”. A Different Kind of Value Proposition: While the “Magnificent 7” generate value through products and services, Strategy ‘s value proposition is intrinsically linked to Bitcoin’s performance. Saylor might be arguing that in an increasingly digital and inflation-conscious world, this form of value – tied to a decentralized, scarce digital asset – will become increasingly sought after and ultimately more valuable than traditional tech growth metrics alone. Disrupting the Status Quo: Saylor and Strategy are disruptors. They’ve challenged conventional corporate treasury management by embracing Bitcoin. This disruptive approach, Saylor implies, is the “strategy” needed to outperform even the most successful companies of the current era. While directly comparing Strategy to the “Magnificent 7” in terms of market capitalization and revenue might seem premature today, Michael Saylor ‘s vision is about future potential and the long game. CryptoQuant CEO ‘s undervalued assessment adds weight to this narrative, suggesting that the market might be underestimating Strategy ‘s long-term trajectory. Analyzing MSTR Stock: Is it Really Undervalued Crypto? To determine if MSTR stock truly represents undervalued crypto exposure, we need to look beyond the headlines and delve into some key analytical points: Bitcoin Holdings as a Primary Value Driver: Strategy ‘s value is heavily dependent on its Bitcoin holdings. Therefore, assessing Bitcoin’s future price trajectory is crucial when evaluating MSTR stock . Bullish on Bitcoin? Then MSTR stock might indeed be undervalued if Bitcoin’s potential upside isn’t fully reflected in the current stock price. Premium or Discount to NAV (Net Asset Value): Investors should analyze whether MSTR stock is trading at a premium or discount to its Net Asset Value, primarily driven by its Bitcoin holdings. An undervalued scenario would suggest a discount, meaning you’re getting Bitcoin exposure at a potentially lower price than buying Bitcoin directly (indirectly through the stock). Market Sentiment and Volatility: Both the crypto market and MSTR stock are known for volatility. Market sentiment can swing wildly, impacting valuations. Understanding the current market sentiment towards both Bitcoin and MSTR stock is essential to gauge if the undervalued perception is justified or merely a temporary dip. Company Performance Beyond Bitcoin: While Bitcoin is central, Strategy also has a software business. Analyzing the performance of this core business provides a more holistic view of the company’s financial health and potential beyond just crypto asset appreciation. A strong core business can further strengthen the argument for MSTR stock being undervalued . It’s crucial to remember that investing in MSTR stock is not the same as directly investing in Bitcoin. MSTR stock is subject to stock market dynamics, company-specific risks, and overall market sentiment, in addition to Bitcoin price fluctuations. However, for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure within the traditional stock market, MSTR stock , if truly undervalued as CryptoQuant CEO suggests, could present a compelling opportunity. Actionable Insights: Is Now the Time to Consider Strategy Stock? So, what should investors take away from CryptoQuant CEO ‘s bold statement and Michael Saylor ‘s ambitious comparison? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on opinions, even from respected figures. Conduct thorough research on Strategy (MSTR), Bitcoin’s potential, and the overall market conditions. Understand the risks and rewards involved. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Investing in MSTR stock , due to its Bitcoin correlation, carries inherent volatility. Ensure your risk tolerance aligns with the potential fluctuations in both the stock and crypto markets. Compare to Direct Bitcoin Investment: Consider if direct Bitcoin investment or exposure through other crypto investment vehicles better suits your portfolio strategy. MSTR stock offers a unique avenue, but it’s not the only one. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep a close eye on market sentiment surrounding both Bitcoin and MSTR stock . News, regulatory developments, and broader economic trends can significantly impact valuations. Consult a Financial Advisor: If you’re unsure about incorporating MSTR stock or crypto exposure into your portfolio, seek advice from a qualified financial advisor. They can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation and investment goals. Conclusion: The Undervalued Potential of Strategy Stock in the Crypto Era The assertion from CryptoQuant CEO that Strategy stock (MSTR) is undervalued is more than just market noise. It’s a compelling argument rooted in Strategy ‘s unique Bitcoin strategy, Michael Saylor ‘s visionary outlook, and the potential for the market to re-evaluate companies deeply intertwined with the burgeoning crypto asset class.

A Critical Crypto Market Analysis,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-bitcoin-season-12/,"Is the crypto market currently favoring Bitcoin, or are altcoins taking the lead? The answer, according to the latest CoinMarketCap data, leans heavily towards Bitcoin. The Altcoin Season Index , a key indicator for gauging market sentiment, has signaled a definitive shift. Let’s dive deep into what this means for you and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Should You Care? The Altcoin Season Index is not just another metric; it’s a compass for navigating the volatile crypto seas. Think of it as a barometer that tells you whether the market winds are blowing in favor of Bitcoin or altcoins. Measured by CoinMarketCap , this index provides a score from 1 to 100, reflecting the comparative performance of altcoins against Bitcoin. Here’s a breakdown of what the index signifies: Altcoin Season (Index above 75): When the index surges above 75, it indicates a vibrant ‘Altcoin Season’. This is when at least 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It’s typically a period of heightened excitement and potentially higher returns in altcoins. Bitcoin Season (Index below 25): Conversely, when the index dips below 25, we enter ‘ Bitcoin Season ‘. This signifies that Bitcoin is dominating the market, with 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins failing to keep pace with its performance. This often suggests a flight to safety or renewed confidence in Bitcoin’s market leadership. Neutral Territory (Index between 25 and 75): An index value between 25 and 75 suggests a more balanced market, where neither Bitcoin nor altcoins are overwhelmingly dominant. Currently, the Altcoin Season Index stands at a mere 21 (as of March 1st, 00:45 UTC), a slight decrease from the previous day’s 22. This reading firmly places us in Bitcoin Season . But what does this mean in practical terms? Bitcoin Season in Full Swing: What Does it Actually Mean for the Crypto Market? A Bitcoin Season , as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index , isn’t necessarily a negative event for the crypto market as a whole. It simply signals a shift in market focus and capital flow. Here’s what typically happens during a Bitcoin Season : Bitcoin Dominance Increases: Capital tends to flow back into Bitcoin, often considered a safer and more established cryptocurrency, leading to an increase in Bitcoin’s market dominance. Altcoin Volatility and Potential Correction: Altcoins may experience increased volatility and potentially face price corrections as investors reallocate funds to Bitcoin. Focus on Bitcoin Fundamentals: Market attention often shifts towards Bitcoin’s fundamentals, such as network upgrades, institutional adoption news, and macroeconomic factors influencing Bitcoin’s price. Opportunities in Bitcoin Trading: Traders and investors might find more lucrative opportunities in Bitcoin trading during this period, capitalizing on its relative strength and momentum. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is dynamic. Bitcoin Season is not necessarily permanent, and market conditions can change rapidly. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season: Actionable Insights So, how can you navigate the crypto market effectively when the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season ? Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Assess your current crypto portfolio and consider your risk tolerance. A Bitcoin Season might be a good time to rebalance your portfolio, potentially increasing your Bitcoin holdings or taking profits from altcoins that have underperformed. Focus on Bitcoin Analysis: Pay closer attention to Bitcoin’s price charts, on-chain metrics, and market sentiment. Understanding Bitcoin’s movements is key during this phase. Selective Altcoin Investing: While it’s Bitcoin Season , not all altcoins will necessarily underperform. Look for fundamentally strong altcoins with unique use cases, strong development teams, and growing adoption. These might still offer opportunities even in a Bitcoin-dominant market. Manage Risk Carefully: Increased volatility can be expected in both Bitcoin and altcoins. Implement robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and diversifying your portfolio (even within Bitcoin and select altcoins). Stay Informed and Adapt: The crypto market is ever-evolving. Continuously monitor the Altcoin Season Index , market news, and on-chain data to adapt your strategies as market conditions change. Is Altcoin Season Over? Understanding Market Cycles The dip in the Altcoin Season Index to 21 raises the question: Is altcoin season definitively over? While the current reading strongly suggests a Bitcoin Season , it’s essential to understand that crypto markets operate in cycles. Just as Bitcoin Season emerges, altcoin season will likely return in the future. Market cycles are influenced by a multitude of factors, including: Market Sentiment: Overall optimism or pessimism in the crypto market significantly impacts capital flow between Bitcoin and altcoins. Technological Developments: Breakthroughs in blockchain technology, new project launches, and protocol upgrades can trigger shifts in market focus. Regulatory Landscape: Changes in regulations can impact investor sentiment and market dynamics, influencing the performance of both Bitcoin and altcoins. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, and interest rate policies can also play a role in shaping crypto market cycles. Therefore, while the Altcoin Season Index currently indicates Bitcoin Season , it’s not a permanent state. Savvy investors understand these cycles and position themselves to capitalize on both Bitcoin Season and the eventual return of altcoin season. Conclusion: Decoding the Altcoin Season Index for Crypto Success The Altcoin Season Index is a powerful tool for understanding the ebb and flow of the crypto market. Currently signaling a definitive Bitcoin Season , it highlights a period where Bitcoin is outperforming the majority of altcoins. By understanding this metric and its implications, you can make more informed investment decisions, adapt your strategies to changing market conditions, and navigate the exciting, yet often unpredictable, world of cryptocurrencies. Remember, staying informed and agile is key to long-term success in the crypto space.

According to data from Binance, BTC hit a low of $78,258, filling the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap between $78,000 and $80,000. Bitcoin Fills CME Gap, Is It Time For Rebound? With today’s dip, BTC has now filled every CME gap since March 2024. At the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is trading in the low $80,000 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits Its Most Oversold Level Since August 2024 – Is A Rebound Coming? For the uninitiated, the CME gap refers to the price difference that occurs on the CME Bitcoin futures chart between Friday’s closing price and Monday’s opening price, as CME does not trade on weekends. These gaps are often filled later as Bitcoin’s price naturally retraces to these levels, acting as key support or resistance zones. A new CME gap has now emerged due to the ongoing market sell-off, triggered by US President Donald Trump’s confirmation that trade tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico will take effect on March 4. According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, the new CME gap lies between $92,800 and $94,000. If past data is anything to go by, this new CME gap may work as a price magnet, pulling BTC upward and initiating a bullish trend reversal. For example, back in January 2021, BTC filled a CME gap between $29,410 and $33,050. After filling the gap, BTC continued to dip further, before surging to as high as $40,000. That said, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors remain significant. The US Federal Reserve (Fed) and Trump continue to clash over interest rate policies. While the Fed has maintained that it is in no rush to cut rates, Trump has repeatedly called for immediate reductions. However, positive inflation data could pressure the Fed to accelerate rate cuts. According to an X post by The Kobeissi Letter, January’s PCE inflation – the Fed’s preferred measure – aligned with its projection of 2.5%. Similarly, core inflation – which measures the change in consumer prices excluding volatile items like food and energy – was in-line with expectations of 2.6% as well. However, data from CME FedWatch suggests that the Fed is likely to keep interest rates unchanged at the March 19 FOMC meeting. Is The BTC Bottom In? Although BTC has fallen nearly 20% over the past month, some analysts believe further downside may still be ahead. A recent forecast from Standard Chartered suggests BTC could decline another 10% before finding support. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Showing Early Signs Of Bullish Divergence? Analyst Explains However, there are also signs that BTC may be forming a local bottom. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that sell-side pressure is easing, which could indicate that BTC is stabilizing. Additionally, the Cryptoasset Sentiment Index recently flashed a strong contrarian buy signal, further hinting at a potential price floor for BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $83,508, down 2.5% in the past 24 hours.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 463,000 followers on the social media platform X that payment tokens Litecoin ( LTC ) and XRP may soon be top market performers as they hold key support levels above recent low prices despite Bitcoin’s price collapse this week. “At this time, for the the first time in a while, select alts are holding their own against prior lows while BTC has nuked below its own relative range lows. Look for those alts that have held their relative lows on this drop; they may be the ones to lead the next rally. Great examples at the moment are LTC and XRP (you seeing a theme here?).” LTC is trading for $127 at time of writing, up marginally in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, XRP is trading for $2.15 at time of writing, down 1.6% on the day. The analyst also says that Bitcoin may trade sideways in the coming days before a breakout. “BTC tagged $79,000 and we are now seeing some relief. Only two levels that really matter from my perspective at the moment: local supply at $94,000-$99,000 and high timeframe demand just under $74,000. I suspect we form a base between these two levels over the coming days before a full-on reversal.” Source: Credible Crypto/X Bitcoin is trading for $85,070, up fractionally in the last 24 hours.

XRP price action also looks good on the daily chart, hinting at a reversal amid rising whale activity and positive skew. Moreover, many analysts expect Bitcoin to pause its crash over the weekend and potentially recover, adding credence to a Ripple (XRP) price rally that could hit $3 over the weekend. XRP Price Recovers as Bitcoin Selloff Pauses The selloff that weighed on Bitcoin’s price this week has cooled. BTC is back above $85,000, and most altcoins are trading in the green today. The global crypto market cap has also surged by more than 7% within 24 hours, hitting $2.93 trillion in market capitalization. Crypto Market Cap Crypto markets are historically more volatile on weekends due to lower liquidity. This can cause wild swings in either direction. Therefore, as traders bought the dip, it triggered a recovery for Bitcoin and altcoins . These market-wide gains have boded well for XRP price, which trades at $2.20 today with a 9% gain in 24 hours. Derivatives trading data and whale activity suggest that XRP price may extend this rally and potentially recover past $3. XRP Derivatives Trading Data Shows a Positive Skew The XRP order book shows that Ripple has flashed a bullish signal as traders place more bids (buy orders) than asks (sell orders). Moreover, there is a significant bid skew that is within 50% of XRP’s current price, suggesting traders are willing to buy at higher prices. This imbalance shows that demand for XRP is currently high, making it more likely for the price to rise rather than fall. According to analyst DOM on X, this bid skew has only happened 4 times over the past year. Each time it has happened, the XRP price registered a strong rally. XRP Bid Skew If Ripple price were to repeat this historical pattern and the bid skew proves to be another bullish signal, it could stir a rally towards $3 over the weekend. Ripple Whale Activity Flashes a Buy Signal Whale activity is crucial in determining accumulation and distribution phases and after the recent drop in XRP price, the altcoin may have entered another accumulation phase. Looking at past trends, a sharp drop in XRP price has often signaled a buying opportunity for whales. At the same time, a price rally has led to XRP whales selling . If this pattern repeats itself, these large addresses may start buying the bottom, which is likely to drive the price up. XRP Whale Activity However, if Ripple price continues to show weakness, whales may remain hesitant until the altcoin establishes a local bottom where these large addresses will start buying. Can XRP Price Reach $3? XRP can continue to rally and reach $3 if Bitcoin continues to recover and averts another selloff. Additionally, other catalysts like an end to the SEC vs. Ripple case could stir a 300% gain for XRP price in March . Analyst CRYPTOWZRD notes that XRP price has established support at $2. After bouncing from this level, traders can expect more upside past $2.80 to the next major target of $3.65. XRP/USDT: 1-day chart However, Ripple price is likely to continue tracking Bitcoin in the near term. Therefore, until Bitcoin establishes a strong support level within the $80K – $90K zone, XRP may continue experiencing wild swings.

Recently, altcoin faced one of the biggest declines in the broader crypto market crash. More is at risk, with whale moving $516M SOL to the Coinbase Prime exchange, raising fears of a potential sell-off. With it already facing resistance, let’s discuss the potential impact of this massive whale activity. Whale Transfers Shake Solana Market Amid Price Recovery Amid the broader crypto market downturn, the Solana price crashed to a multiple-month low of $126.11. With a 15% recovery over the last 24 hours, investors are eyeing a recovery, especially given the rising investor interest and high open interest of $4.63B per Coinglass data. However, the on-chain data reveals that whales were constantly on the move earlier for buying the dip and now for the profits. Recently, one Solana whale bought $14 million worth of SOL, withdrawing it from Binance and staking the tokens. However, other whales are on the opposite side, eyeing a profit on the recent recovery. This is because the on-chain data analytics revealed several large transactions of whales moving SOL to the Coinbase Prime exchange. This includes five whale accounts unstaking 5.52M SOL, worth $810M, and depositing $516M to the Coinbase Prime, fueling speculation that major whales are looking to offload their holding. This move can either take profit or hedge against a potential downturn as $2.06 billion worth of token unlocks to happen today. Solana Price Under Pressure: Will It Crash? The Solana whale transactions indicate that a potential sell-off might take place. More importantly, this could build selling pressure as the SOL price struggles to recover. Such selling can also introduce downward pressure, resulting in further declines. Additionally, the FTX distribution would add 2.2% supply (more than $1 billion SOL) to the Solana network, making it one of the biggest unlocks. Such events increase the liquidity of the token, impacting the price on a short-term basis. More unlocks are expected in the upcoming months, so the price can face turbulence. However, as the trading volume is 28% up to $6.4B and OI surged, this indicates investors building confidence. More importantly, it is unclear when the whale will sell, so that the impact may vary significantly. Key Levels to Watch Despite a significant recovery, the Solana price is struggling to maintain its bullish momentum. At the time of writing, it hovers around crucial support levels, trading at $143.91 with a market capitalization of $72.98B. The whale moves are building selling pressure around the token, and if this pressure intensifies, the price could drop to the $100 psychological level. The SOL price might crash to $70 in the worst-case scenario. In contrast, it might surge to $180 if the buyers stepped in. Therefore, $180.28, $201.47, and $206.75 are key resistance levels to watch. Bottom Line With the recent market crash, the whale activity is in its prime, either for buying the dip or taking the most profit. Five Solana whales also unstaked and deposited $516M of SOL tokens on an exchange. The SOL price might witness a temperory downtrend if they sold these due to increased selling pressure. Investors must monitor the whale movement, SOL token unlocks, and the key support level for better Solana price prediction analysis.

The XRP lawyer urged key SEC officials Hester Peirce and Mark Udeya as well as crypto czar David Sacks and crypto advisor Bo Hines for the Ripple case dismissal. In an X post , Deaton wrote, “As Amici counsel and on behalf of 75K XRP holders, Hester Peirce, David Sacks, Bo Hines, Mark Udeya, when Ripple?” US Court Drops SEC Lawsuit Against Hex Founder Notably, John Deaton’s X post comes on the heels of the US federal court’s dismissal of the lawsuit against the Hex founder, imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC alleged that Richard Heart accumulated over $1 billion through unregistered cryptocurrency offerings and $12.1 million through defrauding investors. However, the court countered that the regulators failed to demonstrate US jurisdiction over Heart’s crypto activities. In a February 28 court ruling, Judge Carol Bagley Amon stated, The alleged misappropriation occurred through digital wallets and crypto asset platforms, none of which were alleged to have any connection with the United States…To the extent the Complaint shows that Heart misappropriated investor funds through deceptive mixer transactions, those actions occurred entirely outside of the United States. The Hex founder’s lawsuit update and John Deaton’s statement come following the SEC’s dismissal of multiple crypto lawsuits involving Coinbase, Robinhood, Uniswap, etc. In a contrasting view, former SEC official John Reed Stark perceives these developments as a warning sign, suggesting that they may ultimately lead to the agency’s destruction. Following the court win, the crypto tokens like PulseChain (PLS), PulseX (PLSX) and HEX (HEX), which the SEC alleged were securities, surged significantly. Richard Heart celebrated the victory, coupled with the tokens’ rally. In an X post, he stated, “HEX has operated flawlessly for over 5 years. Today’s decision in favor of a cryptocurrency founder and his projects over the SEC brings welcome relief and opportunity to all cryptocurrencies.” John Deaton’s Long Battle for Ripple’s Victory Significantly, John Deaton began his crusade against the SEC in response to the agency’s allegations against Ripple, taking on a role as an advocate for XRP holders. He began his journey as an amicus counsel representing 75k XRP holders, filing a writ of mandamus to question the SEC’s jurisdiction and motives. Over the four-year lawsuit, he continued to support Ripple, arguing that the SEC’s claims were unfounded. Recently, John Deaton reflected on Ripple’s significant transformations over the past few years, especially since 2020, when the SEC filed the lawsuit. He credits Ripple’s successful court battles and Donald Trump’s re-election as key factors contributing to the optimistic developments surrounding XRP ETFs.

At the time of writing, Cardano and Solana are both having difficulty returning to their previous highs, with Cardano trading at $0.60 and Solana at $131.10. With more than 3,400 investors and more than $1.8 million already secured, MUTM is currently in phase 2 of its presale. Investors have a unique opportunity to enter the market before the price spikes 33.33% to $0.02 in phase 3. In a few months, Mutuum Finance should hit $3, offering investors a whopping 200x return. Cardano and Solana: Can They Reclaim Their Former Glory? Two of the most well-known cryptocurrency companies in 2021 were Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL), which saw enormous bull runs and hit all-time highs. Both are still having difficulty recovering as of right now. Solana is presently trading at $131.10, still well below its all-time high of around $258, while Cardano is trading at $0.60, a long cry from its $3 peak. Both projects have seen fierce competition and market changes as a result of the overall market slump, despite their ongoing growth and robust communities. Consequently, in search of more profits, investors are turning to Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The DeFi Investment Set for Explosive Growth Investors are flocking to purchase tokens before the price goes up as Mutuum Finance gains a tremendous amount of traction. Even though MUTM is just $0.015 and in Phase 2 of presale, demand is going through the roof. With more than 3,400 investors investing more than $1.8 million, the price will shortly rise 33% to $0.02, so it is the ideal time to invest before the next rise. When MUTM begins at $0.06, an investment today may yield 300% returns. And if expert projections are anything to believe, the token may reach $3, and early adopters may reap life-altering benefits. Revolutionizing Crypto Lending By granting consumers complete control over their assets, Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending. The site can let you access liquidity without selling your cryptocurrency or generate passive revenue as a lender. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending: Smart contracts automatically modify interest rates in response to market demand and manage loan pools. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending does not involve intermediaries. Instead, users are allowed to choose their own terms, interest rates, and collateral, creating a customizable, decentralized borrowing experience. With this dual-lending system, Mutuum Finance improves the efficiency, transparency, and usability of lending and borrowing. The first priority is security. To provide full openness for investors, the team is dedicated to open-source smart contract technology and third-party audits. Staking MUTM tokens is another way for consumers to get additional passive revenue. In order to increase liquidity and solidify its place in the DeFi market, Mutuum Finance intends to grow to other blockchain networks, including non-EVM chains. $100,000 Giveaway for Early Investors To celebrate its growing number of users, Mutuum Finance is giving away $100,000 of MUTM tokens! 10 lucky winners will each receive $10,000,a gesture to thank early birds and keep things active as the project continues toward its launch. Whereas Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) are yet to reach their all-time highs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast taking center stage. It is among the most hopeful cryptocurrency options due to its new loan concept, prosperous presale, and monster growth potential. With estimated profits of 200x, early investors will be able to get in at a paltry $0.015 per token before the price shoots up to $0.02 in Phase 3. This might just be a game-changer. Get into presale right now to secure your share before the next price surge happens—don’t miss this opportunity! Also, don’t miss the $100,000 early supporter incentive.

Good Crypto to Invest In Before Its Q2 2025 Mainnet as Chainlink Gains Momentum & Algorand Climbs 13%",https://thecoinrise.com/qubetics-aims-for-16791-roi-good-crypto-to-invest-in-before-its-q2-2025-mainnet-as-chainlink-gains-momentum-algorand-climbs-13/,"Ever feel like you’re watching crypto prices skyrocket, wishing you got in earlier? Chainlink is eyeing a bullish breakout, Algorand has jumped 13%, and the market is heating up. But the real game-changer? Qubetics ($TICS), the world’s first Web3 Aggregator, is revolutionizing cross-border payments and raking in millions during its presale. With over $14.2M already raised and 21,600+ holders, Qubetics is positioning itself as the next big thing before its Q2 2025 mainnet launch. Analysts are calling it one of the best cryptos to invest in, predicting a staggering 16,791% ROI if $TICS hits $15 after the mainnet goes live. Could this be your chance to buy in before the next 100x move? QUBETICS: REVOLUTIONIZING CROSS-BORDER TRANSACTIONS Sending money across borders has always been a slow, expensive mess. Banks slap on high fees, delays, and hidden charges, making transactions frustrating for businesses and individuals alike. But Qubetics changes the game by offering instant, near-zero-cost cross-border payments using blockchain. Picture this: A small business owner in the U.S. needs to pay a supplier in Asia. Normally, they’d deal with SWIFT transfer delays, high conversion fees, and bank intermediaries. With Qubetics, they send the payment in seconds, directly from wallet to wallet, with no third-party interference. Or imagine a remote freelancer in Europe working with U.S. clients. Traditional payment platforms eat away at their earnings with processing fees and conversion rates. But Qubetics’ blockchain-powered system lets them receive payments instantly, with no middlemen taking a cut. This is why Qubetics is a good crypto to invest in —it’s solving real-world financial problems that legacy banks have ignored for decades. QUBETICS PRESALE: TIME IS RUNNING OUT If you missed Ethereum at $1 or Solana under $5, you might not want to sit this one out. Qubetics is currently in Stage 23 of its presale, with each stage lasting just 7 days before the price jumps by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM. Here’s where things stand: Total Raised: Over $14.2M Current Price: $0.0888 Total Holders: Over 21,600 Tokens Sold: Over 491 million $TICS Analysts are bullish on Qubetics, predicting: $TICS at $0.25 (presale end) → 181.52% ROI $TICS at $1 (after presale) → 1,026.09% ROI $TICS at $15 (after mainnet launch) → 16,791.32% ROI That means a $1,000 investment today at $0.0888 would buy 11,261 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits $10 post-mainnet, that bag could be worth $112,610—and if it reaches $15, you’re looking at $168,000. With the mainnet launching in Q2 2025, this crypto presale isn’t just another hype train—it’s a real opportunity. Join the Qubetics presale today before the next price jump! CHAINLINK: IS A MAJOR BREAKOUT COMING? Chainlink (LINK) has been stuck in a corrective phase, but recent bullish momentum suggests a turning point is near. After bouncing off support at $14.50, LINK has been climbing, with traders eyeing $20.45 as a key breakout level. Technical analysis shows a WXY corrective structure on the 4-hour chart, hinting that the downtrend may be ending. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved out of oversold territory, indicating a shift in market sentiment. If LINK breaks above the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $20.45, it could trigger a massive rally, with $18.01 as the next resistance level. However, if LINK drops below $14.78, the correction could extend further. For now, bulls are in control, and Chainlink is looking strong. ALGORAND SURGES 13%—IS MORE UPSIDE COMING? Algorand (ALGO) has been on a strong upward trend, jumping 13% from $0.2090 to $0.2375 in recent days. This bullish move comes despite broader market uncertainty, signaling strong community support and buying pressure. The price surge has sparked renewed interest among community members, especially as Algorand continues building its DeFi and enterprise partnerships. With growing adoption and solid fundamentals, ALGO could be gearing up for another leg up if market sentiment remains positive. However, technical indicators suggest caution, as overbought conditions could lead to short-term corrections before further gains. Whether ALGO can maintain its momentum remains to be seen. CONCLUSION: WHICH CRYPTO HAS THE MOST UPSIDE RIGHT NOW? Chainlink is flashing bullish signals, Algorand just rallied 13%, but Qubetics is in another league altogether. With a revolutionary cross-border payments system, a booming presale, and a 16,791% ROI target, Qubetics is easily one of the best cryptos to invest in before its Q2 2025 mainnet launch. Don’t wait until it’s too late—join the Qubetics crypto presale now before the next price increase!

Curious to know more details? Read on? CBI Seizes $2.75 M in Cryptos in Nationwide Raids In a press release , the CBI acknowledges the rumours that it has conducted raids in nearly 60 locations across India in connection with the infamous Gainbitcoin scam case – which was transferred to them for a detailed investigation by the top court of the country, the Supreme Court of India, after the registration of multiple First Information Reports across states in connection with the scam. Reports suggest that the raids have been conducted in several major cities, including Delhi, Pune, Nanded, Kolhapur, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Mohali, Jhansi and Hubli. As per reports, several important pieces of evidence, including 121 documents, 34 laptops and hard disks, 12 mobile phones and several email and instant messaging data dumps, have been seized during the raids. The press release of the CBI confirms the reports that several crucial documents and electronic devices have been seized during the raid. Importantly, reports state that the central agency has seized cryptocurrencies worth no less than $2.75 million during the raids. Gainbitcoin Scam: How It Defrauded Investors It was in 2015 that the infamous Gainbitcoin Ponzi scheme was launched. As mentioned above, it was alleged that Amit Bharadwaj (deceased) and Ajay Bhradwaj played a crucial role in orchestrating this fraud scheme. Like every successful Ponzi scheme, the Gainbitcoin scheme also attracted people with a massive monthly return. It promised investors a striking monthly return of 10% on BTC investments for 18 months. Initially, everything worked smoothly. Naturally, it helped the scammers attract more victims. Its multi-level marketing model complemented its growth and expansion significantly. The collapse commenced when withdrawals were suspiciously switched to an in-house cryptocurrency, MCAP. In 2018, Amit Bharadwaj and his team, including Ajay Bhradwaj, Nikunj Jain and Sahil Baghla, were booked in connection with the scam, and produced before a special court. Multiple FIRs were registered across the country in connection with the scam in a very short span of time. Considering the severity and nature of the crime, the Supreme Court directed the CBI to launch a detailed investigation into this matter. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Intriguingly, the price surge comes alongside a whopping 389 million SHIB token burn in February, per recent burn metrics. As an upshot, market watchers anticipate that a breakout for the meme coin looms, with analysts also forecasting the same. Shiba Inu Price Bullish Amid Massive 389M Burn As of press time, Shiba Inu price pumped nearly 6% and exchanged hands at $0.00001393. The leading meme coin bottomed and topped at $0.00001301 and $0.00001412 in the past 24 hours. While this bullish action fell in line with the broader crypto market’s recent recovery-like trend, it’s worth taking into account the massive token burn. According to metrics revealed by the official tracker Shibburn on March 1, a staggering 389.18 million tokens were burnt the previous month, February. This surge in the burn rate indicates that the meme coin’s circulating supply is further shredded. Source: Shibburn, X In turn, market watchers remain bullish about the asset’s future performance, abiding by the law of supply and demand. For context, the burn mechanism sends tokens to a null address, permanently removing them from the supply. As a result, the circulating supply diminished and totaled 584.32 trillion, with the massive burn rate surge constantly dealing blows to it. How Much SHIB Burnt To Date? Shibburn’s statistics indicated that a staggering 410.72 trillion coins have been removed from the supply to date. Intraday data revealed that 14 million coins were burnt. As a result, market watchers continue to weigh optimism over Shiba Inu price’s long-term performance. SHIB ETF Speculations Build Up On the other hand, SHIB marketing lead Lucie took to X on February 27, stating, “Wen SHIB ETF?” This statement has set off waves of speculations across the broader market as meme coin-backed ETPs have been in the trends lately. Notably, dog-themed meme crypto Dogecoin has secured a vital milestone in this field. CoinGape reported that Grayscale Investments, CoinShares, and WisdomTree have submitted applications for DOGE ETF approval . The U.S. SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s filing, with approval odds gaining substantial weight in recent days. This broader development has fueled hope for other meme coin-backed ETFs, such as a potential SHIB ETF. Shiba Inu’s price could substantially leverage this, given the market sees such a feat ahead. Market Analyst Forecasts Bullish Outlook For SHIB Price If Buyers Step In Simultaneously, renowned analyst ‘Rose Premium Signals’ posted on X, spotlighting the crucial support of $0.00001461 for SHIB price. As per the analyst, if buyers step in now, the meme coin could see a bullish movement toward the resistance of $0.00002941 and $0.00003738. Source: Rose Premium Signals, X Further, the highly bullish target remains $0.00004401, per the analyst. Overall, traders and investors extensively eye the token amid a recovery-like trend and token burns, The constant SHIB burns continue to bolster the crypto’s tokenomics, urging the price to move upwards.

The world's largest cryptocurrency has fallen 28% from its all-time high of $109,241 reached on Jan. 20, a dramatic pullback amid market turmoil and growing concerns over U.S. trade policies. The crypto market’s recent decline comes amid heightened risk aversion in financial markets, triggered by renewed tariff threats from US President Donald Trump. Trump announced that 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods will come into effect on March 4, and an additional 10% tax on goods imported from China. Beijing has vowed to take “all necessary measures” in response. Trade tensions have dampened investor sentiment, fueling a sell-off in stocks and risk-sensitive assets, with cryptocurrencies among the hardest hit. “Some of the big investors said at the end of the day, ‘you know what, I’m giving up now,’” said Zaheer Ebtikar, co-founder of crypto fund Split Capital. “There was definitely a lot more selling than usual, so it’s hard to pinpoint a specific exchange or location.” Related News: Binance Responds To Allegations That It Sells Altcoins And Drags The Market Down With Its Sales Bitcoin’s decline pushed it below key technical levels that investors have been watching for signs of a potential reversal. BTC fell below its 200-day moving average for the first time since October, while the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) entered oversold territory for the first time since September. Traders are still waiting for Trump to clarify his crypto policies, including speculation about a potential Bitcoin stockpile, said Stefan von Haenisch, director of over-the-counter trading at crypto custody firm BitGo Inc. “Given the macro environment, it’s not surprising to see where we are,” he said. Market analysts are warning that Bitcoin could see even steeper losses if sentiment in stocks continues to deteriorate. “The real panic could still be ahead. There’s always another 70%+ crash in Bitcoin’s future,” MLIV Editor-in-Chief Mark Cudmore said in a statement. Cudmore highlighted the $72,000-$74,000 range as a potential technical crisis zone that could trigger another prolonged crypto decline. Ruslan Lienkha, head of markets at crypto platform YouHodler, suggested that Bitcoin could find support around $70,000, but warned against assuming the worst is over. “We could see that level only if there is a negative sentiment in the equity markets,” Lienkha said. *This is not investment advice.

Notably, this update comes amid the soaring buzz over the project among the market participants. Besides, the recent developments of the token also fueled speculations over the Pi coin price’s potential rally to $5 ahead. Pi Network Extends Deadline For KYC & Mainnet Migration In a crucial update, Pi team announced an extension for its Grace Period deadline , allowing users additional time to complete their Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and migrate their balances to Mainnet. A recent blog post showed that the deadline has been pushed to March 14, 2025, at 8:00 AM UTC , coinciding with Pi Coin’s sixth anniversary . According to the Pi Network, this extension is the last opportunity for users who have yet to verify their accounts. The decision aims to ensure inclusivity, enabling early Pioneers who have returned after Open Network’s launch to complete their migration . Meanwhile, the team emphasized the importance of this deadline, stating that any Pioneers who fail to complete the KYC process risk forfeiting most of their mobile balances. They explained that previous extensions had provided ample time for verification, making this the final chance for unverified users to secure their holdings. Why Pi Network Extended the Grace Period? Pi Network’s latest decision aligns with its commitment to inclusivity and fairness. The team outlined several reasons for this extension, highlighting key network goals: Reengaging Early Pioneers: Many users who contributed to Pi’s initial success have recently returned. The extension gives them a chance to complete KYC and migration. Ensuring Maximum Participation: The network’s strength depends on verified users. Allowing more Pioneers to complete the process fosters a healthier ecosystem. Addressing Corner Cases: Some users faced unique challenges in completing their migration. The extension serves as a remedy for those who still need time. Strengthening the Network: Pi aims to maintain a decentralized, verified ecosystem. The deadline ensures the network transitions smoothly into its next phase. Pi Network made it clear that while inclusivity remains a priority, this marks the final extension. Users must act promptly or risk forfeiting their balances. What Happens If Pioneers Miss the Deadline? Pi Network’s latest statement reinforces that failing to complete the KYC and Mainnet migration by March 14, 2025, will result in forfeiture. Unverified users will lose most of their mobile balance, except for Pi mined in the last six months before migration. To avoid this , users must: Submit their KYC application via the Pi Network app. Complete the Mainnet Checklist under the app’s ‘Mainnet’ section. Remind their Referral Team and Security Circle members to complete the migration. What’s Next For Pi Coin Price? Market speculation around Pi’s price continues to intensify as the network nears its full transition. Some analysts believe that increasing adoption, combined with a fully verified network, could drive PI’s price higher in the coming days. However, the crypto has witnessed volatile trading lately. Pi value today was down about 2% and exchanged hands at $2.22, after touching a 24-hour high of $2.36. However, unlike other cryptocurrencies that witnessed massive selloffs during the latest crash, PI was up around 170% over the last seven days. Besides, with speculations gaining momentum over Pi’s listing on Binance , market watchers anticipate robust gains ahead for the crypto. Notably, a recent Pi Coin price analysis indicates that the crypto might hit $5 if the bullish momentum holds among traders.

This week’s highlights included the Avalanche Foundation introducing the Avalanche Card, a credit card for users in Latin America and the United States. The card, which was announced in a statement to Cointelegraph en Español, strives to bring cryptocurrencies into use as a powerful tool for daily transactions. According to John Wu, president of Ava Labs, the card image offers a credit card-like experience, reflecting the growing popularity of digital assets. With Avalanche Card, the Avalanche network securely integrates a potential payment method within the Visa network, allowing users to spend their digital assets much more easily without jumping between platforms. With this initiative, users can use cryptocurrencies like USDC, USDT, Wrapped AVAX (wAVAX), and AVAX to buy goods and services online or at any merchant that accepts Visa. The card, which is also marketed toward freelancers and the underbanked demographic, focuses on financial inclusivity in Argentina – for instance- where some 30% of adults do not have access to traditional banking services. The Avalanche Card, backed by the widest acceptance network of Visa, simplifies access to decentralized finance (DeFi) and enables users to hold effectively in self-custody wallet addresses. Tether’s bets on LATAM by relocating to El Salvador Tether, the stablecoin giant, has moved its headquarters to El Salvador and plans to acquire big agricultural companies such as Adecoagro. Unlike other recent Tether news, the top stablecoin issuer is taking steps to ensure its survival in the face of potential existential threats from US institutions. According to Cointelegraph, Tether aims to create its stablecoin marketplace in a more favourable regulatory environment. Shopify’s development into fields including energy, AI, and agriculture may be viewed as a successful diversification strategy or a risky pursuit of growth. According to the report, USDT has the potential to become America’s digital haven as Tether expands throughout the region. The company’s activities may be influenced by regional economic and geopolitical factors, but its goal is to create a financial system based on blockchain technology for inclusion and development. Investing in Adecoagro is more than just a financial transaction; it is a commitment to connecting the digital and real economies. Tether faces regulatory obstacles and competition from new stablecoin entrants such as Circle and Paxos. Tether’s impact on Latin America’s financial future will demand regulatory certainty, notwithstanding the tough road ahead. Peru ranks third in LATAM crypto growth Peru has emerged as a major player in the Latin American bitcoin sector. According to Lemon’s most recent research , “Estado de la Industria Crypto 2024,” (State of the Crypto Industry 2024) the country ranks seventh in terms of cryptocurrency value received. The report shows that the country ranks third in annual growth within the area. This rapid ascension is being driven by developments in legislative frameworks, technical integration, and growing public interest in digital assets such as Bitcoin. According to Cointelegraph , several factors such as improvements to regulations, the development of technology and an ever-growing population interest in topics digitally owned (Bitcoin being one of them) caused this accelerated rise. According to the Lemon report, Peru achieved several milestones contributing to the expansion of the crypto landscape during this past year. The key point came with the implementation of interoperability, enabling local and foreign fintech to interact with Peru’s financial system.

The SEC had accused Heart of raising over $1 billion through unregistered cryptocurrency offerings and misusing $12.1 million for personal purchases, including luxury items and rare collectibles. Jurisdictional Challenges The dismissal was based on jurisdictional issues, with the judge ruling that Heart’s activities were not specifically directed at U.S. investors. The court noted that the alleged misappropriation occurred through digital wallets and crypto asset platforms that lacked a concrete connection to the United States. SEC’s Accusations The SEC had claimed that Heart promoted HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX with exaggerated promises of wealth, including statements suggesting that HEX could provide 38% annual returns. Additionally, the agency alleged that investor funds were used for extravagant purchases, including high-end sports cars, expensive watches, and unique auctioned items. Court’s Reasoning The judge ruled that Heart’s online promotional efforts were global rather than targeted specifically at the U.S. market. Furthermore, the SEC was unable to demonstrate that Heart engaged in financial transactions within the U.S. jurisdiction, weakening the foundation of the case. Heart’s Response Following the ruling, Heart’s representatives expressed relief, emphasizing that the decision was a step toward protecting legitimate crypto entrepreneurs from overreach by regulatory agencies. Heart himself acknowledged the challenges of winning a securities-related case against the SEC and welcomed the outcome. SEC’s Position The SEC has not publicly commented on the dismissal, leaving uncertainty about whether further legal actions will be pursued. Implications for Cryptocurrency Regulation The case highlights the difficulties regulators face in enforcing securities laws within the decentralized crypto industry. As digital assets continue to evolve, this ruling may set a precedent for future cases, influencing how regulators approach enforcement in the space.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-01 09:25:47

This upward momentum has given investors renewed confidence in the market. However, analysts caution that despite the rally, market indicators suggest the bottom may not yet be fully established. The Role of Spot and Margin Buying A significant portion of Bitcoin’s latest rally has been attributed to strong spot buying, as well as leveraged margin longs. Market participants have shown a growing appetite for risk, pushing prices higher despite broader market uncertainties. The influx of institutional interest has also played a role in the price spike, with large buyers accumulating positions amid market optimism. Potential Risks of Overleveraging While the rally has been impressive, there are concerns about overleveraging. High levels of margin trading can lead to sudden liquidations, which may trigger sharp corrections in Bitcoin’s price. If long positions become overextended, a market downturn could wipe out gains and create increased volatility. Macro Factors and Market Sentiment External economic factors, including inflation concerns, monetary policy shifts, and global financial uncertainty, continue to play a role in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Investors are watching central bank policies closely, as changes in interest rates and liquidity conditions could impact risk appetite in the crypto space. Key Support and Resistance Levels Analysts point to key technical levels that will determine Bitcoin’s next moves. If the asset fails to sustain momentum above the $85,000 mark, a pullback to lower support levels could be likely. Conversely, a breakout past resistance could pave the way for further gains, potentially pushing Bitcoin to $100,000 and into new all-time highs. Caution Amid Bullish Momentum Despite the optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s latest surge, experts urge caution. The market remains highly volatile, and traders should be prepared for potential corrections. While long-term sentiment remains positive, short-term fluctuations are expected, making risk management essential for those looking to capitalize on the current trend. Final Thoughts Bitcoin’s rally to $85,000 highlights strong demand and growing institutional participation. However, with leveraged positions rising and external macroeconomic factors at play, the market remains uncertain. Investors should stay vigilant, considering both the bullish momentum and the potential risks that could lead to sudden market reversals.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-01 09:27:19

While top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) experienced a brutal 31% correction in February, LTC staged a strong show, ending 1% on the green side. Market analysts believe that LTC can continue the rally further and surge past $200 levels by April. Will Litecoin Outperform Bitcoin in March? February 2025 turned out to be among the worst-performing months for Bitcoin (BTC) with a 17.3% correction, while Litecoin ended up 1% in the green. According to analytics platform Santiment, LTC price has risen 25% against BTC during the month, a notable divergence in a bearish crypto market. Amid the strong performance, Santiment also highlights a recent spike in LTC addresses and an overly bullish commentary for the altcoin in the last 24 hours. Analysts caution that these factors may signal a minor price retracement in the short term. Source: Santiment Litecoin ETF Demand Grows The surge in the network activity has been largely due to the growing optimism surrounding the approval of Litecoin ETF by the US SEC this year. Bloomberg has pegged the odds of such an approval to 90%, much higher than XRP ETF or Solana ETF. The potential approval of an LTC ETF reflects a growing trend in the cryptocurrency market. The success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have seen significant net inflows since their 2024 launches, has opened the door for additional crypto-focused investment products. While an ETF may not command the same level of demand as its Bitcoin and Ethereum counterparts, analysts believe that even moderate inflows could make it appealing. Will LTC Price Rally to $200? As of press time, the LTC price is trading 11% up at $127.70, however, the bulls still need to push it past the crucial resistance of $130 and sustain above it to trigger the next leg of the rally. As per the Coinglass data, the LTC open interest has surged 8.68% to $645 million. Also, the 24-hour liquidations have soared to $2.25 million of which $1.90 million is in short liquidations. Market analysts have mixed opinions, especially with Litecoin price’s recent surge despite the broader market crash. Some believe that the current bounce in LTC price is the outcome of short liquidations instead of fundamental shifts in market conditions. On the other hand, CoinCodex data shows that Litecoin can rally all the way to $224 by April 2025. Source: Coincodex Tight liquidity conditions have been the major reason behind recent crypto market pullbacks and will continue to influence Bitcoin and altcoin movements ahead. Apart from the current surge, there has to be a strong catalyst that can drive the LTC rally ahead.

The total market capitalization has reached $2.81 trillion, reflecting a 7.15% daily increase.

Recent market activity suggests growing momentum as digital assets trade near key support levels. Cryptocurrencies Price Prediction – Turn $500 to $50K With These Altcoins With Bitcoin pausing its crash over the weekend and other cryptocurrencies looking good, here are four altcoins to turn $500 to $50K. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL), a layer one altcoin, has seen notable momentum over the past year. After dropping to $131 on February 25, marking a five-month low, SOL has since experienced a recovery after a week. This follows other broader crypto markets seeing a rebound, with BTC surging by 10% in the past 24-hours. SOL has overcome the $140 support line in its current market position. SOL price experienced a 10% increase throughout the previous 24-hour period. Experts anticipate substantial cryptocurrency value appreciation while SOL represents a top altcoin position that will be significant during 2025. According to CoinGlass, the SOL derivatives market is showing positive momentum. The volume of trades has surged by 12%, reaching $14.86 billion. Open interest has also climbed by 9%, now at $4.50 billion. This increase suggests growing market interest and may have a bullish impact on Solana’s price, signaling a potential rise in demand and future value.

Speculation surrounding a potential DOGE ETF has fueled optimism, with analysts predicting further price growth. The crypto expert Ali observes DOGE price maintaining its position above key support areas that suggest further price increases next week. Dogecoin’s price outlook for the upcoming weeks is favorable, given the current signs of market recovery. Cryptocurrencies price predictions suggest that altcoins like DOGE could see substantial increases before March 31, 2025. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA), a proof-of-stake blockchain platform, shows signs of rebound. At the time of writing the ADA is trading at $0.6415, ADA has gained 8% over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency recently hit a support level before seeing a rebound. Analytical experts predict ADA will reach the $1 price target in the near future.

Currently trading below $82,000, the cryptocurrency has experienced a significant 24.6% drop. Amid this bearish trend, CryptoQuant contributor EgyHash has highlighted a troubling development on Binance that could further pressure Bitcoin’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Buying The Dip: $1.28 Billion Added Below $90,000 Bearish Sentiment Takes Hold EgyHash notes that Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, is seeing a steady rise in key metrics that indicate growing sell-side activity. According to EgyHash, the 7-day moving average of mean coin inflows into Binance is increasing, signaling that investors are making larger, more frequent deposits. This uptick in inflows often precedes heightened selling activity, as it suggests that more coins are becoming available on the exchange’s order books. Adding to this, the “Bitcoin: Exchange Inflow (Top10)” metric—an indicator that tracks the total coin volume of the top ten largest inflow transactions—has reached levels not seen in almost a year. This surge suggests that significant amounts of Bitcoin are being moved onto Binance, potentially with the intent to sell. EgyHash also points out that Binance’s Bitcoin reserves are climbing, returning to levels last observed in November of the previous year. A rise in exchange reserves typically reflects an increase in coins held by the platform, which can signal more selling pressure. Bearish Signals on Binance? Key Metrics Point to Rising Sell Pressure “Binance’s Bitcoin reserve has risen to levels last observed in November of the previous year, potentially indicating more selling pressure.” – By @EgyHashX Read more ⤵️https://t.co/vl4sDIxaKD pic.twitter.com/y7qB1D4IS1 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 28, 2025 Further supporting this view is the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, which reveals that sell orders currently outweigh buy orders, painting a bearish picture for the market. This accumulation of factors—rising inflows, growing exchange reserves, and a dominant bearish sentiment—could indicate that Bitcoin’s downward trajectory may continue. Examining the Role of Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) While sell pressure on exchanges is a significant factor, other indicators are offering a broader perspective on the market’s overall sentiment. Another CryptoQuant analyst, tugbachain, recently discussed the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric, which tracks the network’s unrealized profits and losses to determine whether investors, on average, are holding Bitcoin at a gain or a loss. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Suffer Massive Losses: $1 Billion Drained In Single-Day Outflow According to tugbachain, the NUPL currently sits just below the 0.50 support level. Historically, a reading below this threshold has coincided with bearish phases, while a recovery above it can suggest renewed buying interest. If Bitcoin’s monthly close for February exceeds this 0.50 mark, it could indicate a shift toward more optimistic price action, possibly encouraging long-term holders to re-enter the market.

Pi Coin’s decline comes as the broader crypto market faces a sell-off . Trump’s tariff policies are creating a mess in the global market. Reports suggest that institutional investors, including BlackRock, have been offloading Bitcoin and Ethereum, dragging down the entire market.

Technical analysis points to a possible recovery. Pi Coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 31.36, close to oversold territory. When RSI dips below 30, it signals seller exhaustion, meaning the price could soon bounce back. Additionally, PI’s price has broken below its Bollinger Bands’ lower line, a volatility indicator that suggests the coin is oversold and due for a reversal. Meanwhile, a Binance survey shows that 86% of participants favor listing Pi Coin on the exchange. A listing would boost liquidity, adoption, and global trading accessibility, which could significantly impact Pi’s price. If Binance lists Pi, a breakout above $3.67 could push it to new highs near $4.20. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Coin Price Prediction: Is $10 Possible After Binance Listing? , Key Levels to Watch Pi Coin needs to break above the $2.56 resistance level to trigger a rally toward its all-time high of $3—a 44% increase from its current price.

The news triggered an immediate bullish reaction, pushing BTC from $78,000 to a new intra-day high. Ethereum (ETH) and major altcoins like Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) followed suit, with increased investor optimism around potential regulatory shifts. Bloomberg reported that Trump is expected to discuss the future of digital assets, leading to speculation that the government may adopt crypto-friendly policies. White House just announced its first-ever Crypto Summit on March 7 Trump, top CEOs, big money – they’re all in the room This ain’t just another meeting, this is THE SIGNAL – Regulatory clarity – Mass adoption – Or just insiders front-running again?

BTC surged 8% to $86,500, while ETH and major altcoins also posted gains. Market sentiment is improving, but macroeconomic risks could weigh on prices. Trade Tensions & Inflation Data Pose Risks to Bitcoin Despite Bitcoin’s impressive rally, external macroeconomic factors could limit further upside. Trump reaffirmed 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports and imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, escalating global trade tensions. These developments strengthened the US dollar, making risk assets like Bitcoin more vulnerable to corrections. US President Donald Trump confirms that his administration plans to implement tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico from 2 April.

Core PCE, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, slowed to 2.6% from 2.9% in December. While the data aligned with expectations, it reinforced the likelihood of the Fed keeping interest rates steady, a factor that could dampen BTC’s momentum. Key Takeaways: Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China intensified global trade tensions. US PCE inflation slowed, with core PCE dropping to 2.6%, keeping rate cuts uncertain. Fed’s hawkish stance could slow Bitcoin’s rally, impacting its long-term trajectory. Bitcoin Rebounds as Experts Predict Key Support at $77K Bitcoin’s recent dip below $83,000 triggered short-term panic, with fears of a potential drop to $70,000. However, BTC quickly rebounded by over 4%, climbing back above $86,000. According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, Bitcoin is at a critical bull-bear boundary. He believes BTC’s bullish cycle will extend until April 2025, following its two-year market pattern. If demand remains strong, Bitcoin could continue higher, but weak buying pressure could drag prices lower toward $77,000 support. Bitcoin Climbs 4% as CryptoQuant CEO Dismisses Market Crash Speculation https://t.co/DDwdB3WBvl — Jestin Jibber © (@JestinJibber) March 1, 2025 Analysts also warn that Trump’s trade tariffs on European goods could increase market volatility, making Bitcoin’s rally less predictable in the coming weeks. Traders are advised to remain cautious, especially with leveraged positions. Key Takeaways: BTC rebounded 4% to $86,000 after briefly falling below $83,000. CryptoQuant CEO expects BTC to remain bullish until April 2025, with $77K as strong support. Market volatility remains high due to Trump’s tariffs on European imports Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook – March 1, 2025 Bitcoin is currently trading at $85,400, showing a 0.8% gain after hitting lows near $82,200. The 2-hour chart indicates BTC is testing key resistance at $86,500, aligning with both the descending trendline and the 50-period EMA ($86,000). If BTC breaks above $86,500, it could target $89,400 in the short term. However, failure to clear resistance may trigger another decline, with $82,200 acting as immediate support. A rejection at current levels could reinforce bearish momentum, potentially dragging BTC toward $78,100 or even $74,000. Bitcoin’s rally is fueled by Trump’s Crypto Summit announcement, but macro risks like trade tensions and Fed policy remain obstacles. Investors should watch $86,500 resistance closely—if BTC clears it, the next leg higher could take prices toward $89,400. However, failure to break out may lead to renewed downside pressure.

With the market facing uncertainty, many are shifting their focus to alternative investments with higher growth potential. One project gaining traction among investors is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi lending platform offering real financial utility. MUTM’s presale has already drawn thousands of investors, with its decentralized lending model providing a sustainable use case beyond speculation. Currently priced at just $0.015, early buyers see an opportunity to secure tokens before its expected surge post-launch. As Bitcoin whales look for fresh investment opportunities, many are betting on MUTM’s long-term potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Many big investors are diversifying their holdings in search of alternatives with high long-term potential as a result of the growing selling pressure on Bitcoin. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gained attention as a result of this change since it delivers more than simply speculation; its decentralized lending and borrowing approach gives real financial benefits. In contrast to conventional cryptocurrency investments, MUTM’s liquidity pools enable users to lend and provide assets while generating passive income. By guaranteeing constant demand, this approach gives the token a structured value as opposed to one that is solely determined by the market. Mutuum Finance is becoming a more popular option for investors that value stability and long-term profits over volatile assets like Bitcoin. The presale phase has been a major success, with over 3,050 holders and $1.54 million raised in a short period. The second phase is already 26% complete within 96 hours, signaling strong demand. Investors are buying in at $0.015 per token, knowing that the launch price is set at $0.06, already offering an automatic 4x return before it even hits exchanges. However, experts predict a much higher surge, with some expecting MUTM to climb to $1 or beyond, delivering over 65x gains. Why investors are Turning to MUTM Beyond the growing presale interest, investors are drawn to the platform’s real-world financial use case. Mutuum Finance enables users to access liquidity without selling their assets. Those who need funds can use their holdings as collateral, borrowing stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies while maintaining ownership of their original assets. This is particularly attractive to long-term holders who want liquidity without exiting the market. On the other side, suppliers who deposit assets like ETH or DAI into the protocol’s lending pools earn passive income based on the demand for borrowing. This model ensures a self-sustaining ecosystem, where both borrowers and suppliers contribute to the token’s utility. Adding to its long-term value, Mutuum Finance will introduce an overcollateralized stablecoin, further reinforcing its lending protocol. This stablecoin will be minted when users provide collateral, maintaining a decentralized and transparent value system without relying on centralized entities. With the presale progressing rapidly, early investors are securing MUTM at its lowest price before the next phase increases costs. If an investor invests $2,000 now, their holdings will automatically increase to $8,000 after launch; if prices continue to rise, this might reach $40,000 or higher, contingent on post-listing performance. Investors who participate in the presale have the opportunity to win MUTM tokens as part of Mutuum Finance’s $100,000 offer. The goal of this campaign is to encourage further involvement with the project while rewarding early backers. The official website has all the information on how to enter, and winners will be chosen according to certain standards. As Bitcoin whales shift their focus to promising DeFi projects, Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the most compelling investment opportunities of 2025.

Investors pulling out of crypto at an alarming pace,https://finbold.com/start-of-bear-market-investors-pulling-out-of-crypto-at-an-alarming-pace/,"While the cryptocurrency market is witnessing bearish sentiment, capital movement trends suggest more cause for concern, as investors appear to be becoming skeptical in the long term. Specifically, for the week ending February 26, cryptocurrency funds experienced a $2.6 billion outflow, marking the largest withdrawal on record, according to data shared by financial markets commentary platform The Kobeissi Letter in an X post on February 28. This outflow surpassed the previous record of $2.1 billion, set at the end of last year, by approximately $500 million. The sharp decline in investor confidence was particularly evident on February 25, when Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds ( ETFs ) saw a record single-day withdrawal of $1 billion, further exacerbating concerns about the market’s stability.

Bitcoin’s worst monthly close Adding to the bearish outlook, Bitcoin ( BTC ) plunged about 20% in February, suffering its worst monthly close since June 2022. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

However, BTC remains red on the weekly chart, down over 11%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Despite the short-term recovery, Bitcoin’s technical outlook presents a concerning picture. According to an analysis shared by cryptocurrency analyst Crypto Rover in an X post on February 28, the latest market conditions suggest that Bitcoin is more oversold than during the FTX collapse in late 2022, when BTC plummeted to $16,000. To this end, Bitcoin’s 90-day market and realized price gradient oscillator indicate that the current oversold reading is deeper than any point in the last five years, including the FTX-induced crash.

Possible shift in Bitcoin sentiment Looking forward, cryptocurrency on-chain analytics platform Santiment suggests a possible shift in market expectations. In an analysis shared on February 28, the platform stated that Bitcoin’s latest price swings have made for one of the most emotional weeks in cryptocurrency since the August 5, 2024, crash. While fear and greed are running high, Santiment observed that a clear pattern has emerged: the crowd keeps misreading Bitcoin’s every move. Bitcoin’s social media sentiment. Source: Santiment Data indicates that traders’ social media predictions have been consistently off the mark. When optimism surges and mentions of $90,000 to $95,000 increase, Bitcoin’s price tends to drop. Conversely, when fear takes over and discussions of $70,000 to $75,000 spike, Bitcoin immediately begins to rise. This dynamic has repeatedly played out, with traders chasing breakouts at the wrong moments and panic-selling just before rebounds. Regarding the cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index, the reading stands at 20, signaling extreme fear as of March 1, 2025. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index.

Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett cleared the rumors that have been spreading that the U.S. SEC might be considering dropping its appeal against Ripple. Will it or Will Not? Legal Experts Weigh In on SEC’s Approach The speculation began after the SEC’s Crypto Task Force recently held a closed-door meeting with legal experts Jason Gottlieb, Andrew Hinkes, and J.W. Verret on 24 Feb 2025. They submitted a document discussing how the SEC regulates digital assets and highlighting key legal issues. One of the key topics in the document was the Ripple lawsuit. The experts noted that the SEC called some cryptocurrencies securities without clear court approval. They also pointed out that judges have not fully agreed with the SEC’s stance on crypto transactions. Specifically, the document mentioned Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling, which stated that XRP’s secondary sales those made by regular investors are not investment contracts. This goes against the SEC’s claims and weakens its argument in the case. SEC Not Dropping the Case After the SEC meeting, some members of the XRP community speculated that the agency was preparing to drop its appeal against Ripple. However, Eleanor Terrett quickly dismissed these claims. When asked about it, she responded with a firm “no”, rejecting the idea that the SEC is considering backing down. She even added a facepalm emoji, showing her frustration with the misleading rumors. No — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) February 28, 2025 Current Status of the Lawsuit As of now, there is no official word that the SEC plans to drop its case against Ripple. Although the commission has withdrawn other crypto-related lawsuits, its fight against Ripple remains active. As of now, there is no confirmation that the SEC plans to drop its case against Ripple. Although the commission has withdrawn other crypto-related lawsuits, its fight against Ripple remains active. If the SEC were to drop its appeal, it would require further legal discussions with Judge Torres. For now, the case continues, leaving the crypto community watching closely. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While they continue battling for dominance in the altcoin market, traders are hyping Mutuum Finance (MUTM) instead. The new project is currently in Phase 2 of its presale at a price of $0.015. Early investors stand to gain a 300% return, as MUTM is projected to launch at $0.06. The project has seen remarkable growth, surpassing $1.6 million in funds raised and attracting over 3,100 holders in an unprecedented timeframe. Unlike XRP and SOL, which have already made big moves, MUTM is just getting started, giving investors a shot at getting in before the hype kicks in. Solana and XRP: navigating market challenges Solana (SOL) and Ripple’s XRP are two top performers in the market and both are facing challenges. Solana, known for being fast and cheap to use, has seen its price drop over 50% since January 2025 peaks. On the other hand, XRP is stuck in a legal fight with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over whether it should be considered a security, which has made some investors nervous. While Solana deals with price swings, XRP faces legal troubles, showing how different issues can affect cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance: the next big player in DeFi lending Mutuum Finance is changing the decentralized lending game with a dual-lending system that combines both the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model uses smart contracts to control the lending pools so that users can put their stablecoins like USDT into the pool and the borrowers can take crypto-backed loans using assets like ETH. On the other hand, the P2P model removes the intermediaries between the lenders and borrowers to enable them to come up with their loan agreements. This hybrid strategy improves the security, adaptability, and profitability of the platform, which enables liquidity providers to get up to 10% APY. Mutuum Finance is building a financial ecosystem for lenders and borrowers. By avoiding the middlemen, the platform reduces the costs of borrowing and increases the returns on the liquidity providers. With near-instant transactions, full visibility, and empowerment of users, Mutuum Finance is establishing itself as a new standard in decentralized finance. Security, stability, & long-term growth Security and transparency are the key principles of Mutuum Finance. The platform is set for third party audits and features open source smart contracts, enhancing reliability. Mutuum Finance is also preparing to launch a USD pegged stablecoin and a buyback policy using the platform’s fees to support the price increase. Advanced risk management protocols add another layer of protection, combining audited smart contracts with an innovative lending framework. This makes Mutuum Finance an attractive choice for both institutional and retail investors seeking stable, high-yield DeFi opportunities. Momentum is building fast, with more than 3,100 investors already on board. An unmatched opportunity for early investors Mutuum Finance’s presale is currently in Phase 2, offering a rare chance to secure MUTM tokens at $0.015 before the price gradually increases through 11 presale stages, reaching $0.06 at launch. Investors in this phase are positioned for a 300% return before the token even hits public trading. Analysts predict that MUTM could surpass $5 post-launch, making it one of the most promising DeFi tokens of 2025. Those who joined in Phase 1 have already locked in a 50% gain, with the total amount raised surpassing $1.6 million. $100,000 giveaway & community incentives To accelerate adoption and reward early supporters, Mutuum Finance is giving away $100,000 in MUTM tokens. Ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000, with additional rewards available through a referral program that encourages users to bring in new investors and grow the community organically. While market giants like Solana and XRP lose momentum at the top, a newcomer, Mutuum Finance, is quickly gaining. Joining the Mutuum Finance presale now, allows you to get in at the cheapest available price and position yourself for life-changing returns during the upcoming bull run. Invest now in phase 2 before a 33.33% price increase in the next one.

February 2025 has etched itself into the history books for all the wrong reasons. Imagine a month where the crypto world reels from a staggering wave of cyberattacks, leaving investors and platforms in disarray. That’s precisely what happened, according to a recent report from the renowned blockchain security firm, PeckShield. Let’s dive into the chilling details of this record-breaking month and understand the implications for the future of cryptocurrency security. Why Did February 2025 Become the Month of Crypto Hack Mayhem? PeckShield, a leading authority in blockchain security, dropped a bombshell report via their PeckShieldAlert X account, revealing that February 2025 witnessed an unprecedented surge in crypto hack incidents. The numbers are frankly staggering: a total of 20 separate attacks resulted in a jaw-dropping $1.51 billion in cryptocurrency losses . This makes February 2025 the most financially devastating month ever recorded in the crypto industry’s history. But what fueled this alarming spike? Was it a coordinated attack, or a series of unfortunate vulnerabilities exploited in quick succession? Let’s break down the key factors contributing to this crisis: Increased Sophistication of Attacks: Cybercriminals are constantly evolving their tactics. February may have seen the emergence of more sophisticated attack vectors, bypassing existing security measures. Exploitation of DeFi Vulnerabilities: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms, while innovative, are often targeted due to the complexity of smart contracts and potential coding flaws. February could have seen a concentration of exploits targeting these vulnerabilities. Human Error: Despite advanced technology, human error remains a significant vulnerability. Phishing attacks, social engineering, and insider threats can all contribute to security breaches. Market Conditions: While not directly causal, volatile market conditions can sometimes create an environment where attackers see increased opportunity, or where security protocols are inadvertently relaxed in the pursuit of rapid gains. While the exact reasons are still under investigation, the sheer scale of the losses demands a serious re-evaluation of blockchain security practices across the industry. The Bybit Breach: A Colossal $1.43 Billion Loss At the heart of this devastating month lies one colossal breach that dwarfs all others: the Bybit hack . PeckShield’s report pinpoints Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, as the victim of the largest single attack, resulting in a staggering $1.43 billion loss. To put this into perspective, the Bybit breach alone accounts for over 94% of the total losses in February! This incident is not just a headline; it’s a seismic event that sends shockwaves through the crypto community. Consider the magnitude: The sheer size of the cryptocurrency losses from the Bybit attack raises serious questions about security protocols at even established exchanges. While details of the attack are likely still emerging, it underscores the immense risks involved in holding and trading digital assets. The impact on Bybit users and the platform’s reputation will undoubtedly be significant. Beyond Bybit: Other Notable Crypto Hacks in February 2025 While the Bybit breach dominated the headlines, February 2025 also saw a series of other significant crypto hack incidents, contributing to the overall record-breaking losses. PeckShield report highlighted several other notable attacks, including: Infini: Suffering losses of $49.5 million. zkLend: Experiencing a breach resulting in $9.66 million in losses. Ionic: Falling victim to an attack with $8.6 million stolen. sujiYan: Reporting losses of $4 million. These incidents, while smaller in scale compared to the Bybit behemoth, collectively paint a grim picture of the heightened security risks in the crypto space during February 2025. The table below summarizes the top 5 hacks reported by PeckShield: Platform Losses (USD) Bybit $1.43 Billion Infini $49.5 Million zkLend $9.66 Million Ionic $8.6 Million sujiYan $4 Million What Can Be Done to Fortify Blockchain Security? The February 2025 crypto hack statistics serve as a harsh wake-up call for the entire cryptocurrency industry. So, what steps can be taken to prevent such devastating losses in the future and strengthen blockchain security ? Here are some crucial areas to focus on: Enhanced Security Audits: Regular and rigorous security audits of smart contracts, exchange platforms, and all crypto-related systems are paramount. These audits should be conducted by reputable third-party firms with expertise in blockchain security. Advanced Threat Detection and Prevention Systems: Implementing sophisticated intrusion detection and prevention systems, utilizing AI and machine learning, can help identify and neutralize threats in real-time. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Robust Access Controls: Strong authentication measures, including MFA, and strict access controls are essential to protect user accounts and sensitive data. Community Vigilance and Information Sharing: A proactive and collaborative approach within the crypto community is crucial. Sharing threat intelligence, reporting suspicious activity, and educating users about security best practices can create a more resilient ecosystem. Regulatory Scrutiny and Standards: Increased regulatory oversight and the establishment of clear security standards for cryptocurrency platforms can drive greater accountability and incentivize stronger security measures. Addressing cryptocurrency losses of this magnitude requires a multi-faceted approach, combining technological advancements, improved security protocols, community collaboration, and potentially regulatory frameworks. Conclusion: A Call for Heightened Vigilance in the Crypto World February 2025 will be remembered as a watershed moment in the cryptocurrency industry, but for all the wrong reasons. The record-breaking $1.51 billion in losses due to crypto hack incidents, spearheaded by the colossal Bybit breach, underscores the ever-present and evolving threats in the digital asset space. This alarming report from PeckShield should serve as a stark reminder to investors, platforms, and developers alike: security cannot be an afterthought; it must be the bedrock of the crypto ecosystem. The future of cryptocurrency adoption hinges on building trust and confidence, and that starts with robust and unwavering commitment to security. Let February 2025 be the catalyst for a new era of heightened vigilance and proactive security measures in the crypto world, ensuring that such devastating losses are not repeated.

The individual, Olumide Osunkoya, was alleged to have carried out his services in the United Kingdom between 2021 and 2022. In the ruling delivered by Judge Gregory Perrins at the Southwark Crown Court, Osunkoya will serve a jail term of four years for violating regulatory orders. The sentencing follows a plea made by Osunkoya in September 2024, where he pleaded guilty to the allegations against him. According to the authorities, he was charged with five offenses, with two offenses as the director of GidiPlus Ltd, and as a sole trader. According to authorities, the 46-year-old Osunkoya carried out his crypto ATM services between December 2021 and March 2022 across 28 different locations in the United Kingdom. He operated the machines under his company, GidiPlus, despite not being registered and recognized as a legal crypto ATM service provider. The company applied for registration in 2020 and was refused in 2021. Illegal crypto ATM operator bags four-year jail term In the statement released by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Osunkoya carried on with his services despite being refused registration, making his activity a crime under federal law. After his first warning, he transferred the machines from GidiPlus Ltd, operating a reduced 12 ATMs personally. The authorities mentioned that the machines and the business were created under a false name to evade detection. According to the United Kingdom authorities, Osunkoya failed to carry out standard checks to ensure that the machines were not being used by criminal elements in the crypto industry. The authorities mentioned that the rate at which criminals used the crypto ATMs to launder proceeds of crimes was alarming. Authorities mentioned that he used fake bank statements to pass the wealth checks of a crypto asset manager. He also attempted to use one of his fake names to incorporate a company in the United Kingdom. He was also charged with possession of criminal property, with regulators seizing £19,540 as proceeds from operating the illegal ATMs. The FCA added that he charged fees ranging from 30% to 60% on each transaction. In the hearing, Osunkoya was also charged with forgery, using false names and identity documents to carry out his illegal activities. The regulators also charged him with possession of criminal property. During the hearing, the FCA asked the court to approve confiscation proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act of 2002. The proceedings will seize all financial benefits he enjoyed during the span of his illegal activities. United Kingdom’s FCA warns about the dangers in the crypto industry According to reports, this is the first prosecution for an unregistered crypto activity in the United Kingdom. The prosecution is coming after efforts by the FCA, in partnership with law enforcement agencies, to remove illegal crypto ATMs at different locations in the United Kingdom. In 2023, the FCA recorded great success, removing 30 machines from 38 locations in the United Kingdom. According to a CoinATMRadar report, the number of crypto ATMs advertised in the United Kingdom has dropped from 80 in 2022 to none in 2024. The FCA still maintains its stance against crypto, warning the general public of the dangers of buying cryptocurrencies, and warning that they may lose all their funds in the process. The FCA has also published a list of suspected ATMs operating in the country without approval on its website. During Osunkoya’s sentencing, the Judge mentioned that it was not only a regulatory issue, because Osunkoya violated federal law by using a false identity to conceal his real identity. The judge also added that his actions were deliberate and carefully thought out due to the technicality of the plan and how he carried out his activities. FCA enforcement officer, Therese Chambers, also noted the impact of the prosecution, noting that it will send a clear message to other individuals carrying out illegal acts.

Once valued at $32 billion, FTX’s downfall was attributed to allegations of misusing customer funds to support its affiliated trading firm, Alameda Research. This led to a liquidity crisis, preventing customers from accessing their assets and culminating in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Initiation of Creditor Repayments In February 2025, FTX began its first round of creditor repayments, with a second round scheduled for later in the year. Creditors eligible for the next phase must verify their claims before receiving payments. Under the exchange’s recovery plan, the majority of affected users are expected to receive more than 100% of their claims in cash. Industry Reactions and Expert Opinions Industry analysts believe that the two-year repayment timeline, despite initial frustration, should be viewed as a positive outcome. Many had anticipated a much longer legal battle due to the complexities involved, including multiple jurisdictions, regulatory barriers, and legal negotiations. Challenges in the Repayment Process FTX’s multinational operations complicated the repayment process, requiring coordination across various legal systems. These jurisdictional challenges added layers of complexity, making the relatively swift resolution surprising to many. Impact on Creditors and Market Sentiment The repayment process has offered some relief to creditors and is seen as a step toward restoring confidence in the crypto industry. The ability to distribute funds relatively quickly, despite the scale of the collapse, demonstrates a level of accountability that is often lacking in similar cases. Lessons Learned and Future Implications The downfall of FTX has underscored the importance of transparency, regulatory oversight, and proper risk management for cryptocurrency exchanges. These developments could pave the way for stronger industry regulations and increased scrutiny over centralized platforms. While the collapse was a significant blow, the expedited repayment process is being regarded as a sign that structured recovery efforts can yield positive results in the face of financial disasters.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-01 10:40:00

As Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) is one of the largest U.S.-based crypto exchanges, its performance is affected by the performance of digital assets. As the market plummeted heavily, the COIN price declined. But how much further can it drop? Let’s discuss this. Crypto Market Plunge Drags Coinbase Stock Price Down Coinbase stock price is experiencing a sharp decline due to the broader crypto market crash. As the market cap of digital assets plummeted to $2.81 trillion from its earlier peak of $3.5 trillion, this exchange’s valuation was also affected. At the time of reporting, COIN stock trades at $215.64, having declined 10% over the last five days. Although the stock is recovering today (3.49% up), the fear of a further crash remains, as the stock’s overall movement shows further weakness. Coinbase Stock Price: Broader Stock Market Turbulence Amplifies Pressure Interestingly, along with the decline in the COIN stock price, the rest of the stock market is experiencing turbulence . The technology sector, especially the one linked to the crypto market, shows signs of instability. More importantly, high interest rates and regulatory uncertainty add a burden. Blind, an analytics platform, pointed out the downtrend in Tesla, Coinbase, Salesforce, and other stocks. However, the worrisome part is that these stocks have lost trillions of dollars in valuation over the last two months, generating fearful sentiments about the stock market’s downtrend. As it has not been long since the recent Stock market crash, the downtrend in COIN stock price and others are concerning. How Low Can COIN Stock Price Go? The COIN stock price has historically shown high volatility, with its year’s high being $298.22 in the middle of February 2025. Considering this performance, some analysts anticipated the COIN stock would hit $500 , but the cryptos’ downtrend brought a different outcome. If the crypto market correction deepens, the stock’s value might face additional pressure. However, other than that, analysts reveal that it has recently broken out of a symmetrical triangle, which could result in a massive decline to as low as $177. According to Ali Martinez , COIN could test its $170-$180 range, with its moving out of the summetrical triangle pattern. Adding this to the broader market selloff could push the stock even lower, potentially revisiting its 2023 low. However, if the crypto market recovers and gains bullish momentum, the COIN stock price might regain momentum, finding stability above $250. Conclusion Coinbase’s stock fate remains intertwined with the crypto market. However, regulatory clarity, such as the US SEC dropping the Coinbase lawsuit, and other macroeconomic factors are helping with the recovery. If the recovery stays maintained and results in strong uptrends, the Coinbase stock price might hit $250. In contrast, it might crash to $177.

Having experienced firsthand the thrill of investing in meme coins, I can tell you it’s not all about hype. One rising star in the crypto world is Dawgz AI , an innovative project using powerful trading bots to help investors maximize their returns. By leveraging Ethereum, Dawgz AI offers a fresh opportunity to capitalize on crypto growth, potentially outpacing Dogecoin as a serious investment. The future of meme coins might be more strategic than we thought! The Rise of Dogecoin: A Meme Coin’s Journey Dogecoin's price began its journey as a fun, meme-driven project, based on the Doge meme. At first, it seemed like just another joke in the crypto market, but something unexpected happened: Dogecoin caught the attention of both the crypto community and investors. Thanks to its low price and massive online following, Dogecoin surged in value, leading to explosive trading volume and growth. In recent years, Dogecoin's doge price has fluctuated wildly. From hitting a peak price during the 2021 bull run to experiencing major dips, Dogecoin's price history has been nothing short of dramatic. Despite its ups and downs, Dogecoin's market cap has grown significantly, and its influence in the meme coin world remains strong. Dogecoin’s Current Market Impact At the time of writing, Dogecoin's price continues to show resilience, with market analysts predicting further potential for growth. The current price of Dogecoin, while not at its peak price, still holds a solid place in the market, especially among meme coins. The trading volume remains high, indicating active trading and interest in Dogecoin. Many experts have weighed in on the Dogecoin forecast, and there’s a mixed outlook. Some predict steady growth, while others believe Dogecoin's price will experience volatility. Regardless, Dogecoin's doge price will likely be influenced by community engagement, market trends, and the growing crypto market interest in meme coins. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Can It Keep Up? When looking at Dogecoin price predictions, it’s important to consider market capitalization, trading volume, and historical performance. Dogecoin's price has been heavily impacted by social media trends and celebrity endorsements, so it’s no surprise that it’s often seen as an unpredictable asset. That said, many market analysts believe Dogecoin could see further growth in the next crypto bull run. Some estimates predict Dogecoin's doge price could increase significantly, but reaching the maximum value seen in previous years may be a stretch. For example, Dogecoin price predictions vary, with minimum and maximum prices for the coin ranging from conservative to more optimistic forecasts. Dogecoin's price could rise again, but it’s important to note that much of this potential hinges on the overall crypto market performance. What Affects Dogecoin’s Price? The Dogecoin price prediction hinges on several factors: Community Engagement: Dogecoin thrives on its vibrant community. If the community stays active and engaged, it could help Dogecoin's price grow. Meme Culture Influence: Meme coins like Dogecoin are heavily driven by internet culture. The hype around these coins plays a massive role in driving price action. Crypto Market Trends: The overall performance of the crypto market will play a significant role. If the market experiences a surge, Dogecoin's doge price could follow suit.

The Dogecoin price prediction for 2025 shows potential for steady growth, with market analysts suggesting a bullish sentiment depending on the overall crypto market performance. While Dogecoin's doge price could see price increases, it’s unlikely to reach its peak price from the past. Based on technical analysis, Dogecoin's price could experience fluctuations, but predictions vary. The market capitalization and circulating supply are pivotal in determining Dogecoin price movements, and own research is always crucial when making investment decisions. Can DOGE reach $10? Reaching $10 for Dogecoin seems unlikely, given its current price and market capitalization. Although the price of Dogecoin has seen impressive growth in the past, the minimum and maximum prices indicate a significant challenge for Dogecoin doge to hit that level. The maximum value Dogecoin has reached so far is well below $10, and considering the trading volume and market dynamics, the highest price is projected to stay much lower than that. However, price prediction models still see room for price increases in the future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? The price of Dogecoin fluctuates, so the value of $500 in Dogecoin doge depends on the current price. For instance, if the average price of Dogecoin is $0.05, $500 would buy you around 10,000 Dogecoin coins. As Dogecoin’s price can experience fluctuations, especially influenced by social media buzz or meme coin hype, checking the latest data before making a move is essential. Use technical analysis to forecast price action trends, but always remember that future results can be uncertain. Is Dogecoin projected to skyrocket? While Dogecoin's price could see price increases, it’s important to note that a skyrocket is uncertain. Market analysts predict that the doge price prediction will likely follow trends influenced by community involvement, social media buzz, and overall crypto market activity. As for the doge price forecast, some predict moderate growth, but reaching past peak price levels is challenging. With a bullish sentiment in the market, Dogecoin's doge price may grow, but for explosive growth, coins with more strategic potential ROI, like Dawgz AI, might be a better bet for investment decisions.

I’ve dabbled in a variety of coins, and from my experience, I can confidently say that Dawgz AI presents a more strategic and reliable opportunity. Unlike Shiba Inu, which often fluctuates based on trends and hype, Dawgz AI is powered by innovative trading bots that maximize ROI. With Ethereum at its core, Dawgz AI offers a way to engage with the crypto market without relying solely on speculation. It’s a smart bet for long-term growth. Next Crypto Bull Run: Why This Coin Might Be the Best Bet for Explosive Growth As the next crypto bull run looms closer, many investors are turning their eyes to the meme coin market. One such coin that has caught attention is Shiba Inu. However, as the Shiba Inu price prediction remains uncertain, a fresh competitor is positioning itself for explosive growth. Enter Dawgz AI - a new project with the potential to outpace Shiba Inu and other coins during the upcoming surge. The Rise of Shiba Inu: A Meme Coin’s Journey Shiba Inu began its journey as a meme coin, often compared to Dogecoin due to its internet meme origins. However, Shiba Inu's price quickly gained momentum, and it soon attracted a massive following. What initially started as a joke quickly became a serious player in the crypto market. Its popularity skyrocketed with the help of social media buzz, and its market capitalization expanded significantly. In fact, Shiba Inu’s price movements during the 2021 bull run were nothing short of impressive. With its average price seeing exponential growth, Shiba Inu's price reached a new peak price that stunned many in the crypto community. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Can It Keep Up? Looking at Shiba Inu’s price prediction, it’s clear that the future is uncertain. According to Shiba Inu's price forecast, many analysts expect moderate growth, but Shiba Inu’s rise to new all-time highs seems unlikely without a major market catalyst. A minimum Shiba price has been suggested in some forecasts, with analysts pointing out that Shiba Inu’s price might stabilize in the coming months. Several factors influence Shiba Inu’s price movements. The Shiba Inu coin relies heavily on its community and social media trends, so any major news or viral moments can push Shiba Inu’s price upward. Dawgz AI, on the other hand, provides a more structured approach to investing, using advanced technical analysis and trading bots to capitalize on market fluctuations. This is where Dawgz AI stands out. Dawgz AI: The Rising Star Ready to Outshine Meme Coins Dawgz AI is not just another meme coin - it’s an investment opportunity designed for long-term growth. Unlike Shiba Inu, which is largely driven by community hype, Dawgz AI leverages cutting-edge technology, including AI-powered trading bots, to enhance Ethereum-based investments. This gives it a strategic edge over coins like Shiba Inu, which often rise and fall based on social media buzz.

Why Dawgz AI is the Superior Choice While Shiba Inu has been a leader in the meme coin space, its reliance on community engagement and market hype makes it a risky investment. Dawgz AI, on the other hand, is built for long-term growth through AI-powered trading and Ethereum integration. Conclusion While Shiba Inu’s Shib price and Shiba Inu price prediction have gained traction in the crypto space, Dawgz AI stands out as the next big cryptocurrency for long-term growth. From my personal experience, Dawgz AI offers a more reliable investment opportunity. Unlike speculative coins like Shiba Inu, which rely on market cap and community hype, Dawgz AI uses advanced trading strategies that are backed by technical analysis. With its market cap steadily growing, Dawgz AI is primed for explosive growth, making it the better bet for anyone looking for serious, sustainable returns. FAQ How much will Shiba Inu be worth in 2025? The Shiba Inu price prediction for 2025 suggests it could see significant growth, but reaching new highs depends on market trends and trading volume. Analysts predict moderate growth, with some expecting it to follow a bullish trend, but factors like resistance and the overall crypto market could impact its price. Will Shiba Inu coin reach 25 cents? Reaching 25 cents for Shiba Inu coin seems highly unlikely due to its market cap and circulating supply. While Shiba Inu’s price might experience price increases, it would require extraordinary demand to hit this level. The potential ROI is more likely to be modest, with Shiba Inu's price constrained by various factors like resistance and market trends. Will Shiba hit $1 in 2040? While it’s difficult to predict the future, Shiba Inu hitting $1 in 2040 would require unprecedented demand and a significant growth in market capitalization. This would depend on the broader crypto market’s adoption and the growth of the Shiba Inu token’s use case. What is a realistic price prediction for Shiba Inu in 2050? A realistic price prediction for Shiba Inu in 2050 depends on the evolution of digital assets and Shiba Inu's price action. With long term forecast models, it’s hard to predict beyond the next few decades, but Shiba Inu could potentially see steady growth if it continues to gain adoption.

As the anticipation builds around this summit and the impact it will have on crypto prices, savvy investors are looking for altcoins that could deliver 100x returns. In this article, we identify the top 4 US altcoins that you can buy today for massive gains ahead of this event. US Altcoins to Buy Ahead of White House Crypto Summit White House crypto czar David Sacks has announced that President Trump will host a crypto summit at the White House on March 7. President Trump will speak at this summit where prominent crypto founders, executives, and investors will be in attendance. Per the statement, members of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets will also attend the summit. This meeting will deepen the ties between Trump and the crypto industry, which he promised to support during last year’s campaign trail. White House Crypto Summit This development has stirred excitement within the crypto community. Analyst Crypto Patel believes that it “could be a game changer for the crypto industry.” Additionally, BitWise co-founder Matt Hougan noted that it adds to the positive developments happening in the US crypto environment that will benefit US altcoins. As the crypto community eagerly awaits this summit, below are the top 4 US altcoins you can buy. Ripple (XRP) Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is likely to be among the crypto executives who will attend this summit. Garlinghouse has previously met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, raising speculation about Elon Musk picking Ripple for US national debt repayment . The XRP price has also bounced from its critical support of $2. The price is still trading above the 200-day EMA and the Chaikin Money Flow shows buying pressure is strong. If Ripple sustains a rally above this support, the US altcoin could support a breakout toward the resistance levels of $2.45 and $3.40. Solana (SOL) Solana price, at press time, had outperformed the other top altcoins with a 10% gain. The altcoin shows a strong outlook despite a $1.8B SOL unlock happening this week that could drive selling activity. Solana is breaking the midline of the descending parallel channel, suggesting a possible bullish reversal. The ADX is also falling showing weakening bearish momentum. If buyers step in now, and SOL breaks out of this trendline, it may aid a recovery to resistance at $206, making it one of the top US altcoins to buy. SOL/USDT: 1-day Chart Dogecoin (DOGE) Speculation is rife that Dogecoin price could hit $10 this cycle . One of the factors that could drive this rally is the recent move by the SEC to declare that meme coins are collectibles and not securities. The DOGE Awesome Oscillator shows a bullish divergence, and the price has bounced from support. If this US altcoin flips the 200-day EMA, it could resume the uptrend to the 123.6% Fibonacci level of $0.55. DOGE/USDT: 1-day Chart Cardano (ADA) Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson might also be among the executives that will attend the White House crypto summit, boding well for the altcoin’s price. Buyers are already reentering the market, with the RSI tipping north. This supports a bullish Cardano price prediction that could lead to a rally to the 178.6 Fibonacci level of $1.97. ADA/USDT: 1-day Chart Why Are These The Best US Altcoins to Buy For 100x Gains Ripple, Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin can rally 100x this week amid speculation about the crypto summit. These are US-based coins and some executives and representatives from their ecosystems might attend this summit. As speculation around this summit grows, these 4 altcoins are a good pick for crypto traders.

Whether you’re after a triple-double ROI or just looking to ride the next big wave, this is where the smart money’s heading. Solana might be making moves, but in a market where speed, efficiency, and insane returns matter, $DAGZ is leading the pack. Are you ready to level up your portfolio? Solana’s Market Position & Price Prediction Solana has been one of the fastest-growing blockchains, gaining attention for its ability to process thousands of transactions per second. It’s often positioned as a strong competitor to Ethereum, thanks to its scalability and low transaction costs. Solana’s Strengths Solana’s speed is its biggest advantage. The Solana blockchain can handle around 65,000 transactions per second, making it far faster than Ethereum. It also has significantly lower fees, making it a favorite among developers and traders. The Solana ecosystem has also grown rapidly, attracting NFT projects, DeFi applications, and institutional investors. With its strong development team and expanding network, it remains a dominant force in the crypto space. Solana Price Forecast: What Analysts Expect The solana price prediction has been mixed, with some analysts expecting it to reach new highs, while others remain cautious due to market volatility. Technical analysis suggests that if market capitalization continues to grow, solana sol price prediction could show a steady upward trend. However, there are risks. The Solana forecast has also included concerns about price drops, especially after previous network outages. Dawgz AI: The Future of Crypto Investing While Solana has built a strong reputation, $DAGZ is offering something entirely different-a crypto ecosystem designed for both profitability and fun. Unlike Solana, which is purely a blockchain, $DAGZ is an investment-focused project that helps traders maximize returns using AI-powered automation. What is Dawgz AI? $DAGZ is a meme coin with real utility. For investors, this means they don’t have to spend hours studying charts or making emotional trading decisions - $ DAGZ does the work for them. A New Way to Invest: More Than Just a Blockchain Solana is great for developers, but $DAGZ is built for investors. Instead of just offering fast transactions, $DAGZ provides a complete profit-generating system with automated trading and staking rewards. While the Solana price forecast depends on adoption and market trends, $DAGZ’s profit potential is driven by AI trading and smart tokenomics. Staking & Passive Income: How Dawgz AI Rewards Holders One of the most attractive aspects of $DAGZ is its staking rewards. Unlike Solana, where staking returns can fluctuate, $DAGZ offers a stable, competitive APY for Ethereum holders. ETH Staking for Competitive APY Investors can stake their ETH and earn passive income, making $DAGZI an appealing choice for long-term holders. The staking rewards are designed to be sustainable, unlike Solana’s variable staking system. Tokenomics That Work for Investors Dawgz AI has a total supply of 8.888 billion tokens, with a well-structured distribution model: 30% allocated to presale 20% for staking rewards 10% for liquidity This ensures that investors are rewarded while maintaining long-term stability. In contrast, Solana’s supply is much larger, which can lead to more volatility and inflation in price. Solana vs. Dawgz AI: Who Wins in Staking? While Solana allows staking, its APY fluctuates based on network activity. In comparison, $DAGZ offers a clear, competitive staking model that provides predictable and sustainable returns. Presale Success & Market Potential Dawgz AI isn’t just an idea-it’s already gaining major traction in the market. Investors are recognizing its potential, as seen by its successful presale numbers. Over $2M Raised & Growing The project has already raised over $2 million, with the next goal set at $2.1 million. The momentum continues to build, signaling strong demand from early investors. Limited Supply = High Demand Unlike Solana, which has a high circulating supply, Dawgz AI has a hard-capped supply of 8.888 billion tokens. This scarcity creates higher demand, which can drive prices up as adoption increases. Why This Matters for Investors While Solana has already experienced its biggest growth phase, Dawgz AI is still in its early stages, meaning there’s more room for upside potential. Getting in early could mean higher returns compared to buying into an already established project like Solana. The Verdict: Which is the Better Long-Term Bet? Both Solana and Dawgz AI have their strengths, but which one is truly the better investment for the future? Solana is a Strong Blockchain, But… There’s no denying that Solana has made a name for itself in the crypto world. However, it faces challenges: Network outages and reliability issues Growing competition from Ethereum and other blockchains Uncertain price trends, making price prediction difficult Dawgz AI Offers More Than Just Transactions Dawgz AI isn’t just another blockchain-it’s a profit-driven ecosystem designed for traders and investors who want automated income, staking rewards, and strong tokenomics. While Solana price predictions depend on market conditions, Dawgz AI’s model is built for consistent profits through AI trading. Meme Coin with Real Utility = High Growth Potential Meme coins usually lack real-world applications, but Dawgz AI changes that by offering real AI-driven trading tools. This makes it a unique hybrid of meme culture and profitable investing-something no other project has successfully achieved at this scale. Conclusion Solana has had an impressive run, and its market cap remains strong. But when looking at long-term opportunities, Dawgz AI presents a more innovative and rewarding investment. For those seeking passive income, AI-powered trading, and strong tokenomics, Dawgz AI is the smarter bet. While Solana continues to fight for dominance in the blockchain space, Dawgz AI is offering a new way to invest-one that’s both profitable and fun. Frequently Asked Questions What price will Solana be worth in 2025? The expected price of Solana in 2025 varies depending on market trends and competition. Some analysts predict a range between $150 and $300, while others are more conservative due to past network issues. Solana Labs has made improvements, but with decentralized finance expanding, newer projects like Dawgz AI are stealing the spotlight. Can Sol reach $1000? While some believe Solana could hit $1000, it’s an expected price that relies on extreme market growth and perfect execution from the Solana team. With low transaction costs and a strong presence in smart contracts and Solana NFTs, it has potential, but competition is fierce. Instead of waiting for Solana’s growth to hit uncertain numbers, investing in a high-utility meme coin like $DAGZ could provide bigger and faster returns. How high can Solana go in 2025? Solana’s expected price in 2025 largely depends on market conditions and demand for its blockchain. Some estimates place it around $100 to $250, but this isn’t guaranteed. While Solana NFTs and smart contracts contribute to its value, $DAGZ is proving to be the more lucrative choice for investors. If you’re looking for real returns rather than speculation, Dawgz AI is the clear winner. Is Solana going to boom? Solana’s growth has been fueled by decentralized finance, smart contracts, and institutional backing, but it still struggles with network stability issues. Dawgz AI offers a more promising future, combining trading with staking rewards for maximum profitability. Instead of waiting for another Solana surge, investing in Dawgz AI now positions you ahead of the curve with higher potential gains and real-world utility.

As the pioneering BTC network, Bitlayer, announced at ETH Denver 2025 its key partnerships with five Blockchains, viz., Arbitrum, Statknet, Base, SonicSVM and Plume Network. The partnership aims to unlock Bitcoin’s $1.9 trillion liquidity by integrating it with these five major Blockchains through Bitlayer’s BitVM. The collaboration is set to work towards redefining the role of Bitcoin by bringing Bitcoin-powered smart contracts, interoperability, and decentralized finance (DeFi) similar to existing Ethereum. Bitlayer BitVM transforming the Passive role of BTC Historically, Bitcoin has been the most secure and decentralized blockchain, but its limited scripting language has prevented the development of advanced smart contracts. The off-chain computation framework, Bitlayer BitVM Bridge, seeks to change that by enabling Turing-complete smart contracts on Bitcoin without requiring protocol changes. Developed by Bitlayer, the BitVM Bridge – which is the core of these partnerships – is a trust-minimized Bitcoin bridge powered by the innovative BitVM smart contract framework. This technology facilitates secure and efficient transfers of Bitcoin ( BTC ) into various blockchain ecosystems, allowing BTC holders to engage directly with DeFi applications without relying on centralized intermediaries. Bitlayer’s Bitcoin Virtual Machine or BitVM enables Turing-complete smart contracts on Bitcoin and allows developers to build Ethereum-like dApps without changing Bitcoin’s protocol. It uses off-chain computation and fraud proofs to ensure security and efficiency.

Every partner in this partnership is set to play a key role, such as: The integration of Bitlayer BitVM bridge with Base will allow Bitcoin holders to utilize their assets across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains, enhancing Bitcoin’s liquidity within the DeFi ecosystem. 2. As one of the leading Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, Arbitrum will provide scalability and high-speed execution for BitVM-powered smart contracts and yBTC DeFi applications. Through the BitVM Bridge, Arbitrum users can bridge assets to and from Bitcoin under a trust-minimized framework, enriching Arbitrum’s DeFi landscape. 3. The integration with Starknet will offer Bitcoin users instant transactions with minimal fees in a secure environment, leveraging STARK proofs for enhanced security. 4. By integrating with Sonic , the first Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) chain, the BitVM bridge will be able to bring Bitcoin liquidity to Web3 applications, including gaming and social media platforms. 5. The collaboration with Plume Network , a Layer 1 blockchain focused on real-world assets (RWA), can unlock Bitcoin’s liquidity for institutional-grade financial products, bridging traditional finance with blockchain technology. It will enable native BTC to flow directly into its ecosystem to access real yields and RWA staking, bridging a new era of RWAfi and BTCfi together. Further, the integration of yBTC (Yield Bitcoin) into these networks will enhance Bitcoin’s utility. yBTC is a wrapped Bitcoin asset that allows BTC holders to participate in DeFi applications, lending protocols, and yield-generating opportunities while maintaining exposure to Bitcoin’s value. With this partnership, yBTC will be natively supported across multiple blockchain ecosystems, creating new liquidity and DeFi use cases. Estimated Market Impact of Bitlayer’s Bitcoin integration into Web3. With yBTC available across multiple networks, BTC holders can access lending, staking, and liquidity provision without relying on centralized intermediaries. Thus, the partnerships and collaborations are set to unlock new cases of Bitcoin while expanding its utility. As over $1 trillion of Bitcoin sits idle in wallets, the aimed efforts of Bitlayer alongwith the key Blockchain partners can significantly work towards transforming it into an active asset.

As the price starts to recover from the recent lows, some analysts consider the weekend might bring some bullish relief for investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Drop Coming? ETH Risks Fall To $2,180 If This Support Fails – Analyst Bitcoin Recovers From $78,000 Drop Bitcoin has experienced significant selling pressure over the last week, fueling doubts about a potential market top. The flagship crypto has dropped 21% from last week’s high of $99,000, dipping below the $80,000 level for the first time since November. The correction also saw BTC drop nearly 30% from its January all-time high (ATH) and trade below its post-US election price range. A week after the market bleeding started, Bitcoin hit a new three-month low, retesting the $78,000 support on Friday morning. Various market watchers noted that BTC’s most recent decline reached and partially filled its November 2024 CME Gap between $78,000 and $80,700. Rekt Capital pointed out that Bitcoin is experiencing a “strong rebound against the partially filled CME Gap and is doing so on above-average seller volume.” The flagship crypto has surged around 7% from today’s lows, hovering between the $83,000 and $84,000 support zone for the past few hours. To the analyst, the CME Gap support and sell-side volume will be two key indicators to pay attention to over the weekend as constant, uninterrupted BTC sell-side pressure is unsustainable, and seller exhaustion potentially accelerates in the next few days. Bitcoin is finally starting to experience above-average seller volume. There’s still scope for more seller volume to come in, but the chances of Seller Exhaustion occurring are increasing. And Seller Exhaustion tends to precede price reversals. Is A Weekend Rebound Coming? Crypto analyst Jelle highlighted that Bitcoin has done “three drives in deeply oversold territory” this week and is retesting the local lows before today’s drop, which suggests that a “weekend relief seems likely.” The analyst stated that reclaiming the $84,500 support is key for BTC’s recovery as “the past two retests ended up resulting in new lows.” Nonetheless, he noted that today’s rebound seems different due to BTC “touching the 200-ema cluster” for the first time this week and breaking above it. To Jelle, this could signal an “interesting weekend,” with the new CME Gap at $93,000 open. Rekt Capital pointed out that Bitcoin “has filled every CME Gap that has formed since mid-March 2024” and that only the newly formed CME Gap between $92,800 and $94,000 remains open after this retrace. If BTC continues this pattern, the price could see a rebound to fill the new gap soon.

The project is initiating a reward system to compensate active testnet contributors, with the beta launch set for March. These incentives aim to stimulate participation from developers, miners, and validators, especially given the strong interest shown by the sale of over 18.6 billion coins. The presale has already raised $199.5 million, and BlockDAG is steadily moving towards the $200 million milestone. Driving Network Stability: The Incentive Initiative During the AMA, the BlockDAG team underscored the necessity of incentivizing node operators to ensure a stable and secure network. A structured rewards system is being launched, targeting key contributors: Testnet Validators—Those running testnet nodes will receive compensation for verifying transactions and maintaining network integrity. Stakers—Those staking BDAG coins will earn rewards based on the duration and amount staked, fostering long-term involvement. Contributors: BlockDAG rewards developers, bug testers, and community members who actively participate in improving the testnet. These incentives are designed to attract a broad range of participants, from casual miners to blockchain developers testing smart contracts, and further drive the exciting speculative nature of the project. Building a Robust Foundation: Expanding the Validator Ecosystem BlockDAG’s aim is to establish a decentralized and efficient validator network. To achieve this, the project will introduce staking rewards and community-driven initiatives that allow validators to secure the blockchain while earning BDAG coins. These measures are expected to enhance the network’s security and resilience. Additionally, BlockDAG’s testnet program will include a structured beta-testing phase. Select users will be given early access to validate network performance under real-world conditions. Those running nodes during this phase will receive exclusive bonuses before the mainnet launch. The exciting speculative movements within the project are already driving increased participation. Recognizing Contributions: Rewarding Testers & Developers A significant highlight from the AMA was BlockDAG’s commitment to rewarding testers who identify vulnerabilities or optimize network performance. The company will introduce bug bounties and milestone-based incentives, allowing participants to earn rewards based on their contributions. Developers will also have access to grants and tools necessary to build decentralized applications on BlockDAG’s infrastructure. BlockDAG’s presale has seen considerable success, with over $199.5 million raised to date. The project is currently in Batch 27, with BDAG coins priced at $0.0248. Since the first batch, the coin price has increased by 2380%, reflecting strong public interest. Over 18.6 billion BDAG coins have already been sold, positioning the project as a significant player. This rapid growth, combined with the upcoming testnet incentives, highlights BlockDAG’s strategy to build a sustainable and engaged network before its official launch. Public participants are closely watching these developments, especially with the anticipated staking opportunities and validator rewards. The exciting speculative possibilities are driving much of this observation. Looking Ahead With the beta testnet launching in March, BlockDAG is laying the groundwork for a robust network powered by its community. The company’s incentive programs for validators, miners, and developers are designed to ensure a smooth transition to mainnet while strengthening long-term engagement. As BlockDAG moves closer to its mainnet release, participants can expect further announcements on staking mechanics, additional reward structures, and potential new exchange listings. The upcoming months will be crucial as the project continues to expand its ecosystem and attract more users to its decentralized infrastructure. For those looking to get involved, now is the time to explore BlockDAG’s testnet opportunities and secure their place in the network’s future.

The market tumbled 20.57%, dragging Bitcoin down 17.5%, Ethereum by 32.2%, and XRP by 29.3%. The worst of the crash came between February 24 and 26, when the market plunged 12.42% in just two days. Bitcoin followed suit, dropping 12.48%, weighed down by three consecutive red candlesticks. But here’s where things get interesting – XRP didn’t follow the exact same script. While it fell on February 24, it quickly bounced back the next day, showing signs of resilience. And in the past 24 hours, XRP has surged 8.4%, outpacing both Bitcoin and Ethereum. So, is XRP breaking free from the broader market downtrend? Could this be the start of a bigger rally? Let’s dive into what analysts are saying. Crypto Market Dips, But XRP Holds Strong Yesterday, the total crypto market cap dropped to $2.55 trillion, and Bitcoin briefly fell below $80,000. Meanwhile, XRP touched a low of $1.95 but managed to close above the $2 support level. At the start of today, XRP traded around $2.14, and it now stands at $2.19, up 2.33% from its opening price. Despite this recovery, analysts warn that a full rebound is still uncertain. Key Levels: Will XRP Rally or Consolidate? Crypto analyst Dom believes XRP must break above $2.20 to confirm a stronger rally. If it does, he predicts a rise to $2.40 or higher. He also points out that $2.20 is a key level—if XRP fails to move past it, the market could see more sideways movement. On the downside, if XRP loses the $2 support level, it may drop further. Dom also warns that if Bitcoin falls to $75,000, it could pull XRP down with it. https://twitter.com/traderview2/status/1895561674448396614 Key Levels to Watch Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlights a strong support level at $1.65, noting that XRP is still moving within an upward price channel that started last year. Meanwhile, Dark Defender believes XRP has already bottomed out. He points to a Fibonacci retracement level, suggesting XRP could now enter a fifth wave – a pattern that could push prices to $5 or even $8. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today: Signs Point to SEC Dropping Ripple Lawsuit Soon – Here’s Why , XRP is showing signs of strength despite the broader market dip, but its next move depends on key resistance and support levels.

The crypto world has seen explosive growth in community-driven tokens, and new contenders are shaking up the space. With Peanut the Squirrel making waves and Cheems securing fresh traction, a new challenger is emerging— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). Arctic Pablo Coin is already turning heads with its innovative presale strategy, unique token burn mechanism, and sky-high ROI potential. With its presale currently in the 12th phase at Penguinopolis, early investors have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to secure an entry at just $0.000067 before its anticipated launch at $0.008. This article will cover the latest updates and developments of Arctic Pablo Coin, Peanut the Squirrel, and Cheems. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Strategy: How Token Burns Boost Value A key factor in Arctic Pablo Coin’s sustainability is its aggressive token burn strategy, which directly impacts scarcity and value. Each week, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation during the presale, reducing supply and strengthening the coin’s long-term price potential. Moreover, any tokens left after the presale will also be burned, ensuring a deflationary model that benefits early adopters. This mechanism isn’t just about limiting supply—it’s about increasing investor confidence and fostering long-term sustainability. By continuously reducing available tokens, Arctic Pablo Coin is creating a scarcity-driven demand, which could significantly boost its price post-launch. With crypto enthusiasts constantly searching for the best meme coin investments, Arctic Pablo Coin’s burn strategy is setting it apart. Arctic pablo coin is in the middle of Top New Meme Coins to Join for Short Term. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale – The Journey to Penguinopolis Offers Massive Potential The Meme Coin presale is anything but ordinary. Unlike traditional presales split into multiple pricing stages, this one follows a unique approach where Arctic Pablo “travels” through different locations. Currently, it has reached its 12th phase—Penguinopolis—where investors can get in at an ultra-low price of $0.000067 per APC. With over $1.64 million already raised, the momentum is building fast. The most exciting part? Early adopters stand to gain an astronomical ROI. From the current phase in Penguinopolis to its expected launch price of $0.008, investors could see gains exceeding 11,844.78%. To put it in perspective, a $100 investment at this stage would fetch 1,492,537 APCs, translating to a projected value of $11,940.30 post-listing. As Arctic Pablo Coin moves to new locations, prices will only increase. Those who act now could secure the best entry point before the next phase drives the price higher. With Arctic Pablo Coin solidifying its place among the top new meme coins to join for short-term gains, this presale is not one to be missed.

Cheems’ Recent Surge in Popularity Amid Community-Driven Developments Cheems has been making significant strides in the crypto space, gaining traction through its innovative community-led governance initiatives. By empowering token holders with voting rights on key project decisions, Cheems has reinforced its commitment to decentralization, ensuring that its future is shaped by those who believe in its vision.

Mark your calendars, March 14, 2025, will be the final day. No more extensions, no more waiting. This is it! With recent updates, many believe Pi Coin could soon rise from $3 to $5. One Last Extension Until 14 March The decision to extend the KYC deadline aims to provide early Pioneers who may have gone inactive with another opportunity to verify their identity and migrate their Pi holdings to the Mainnet. Pi Network has officially announced on X that the KYC and Mainnet migration deadlines have been extended one last time to 8:00 AM UTC on March 14, 2025. This gives real Pioneers extra time to verify their balances and move their Pi to the Mainnet after the Open Network launch. The KYC and Mainnet migration deadlines for the Grace Period have been extended one last time to 8:00am UTC on March 14, 2025, allowing additional time and opportunity after Open Network for real Pioneers to verify their balances and migrate to the Mainnet. Learn more:… pic.twitter.com/lD2jsDN8Wd — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) February 28, 2025 Pi developers also raised concerns about unverified and unclaimed Pi. Now that the Open Network is live, holding large amounts of unverified Pi on mobile wallets is not practical. They made it clear that this final extension is needed to help the network move forward while keeping it secure and decentralized. What Happens If You Miss the Deadline? Pioneers who fail to complete KYC and migrate to Mainnet by March 14, 2025, risk losing most of their mobile balance. However, Pi Network clarified that users will retain Pi mined within the last six months before migration. This means that anyone still holding older, unverified Pi must act before the deadline to avoid losing their assets. Pi Coin Price Prediction As the Pi Network ecosystem grows, speculation around Pi Coin’s price is rising. Recent trends suggest increasing market interest, with the token currently trading at $2.15, reflecting a 10% rise in 24 hours. If the bullish momentum continues, experts believe Pi could reach $3 or even $5 soon. With the final deadline now set, Pioneers who have yet to complete KYC should take action to secure their Pi holdings before it’s too late.",News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-01 11:15:45

Popular analyst Credible Crypto believes Litecoin (LTC) and XRP could become key players in the next market rally. Both tokens have maintained their support levels despite Bitcoin’s price dip below $80K, showing resilience while BTC continues to hover around key price ranges. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, remains stagnant at $2.1K but could surprise investors if momentum shifts in its favor. Altcoins Showing Strength Amid Market Uncertainty Since the Bitcoin and ETH craze is fading , several altcoins are standing out in the current market. Solana, Pi Network, Dogecoin, and Cardano have rebounded strongly, presenting investment opportunities. Dogecoin saw a 10.90% jump to $0.2044, largely driven by speculation of a potential ETF approval, which has fueled optimism among investors. Cardano is also showing positive buying signals, indicating a potential upward move. https://twitter.com/CredibleCrypto/status/1895425691262537946 LTC vs XRP: Altcoins Giving Bull Vibes! Litecoin and XRP have emerged as some of the most stable altcoins in this downturn. The analyst points out that while Bitcoin has dropped below its key support levels, LTC and XRP have held steady, making them likely candidates to lead the next market recovery. At the time of writing, Litecoin is trading at $127, showing marginal gains, while XRP sits at $2.15, down 1.6% on the day . Crypto analyst BearBull points out that while XRP has held its relative low, a drop to the high-timeframe (HTF) demand zone around $1.60 would challenge its current strength. However, Litecoin (LTC) appears more likely to hold higher, as its local low at $80 is still 33% away, compared to XRP’s 15% margin. In response , Credible Crypto agrees, noting that if XRP breaks its range lows and hits HTF demand, it may not look as strong in the short term, but overall, the HTF remains bullish. Bitcoin’s Current Position—Sideways Action Before a Breakout? Bitcoin recently dropped to $79,000 before recovering slightly to $85,070. According to Credible Crypto, BTC is likely to trade sideways between $74,000 and $99,000 before making a significant move. This consolidation phase could provide a foundation for select altcoins to surge ahead. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Recovered: Is this a Rebound or a Bull Trap? , Are We in a Selective Altcoin Season? Bitcoin dominance remains above 60%, keeping most altcoins in check, but select tokens like XRP, Litecoin, Solana, Pi Network, Dogecoin, and Cardano have rebounded, attracting investor interest. CryptoQuant’s CEO, Ki Young Ju, sugests that only a handful of altcoins will benefit in this cycle. Unlike past bull runs where most altcoins surged together, this time, only select assets tied to institutional adoption, stablecoins, and meme coins are standing strong. The total crypto market cap is now at $2.76 trillion, testing the highs of 2021. However, many altcoins are still down over 80% from their peak. Investing in projects with real utility rather than hype could be the best strategy in this bear market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ethereum Faces Bearish Pressure As Sentiment Hits 12-Month Low – Can ETH Avoid Dropping Below $2,000? https://t.co/8ncqGw6Mby — X Crypto News (@pakjobsidea) March 1, 2025 However, Ethereum quickly rebounded, surging to an intra-day high of $2,277 amid optimism surrounding Trump’s upcoming Crypto Summit on March 7. Despite the brief recovery, Ethereum is now facing renewed downward pressure, as the extended trendline resistance around $2,275 has pushed the price back down to $2,185. Geopolitical Tensions Impact Crypto Markets; Impact on ETH The sudden drop in Ethereum’s price was attributed to rising geopolitical uncertainties following a tense meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy. According to reports, their discussion on Ukraine’s natural resource investment plan turned into a heated exchange, with Trump and U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance openly criticizing Zelenskyy. The situation escalated when Zelenskyy stated that he would not return to the White House, further adding to the market’s nervousness.

U.S.… pic.twitter.com/auQfbVHhgH — Kyrylo Shevchenko (@KShevchenkoReal) February 28, 2025 Financial analysts believe that investors reacted to the uncertainty by moving funds out of riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. As a result, Ethereum’s decline below $2,100 marked its lowest level this year, raising fears of further downside if support at $2,000 fails to hold. Ethereum dropped due to Trump-Zelenskyy tensions. Investors pulled funds, pushing it below $2,100. If $2,000 breaks, more losses may follow. ETH Slips Ahead of Trump’s Crypto Summit Despite the initial losses, ETH swiftly regained momentum as positive news from the U.S. boosted investor confidence. Trump’s announcement of a Crypto Summit on March 7 sparked optimism regarding potential regulatory changes, leading to a surge in demand for digital assets. Bitcoin (BTC) also benefited, jumping from $78,000 to $86,500, while altcoins like Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) followed suit with notable gains.

The cryptocurrency’s 24-hour trading volume has surged to $22.97 billion, while its market capitalization stands at approximately $269.68 billion. This rapid recovery highlights the market’s sensitivity to both geopolitical risks and regulatory developments. Ethereum rebounded as Trump’s Crypto Summit announcement boosted confidence. Bitcoin surged to $86,500, with altcoins like XRP and ADA also gaining. ETH now trades at $2,236.52, up 5.36%, with a $22.97B trading volume. ETH/USD Outlook and Key Levels to Watch Market analysts caution that ETH’s price movements remain highly reactive to geopolitical news and upcoming regulatory discussions. If Ethereum sustains levels above $2,200, further upside momentum could push it toward the $2,300 resistance level. However, a break below $2,100 could expose the asset to renewed selling pressure, with $2,000 being a critical support zone.

He stated that cryptocurrencies have several issues as an asset class, in an interview with the Tamedia newspaper group. Why Cryptocurrencies Don’t Fit the SNB Swiss National Bank (SNB) President Martin Schlegel explained why cryptocurrencies do not fulfill the essential characteristics that a good currency should have in an interview with a media group. He highlighted three main reasons: first, cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, which makes them unreliable for maintaining long-term value. Second, he remarked that SNB reserves need to be highly liquid, allowing for quick use in monetary policy if needed. Lastly, Schlegel pointed out that cryptocurrencies have security flaws, as they are based on software, which can have bugs and vulnerabilities. SNB In Competition With Crypto? Furthermore, Schlegel argues that the SNB’s role is not to offer cryptocurrencies, noting that the total market value of all cryptocurrencies, around CHF 2,000 billion, is still small compared to the global financial system. He described cryptocurrencies as a “niche phenomenon.” When asked about competition from crypto, Schlegel stated that currencies have always competed with each other. However, he emphasized that the Swiss franc is in high demand and that the SNB is not really worried about competition from cryptocurrencies. The Bitcoin Initiative However, a proposal launched last December aims to make the Swiss National Bank (SNB) invest in bitcoin. The group behind the “Bitcoin Initiative” has 18 months to collect 100,000 signatures to bring it to a public vote. The plan suggests the SNB should build its currency reserves with earnings, including gold and bitcoin, although it doesn’t say how much bitcoin should be held. The initiative is backed by Yves Bennaïm, an internet pioneer, and other Swiss crypto advocates, whose main goal is to spark a public debate.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-01 11:41:41

However, the same cannot be said about the Ethereum counterparties, as they extended their negative streak to seven days in a row. BTC ETFs: The Bad and Minor Good The US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs didn’t enjoy February, which turned out to be the worst month in terms of net outflows since their inception over a year ago. The second part of the month was particularly painful , which is perhaps what helped make February 2025 the poorest for BTC’s price movements in over a decade. There hasn’t been a day with a triple-digit net inflow since February 7. In fact, only two trading days since that date have been in the green, while the remaining 12 were deep in the red. The biggest net withdrawals came on February 25 when $1.138.9 billion left the funds. The two surrounding dates – 24 and 26 – were also deep in the red, with $539 million and $754.9 million exiting, respectively. After another $275.9 million was withdrawn on Thursday (Feb 27), the tables finally turned on Friday with $94.3 million in net inflows. Despite this minor glimpse of hope, though, the week still ended deep in the red, with $2,614.1 billion exiting the funds. Perhaps it’s no surprise that BTC’s price went from $96,000 to $78,000 within this timeframe and dumped to its lowest level since early November 2024. ETH ETFs in Knockdown State The spot Ethereum ETFs had a slightly different trajectory this month as they even registered some consecutive days of net inflows from February 13 to February 19, granted there were three non-trading days within this timeframe. However, their streak was halted on February 20, and they have bled out each trading day since. The past week alone saw $78 million taken out on Monday, $50.1 million on Tuesday, $94.3 million on Wednesday, $71.2 million on Thursday, and $41.9 million on Friday. Overall, the week ended well in the red, with $335.5 million leaving the funds. ETH’s price performance was quite similar to that of BTC, as the asset is now down by over 20% on a weekly scale. Moreover, it dipped toward $2,000 for the first time in several months but managed to defend that level, at least for now.

Despite the massive bull run in the crypto landscape since 2023, Ethereum (ETH) holders have not had the same experience. Although ETH price shot 243% in 2023 and early 2024, it has failed to perform for the better part of 2024 . Meanwhile, its peer altcoins have yielded massive gains. As of this writing, ETH has undergone 12 weeks of agonizing downtrend. Ethereum’s uninspiring performance can be attributed to the Ethereum Foundation’s unconcerned and unchanging approach toward ETH and Solana’s sudden popularity as an “ETH-killer.” Regardless, let’s explore what technicals suggest is next for Ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, after 12 weeks of downtrend as it follows Bitcoin’s lead . What Comes After Ethereum Price Endures 12 Weeks of Pain? As shown in the weekly chart, Ethereum price crashed 49% from a peak of $4,087 on December 2, 2024, to $2,076 as of February 24, roughly constituting 12 weeks . In doing so, ETH has revisited the $2,100 support level for the fifth time since January 2024. Due to these frequent visits, a large portion of liquidity is likely to be present below this key level from investors looking to open long positions, hoping for a reversal. Technicals suggest that markets typically sweep this liquidity , allowing smart investors to buy at a discount, kickstarting a bullish reversal. So, to put it simply, investors can expect the ETH’s value to slide even lower before it can attempt to embark on a full-blown uptrend. ETH/USDT 1-week chart How Low Can ETH Go? Based on the weekly chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has attempted to overcome the mean level of 50 and failed, which signals a prevalence of strong bearish momentum . The Awesome Oscillator (AO) also expresses similar intent as it has produced three red histograms below the zero mean level. Therefore, investors can expect the Ethereum price to dip below $2,000 as it hunts for the sell-side liquidity below equal lows formed at $2,100 . Catalysts That Could Prepone Ethereum’s Bull Run Despite the lackluster Ethereum price performance, here are a few high-probability catalysts that could preempt ETH’s bull run. The Ethereum Foundation crisis involving Vitalik Buterin and Aya Miyaguci needs to be resolved with an appropriate replacement who will make Ethereum great again. A part of this solution was already implemented by removing Miyaguci from the helm and the Foundation exploring staking and other DeFi services instead of selling ETH for operational expenses. The Crypto Summit on March 7 could potentially pause the downtrend and catalyze a dead cat bounce. An announcement of a strategic digital asset stockpile that involves Bitcoin and Ethereum could further improve ETH’s odds of restarting the bull run.

Bitcoin fell 17.5%, Ethereum plunged 32.2%, and XRP dropped 29.3%. Unlike the broader market, XRP took a hit on February 24 but staged a quick recovery the next day, showing resilience. Over the past 24 hours, it has jumped 8.4%, outpacing both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, this surge came after SEC’s recent case drops that raised hopes of Ripple vs SEC case dismissal . But if that made you think XRP will moon, think again. Analyst says this will not be the only factor. The long-awaited conclusion of the SEC lawsuit against Ripple may bring regulatory clarity to XRP, but analysts warn that investors shouldn’t expect an immediate price explosion. According to a recent thread by All Things XRP, the real catalyst for XRP’s surge lies in Ripple’s next moves—adoption, partnerships, and real-world utility. https://twitter.com/XRP_investing/status/1895628037917729184 Factors Supporting XRP Pump, NOT SEC Case Closure Once the legal chapter closes, XRP’s market activity is expected to go higher. Exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken could expand trading pairs, while Binance.US might reintroduce XRP to its platform. The resulting liquidity boost and renewed retail interest could provide the initial push for a price rally. https://twitter.com/XRP_investing/status/1895628044926320704 Meanwhile, Ripple has already established partnerships with over 300 financial institutions through RippleNet, showcasing confidence in future adoption. With regulatory hurdles out of the way, major players like Standard Chartered, Santander, or even PayPal could integrate XRP for cross-border payments. This shift could lead to a massive spike in transaction volume. Another key factor is Ripple’s newly launched RLUSD stablecoin . If Ripple strategically integrates RLUSD into DeFi platforms and pairs it with XRP, institutional investors could flood the network, attracted by the combination of stability and fast, low-cost transactions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why XRP Is Going Up Today & Analyst Price Predictions , Tokenization: The Real Game-Changer? Moreover, the analyst noted that Ripple has long hinted at real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on the XRP Ledger. With the SEC case resolved, Ripple could accelerate plans to tokenize assets like gold, real estate, or carbon credits. If XRP becomes the transaction fuel for these trades, demand could skyrocket. The Power of Sentiment and Strategic Moves Ripple’s CEO, brad garlinghouse brad garlinghouse Brad Garlinghouse is the CEO of the financial technology company Ripple Labs, he is an extremely popular name across the global crypto landscape. He has previously served as the CEO of Hightail, a file-sharing service, and is also an active angel investor. He joined Ripple as COO in April 2015, answering to the CEO and prime supporter, Chris Larsen. He was elevated to CEO in December 2016. Initially, he worked at AOL and Yahoo! From 2003 to 2008, he filled in as Senior Vice President at Yahoo!, where he ran its Homepage, Flickr, Yahoo! Mail, and Yahoo! Courier divisions. While at Yahoo!, he wrote an inner update known as the ""Peanut Butter Manifesto,"" requiring the organization to zero in on its core business instead of extending itself excessively far, much like peanut butter.Details:Organization: RippleLocation: United StatesEducation: MBA from Harvard Business School and BA from The University of KansasSkills: Venture capital and StartupsExperience:CEO at Ripplefrom from Jan 2017 - Present ·President and COO at Ripple logo from Apr 2015 - Dec 2016Board Member at Animoto from 2012 - Dec 2017Tonic Health, an R1 company logoBoard Member at Tonic Health from 2011-2016Board Member at Ancestry from 2013 - 2016CEO at Hightail from May 2012 - Sep 2014FAQsWho is Brad Garlinghouse?The CEO of Ripple, a financial technology business that specializes in blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency XRP, is Brad Garlinghouse.

If adoption and scaling efforts materialize as expected, XRP could be in for a much bigger rally than just a legal win. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Expert Predicts Why Dogecoin Price Will Teleport to $3,https://coingape.com/markets/buy-doge-now-expert-predicts-why-dogecoin-price-will-teleport-to-3/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) price has maintained stability around the $0.20 mark despite recent market downturns. This key support level signals potential strength for the meme token. As the broader crypto market shows signs of recovery, analysts suggest that Dogecoin may be poised for a major breakout. An expert predicts that DOGE could surge toward $3, citing technical patterns and growing market interest as key factors driving bullish momentum. Crypto Expert Predicts Dogecoin Price Breakout To $3 Crypto experts suggest Dogecoin price is on the verge of a major breakout after weeks of consolidation. An analyst chart highlights a descending price channel, with DOGE trading near the $0.2 support level. Experts project a potential surge beyond $0.6, marking a 208% rally if critical resistance levels are breached. The Mmeme coin price action indicates a reversal pattern, suggesting that DOGE Price could be preparing for an upward trend. Market watchers are closely monitoring the breakout zone as technical indicators show signs of momentum shifting. If Dogecoin surpasses its resistance, a rally above the support levels will be fueled by increased market interest. DOGE Holds Above Critical Support Level, Eyes Potential Breakout Crypto analyst Ali also shared an X post that the Dogecoin price is holding above a critical support level. The chart shared by the analyst highlights DOGE’s long-term trend, showing a key support zone around $0.18. Despite recent price fluctuations, the meme coins asset remains within an upward channel, suggesting resilience in its structure. The chart also marks Fibonacci levels, with resistance near $0.25 and a potential breakout level above $0.30. If DOGE maintains support, it could sustain its upward trend. However, a drop below this level might indicate further declines. The rising Dogecoin price has caused broad cryptocurrency market optimism among investors. During the last 24-hours, Bitcoin prices soared by almost 10%, followed by substantial growth of Ether, XRP, and Solana (SOL). Market experts question whether positive market movement represents a lasting effect or a brief upward trend. Key Levels To Watch DOGE price experienced a 10% increase in 24 hours, which pushed it to a trading value of $0.20 on Saturday. Following constant stabilizing market trends, Dogecoin surpassed its previous $0.20 price level because of potential ETF development. The top altcoin needs to overcome $0.22 resistance before it can advance more in the short term. The Dogecoin price prediction continues rising so the next significant barrier stands near $0.25. The price would potentially engage support at $0.20 before breaking through that support level. The RSI stands at level 45 to show moderate but rising bullish market sentiments. Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView The price outlook for Dogecoin suggests a bullish trend where experts expect it to move toward the $3 milestone. DOGE will experience an intensive market rally once key resistance levels fail to hold. The post Buy DOGE now?

Priced at $0.015, analysts predict the altcoin could skyrocket to $1.5, a 100x return on investment for holders. Mutuum Finance is in phase 2 of its presale. Over $1.6 million has already been raised and more than 3100 investors are in. Investors have this once in a lifetime opportunity to enter before the price spikes 33.33% to 0.02 in phase 3. If Mutuum Finance pulls off this prediction, a $700 investment today becomes $70,000 during the next bull run. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): the DeFi opportunity everyone’s talking about Mutuum Finance ’s presale is gaining massive traction, offering early investors a rare chance to buy MUTM tokens at just $0.015 before they hit the open market. Currently in Phase 2, the token price is set to climb to $0.06 by the end of the presale, delivering a 300% return before public trading even begins. Analysts are optimistic, with predictions that once listed, MUTM could soar past $1.5. The excitement continues to build, with over $1.6 million raised and more than 3,100 investors already on board. Revolutionizing DeFi lending with a dual-system model Mutuum Finance is making crypto lending easier and more flexible with two smart ways to borrow and lend money: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) Model: investors can put stablecoins like USDT into a special pool managed by smart contracts. This helps them earn passive income, while borrowers can take out quick loans using their crypto as security. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model: Borrowers and lenders deal directly with each other, they can set their own loan rules, interest rates, and guarantees. There are no middlemen, making everything faster, fairer, and fully decentralized. With these two models, Mutuum Finance gives users more freedom, security and better ways to grow their money. Mutuum Finance is also set to launch a fiat-backed stablecoin on Ethereum. The stablecoin will be pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. This differentiates it from algorithmic stablecoins, which are prone to depegs causing massive losses to investors. Mutuum Finance is designed for long-term success, with a well-structured presale pricing model that rewards early adopters. A controlled token release strategy prevents inflation and keeps prices stable, while funds are strategically allocated to liquidity, security, and partnerships to fuel continuous platform development. Big rewards & community incentives To drive mass adoption, Mutuum Finance is giving away $100,000, with 10 winners receiving $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. Additionally, their referral program lets users earn bonuses for bringing in new investors, accelerating the community’s growth. Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a game-changer in the decentralized finance market, with groundbreaking DeFi solutions, strong tokenomics, and a fast-growing community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about opportunities in crypto. Currently, its presale price is just $0.015, but with Phase 3 approaching, it’s about to jump 33.33% to $0.02. By the time the presale ends, Mutuum Finance token price will be $0.06, delivering a 300% gain before it even reaches public trading.

BTFD Coin’s $0.00016 Entry Price and 3,650% ROI Potential Are Screaming Opportunity",https://thecoinrise.com/wishing-youd-bought-snek-early-btfd-coins-0-00016-entry-price-and-3650-roi-potential-are-screaming-opportunity/,"The crypto market has always been full of surprises, with meme coins leading some of the most unexpected rallies. Many investors who missed out on early opportunities have found themselves watching from the sidelines as prices skyrocketed. Snek became one of the most talked-about projects on Cardano, and those who got in early saw massive gains as its deflationary model drove demand. But as history shows, every missed opportunity is followed by a new one, and right now, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be the next big thing. BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s a project designed for long-term growth, combining a Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards, and a strong community foundation. The presale is currently in Stage 14, with an entry price of just $0.00016. Analysts are already predicting a listing price of $0.0006 and a potential moon price of $0.006, signaling a massive 3,650% ROI potential. Investors looking for the best new meme coins to join this week are turning their attention to BTFD Coin before the window closes. BTFD Coin’s Play-to-Earn Game and Explosive Growth Potential The biggest reason BTFD Coin is gaining momentum is its Play-to-Earn game, which officially launched on January 1, 2025. This isn’t just a promise of future development—it’s a fully functional game that allows players to earn rewards in real-time. The gaming sector has proven to be one of the strongest drivers of crypto adoption, and BTFD Coin’s early entry into this space is setting it apart. Imagine investing in a project where you don’t just hold tokens—you actively engage in a growing ecosystem that pays you for your participation. That’s exactly what BTFD Coin is offering. With players already earning rewards and staking opportunities providing an incredible 90% APY, the project has created multiple ways for holders to grow their investments. This combination of gaming and staking makes BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to join this week, attracting both investors and gamers alike. With over $6.21 million raised, more than 11,100 holders, and 70 billion tokens already sold, the presale is moving fast. Every day, more investors are realizing that this is the chance they’ve been waiting for. At the current price of $0.00016, those who invest now stand to gain significantly once the token reaches its projected $0.006 price. A simple $5,000 investment at presale prices would turn into $187,500 at the predicted moon price. That’s the kind of opportunity that doesn’t come around often, and those searching for the best new meme coins to join this week are starting to take action. Snek’s Run Was Huge, But BTFD Coin’s Future Looks Promising Snek became a cultural force on Cardano, with its deflationary mechanism driving increased demand. As tokens continue to be burned, supply shrinks, creating additional buying pressure. This unique model helped push Snek into the spotlight, cementing its status as one of the most traded tokens in its ecosystem. Investors who spotted the opportunity early have already reaped the benefits, while many others are left wondering what’s next. The reality is that crypto moves fast, and waiting too long can mean missing out on the next major trend. That’s why so many traders and investors are now looking at BTFD Coin. With its presale still ongoing and multiple revenue streams for holders, it presents one of the strongest cases for those looking for the best new meme coins to join this week. The combination of a live Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY staking, and a referral program that rewards early supporters makes it clear that this project is built for growth. How to Buy BTFD Coin Before the Presale Ends Buying BTFD Coin is simple, but the key is to act before the presale ends. Start by setting up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head to the official presale page . Connect your wallet, choose the amount of BTFD you want to buy, and confirm the transaction. Once the presale concludes, your tokens will be available for claim. With staking and Play-to-Earn rewards already in place, early buyers will have the opportunity to start earning right away. Final Thoughts Crypto history has proven time and time again that early movers often see the biggest gains. Those who got into Snek early had the chance to profit, while others were left watching from the sidelines. BTFD Coin is presenting a second opportunity, but the clock is ticking. With its $0.00016 presale entry price, projected $0.006 moon price, and over $6.21 million already raised, it’s clear why this is one of the best new meme coins to join this week. Investors looking to make a move need to act before the next presale stage sells out because once the price moves up, the best entry point will be gone. Join BTFD Coin’s presale today before it’s too late. FAQs What makes BTFD Coin different from other meme coins?

Besides, speculations are also soaring over a potential dismissal of the Ripple SEC case, given the recent shifting stance of the US SEC towards the crypto sector. However, a top expert recently shrugged off concerns over the lawsuit’s impact on Ripple’s native coin, saying that the crypto is likely to hit $8 irrespective of the case result. XRP Price Soars 6%: More Stream Left? XRP price today jumped nearly 6.25% and exchanged hands at $2.15, while its trading volume fell 32% to $5.16 billion. Notably, the crypto has hovered between $2.21 and $2.02 over the last 24 hours. Further, derivatives data by CoinGlass showed that XRP Futures Open Interest rose 7% today, reflecting the regaining market confidence. Amid this, a renowned market analyst CasiTrades said that the correction is likely over for the crypto and XRP’s major resistance now looms at $2.2. Besides, the expert added if Ripple’s coin breaks the $2.5 ahead, it could continue to move towards the north. Source: CasiTrades, X Meanwhile, despite the positive market sentiment, the community has shown frustration over the US SEC’s delay in dropping the Ripple SEC case. For context, the US SEC has dropped many of the major crypto cases this week but made no comments on the long-running XRP lawsuit. Highlighting the delay, renowned legal expert John Deaton recently pushed for a settlement in the ongoing legal battle. Will Ripple SEC Case Impact XRP Price Ahead? Renowned market expert Dark Defender has made a bold prediction that the XRP price will reach $8, irrespective of the outcome of the ongoing Ripple SEC case. This prediction comes as Ripple’s coin has recovered today, indicating renewed investor confidence amidst a broader crypto market recovery. The Ripple Vs SEC lawsuit has been a major point of speculation, with many investors worried about its impact on the asset’s price. However, Dark Defender’s prediction suggests that the crypto’s price will continue to rise, regardless of the case’s outcome. In a recent social media post, Dark Defender explained that XRP has reached the lowest Fibonacci level for a 4th wave and is expected to start a 5th wave, which could push its price towards $5-$8. Source: Dark Defender, X This prediction is significant, given the current market sentiment. XRP’s price has been volatile in recent times, but Dark Defender’s analysis suggests that it has the potential to reach new heights. It’s worth noting that the Ripple case is still ongoing, and its outcome is uncertain. However, if Dark Defender’s prediction comes true, it could be a major boost for the traders. Key Levels to Watch Ahead As XRP price noted some recovery and hovered in the green zone, top experts have provided key price levels to watch ahead. For context, market pundit Ali Martinez said that the crypto has found new support at $1.65. Having said that, it’s crucial that the crypto holds this support to maintain its upward trajectory. Source: Ali Martinez, X On the other hand, expert Rose Premium Signals said that Ripple’s coin is currently experiencing a retracement phase, testing key Fibonacci levels. The cryptocurrency is expected to bounce back strongly from the support zone of $1.2578. If successful, this could trigger a massive recovery and a bullish breakout. Potential targets include $3.0110 and $4.2243. Source: Rose Premium Signals, X Having said that, it appears that the crypto is poised for a strong rally ahead. Besides, another expert has recently predicted the Ripple price to hit $320 in 2026, which has sparked significant discussions in the market.

The lawsuit had accused Heart, whose real name is Richard Schueler, of raising more than $1 billion through unregistered crypto offerings and misappropriating $12.1 million for personal luxuries, including the world’s largest black diamond. However, in a Feb. 28 decision, Judge Carol Bagley Amon determined that the SEC failed to establish a direct connection between Heart’s activities and U.S. investors. Judge Rules No U.S. Jurisdiction Over Crypto Misconduct Allegations The Judge noted that the alleged misconduct occurred through digital wallets and crypto platforms with no clear ties to the United States. “The alleged misappropriation occurred through digital wallets and crypto asset platforms, none of which were alleged to have any connection with the United States,” Amon stated in her ruling . “To the extent the Complaint shows that Heart misappropriated investor funds through deceptive mixer transactions, those actions occurred entirely outside of the United States.” The SEC had classified Hex (HEX), PulseChain (PLS), and PulseX (PLSX) as unregistered securities in its complaint. Since the ruling, all three tokens have surged in value, with HEX, PLS, and PLSX rising by 78%, 36%, and 67%, respectively. Heart celebrated the court’s decision, describing it as a victory not just for himself but for the broader cryptocurrency community. “HEX has operated flawlessly for over five years. Today’s decision in favor of a cryptocurrency founder and his projects over the SEC brings welcome relief and opportunity to all cryptocurrencies,” Heart wrote in a Feb. 28 post on X. Case dismissed. Thank you Judge Amon. pic.twitter.com/4OCGwYcJCO — Richard Heart (@RichardHeartWin) February 28, 2025 Despite the dismissal, the legal battle may not be over. Judge Amon allowed the SEC to amend its complaint and refile the case within 20 days, leaving the door open for further legal action. Heart has also faced legal trouble outside the U.S. Finnish Police Seize $2.6M in Luxury Watches from Hex Founder As reported, Finnish officials did manage to seize approximately $2.6 million worth of luxury watches that he allegedly abandoned. Schueler is wanted in Finland for alleged tax evasion and assault charges, with authorities struggling to locate his whereabouts. Inspector Harri Saaristola, who is leading the investigation, revealed that the watches were traced through intelligence activities. While some were purchased in the U.S., many were acquired in Finland. Schueler is suspected of tax evasion between 2020 and 2024, with his unpaid taxes potentially reaching “several hundred million euros.” He is also accused of assaulting a 16-year-old in 2021, an incident detailed in Europe’s most wanted fugitives list. On December 22, Interpol issued a “Red Notice” for Schueler to aid in his capture. Despite these allegations, Schueler remains active online, using platforms like X and YouTube to promote HEX.

The cryptocurrency’s open interest surged by an impressive 8.43%, indicating that investor sentiment is growing more positive. This uptick in open interest suggests that many traders are positioning themselves for a potential price rally, raising hopes that the recent sell-off might be over. XRP Open Interest Crosses $3B! Notably, data from CoinGlass indicates that the total amount of XRP in open interest has crossed the $3 billion mark. In the past 24 hours alone, investors have locked in 1.40 billion XRP, worth $3.07 billion, signaling a significant increase in market activity and interest in XRP.

This development could ignite a viral frenzy in the cryptocurrency world. The focus turns to Dogecoin and WIF. Will these coins experience a surge? Buckle up to discover which digital currencies are primed for potential growth. OFFICIAL TRUMP: Recent Deep Drops Amid Long-Term Gains Price dropped almost 50.93% over the past month and fell 15.51% in one week, contrasted by a 6-month gain of 11.42%. The numbers show a striking short-term loss amid a gradual long-term improvement. Movements reflect high volatility where swift declines can give way to modest recovery over longer spans. Historical performance underlines a turbulent market phase with sharp corrections linked to sudden selling pressure. Current prices range from $7.68 to $21.64 with immediate resistance at $30.32 and solid support at $2.39. A second resistance is at $44.28. Negative momentum and an oscillator, along with an RSI of 39.76, indicate bearish dominance without a clear trend. Traders might explore short positions below resistance or consider buying near support while managing risk carefully. Dogwifhat Market Update: Recent Trends and Key Levels Dogwifhat experienced a 45.77% decline over the past month and a 53.98% drop in the last six months. Price movements have shown steep declines with only small recoveries amid overall bearish pressure. The past performance highlights a continuous downturn with inconsistent attempts to rally, reflecting a difficult market situation that has kept bearish sentiment at the forefront. Current trading places the coin between 0.36 and 1.04 dollars, with clear resistance at 1.44 dollars and support at 0.10 dollars, along with a second resistance around 2.12 dollars. Bearish signals dominate the market, with near-neutral momentum and an RSI reading of 40.85, indicating slightly oversold conditions. Traders might look for cautious entries within these levels while staying alert for any signs of a trend reversal. Dogecoin Volatility: Short-Term Decline Amid Long-Term Surge Last month saw a 37% decline after a notable 114% gain over the past six months. The coin has faced sharp short-term drops, contrasting with its long-term rally. Variability has characterized its price action, reflecting market swings that led to significant corrections despite the overall positive trend in the half-year timeframe. Trading volume and market sentiment have varied widely, indicating a volatile landscape for Dogecoin in recent months. The current price trades between $0.1445 and $0.2961, with resistance at $0.39 and support around $0.0871. Bears dominate the market, pushing negative momentum and oscillator readings, although the RSI shows it is oversold. Traders may consider looking for rebound opportunities near support or assessing potential breakdowns before anticipating upward movements. Conclusion TRUMP's recent performance suggests a strong move towards breaking the main resistance. This momentum could impact related coins like WIF and DOGE. Close attention to TRUMP's actions will be key. If TRUMP successfully breaks through, it may set off a positive trend, particularly in meme coins. DOGE is likely to experience increased activity as a result. WIF could also benefit, riding the wave of interest generated by TRUMP's breakthrough. Watching how these coins interact in the coming days will be crucial for understanding the broader impact. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The reversal follows a turbulent period that saw significant capital exits from Bitcoin ETFs, including a staggering $754.53 million outflow on February 26. The latest data from SoSoValue shows that cumulative total net inflows now stand at $36.94 billion, with total net assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs reaching $95.38 billion. The total value traded on February 28 amounted to $3.91 billion. Fidelity’s FBTC Records Highest Inflows Among the biggest movers, Fidelity’s FBTC recorded the highest inflow, adding $176.03 million, followed by Ark Invest’s ARKB, which saw an inflow of $193.70 million. On the other hand, BlackRock’s IBIT, one of the most prominent Bitcoin ETFs, suffered a net outflow of $244.56 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC saw another $33.28 million in net exits. BREAKING: Investors have pulled a record $3.3 billion from US spot-Bitcoin ETFs in February ABSOLUTELY INSANE! pic.twitter.com/4BWWlUrfs6 — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) February 28, 2025 The turnaround comes amid heightened market volatility, with Bitcoin recently fluctuating between $78,000 and $85,000. Despite the recent inflow, the broader trend remains uncertain, as previous outflows have been driven by profit-taking and shifting investor sentiment. Analysts suggest that further sustained inflows would be necessary to confirm a bullish trend reversal for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Meanwhile, BlackRock remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term investment potential. In a Feb. 27 commentary , Michael Gates, the lead portfolio manager for the firm’s Target Allocation ETF model suite, emphasized that Bitcoin could serve as a unique diversification tool for portfolios. “As multi-asset portfolio constructors, we believe bitcoin has long-term investment merit for certain investors and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios.” However, market sentiment has been rattled. On Feb. 26, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropped to “extreme fear” with a score of 10—its lowest level since June 2022, when the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) shook the industry. BlackRock Adds Bitcoin ETF to Its Model Portfolio Amid Growing Institutional Adoption BlackRock has incorporated its Bitcoin ETF into its model portfolio product. According to a Bloomberg report on Feb. 28, the firm’s iShares Bitcoin ETF Trust (IBIT) will now be available for portfolios allowing alternative assets, with allocations ranging from 1% to 2%. The move could generate additional demand for the ETF as institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues to expand. The 1%–2% allocation is a cautious approach due to Bitcoin’s notorious volatility, which BlackRock’s Investment Institute described as a “reasonable range” in a recent research paper. The firm noted that exceeding this level could significantly impact the overall portfolio’s risk profile. BlackRock’s model portfolio business, valued at $150 billion, provides a variety of investment strategies for financial advisers managing client assets. These portfolios offer different asset allocations tailored to objectives such as growth, income generation, or capital preservation. In 2023, BlackRock projected that the model portfolio sector would expand to a $10 trillion industry over the next five years, up from roughly $4.2 trillion at the time. Given the sector’s influence, adjustments in model portfolio allocations can drive substantial capital inflows into specific assets, including Bitcoin ETFs. Financial institutions have increasingly analyzed Bitcoin’s role in traditional portfolio structures, particularly the 60/40 allocation model.

The event has gained significance as it could influence US regulatory policies and investor sentiment in the crypto market. White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks will chair the summit. Bo Hines, Working Group’s Executive Director will administer it. White House Readies For Crypto Summit The White House crypto summit will be held on March 7 and marks a significant milestone in the recognition of cryptocurrencies by the US government. The summit will be led by venture capitalist and White House Crypto Czar David Sacks and administered by Working Group Executive Director Bo Hines. President Trump created the Executive Group shortly after taking office and tasked it with advising the White House on digital asset policy and evaluating the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The White House released a statement confirming the summit, stating, “President Trump will host and deliver remarks at the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on Friday, March 7. Attendees will include prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto industry, as well as members of the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. The summit will be chaired by the White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks and administered by the Working Group’s Executive Director, Bo Hines.” President Trump is expected to deliver remarks at the gathering, which comes at a time when investor confidence and market sentiment is lagging. The White House added it was committed to providing a clear regulatory framework for crypto, stating, “The administration is committed to providing a clear regulatory framework, enabling innovation, and protecting economic liberty.” Trump’s Position On Crypto Donald Trump derided crypto before the 2024 elections, calling it a scam. However, he changed his position during the 2024 campaign, promising to streamline regulations, choose crypto-friendly officials to key positions, create a stablecoin framework, and establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. As a result, the crypto industry donated millions towards his campaign. However, Trump has yet to fulfill the promises made on the campaign trail, with the industry disappointed by the lack of urgency. The markets have also gotten over the initial euphoria of Trump’s election victory and are struggling after falling back to pre-election levels. However, the Trump administration’s policies are a clear departure from the Biden administration’s regulatory approach after the collapse of FTX and other scandals. Trump has also gotten into the crypto business himself by launching a meme coin just days before taking office for a second time. He is also involved with a crypto project called World Liberty Financial. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

41008652,https://cryptonews.com/?p=337316,1740834624,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/41008652.jpeg,SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw Dissents on Meme Coin Non-Security Ruling,https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-commissioner-caroline-crenshaw-dissents-on-meme-coin-non-security-ruling/,"SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has voiced opposition to the agency’s recent guidance that classifies meme coins as non-securities. In a statement on Feb. 27 , Crenshaw argued that meme coins could meet the Howey test’s criteria, particularly in how investors rely on the managerial efforts of developers and promoters for potential profits. Her dissent comes in response to the SEC’s newly released guidance, which describes meme coins as speculative assets tied to online trends rather than investment contracts. New SEC Stance Suggests Meme Coins Exist For Entertainment The SEC’s new stance suggests that meme coins exist primarily for entertainment and social engagement , a perspective Crenshaw firmly disputes. “Today’s statement paints meme coins as cultural projects whose purpose is entertainment and social engagement. The reality is that meme coins, like any financial product, are issued to make money,” she said. The debate around meme coins has intensified following several high-profile scams and a controversial presidential memecoin launch. The issue has drawn the attention of lawmakers, particularly after former U.S. President Donald Trump’s involvement in a memecoin project. In response, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and others have called for an investigation into potential ethics violations related to political token offerings. On Feb. 27, Representative Sam Liccardo of California announced that House Democrats are preparing legislation to ban presidential meme coins. The proposed Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act aims to prohibit U.S. lawmakers, as well as their spouses and dependents, from issuing, endorsing, or profiting from digital assets. #SEC 2.0: Commissioner #Crenshaw issues Crypto 2.0 Statement https://t.co/nElWf4yfjp pic.twitter.com/zAUTJt9HIN — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) February 28, 2025 Meanwhile, legal experts are weighing in on how meme coins should be regulated. Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) attorney Elizabeth Davis suggested that if the CFTC is granted greater oversight of cryptocurrencies, meme coins could fall under its regulatory jurisdiction. Davis also predicted that clearer regulations on meme coins would emerge within the next year, bringing more clarity to the industry. Trump Elects Pro-Crypto Paul Atkins as SEC Chair As Cryptonews reported earlier , President-elect Donald Trump has selected Paul Atkins as SEC Chair. Atkins, who previously served under SEC chairs Richard Breeden and Arthur Levitt, is “crypto savvy” and has a “deep understanding of the inner workings of the agency.” Trump, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, has regularly vowed to enact a crypto-friendly regulatory framework upon returning to the Oval Office. The shift comes as the SEC has been facing growing criticism due to its “regulation-by-enforcement” approach to the crypto industry. Critics argue that the SEC has failed to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, opting instead to pursue legal action against key industry players. A coalition of seven U.S. states has come together to challenge the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulation of cryptocurrency. The states have filed an amicus brief, led by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, arguing that the SEC’s attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies constitutes a “power grab” that would stifle innovation, harm the crypto industry, and exceed the agency’s authority.

The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 5% over the past 24 hours but remains below $85,000. BTC experienced a bounce after President Donald Trump announced a crypto summit on March 7, triggering an immediate bullish reaction in the market. BTC Bounces As White House Prepares For Crypto Summit Bitcoin (BTC) finally ended its losing streak as it rallied from a low of $78,457 to hit $86,570 before settling at its current level of $84,600. The rally can be attributed to the White House announcing plans to host a Crypto Summit on March 7, triggering an immediate bullish reaction from the market. Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP), and several other coins rallied following the news. According to reports, Trump will discuss the future of digital assets, leading to speculation the government may be readying to adopt crypto-friendly policies. “White House just announced its first-ever Crypto Summit on March 7 Trump, top CEOs, big money - they’re all in the room This ain’t just another meeting, this is THE SIGNAL - Regulatory clarity - Mass adoption - Or just insiders front-running again?” Trading volumes and market activity also registered a significant jump, signaling growing anticipation among institutional and retail investors. While investor sentiment is bullish in the short term, analysts believe several macroeconomic factors could challenge Bitcoin’s rally. A Macroeconomic Threat Despite BTC’s recovery, several external macroeconomic factors could limit further upside. President Trump reiterated plans to impose 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports and an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, escalating the prospect of a trade war. The developments strengthened the US dollar, making risk assets like BTC vulnerable to corrections. Meanwhile, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report registered a 0.3% increase in January, bringing the annual rate to 2.5%. Core PCE slowed to 2.6% from December’s 2.9%. While the data was along expected lines, it reinforced the likelihood of the Fed keeping interest rates unchanged. Standard Chartered Still Bullish About BTC Standard Chartered is still bullish about crypto, expecting it to hit $200,000 by the end of the year and $500,000 over the next few years, despite the recent selloff. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital asset research at Standard Chartered, said he expects BTC to hit $200,000 this year. Kendrick stated, “Within the crypto ecosystem, what we need are traditional financial players, like Standard Chartered, BlackRock, and others that have the ETFs now to really step in. As the industry becomes more institutionalized, it should be safer.” He added that increased institutional crypto adoption and greater regulatory clarity in the US would reduce volatility over time. “That should add to that medium-term, top-side potential, which for me is bitcoin up to $200,000 this year and $500,000 before Trump leaves office.” BTC sank to levels not seen since November 2024 as a bearish week took its toll on the flagship asset. BTC and other cryptocurrencies declined due to uncertainty around tariffs and other macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. “Risk assets don’t like uncertainty and so that’s what we’ve seen. We’ve seen tech stocks in the U.S. coming lower. That should further legitimize, so you’ll see more U.S. banks involved. You’ll see larger institutions in the U.S. continue to push through.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) slumped to a low of $78,457 on February 28. However, buyers finally stepped in at lower levels, allowing the price to climb above $80,000 and move to its current level. According to CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju, selling after a 30% correction could be a mistake as BTC rose to a new all-time high after dropping 53% in 2021. Some whales have already begun accumulating, with one buying 4,000 BTC worth $344 million when the price was between $82,000 and $85,000. The whale, known as Spoofy, has a reputation for building its position extremely slowly and may buy more if the market drops further. The decline has not changed Standard Chartered’s long-term view of the asset, with the financial giant expecting BTC to hit $200,000 by the end of the year. BTC has traded in the red since the weekend, falling into the red after a move past the 20-day SMA on Thursday. Bears defended this level as markets turned red on Friday following the Bybit hack. As a result, BTC fell over 2% to slip below the 20-day SMA and settle at $96,184. BTC registered a marginal increase on Saturday but fell back in the red on Sunday to settle at $96,084 after a marginal decline. Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC plunged nearly 5% to go below $95,000 and settle at $91,622. Source: TradingView BTC fell below $90,000 on Tuesday, dropping to an intraday low of $85,985. The price recovered from this level but could not reclaim $90,000 and ultimately settled at $88,654. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC dropped over 5%, slipping below $85,000 and settling at $84,129. Despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, BTC registered a recovery on Thursday, rising to an intraday high of $87,045 before settling at $84,657, ultimately registering a marginal increase. Bearish sentiment intensified as BTC plunged below $80,000, falling to an intraday low of $78,179. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $80,000, move back above the 200-day SMA, and settle at $84,578. The current session sees BTC marginally up as it looks to reclaim $85,000. Buyers must reclaim $85,000 and push towards $90,000 to prevent a downtrend. If they reclaim these levels it could suggest a short-term bottom is in place. On the other hand, if BTC falls back into the red, it could drop below $75,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Zhao: Tokens sent will be left or burned Zhao’s announcement came with a pointed warning to those attempting to send tokens to his address, hoping for a response. “If you send funds to this address with the expectation that I will send them back so that you have a linked transaction or interaction with me, then you are greedy,” he stated.

Instead, Zhao plans to either leave the tokens untouched or burn them. “I will not endorse any tokens,” he emphasized. Zhao also briefly considered converting received tokens to BNB, similar to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s approach with unsolicited token sends. However, he abandoned this idea after considering market impact concerns for existing holders and the additional effort required. “I typically choose the least amount of work,” Zhao noted.

Economist Alex Krüger Says Potential Bear Trap Awaits BTC – Here Are His Targets,https://dailyhodl.com/2025/03/01/is-the-bitcoin-bottom-in-economist-alex-kruger-says-potential-bear-trap-awaits-btc-here-are-his-targets/,"A closely followed economist thinks that Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be forming a market bottom after a deep correction that tapped the $78,000 level. Alex Krüger tells his 206,200 followers on the social media platform X that if Bitcoin’s bottom is in, the flagship crypto asset will soon march back to $92,000. He also says a bear trap would be confirmed if Bitcoin reclaims $92,000 as support. A “bear trap” is when a price goes low enough to convince bears to sell or go short before quickly reversing in the opposite direction of their positions. “BTC did lose its prior range by a wide margin. If that was indeed a bottom would expect it to trade up to $89,000-$92,000 and then fall back to the $80,000s again to fill a new range. Above $92,000 you have a bear trap. Good year for active traders still ahead.” The economist also says there were likely multiple factors contributing to Bitcoin’s severe correction, but he believes the flagship crypto asset remains in a bull market cycle. “Noticing some confusion behind the drivers of this crypto crash. There have been multiple variables at play. Best not to try to find a single culprit. On the crypto side: [MicroStrategy founder Michael] Saylor blowing his entire $2 billion load in one sitting at $97,500. SOL implosion driven by unlocks and the Libra fraud making market participants question the casino investment thesis, [leading to] contagion. BTC multi-month range breakdown. On the macro side: Tariffs much more aggressive than expected. Higher inflation expectations print. Growth scare, partly driven by Trump lowering public spending, tariffs, and a few economic data points (fear is inconsistent with inflation expectations). Ironically, the US economy is in very good shape. Growing, around full employment, with inflation trending lower. That said, the market may just have bottomed overnight. Even if not the case, I find it very hard to see this as the beginning of a prolonged bear market.” Bitcoin is trading for $85,312 at time of writing, up over 5% in the last 24 hours.

Analysts foresee a significant upside for both, especially as the market braces for March 2025. Could Rollblock yield outsized gains amid widespread market uncertainty? Emerging cryptocurrency Rollblock gains attention While both Solana and Tron vie for whale allocations, an entirely different emerging cryptocurrency has entered the spotlight. Rollblock (RBLK) has garnered buzz due to its revenue-based tokenomics. Each week, the Rollblock casino platform dedicates up to 30% of its profits to buy back RBLK tokens, thereby reducing supply while rewarding holders. This real-world revenue model stands in stark contrast to purely speculative altcoins. Rollblock is still in presale, pricing tokens at $0.06 in stage 10. Already, the project has raised over $10 million. Intrigued whales foresee steady demand for RBLK if the platform’s user base grows. With many investors disillusioned by meme coin scams on Solana, a transparent buyback mechanism offers a more dependable approach to portfolio growth. For that reason, even some Tron advocates are diversifying into RBLK, viewing it as a hedge against broader market unpredictability. Solana price outlook: Uncertain times The SOL price dropped to around $135, well off its 2024 peak near $264. Analysts attribute the continued decline partly to an expected liquidation of $2.03 billion worth of SOL on March 1, 2025, linked to the FTX estate. This injection of tokens could inflate the circulating supply by about 2.4%, potentially pressuring the SOL price even more. Adding to Solana’s woes, a surge of meme coin scams has eroded investor sentiment. Some see $120–$140 as a crucial support range, with a final breakdown sending prices spiraling to lower levels. Technical analysts say a rebound above $185 might signal a reversal. Until then, the downtrend appears firmly in place, leaving whales looking for alternative plays. Why Tron attracts Solana whales As the SOL price falters, many whales pivot to Tron (TRX). Tron’s own chart reveals a descending channel, but key support near $0.22 could prompt a bounce. If TRX can defend this Fibonacci level and break channel resistance around $0.25–$0.27, an extended rally might follow. However, failing that scenario could spell a decline to $0.158. Beyond price action, Tron’s near-settlement with the SEC has stirred optimism. Founder Justin Sun has reportedly made progress resolving allegations of unregistered securities offerings and market manipulation, which could lift the regulatory cloud over TRX. If negotiations succeed, Tron may see renewed mainstream acceptance, enticing whales looking for stable midterm returns. Coupled with Solana’s uncertainty, TRX’s potential upside appears increasingly attractive. A strategy for February 2025 Solana whales searching beyond the SOL price see promise in Rollblock. Rollblock’s emerging cryptocurrency model presents a unique revenue-driven method that could sidestep typical bear-market pitfalls. As February 2025 approaches, the choice boils down to risk appetite. Solana could still recover if institutional interest in its technology remains strong. Tron might rally if the SEC settlement cements regulatory clarity. Yet, emerging cryptocurrency Rollblock offers a different value proposition altogether, one built on immediate profitability and token buybacks. Whales diversifying into RBLK appear to be wagering on more reliable returns in an otherwise unpredictable landscape—and many analysts think their bet may well pay off.

These purchases came at a time when Solana’s price reflected a rise of 5%. Arthur’s Big Bet on SOL According to his statement, he purchased SOL at $64 through Galaxy Digital and has now received the unlocked tokens. While many investors often sell their holdings once tokens are unlocked, Arthur has taken a different approach by choosing to hold. https://twitter.com/Arthur_0x/status/1895742016799334528 Despite the price fluctuations in the crypto market, Arthur has made it clear that he is holding onto his SOL tokens, believing that their value will increase significantly in the next three months. The crypto market has seen increased volatility, but Arthur’s optimism suggests that he expects a strong recovery and possible price rally for SOL. Solana Will Surge In 3 Months Arthur’s bullish stance is backed by several factors. However, the key reason could be the recent institutional interest in Solana. With large players like Galaxy Digital facilitating OTC transactions, it shows that institutional investors are also recognizing SOL’s potential. If this trend continues, Solana could see increased demand, pushing its price higher. Additionally, the network has been strengthening its position in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT spaces, attracting more users and investments. Solana Price Analysis Solana has faced a tough week, dropping 20% in value . However, it has since recovered most of its losses, and many now believe it could break the $150 resistance. Currently, Solana is trading around $141, showing a 4.3% increase, with its market cap reaching $71.5 billion. The main reason for this decline is the expected release of 11.2 million SOL tokens in March, belonging to the bankrupt FTX exchange.

Table of Contents Bitcoin bearish momentum: What next for investors? PropiChain: A rising star amid Bitcoin price slump Why PropiChain is a promising choice in 2025 The crypto market is in turmoil as the recent Bitcoin price crash has triggered panic and uncertainty among investors. With fears of a further Bitcoin price decline, savvy investors are looking for a high-growth alternative that offers more than a store of value. An emerging crypto, PropiChain (PCHAIN) , incorporates AI and blockchain to transform the lucrative real estate market. As Bitcoin struggles, the PCHAIN presale is selling out fast, proving a shift in the crypto market and that the PCHAIN crypto is a top choice for savvy investors. You might also like: Solana ETF filings: Investors turn to Propichain’s real estate ecosystem Bitcoin bearish momentum: What next for investors? The Bitcoin price has on Jan 25 dropped below the $90k mark, causing panic among investors. At press time, Bitcoin price is down 8.5% to trade at $86,582. The Bitcoin price movement marked a break from an ascending broadening wedge, which signifies a bearish pattern. In addition to the Bitcoin price drop, the US Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant outflows, with over $500 million in withdrawals in the past week. This signals growing caution among investors, contributing to the drop in Bitcoin prices. Again, macroeconomic factors, including speculation of tightening monetary policies, have led to Bitcoin’s volatility and a further decline in Bitcoin price. As investors seek more stable and high-growth crypto alternatives, PropiChain is emerging as a top pick. PropiChain: A rising star amid Bitcoin price slump As Bitcoin price slides downwards, investors are turning their attention to PropiChain, an emerging crypto set to disrupt the trillion-dollar real estate market. Unlike Bitcoin, which is a store of value, PropiChain incorporates AI and blockchain technology to offer real utility in real estate investment, making it a promising altcoin in the crypto market. One of PropiChain’s main appeals is its fractional ownership model, which allows investors to own portions of high-value real estate properties without a hefty capital requirement. For as low as $1,000, investors can own portions of a luxurious beachfront in Miami. The PCHAIN crypto also incorporates AI to assist investors in identifying potential properties using advanced filters resonating with unique investor preferences. Again, the platform has an automated valuation model (AVM) that offers real-time property valuation by assessing historical sales data and economic indicators. This guarantees an objective and current valuation that eliminates bias and human error. The PCHAIN crypto uses AI to provide round-the-clock support to investors. Virtual assistants and AI chatbots provide investors with real-time market analysis, property recommendations, and a streamlined investment process, making it easy for investors to make informed decisions at any time. PropiChain’s smart contracts, backed by BlockAudit security review, simplify property management, lease renewals, and rental payments. For example, tenants can set automated rental payments, which ensure timely payments and guarantee that landlords receive funds instantly. Another outstanding feature of the crypto is its Metaverse, which allows investors to take a virtual tour of listed properties. This feature enables investors to assess properties anywhere in the world from the comfort of their homes. Imagine exploring and assessing a property on the other side of the world without stepping foot in the physical property. Through the virtual tour, investors can make informed decisions and close on property deals. Why PropiChain is a promising choice in 2025 With the Bitcoin price facing bearish momentum, investors are flocking to the PropiChain presale, which is quickly selling out. Currently in stage 2, the PCHAIN tokens are priced at just $0.11, with the price set to rise to $0.023 in stage 3 to offer a 109% rise for early investors. Already, 63% of the allocated tokens in stage 2 are sold out, showing the crypto’s growing popularity. Given its real-world utility, AI-powered tools, and high growth potential, PCHAIN is proving to be a top choice as the Bitcoin price declines. With PropiChain’s recent listing on CoinMarketCap, this boosts the platform’s credibility and increases its accessibility to investors. As demand for the PropiChain crypto soars, the opportunity window is quickly closing, making this the ideal time to secure the PCHAIN tokens.

With a rise of over 30% in the past 48 hours, the token surpassed popular cryptos like Chainlink, Steller, & Litecoin to become the 11th largest crypto in the market. The growing strength of the token and the rise in bullish sentiments among the market participants suggest that the HBAR price is set to materialize a 60% rally to reach $1 soon. Why HBAR price is rising? Hedera is known for it’s strategic partnerships, which have strengthened the platform to a large extent. As per the new update, Swift, a global payment used by banks for international transfers, announced it’s partnership with Hedera by integrating it’s blockchain across North America, Europe, and Asia. https://twitter.com/Dagnum_PI/status/1895651088143135185 After this major step, the institutional adoption is set to increase over the Hedera network, which may also make the chain a leader in the world of cross-border payments. With this, the HBAR price is also expected to undergo a notable change and trigger a strong upswing soon. Will Hedera Price Reach $1? The HBAR price has raised above the 5-week descending trend with a strong upswing, which suggests the bulls have reclaimed their dominance over the token. Besides, the technicals have turned bullish, which suggests the price is about to initiate a fresh ascending trend towards new highs. The weekly chart of HBAR seems to be extremely bullish as the token is about to undergo the very first weekly Golden Cross. Besides, the weekly RSI has also triggered a bullish divergence before reaching the average levels. Therefore, the HBAR price is expected to revive a strong rise and reclaim 0.5 FIB at $0.289 in a short while.

BVI has been a preferred jurisdiction for crypto firms due to its business-friendly laws. LTP’s licensing reinforces BVI’s status as a global crypto hub. With the approval of these licenses, LTP can now operate as a fully compliant virtual asset and securities investment provider under the regulatory framework of the British Virgin Islands. The VASP license allows LTP to offer secure and transparent virtual asset transactions, while the SIB license enables the firm to engage in regulated securities investment activities. Notably, for LTP this approval of BVI licenses comes only after a week it secured Type 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9 licenses from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on 19 Feb.

It will also ensure its compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) regulations – building trust and security for institutional and retail investors. The other SIB license will permit LTP to conduct securities investments within a legally compliant framework. A Boost for Institutional Adoption and Global Expansion With these licenses, LTP is poised for rapid expansion into new markets while offering institutional investors a regulated and secure environment for digital asset investments. Industry experts see this as a positive signal for broader institutional adoption of blockchain-based financial services. The ability to provide regulated services under BVI FSC oversight adds credibility and legitimacy to LTP’s operations, encouraging more firms to explore digital assets within a compliant framework. Since the crypto space has long struggled with regulatory uncertainty, LTP, by securing BVI FSC licenses, can set a precedent for compliance. It will further help in attracting institutional investors who seek regulated platforms, building greater trust, and a more secure trading environment. Final Thoughts LTP’s successful acquisition of VASP and SIB licenses marks a landmark moment for the company and the broader digital asset industry. A s regulatory clarity becomes increasingly essential for crypto firms, securing these approvals demonstrates LTP’s commitment to long-term sustainability and investor trust.

Some U.S. states are now considering adopting Bitcoin reserves before the federal government takes similar action. State-Level Bitcoin Adoption Certain states have taken legislative steps toward establishing Bitcoin reserves. Some are in the final stages of approving bills that would allow state treasuries to hold Bitcoin as part of their reserves. Others have initiated discussions on how integrating Bitcoin into state financial systems could provide a hedge against inflation and economic instability. However, not all states have embraced the idea. Several have rejected proposals related to Bitcoin reserves, highlighting concerns over volatility and regulatory uncertainty. This divide showcases the varying perspectives on cryptocurrency adoption within the U.S. Federal Government’s Stance on Bitcoin Reserves At the federal level, discussions around Bitcoin reserves have been more measured. Recent executive orders have explored the feasibility of a national Bitcoin stockpile, with some officials advocating for a sovereign wealth fund that includes digital assets. Despite these developments, state governments are likely to move faster than the federal government in adopting Bitcoin reserves. The decentralized nature of state decision-making allows for more rapid policy changes, potentially setting a precedent for broader national adoption in the future. Implications for Bitcoin Adoption If states begin incorporating Bitcoin into their reserves, it could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency market. Increased governmental adoption could: Strengthen Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a store of value Influence future regulatory frameworks Encourage institutional investors to increase their exposure to digital assets Conclusion As some states lead the charge in integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies, they may set the stage for broader adoption at the national level. While the federal government remains cautious, the momentum at the state level suggests that Bitcoin’s role in governmental reserves could expand in the near future.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-01 13:28:00

Fast-forward to today, and a new player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is predicted to achieve a similar meteoric rise in just two months with its ambitious roadmap and growing investor interest. Mutuum Finance is in Phase 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.015 each. The project has quickly gained traction, raising over $1.6 million and drawing in more than 3,100 holders within days. However, the window to buy at this price is closing fast, as the next phase will bring a 33.33% increase to $0.02. Those who get in during Phase 2 stand to see a 300% ROI when the token launches at $0.06. Mutuum Finance could hit $12.16 if it follows the 20260% surge. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): the hottest DeFi presale right now Mutuum Finance is trending in the crypto market, with its presale gaining serious momentum. MUTM tokens are currently priced at $0.015, but as the presale progresses through its 11 phases, that price is set to rise, reaching $0.06 at launch. This guarantees phase 2 investors a 300% return before public trading even begins. Analysts are eyeing a potential post-launch price of $12.50, if the token mirrors XRP’s growth. With over $1.6 million already raised and more than 3,100 investors on board, Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be a DeFi top performer. A next-level approach to DeFi lending Mutuum Finance is changing the way people borrow and lend money in crypto. It has two ways to do this: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) Lending: You can put stablecoins like USDT into special money pools run by smart contracts (computer programs that handle money safely). You earn rewards, and borrowers can take out crypto loans instantly. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending: Users can borrow and lend directly to each other. They agree on loan terms, interest rates, and what they will use as security (collateral) without any middlemen. By offering both options, Mutuum Finance makes borrowing and lending faster, easier, and more flexible. Algorithmic stablecoins lose their value quickly, but Mutuum Finance’s USD-pegged stablecoin is different. It is fully backed by real assets, meaning its price stays steady. If you have $10,000 in crypto, you can borrow up to $8,000 in stablecoins. Massive rewards & community growth To fuel adoption, Mutuum Finance is giving away $100,000, with 10 lucky winners receiving $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. Plus, their referral program rewards users who bring in new investors, helping expand the community at lightning speed. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining serious traction, drawing in over 3,100 investors and raising $1.6 million in just days. Its cutting-edge lending model and structured presale have positioned it as one of the most promising DeFi projects in 2025. While XRP delivered an incredible 20,260% ROI over a decade, MUTM has the potential to reach similar heights in just two months. The current price of $0.015 won’t last long, as the next presale phase will push it up to $0.02, a 33.33% increase. By the time it launches at $0.06, early investors will already be sitting on a 300% return, before the real growth even begins. The window to buy at this low price is closing fast, making now the best time to get in before the next surge.

This dip saw BTC deviate from previous cycles. Despite the recent decline, there may be hope for a recovery, as BTC price performance mirrors that of the world’s largest asset by market cap, gold. Bitcoin price today trades at $84,459 after a 5% increase in 24 hours. Bitcoin Price Mirrors Gold’s Rally – Is $125K Next? Bitcoin, also labeled as digital gold, is mimicking gold’s price rally. According to analyst Ash Crypto, the recent liquidation event that wiped billions of dollars from the Bitcoin futures market is similar to what happened to gold in the last quarter of 2024. In his analysis, he predicted that BTC price has likely bottomed up, and could be ready for the next leg up towards $125,000. BTC vs. Gold The recent Trump tariff woes have boded well for gold prices as the asset recently reached an all-time high above $2,900 per ounce. If BTC is indeed following gold’s price, it may be in a brief correction phase before making a strong recovery. Can Bitcoin Price Rally by 13% in March? Bitcoin may also repeat its past performance in March if it follows historical cycles. This is because March has historically been the third-best month for BTC price, with an average return of 13.12%. BTC Historical Performance If Bitcoin were to see a similar trend this month, it could potentially recover past $100,000 and target $125K. Analyst Based Money mapped this path for a recovery saying that it could attain this price between March and April. BTC/USD: 1-day Chart However, it is important to note that BTC did not perform well in February like it did in previous years. Therefore, this rally is contingent on new buyers entering the market after Bitcoin price entered a “shopping area.” According to analyst IT Tech, the recent drawdown in BTC price has pushed it to a key demand zone that has previously coincided with accumulation phases. BTC Price Distribution One of the catalysts that could support a bullish Bitcoin price forecast is the upcoming White House crypto summit . Past trends show that Trump’s crypto events have often boded well for BTC, and if this happens again, it could drive another price rally. Key Levels to Watch in Bitcoin Price Bitcoin price has dropped to oversold levels, which often precedes a correction to the upside. If this seller’s exhaustion coincides with a surge in demand, the king coin can bounce to the first key resistance level of $91,579. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart The widening Bollinger bands indicate that Bitcoin is likely to face more volatile price swings. The price is fluctuating at the lower band showing oversold conditions. For a strong bullish momentum and price recovery, the asset needs to reach the middle band of $93,614. Conclusion Bitcoin price is mirroring gold’s recent rally after the recent liquidation event. At the same time, March has always boded well for BTC price, with average returns of around 13%. If these past trends repeat, Bitcoin price could likely rally past $125K in March 2025.

In a recent development, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin expressed support for Ver, urging the government for his release. However, DOGE agency’s Elon Musk has reversed his stance on Roger Ver’s pardon. He argued that Ver is no longer eligible for a presidential pardon since he renounced his US citizenship. Vitalik Buterin Supports Bitcoin Jesus, Calls for Pardon Notably, Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum blockchain’s co-founder, is raising concerns over Roger Ver’s politically motivated prison sentence. In his latest X post , Vitalik Buterin speaks out against the injustice against Ver, who is currently facing life imprisonment for non-violent tax offenses. Buterin thinks the case is driven by political agendas, drawing parallels with Ross Ulbricht’s case, which highlights inconsistent sentencing practices. In addition, Vitalik Buterin stated that Roger Ver’s outspoken advocacy for freedom and his rejection of coercive state power may have made him a target for selective prosecution. The Ethereum founder argued that this is a tactic used to undermine constitutional protections like the First Amendment, which guarantees free speech. Harsh Tax Regime: Ethereum Founder Demands Fundamental Rights Protection Furthermore, Vitalik Buterin criticized the US tax regime. He stated that the tax-by-citizenship and exit tax system are extreme compared to other countries. The United Kingdom, for example, only charges capital gains if an individual returns within five years. Notably, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) accused Ver of evading $48 million in taxes in April 2024. Subsequently, he was arrested in Spain. He is currently in Spain and may soon be extradited to the US for a possible sentence of 109 years. Addressing these concerns, Vitalik Buterin prioritized the need to oppose such practices as they erode fundamental rights. He advocated for treating “genuine good faith mistakes” like Roger Ver’s with penalties and similar measures, rather than prosecuting them. The Ethereum founder is notably a proponent of security and user protection. Recently, Buterin highlighted the significance of tackling crypto losses caused by non-thefts. Elon Musk Denies Support for Roger Ver’s Pardon In contrast to Vitalik Buterin’s support for Ver, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Chief Elon Musk has refused to back him. Citing Ver’s renunciation of US citizenship as the reason, Musk stated that he is now not eligible for a presidential pardon. Musk implies that Ver has relinquished his eligibility for a presidential pardon, along with other privileges and protections afforded to US citizens. Elon Musk’s recent statement contrasts with his previous support for Ver. Previously, Elon Musk endorsed a pardon for Ver, ahead of Ross Ulbricht’s release. His views reignited the discussion on fair treatment for crypto innovators, drawing comparisons to his own experiences challenging regulatory frameworks.

Due to its unique corporate investment strategy, this software development company has bought BTC for over two years. During this journey, the firm has significantly affected the price of this crypto token and vice versa. As a result, the MSTR trades at $255.5 amid the crypto market’s downtrend, but this could be the best time to buy this asset. Why? Let’s discuss this. MSTR Stock Drop to $255, Time To Buy? MSTR stock hit its prime of $478.83 in November 2024, after Donald Trump’s win in the US election. This happened as Trump became a pro-crypto supporter and promised crypto regulations and developments, affecting Microstegy’s valuation. However, the broader crypto market crash caused the stock valuation to drop to $240.05 before recovering today. After a 7% surge, it currently trades at $255.58, but investors anticipate higher growth with the market’s recovery. Even analysts believe that this asset is undervalued and should be bought. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation has given its stock strong historical returns, outperforming others, but there’s more to come. Recent reports reveal that MicroStrategy’s yearly returns reached 165%, whereas others like NVDA, TSLA, META, etc, did not meet half of that. As a result, the Michael Saylor and team’s commitment to BTC turned fruitful. More importantly, MicroStrategy’s recent $2 billion BTC purchase shows its resilience and strategy commitment. As long as Bitcoin moves, the stock price will increase. Microstrategy Stock’s Historical Performance and Bitcoin Exposure MicroStrategy’s stock performance is closely tied with Bitcoin price movements. Historical data reveals that the MSTR stock price rose with the BTC bull run, and vice versa, and the current scenario is a testament to that. As the investors have tied the performance of the two, MSTR is anticipated to see higher returns with the Bitcoin price rally. If an uptrend occurs, MicroStrategy stock will likely move on a similar trajectory, making the current level perfect for buying. MSTR Stock Price Prediction: 370% Rally Underway MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR) on the NASDAQ charts shows that the price is testing its 200-day simple moving average. This SMA is a historically proven support level; the last time this happened, the stock price surged by 372%. If the same happens, the MSTR stock price will witness a 370% rally as the buyers step in, and the 200-day SMA could act as the launchpad for the rally. More importantly, Michaell Saylor and MicroStrategy’s connection with Bitcoin and the crypto market recovery to fuel this rally. Despite that, investors must look for further confirmation signals, as if the stock fails to hold the support, it may decline further. Should You Buy MSTR? MicroStrategy stock is at its lowest point in months, which some analysts have regarded as a dip opportunity. At $255.5, it can become a compelling opportunity if the price recovers with the Bitcoin price movement. Analysts also forecasted a 370% rally based on the historical trend and the crucial support touching the 200-day EMA. A bounce from that is the path towards a 370% rally. However, there are some regulatory and volatility-related concerns, and its performance tied to BTC could cause fluctuations. Investors must investigate further and decide accordingly.

Seeing your blockchain project go from a spark of inspiration to a fully functioning operation is a thrilling journey—one that more women than ever are stepping up to lead. Below are five ways women can smoothly guide their blockchain ventures from concept to launch while building resilient, inclusive foundations along the way. You might also like: Top five blockchain analytics trends for 2025 | Opinion 1. Develop a clear, actionable roadmap Every transformative idea begins with a strong vision, but the key to success lies in translating that vision into concrete steps. How to do it: Break your concept down into milestones—each tied to tangible goals, timelines, and budgetary requirements. This keeps both you and your team focused on the path ahead rather than overwhelmed by the big picture. 2. Tap into female-focused networks and mentorship Organizations like SheFi, HerDAO, BeraBaddies, Chipped Social, and Boys Club (yes, they champion women, too!) are vital resources for forging partnerships, seeking mentorship, and finding support at any stage. How to do it: Proactively join these communities, attend their events, and stay engaged through their online channels. Surround yourself with women (and allies) who have navigated similar challenges and can offer guidance, introductions, and moral support. 3. Prioritize the right talent and collaboration Building a strong team often requires expertise in areas like smart contract development, marketing, product management, and community engagement. Hiring the right mix of talent—or partnering with complementary projects—can accelerate progress. How to do it: Emphasize shared values and enthusiasm for blockchain during the recruitment process. Seek advisors who believe in your project’s mission and can open doors in the industry. 4. Secure funding strategically Female founders can face hurdles in fundraising, but the growing recognition of women-led ventures is helping shift the investment landscape. How to do it: Research venture capital firms and angel networks that specifically invest in women-led or diverse startups. Craft a compelling pitch that showcases your project’s unique angle, feasibility, and market potential. Use your network to request warm introductions, and practice your pitch until it resonates with both technical and non-technical audiences. 5. Foster an inclusive community early on Blockchain thrives on collaboration and shared ownership. By cultivating a supportive community around your project from the start, you’ll build trust, gather user feedback, and gain brand ambassadors. How to do it: Use social channels, online forums, and Ask Me Anything, or AMA, sessions to engage users at each stage. Encourage open discussion and invite others—especially women newcomers—to co-create with you. Early adopters often become your most enthusiastic advocates. Final thoughts As more women enter the blockchain space, we’re collectively shaping its future—filling it with diverse perspectives and fresh approaches. By laying out a clear roadmap, leveraging supportive networks, assembling the right talent, securing targeted funding, and building inclusive communities, women can confidently move from ideation to operational excellence in this evolving industry.

Zelenskyy was kicked out of the White House yesterday, with Trump taking to social media to blast him for not being thankful. According to reports from the polygon-based betting platform Polymarket, users are now placing wagers on how long the Ukrainian president will remain in his role. More than $500,000 in bets have been placed by crypto bettors on Zelenskyy leaving office before July. While the platform notes that Zelenskyy’s fate hangs in the balance, it puts the likelihood of an early departure at 26%. The Ukrainian president visited the White House yesterday in what was supposed to be a high-stakes negotiation. However, things went sideways when the negotiation became explosive at the Oval Office. Zelenskyy ended up walking out and Trump made it clear that a peace deal was off the table for now. Bets on Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy leaving office before July 2025 have surpassed $500,000. Source: Polymarket Zelenskyy’s heated meeting with Donald Trump Zelenskyy met with US President Donald Trump and his Vice JD Vance at the Oval Office, discussing the ongoing war with Russia and other deals. The subject proved to be a touchy one as it ended in disagreement, with Trump accusing Zelenskyy of being an uncooperative ally. He also said he didn’t even show any gratitude towards the United States. Trump mentioned that during the negotiations, it was evident that Zelenskyy still had hate towards Putin in his heart, noting that he won’t be able to make a deal with that kind of hate. “You see the hatred he’s got for Putin, that’s very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate,” Trump said. According to reports, Trump accused Zelenskyy of not acknowledging and appreciating the efforts of the United States to back Ukraine in the war that has now reached three years. President Donald Trump shared a statement after his heated Oval Office meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky. Source: @ realDonaldTrump (X/Twitter) According to sources inside the room, Trump wanted Zelenskyy to make a minerals deal with the United States, with the US President pressing him for the deal. “You don’t have the cards right now,” he said. “You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out, and if we’re out, you’ll fight it out and I don’t think it’s going to be pretty.” Trump also accused the Ukrainian president of gambling with World War III, noting that he was using the United States’ involvement in the ongoing war as a bargaining chip. Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky argue during their Oval Office meeting on February 28, 2025. Source: Yahoo Finance Crypto bettors want Zelenskyy to be ‘thankful’ Currently, crypto bettors have wagered more than $21 million on the likelihood of Ukraine’s war with Russia ending in the first three months of Trump’s reign as president. Trump had promised during his campaign that he was going to do everything in his capacity to ensure that the war ends when he gets into the Oval Office. According to records on Polymarket, the likelihood of the bet now stands at 23% following the meeting on Friday. Meanwhile, users on the platform have begun to show their frustrations, urging Zelenskyy to show gratitude to the United States for helping his country. A user on the platform said: “[Zelenskyy] should’ve thanked the American people, how hard can it be to show some gratitude?” Polymarket has hosted similar wagers on its platform, with the betting website allowing crypto bettors to wager on the likelihood of former President Joe Biden dropping out of the 2024 United States presidential contest. The website also opened up wagers to crypto bettors for the winner of the 2024 United States presidential election, tipping the eventual winner, Donald Trump for a win ahead of opponent, Kamala Harris. “Prediction markets give people a financial motivation for conducting thorough research and making rational analysis before placing their bets, and they provide a much higher level of accuracy versus traditional polling because of this financial motivation,” a former exec at Polygon Labs said. Ukraine is now proposing a crypto tax of up to 10% to support its economy, with the promise of additional support from the United States dwindling.

Such a substantial price decline naturally brings the question of whether this is just another ‘normal’ dip or whether the bull market has been cut short. End of Bull Market Narrative Who else can lead the ‘end of the bull market’ sentiment other than the permanent BTC bear – Peter Schiff? After all, he uses every opportunity to bash the asset, even if it’s charting massive gains and outperforming his favorite asset – gold. So, what would he do when bitcoin’s price is tumbling – that’s right, go on a bashing spree? In his latest barrage against the largest cryptocurrency, he advised people to move away from its ‘bear market rally’ and join the ‘bull market rally’ in gold as both headed in different directions on Friday. BTC finally bounced off after several days of consecutive declines and went from the aforementioned multi-month low to $84,000-$86,000. In contrast, the precious metal retracted to under $2,850. Bitcoin rallied back from below $79K to above $84K. Meanwhile gold corrected from above $2,950 to below $2,850. This is a great opportunity to use Bitpay to sell the bear market rally in Bitcoin and buy the bull market dip in gold. https://t.co/P21SuYSUub — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) February 28, 2025 Although he’s always pessimistic, Schiff’s words are not without merit. Aside from the dropping BTC price, the network behind the asset has seen a substantial decline in terms of activity and even hash rate and mining difficulty in the past few weeks. All of those, combined with the growing number of ETF outflows in the States, as well as Trump’s controversial policies, have led many to question whether the curtain has closed on this cycle’s bull run. Even February betrayed BTC. A historically bullish month, especially after a halving year, has brought tons of gains for the asset. However, February 2025 turned out to be the worst for BTC’s price in over a decade . The Not-So-Fast Narrative BTC is known for its highly volatile price moves in both directions. It has a long history of going down by double-digits after an explosive rally, and many argued that there wasn’t a real correction during this cycle, although it dipped toward $90,000 on a couple of occasions after it peaked above $100,000. In fact, even the one that brought it to $78,000 on Friday, which is a 28% drop from the all-time high in January, is not that violent compared to previous crashes.

He highlights futarchy, distilled human judgment, and deep funding as potential models. The approach could reshape DAOs by ensuring fairer and more efficient decision-making. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a governance model that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) while ensuring human oversight. In a post on X, Buterin outlined how AI could enhance decision-making in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) without concentrating power in a single AI system. Rather than allowing AI to dictate governance, Buterin suggests using it as an “engine” while humans act as the “steering wheel.” He envisions a system where AI processes large-scale data and makes predictions, while human referees verify and adjust outcomes. This approach aims to balance efficiency and decentralization, preventing undue influence from any single entity.

Early investors are taking notice of Mutuum Finance, a DeFi initiative that is growing thanks to its structured lending approach, passive income potential, and overcollateralized stablecoin rapidly. Meanwhile, PEPE struggles to regain momentum, facing weak buying pressure and uncertain price action. Pepe (PEPE) struggling to recover Pepe (PEPE) has had a rough start to 2025, with its price dropping 57% since the beginning of the year. While it has seen some minor rebounds, currently hovering around $0.0000082, buying pressure remains weak. Technical indicators show no clear breakout signal, keeping investors cautious about its next move. PEPE remains below important resistance levels even after a 6.7% increase over the past day. Although the charts’ falling wedge structure points to a possible rebound, indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator (AO) and Bull Bear Power (BBP) indicate a lack of momentum. PEPE may drop much lower to $0.0000065 if selling pressure persists, but a change in market attitude may allow it to recover $0.0000090 or more. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) With many experienced crypto investors moving away from struggling assets like PEPE, attention is shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a project with real financial utility. Currently in its second presale phase, Mutuum Finance has already raised over $1.7 million, with 35% of this phase completed. The first phase sold out quickly, successfully distributing 110 million tokens. The presale consists of 11 phases, with a final launch price of $0.06, but experts predict a much higher valuation post-launch. Given the demand and structured financial model, a minimum 1100% surge after launch is expected as the project gains traction. Strong liquidity and continuous incentives are guaranteed via Mutuum Finance’s token allocation. While a number of tokens fund liquidity, ecosystem growth, community awards, and strategic collaborations, a sizable amount of tokens are allocated to the presale. Early investors’ trust is strengthened by Mutuum Finance’s effective supply design, which guarantees long-term sustainability. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? The platform is designed for decentralized lending and borrowing, providing users with the ability to supply assets, earn passive income, and access liquidity without selling their holdings. Borrowers can secure overcollateralized loans, while lenders benefit from competitive interest rates based on pool utilization. Mutuum’s buy-and-distribute mechanism further strengthens token demand, ensuring consistent buy pressure as platform fees are reinvested into MUTM. Another key development is the team’s plan to introduce an overcollateralized stablecoin, offering a secure and decentralized way to access liquidity. Unlike centralized stablecoins, this asset will be backed by collateral within Mutuum’s ecosystem, maintaining a stable value while enhancing the platform’s utility. Mutuum Finance is launching a $100,000 giveaway to incentivize early supporters and strengthen community participation. Participants can join by interacting on social media, referring friends, and staying active. More details on how to enter can be found on the official website. Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the strongest investment opportunities in DeFi. With a fully decentralized lending system, an overcollateralized stablecoin in development, and a structured buy-and-distribute model, the project is built for long-term success. As the presale advances toward higher phases, the price of MUTM will continue to rise, making this phase one of the last chances to enter at $0.015. Investors looking for a high-growth project with strong fundamentals and increasing market demand are seeing Mutuum Finance as the best option before March 2025.

This $0.20 Token Looks Like a Stronger Bet appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Rexas Finance (RXS) is attracting major attention as it nears the final stages of its presale, raising over $44.5 million. Meanwhile, Pepe Coin (PEPE) is approaching a crucial resistance level, sparking speculation on whether it can replicate its past gains. While PEPE faces uncertainty, RXS stands out with a strong ecosystem, making it a compelling alternative for investors. Rexas Finance Revolutionizes Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance is reshaping crypto by tokenizing illiquid assets, including real estate, luxury goods, and fine art. This approach makes high-value investments more accessible, ensuring broader financial participation. Unlike speculation-driven altcoins, RXS offers tangible utility, positioning itself as a leader in blockchain-powered finance. Currently in its 12th stage of presale at $0.20 RXS is all set for its official launch on June 19th, 2025 at $0.25 which is an 8x surge from the initial price of 0.03. The Rexas Token Builder simplifies token creation by allowing users to launch assets without coding expertise. Additionally, the QuickMint Bot integrates with Telegram and Discord, making instant tokenization seamless. These tools make RXS an essential platform for businesses and startups looking to enter the crypto market efficiently. Security remains a priority, with a CertiK audit confirmation of Rexas Finance’s adherence to high standards. Investors benefit from increased confidence as the platform integrates AI-driven tools for market analysis and cybersecurity. With its listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, RXS strengthens its credibility among global investors. Pepe Coin Faces Key Resistance and Market Uncertainty Pepe Coin is trading at $0.00001044 after a 9.43% increase in the current session. To maintain bullish momentum, the token must break the $0.0000117 resistance level. If successful, PEPE could see a 50% rally toward $0.00001785. However, failure to hold its position could lead to a steep decline, potentially dropping to $0.00000688. The composite volume profile indicates heavy accumulation, making current price levels crucial for traders. A decisive breakout could trigger renewed investor interest, while a rejection may drive further selling pressure. Despite its recent gains, PEPE relies on market speculation, which introduces risks for long-term investors. With BTC nearing $100,000 and the total market cap reaching $3.23 trillion, bullish sentiment persists. However, compared to RXS, PEPE lacks a comprehensive financial ecosystem supporting sustained growth. Rexas Finance Emerges as the Stronger Investment Rexas Finance stands apart from a diverse ecosystem, including the Rexas Treasury, a decentralized investment platform. The Rexas Estate marketplace facilitates real estate tokenization, while the Rexas Launchpad supports blockchain entrepreneurs. These utilities establish RXS as more than just a token, reinforcing its role in decentralized finance.

TRON Hits 42% Share As USDT, DeFi Explode",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-transaction-king-tron-hits-42-share-as-usdt-defi-explode/,"Tron (TRX) is demonstrating its status as a dominant force in the realm of altcoin transactions. The network has established itself as one of the busiest blockchain networks by capturing a significant 42% proportion of all altcoin transactions. Tron’s dominance is becoming increasingly apparent due to its expanding role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and its efficient system for managing Tether (USDT) transfers. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Overextended—Is A Market Shakeup Imminent? Tron’s Position In The Altcoin Market Tron has established itself as the foundation for stablecoin transfers, processing millions of transactions each day. The blockchain is a critical factor in the growth of its market share, as it processes a substantial portion of USDT transactions. For merchants and investors seeking to efficiently transfer funds, Tron is an appealing option due to its low fees and high transaction speeds. TRON Leads Altcoin Transactions with 41.6%, Driven by USDT and DeFi Growth! “This chart shows the transaction percentage of major altcoins (ex. SOL and BNB) over time. Tron Network has the highest share, staying around 40%. In recent days, it reached 41.6%.” – By @JA_Maartun pic.twitter.com/Eeq0JylaxV — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 26, 2025 Tron’s domination extends beyond the realm of small-scale activity, according to a research by CryptoQuant. The fact that the network currently controls 70% of all USDT transfers is a clear sign that users prefer the network over competitors such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Because of this, Tron’s entire USDT supply share has climbed to 43%, which is on the verge of reaching its highest level ever recorded. A Closer Examination Of The Data The statistics are the foundation of Tron’s strength. The network processes more than 14 million USDT transactions per week, according to recent statistics. The volume alone is sufficient to establish it as a leader among the majority of altcoins, demonstrating its increasing importance in the cryptosphere. Even though there are still a lot of transactions going on, Tron’s price has been holding steady. In the past day, TRX has gone up 7.7% and now trades at about $0.23. Even though this may not seem like a big step, the network’s steady growth shows that its strong base is helping to keep its value. Related Reading: Dogecoin Demand Slumps—Nearly 70% Drop In Open Interest Raises Concerns What Does This Mean For The Price Of TRX? The big question remains—will Tron’s transaction dominance lead to a surge in TRX’s price? Market analysts believe that increased network usage could push TRX to higher levels. Some predictions even suggest the token could hit $1.11, representing a 444% gain from its current price. However, history has demonstrated that many transactions do not immediately result in price increases. Investors sentiment and the overall health of the market are only two of the several other factors that will impact TRX’s price trajectory.

He urged direct ownership as protection against what he describes as a corrupt banking system. In a recent X post, Kiyosaki advised against gold, silver, or Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs, labeling them “banksters’ money.” He further highlighted distinctions between traditional financial instruments and direct asset ownership amid his predictions of financial system failure. Is BITCOIN a SCAM? It might be…. But not a big a scam as the US Dollar and the US Banking System…. Starting with the Fed. They are BANKSTERS. For example…. When they F. U. and lose billions…. The criminals at the Fed bail them out. They should go to jail. That’s… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) March 1, 2025 “Is BITCOIN a SCAM? It might be…. But not as big a scam as the US Dollar and the US Banking System…. Starting with the Fed,” Kiyosaki stated. He characterized central bankers as “BANKSTERS” who receive government bailouts after losing billions, arguing they “should go to jail” instead. Kiyosaki says Bitcoin is on sale The author’s commentary comes during a period of Bitcoin price volatility. On February 27, as cryptocurrency prices declined, Kiyosaki viewed the downturn as an opportunity, declaring “BITCOIN CRASHING. Bitcoin is on SALE. I AM BUYING.” He attributed the underlying issues not to Bitcoin itself but to America’s monetary system and banking sector. Kiyosaki spoke about the U.S. financial situation, claiming the country faces bankruptcy with over $230 trillion in combined debt when including social programs and unfunded liabilities beyond the official $36 trillion national debt. He predicted that when major holders like Japan and China stop purchasing U.S. bonds, “inflation will go through the roof,” potentially causing economic collapse and dollar devaluation. The financial author has consistently advocated for tangible assets during economic uncertainty. In a separate tweet focusing on silver, Kiyosaki suggested the metal is positioned for notable growth. He has predicted a rise from approximately $32 per ounce to $70 within a year once gold breaks through $3,000. SOMETHING MOVING UNDER SILVER MARKET…. When gold goes through $3,000 a new all time high…my sources say SILVER will take off. Silver is the best investment at the best price. Silver is still about 50% below its all time high. I believe silver at $32.00 an ounce will within… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 26, 2025 His perspective on asset prices shows his views on inflation and currency devaluation: “The price of gold, silver, and Bitcoin aren’t going up.

Kaspa Price Dips 17% & Tron Price Prediction Shows Rally!,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-x1-miner-app-explodes-with-500k-users-onboard-kaspa-price-dips-17-tron-price-prediction-shows-rally/,"Digital assets continue to rise, with over 10,000 different cryptocurrencies experiencing constant price swings. Market volatility remains high, and many traders closely watch price movements for potential opportunities. Recent trends in the Kaspa price prediction suggest a bearish outlook, with KAS needing a significant 30% gain to reach $0.14047. This struggle leaves many market participants uncertain. On the other hand, Tron’s price movement sparks optimism as TRX heads toward its $0.30 goal. While these coins battle market shifts, a fresh contender, BlockDAG (BDAG) , is rapidly making waves. Its environmentally friendly X1 mining app is driving major adoption, with 500,000+ users actively mining BDAG. With the presale approaching $200 million, BlockDAG is emerging as the best crypto to buy and mine now. Kaspa Price Prediction: Struggles Persist Amid Market Uncertainty Kaspa’s market activity has been largely negative, showing a 17% decline over the past 30 days. This prolonged downturn signals ongoing market hesitation. Over the past three months, KAS has witnessed multiple 30% declines, making its near-term recovery difficult. Even on a broader scale, the long-term outlook remains weak, with a 40% drop recorded last year. For Kaspa to reach its next key target of $0.1404, a substantial upward movement is required. However, current trends indicate a struggle to achieve this level. The Fear & Greed Index currently places Kaspa at a score of 44, reflecting overall cautious sentiment. The coin’s future remains closely tied to market volatility, with an expected monthly fluctuation of around 14.42%. Tron (TRX) Price Prediction: Aiming for a Strong Breakout Tron’s recent performance has caught attention, with a 3.01% rise in just 24 hours, bringing its value to $0.2430. With increasing bullish activity, TRX is inching closer to breaking past $0.2470, a move that could signal a larger market breakout. Over the past four years, the Tron network has seen $56 billion in total value flow through it, marking a tenfold increase from its earlier days. As the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector expands, the TRX price prediction remains optimistic, with market demand pushing further growth. If TRX surpasses its key resistance level, achieving a $0.30 milestone remains a strong possibility. Despite minor short-term fluctuations, the long-term outlook suggests a steady upward trend for Tron. BlockDAG’s X1 Miner Hits 500K Users: A Game Changer for Mining! BlockDAG’s eco-friendly X1 mining app has achieved a significant milestone, surpassing 500,000 users. This influx of dedicated crypto-miners to the BlockDAG community is largely attributed to the user-friendly and environmentally conscious X1 Miner app. Mining crypto has traditionally been a complex and resource-intensive process, but the X1 Miner app revolutionizes this with its simplicity and sustainability. The app features a streamlined interface, minimal setup requirements, and numerous incentives for users. With just a simple tap, users can mine 20 BDAG coins using the app. These factors contribute to making BlockDAG the premier cryptocurrency for mining today. The convenience of using the X1 app, coupled with its compatibility with iOS and Android devices and its small size of only 50MB, enhances its appeal. In addition to the success of the X1 app, BlockDAG’s presale is drawing significant interest, having already amassed over $199.7 million. Projections suggest that the BDAG coin will hit the $1 mark with the upcoming launch of the mainnet. Early adopters who mine BDAG stand to see substantial returns, positioning BlockDAG as the best crypto to mine in 2025. Best Crypto to Buy Now! The cryptocurrency market remains unpredictable, with coins like Kaspa facing prolonged price struggles, while Tron shows strong potential for an upcoming breakout. However, the real standout in this space is BlockDAG. With its X1 mining app making mining accessible and eco-friendly, plus a rapidly growing community of 500,000+ users, BlockDAG is surging forward. Its presale is nearing $200 million, adding further credibility to its strong momentum. While Kaspa and Tron continue to generate discussion, BlockDAG’s rising adoption and technological advantages make it a prime contender in the market, solidifying its status as the best crypto to buy and mine now.

Meanwhile, Rollblock (RBLK) is attracting thousands of new investors, driving its presale to new heights with over $10.7 million generated in ICO funding. With its innovative blockchain gaming ecosystem and impressive revenue-sharing system, Rollblock is quickly becoming a standout choice in GameFi. Having already rallied 500%, investors are rushing in to secure positions before its price climbs higher in the coming weeks. Rollblock (RBLK): The Next Big Player in Blockchain Gaming Rollblock is rapidly emerging as a gaming powerhouse, leading the evolution of iGaming with its cutting-edge play-to-earn ecosystem. With over 50,000 active members and over $10.7 million raised in its presale, the platform is on a trajectory for massive expansion. The platform offers an extensive collection of over 7,000 games, appealing to traditional gamers and blockchain enthusiasts. The recent introduction of sports bidding has expanded its reach, transforming Rollblock into a comprehensive decentralized entertainment hub. Through its sportsbook users can bid on major events such as the Premier League and UFC, which increases the platform’s overall appeal. The platform prioritizes security and gives users a transparent and unbiased gaming experience. Regulatory approval from SolidProof and an Anjouan Gaming license reinforce Rollblock’s credibility, setting it apart in an industry often plagued by trust issues. Furthermore, Rollblock’s deflationary tokenomics model strengthens its long-term value, making RBLK a highly attractive investment. Each week up to thirty percent of the platform’s revenue is allocated to token buybacks, with 60% of repurchased tokens permanently burned to reduce supply. The remaining 40% is distributed as staking rewards, providing up to 30% APY for investors and players. With major exchange listings on the horizon, investment demand is accelerating. Stage 10 tokens are selling fast at $0.06, and investors can still take advantage of a 50% limited-time bonus on all RBLK purchases heading into March. Dogecoin Struggles With Bearish Momentum Dogecoin has experienced prolonged selling pressure, causing it to lose 11% of its value before re-establishing above $0.20. Market expert Ali Martinez warned that losing its $0.19 support line would likely lead to a sharp price drop to $0.06. Traders continue to track this vital pricing point because market volatility shows no sign of fading. Despite price challenges, Dogecoin remains the number one meme coin in the market. Many believe Dogecoin’s outlook could change with Elon Musk’s possible incorporation of DOGE as a payment option on X and the potential payment partnerships with PayPal and similar processors. Institutional interest is also growing, with Bitwise filing for a Dogecoin ETF. If approved, this could attract significant capital inflows and reinforce Dogecoin’s standing in the market. Pepe Crashes by Over 34% in 30 Days Pepe is currently trading at $0.00000793, consolidating after a prolonged decline. The meme coin remains below the 50 EMA, 100 EMA, and 200 EMA, signaling persistent bearish pressure. Over the past month, Pepe has dropped 34.50% in value, struggling to regain momentum. In the last 24 hours, it has seen a 3.9% drop in price, leaving investors unsure about its future. Source: TradingView Pepe’s volatility stems from its holder distribution and market activity. A staggering 47.9% of its supply is controlled by whales , while 68.3% belongs to cruisers. This imbalance suggests that many traders are capitalizing on its price swings rather than holding for the long term. The high concentration of whale holdings puts Pepe at risk of sudden sell-offs, leading to sharp price fluctuations. According to X analyst UnknowTraderAi , Pepe’s trend remains neutral-to-bearish unless it reclaims $0.00001006. A breakout above this level could trigger an upward move, while a drop below $0.00000700 could signal further losses. If the price fails to hold current levels, a decline toward $0.00000600 becomes increasingly likely. Pepe & Dogecoin Investors Rush Rollblock Presale With the market downturn causing Pepe and Dogecoin to dip in value, many PEPE and DOGE investors are diversifying to Rollblock (RBLK) . RBLK has already increased by 500% during its presale and another 300% surge is expected before the presale is complete.

While Cardano (ADA) has maintained its status as a leading blockchain and Pepe (PEPE) has capitalized on the meme coin frenzy, FloppyPepe (FPPE) brings an entirely new dimension to the space, one that integrates advanced AI agents, robust tokenomics, and a rapidly growing community. The stage is set for a major shift, and Shiba Inu analysts are paying close attention. FloppyPepe (FPPE): AI-Driven Crypto Poised To Shine Brightly In 2025 Shiba Inu analysts are overwhelmingly optimistic about FloppyPepe (FPPE), seeing it as the next big player set to outshine both Cardano (ADA) and Pepe (PEPE). FloppyPepe (FPPE) combines the legacy of Matt Furie’s iconic meme culture with state-of-the-art AI agents, including an AI video agent and a text-to-image generator . These tools are designed to transform content creation within the crypto space. Also, the text-to-AI agent has been launched via the Telegram community account, offering users an unparalleled creative experience. Furthermore, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale has been a massive success, with the private sale concluding within 24 hours and the current stage attracting significant investment. This momentum is fueled by a stage-based pricing structure that rewards early adopters, creating intense FOMO among investors. Moreover, a smart contract audit by SolidProof further boosts investor confidence by improving transparency and security. Tokenomics further strengthen FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) appeal. The project features a deflationary model with a token burn mechanism, enabling scarcity and potential value growth. Redistribution strategies reward holders, with 3% of every transaction funneled back into the community. Shiba Inu analysts emphasize that these mechanics not only sustain the ecosystem but also incentivize long-term holding. Additionally, community-driven growth is at the heart of FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) strategy. Its fast-growing Telegram and X communities highlight the project’s appeal and strong support. Collaborations with top artists, who regularly release hand-drawn FloppyPepe art, enrich the ecosystem, while endorsements from influential crypto YouTubers like NASS CRYPTO amplify its reach. Hence, why Shiba Inu analysts believe FloppyPepe (FPPE) is poised to outshine its counterpart. Join the presale of this meme coin to unlock the potential profits by acquiring the token at a low price of just $0.0000002 . Cardano (ADA): A Stalwart Facing New Contenders Cardano (ADA) has long been hailed as a pioneering layer-1 blockchain with a focus on scalability, security, and sustainability. Its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and research-driven development have positioned it as a go-to platform for decentralized applications. However, Shiba Inu analysts have begun questioning whether the Cardano (ADA) price methodical approach is enough to maintain its dominance. In a rapidly evolving market where AI evolution and community engagement drive momentum, Cardano’s (ADA) slower rollout of updates and features could hinder its growth. Shiba Inu analysts note that while Cardano (ADA) remains a strong project, it may struggle to compete with the excitement and rapid advancements offered by projects like FloppyPepe (FPPE). Pepe (PEPE): The Meme Coin Phenomenon Losing Steam Pepe (PEPE) took the meme coin world by storm, capitalizing on viral internet culture and delivering impressive early gains. Shiba Inu analysts, however, have observed that Pepe’s (PEPE) momentum has started to wane. Without significant utility or technological advancement, Pepe (PEPE) risks being categorized as just another fleeting meme coin. Shiba Inu analysts point out that while Pepe (PEPE) initially attracted massive investor interest, its lack of evolving features and community-driven initiatives may limit its long-term potential. In contrast, FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers an advanced ecosystem that blends meme culture with cutting-edge AI technology, setting the stage for sustained growth. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is The Top Investment Choice Shiba Inu analysts are making it clear that FloppyPepe (FPPE) is more than just another meme coin. It represents a rare blend of cutting-edge AI technology, strong tokenomics, and vibrant community engagement. The presale’s overwhelming success and the buzz surrounding its AI agents indicate that FloppyPepe (FPPE) is on the brink of something monumental. For those looking to be part of the next big thing, the window of opportunity is now. Stage-based pricing rewards early participants, and with the private sale already snapped up in record time, demand is only set to grow.

The flagship asset, which started February at over $101,000, fell as low as $78,000 before ending the month at over $84,000. According to Coinglass data, this is the second-largest drop that BTC has experienced in February, which historically has been a positive month for the flagship asset. Its biggest decline for that month came in 2014 when it fell 31%. However, Bitcoin has only experienced a drop in value thrice in February since 2013, when Coinglass started keeping the data with the last one before this coming in 2020. On average, the flagship asset experienced a 13% rise in February. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s decline in February was even better than Ethereum’s. ETH, which has been struggling since 2024, nosedived last month with a massive 32% decline in value. Although it was trading around $3,300 at the beginning of the month, it lost more than $1,000 in value, falling as low as $2,100 on February 28. The massive decline is also a historical anomaly for Ethereum, which last experienced a February loss in 2018 when it dropped 24%. Overall, it has averaged an 11.68% gain during the month. Bitcoin’s performance in February is the worst monthly decline the asset has experienced since June 2022. The forces pulling the crypto market down Meanwhile, several factors contributed to the massive decline that Bitcoin and other digital assets experienced last month. The biggest factor was President Donald Trump ‘s announcement that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would finally go into effect by March 4, along with the extra 10% tariffs on Chinese imports. With the initial announcement of the tariffs inducing the sell-off of crypto, the news of its renewal, coupled with other signs of geopolitical tensions and uncertainties, was enough to drive crypto to its lowest level in more than 3 months. This highlights how political events have significantly influenced digital assets’ performance. Other factors, such as the $1.5 billion hack of ByBit, which the exchange recovered from, and other macroeconomic issues, also contributed to the sizable losses for crypto holders in February. Despite the decline, Bitcoin and several other crypto continue to trade at a better level than before Trump was elected president, showing that they retained some of their gains even. For instance, Bitcoin, which is trading above $84,000, was worth $69,000 as of November 6, 2024. Market in rebound, but will it last? Following that massive decline to close out February, the crypto market is now experiencing a price rebound led by Bitcoin, which has gained 5% in the last 24 hours. Solana is also up 4.67%, and XRP has gained 5.57%, while ETH saw just a 2.27% gain. Still, it is too early to determine whether the dip is finally over. Data from Santiment shows crowd sentiments, which are mostly bearish across several social media platforms. This is a good sign of an incoming rebound, as BTC is historically contrarian to the crowd. However, the liquidity drain has contributed to weakened demand for BTC this year and is one of the major reasons the crypto market has struggled to gain momentum. CryptoQuant data shows that Binance stablecoin reserves have been declining, particularly for USDT and USDC, and if this continues, the market might see more liquidity crunch. Binance stablecoin reserves. Source: CryptoQuant Meanwhile, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have not been the major source of demand for BTC this year compared to 2024. As of this time in 2024, Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over 128,000 BTC, valued at $6.3 billion, while the 2025 numbers show around 12,000 BTC, valued at $1.7 billion. This is a sizable decline in both BTC and dollar terms. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

If this momentum continues, there could be more growth. We’ll cover the predictions in detail below. We’ll also talk about PlutoChain ($PLUTO) , a cutting-edge hybrid Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin that could make it more useful for everyday payments and new applications. Here’s what you need to know about these projects. Solana Price Prediction: Can Solana Reach $264 Soon and Push for a New All-Time High? Right now Solana is trading at around $190.37, down 2.13% in the last 24 hours. The price has ranged between $189.96 and $195.91 during this period. Solana’s current market cap is approximately $93 billion. Solana has been showing signs of recovery after a rough month and gaining some momentum in the past week. Analysts believe this uptrend could continue, with the potential for a significant price surge if key levels hold. Crypto expert Ali Martinez points out that Solana is following an upward trend within a parallel channel. This means that despite recent dips, the overall movement suggests steady growth. The price recently bounced off a key support level, which could indicate that buyers are stepping in to push it higher. If this trend continues and Solana breaks through resistance, it could climb even further. However, if it falls below the current support, the next major level would be crucial in determining whether the rally can continue. Another analyst GeryCat predicts that Solana will rise to at least $250, with an ideal target of $300. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Is the High-Speed, Low-Cost Hybrid Layer-2 Solution That Could Turn Bitcoin Into a Scalable and Versatile Ecosystem With only about seven transactions per second and confirmation times that can stretch to 10 minutes or more, Bitcoin often feels too sluggish and expensive for small purchases or fast payments—especially when network congestion drives fees even higher. Fortunately, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might be able to fix these issues. As a Layer-2 solution, it could make Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and more versatile. By processing transactions off the main Bitcoin chain, PlutoChain could reduce congestion and enable near-instant confirmations. With block times of just two seconds, it could turn Bitcoin into a practical option for everyday spending, cross-border payments, and microtransactions. Lower fees are another major benefit. Right now, Bitcoin’s high costs make sending small amounts impractical. PlutoChain could help cut transaction fees and make Bitcoin transfers more affordable for both individuals and businesses. But, PlutoChain isn’t just about payments. It’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible, meaning developers could build DeFi apps, NFT platforms, and other blockchain tools on top of it. This could unlock a whole new world of use cases for Bitcoin beyond just being a store of value. PlutoChain’s testnet has processed over 43,200 transactions in a single day, which showcases its ability to handle high demand and scale efficiently. Security is also a priority. PlutoChain has been audited by SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi to ensure a strong defense against vulnerabilities. It also introduces decentralized governance and allows users to vote on upgrades. This could give the community more control over Bitcoin’s future. With faster transactions, lower fees, and expanded functionality, PlutoChain could be the key to making Bitcoin more practical and powerful than ever before. Closing Thoughts Solana continues to climb on an upward trend. Analysts are optimistic about a potential breakout as buyers hold strong at key levels. Meanwhile, PlutoChain might tackle Bitcoin’s biggest challenge—scalability. With faster transactions, Ethereum compatibility, and decentralized governance, it could do more than just speed up Bitcoin. It could turn it into a versatile, community-driven ecosystem and expand its use beyond just an asset for holding wealth. ——- Disclaimer: It’s important to note that participating in presales carries risks, including market volatility and potential project delays.

His tirade against the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has triggered polarizing reactions in the ecosystem with a cross section taking swipes at Solana. Bitcoin Has No Value And Is Not An Investment, Says Solana Cofounder Solana cofounder Anatoly Yakovenko has cast aspersions on Bitcoin’s viability as an investment option, saying the asset has no value. Yakovenko made the assertions on a post on X, claiming that the asset is not an investment but akin to a coin flip. He argues that the best-case scenario for Bitcoin is as “insurance” against the collapse of a global superpower. The Solana co-founder pegged the odds of such a collapse at 1%, adding that Bitcoin may hold up well in the event of a superpower implosion. “It’s worth it for me to spend 1% of my wealth on some asset that might not go to zero in that environment,” said Yakovenko. “It’s not an investment, its a cost and there is no guarantee that it will work.” Yakovenko adds that a BTC price of $100K or $10K does not affect its ability to withstand a superpower collapse. “If it works, it has very little to do with technology outside of the initial innovation that happened 15 years ago,” said Yakovenko. Bitcoin Maxis Disagree With Yakovenko’s Claims Yakovenko’s comments have triggered a wave of reactions from the cryptoverse with the bulk disagreeing with his claim. Angel investor Ashkay BD diverged from Yakovenko, stating that Bitcoin offers immense value flowing from its ability to protect users from counterparty risk. He adds that without BTC, individuals will be forced to transact with failing banks and governments with currency debasements and capital controls. Others say despite incoming CME Group’s SOL futures , Solana is overvalued since it is still finding its feet in the world. Critics opine that if the Solana cofounder sees Bitcoin as good for doomsday events, then Solana is only for memecoins. Despite a previous spike of memecoin activity in Solana, ecosystem activity is waning with PumpFun halting token creation amid market volatility. President of the Solana Foundation Lily Liu appeared to distance herself from Yakovenko’s claim. Liu considers herself to be a Bitcoiner while advocating against ecosystem tribalism in a lengthy post.

With its decentralized lending system, overcollateralized stablecoin, and buy-and-distribute mechanism, the project delivers real financial value—not just hype. At just $0.015 per MUTM, early investors are locking in gains before the price climbs through the presale phases. With demand surging, Mutuum Finance is positioned for massive growth, making this the perfect time to invest. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike many crypto projects that rely on speculation, Mutuum Finance offers a structured DeFi model with real utility. Its ecosystem is built around lending, borrowing, and passive income generation, making it more than just another token. The platform allows users to supply assets to liquidity pools and earn interest, while borrowers can access funds by securing overcollateralized collateral. This creates a sustainable cycle of demand, ensuring continuous engagement from both lenders and borrowers. For example, an investor supplying 10,000 USDT into Mutuum’s liquidity pools would receive mtUSDT at a 1:1 ratio, meaning they would hold 10,000 mtUSDT in return. These mtTokens act as a representation of their deposit and continuously accumulate interest over time. Instead of changing the exchange rate, Mutuum updates the redemption value of mtUSDT to reflect the earned interest. With an annual percentage yield (APY) of 12%, this investor’s mtUSDT balance would remain 10,000, but its redeemable value would increase. After a year, the investor could withdraw the original 10,000 USDT plus an additional 1,200 USDT in earned interest, making it a passive income stream that grows without requiring active trading. Since mtUSDT is ERC20-compliant, it can also be transferred, traded, or used in other DeFi applications while still accumulating value. A key factor behind Mutuum Finance’s rapid investor interest is its buy-and-distribute mechanism. Instead of relying solely on price speculation, the platform reinvests fees to purchase MUTM tokens from the market and distributes them to mtToken stakers. This steady buy pressure supports long-term growth, making it an ideal asset for investors looking for sustainable returns. The team is preparing to launch a beta version of the platform by the time the token officially goes live. This early access will allow users to experience its lending and borrowing system in action, proving its functionality before major adoption begins. Thanks to its clear utilities and structured financial model, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is expected to be listed on major exchanges. With increasing interest from the crypto community, MUTM’s listing is anticipated to attract significant demand from both retail and institutional investors, ensuring a strong market presence from day one. Mutuum Finance has already raised over $1.69 million, with thousands of investors securing their positions. The presale is structured across 11 phases, with prices increasing as demand rises. A $500 investment at $0.015 per MUTM secures over 33,000 MUTM tokens. If the expected listing price of $0.06 is reached, that same investment would be worth $2,000. However, when MUTM climbs to projected targets of $0.50 or even $1 as adoption grows, early investors will see gains surpassing $55K. Mutuum Finance it’s a fully operational DeFi platform with clear use cases. Its lending and borrowing system, buy-and-distribute mechanism, and overcollateralized stablecoin set it apart from speculative projects.

According to Buterin, the possible sentence does not make sense for nonviolent tax offenses, mentioning that it may be politically motivated. Vitalik Buterin’s comment was in response to a post made by Silk Road marketplace founder Ross Ulbricht, where he took to the blogging website to protest Ver’s incarceration, asking for his release. He mentioned that Roger Ver supported him when he was incarcerated and needed help, and it was his turn to support Ver. “Roger Ver was there for me when I was down and needed help. Now Roger needs our support. No one should spend the rest of their life in prison over taxes. Let him pay the tax (if any) and be done with it. #FreeRoger,” he said on X. Ross attached a photo showing Ver holding a placard that reads “FreeRoss” in 2014 side by side with himself holding a placard that reads “FreeRoger” in 2025.

Vitalik Buterin condemns Ver’s plight In his statement , Buterin argued that potentially spending life in prison over tax evasion offenses is absurd. He highlighted that other individuals and firms in the crypto industry have committed the sentences and have seen milder judgments.

The case against Roger seems very politically motivated; like with @RealRossU, there have been plenty of people and corporations who have been accused of far worse and yet faced sentences far milder than what Roger is facing,” Buterin said. The Ethereum co-founder added that Ver should not have to suffer a worse fate because of his advocacy for freedom and his challenge of coercive state power. He also criticized selective criticism, noting that actions like that betray the constitutional powers. He also discussed the United States tax policy, highlighting that the US tax-by-citizenship and associated exit tax regime is extreme. “The US tax-by-citizenship and associated exit tax regime are extreme; the former is shared by almost no other countries in the world, and the latter is on the high end of what countries do (eg. the UK only charges capital gains if you return within 5 years),” he added. Buterin also waded into reports about the IRS intimidating Ver’s lawyers to get privileged information, calling it a bad move. “If the IRS did intimidate Roger’s lawyers to get privileged information, that is a bad faith move; the right to consult lawyers in confidence must be kept sacrosanct. Genuine good faith mistakes should be treated by allowing the actor to pay back taxes if needed with interest and penalties, not with prosecution,” he said Roger Ver’s tax evasion story Roger Ver was charged by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) with tax fraud in April 2024, with the authorities noting that during his early Bitcoin investment days, he filed false tax returns, evaded taxes, and committed mail fraud. He was arrested in Spain, with the United States processing his extradition to stand trial in connection with his criminal case. His indictment showed that he owned two companies where he sold computer and networking equipment. In 2011, he started to acquire Bitcoin for himself and his companies, promoting the asset on some occasions, hence where he earned the “Bitcoin Jesus” moniker. He renounced his citizenship in 2014, after obtaining a St. Kitts and Nevis citizenship. Due to the expatriation, he was required to file tax returns from sales of his assets, including the Bitcoin. He was also required to pay exit tax on the capital gains. During the process, authorities discovered that he allegedly provided misleading or false information to the law firm he hired to carry out the appraisal. As a result, the law firm filed false tax returns, including undervaluing the companies and the 73,000 Bitcoins in its possession. The report also mentioned that Ver did not hold any personal Bitcoin. In total, Ver owed at least $48 million in taxes to the IRS.

This caused some investors to panic and rethink their bullish sentiment, but all’s not lost for crypto enthusiasts. A recent Matrixport analysis says that although the current market dump might last a little bit longer, all the way through March and into April, that’s not exactly an issue considering the long-term potential Bitcoin’s been showing. Let’s unpack why the current Bitcoin correction isn’t necessarily negative, or even unprecedented. Reasons for Bitcoin Falling Right off the bat, it’s important to note that the recent sell-off isn’t exclusive to crypto; the broader market, including the three US stock market indexes, fell sharply in the last five trading days. The biggest catalyst for this has been Trump’s tariffs. While his initial announcement of reciprocal tariffs on Canada and Mexico rattled the markets, his recent reaffirmation of these tariff hikes added fuel to the fire, eventually driving $BTC to break its two-month-long channel towards the downside. Understanding the effect of tariffs on investor sentiment is simple. Tariffs increase the price of goods, creating global tensions and disrupting supply chains. Put together, all this jacks up market volatility, which is what we’re seeing now. As a result of this financial turmoil, the US dollar has strengthened quite a lot. The US Dollar Index (DXY) shot up for three days straight, signaling that traders are looking for a safer investment avenue. As Matrixport said in its report, ‘A stronger US dollar causes this liquidity measure to decline, which suggests downward pressure on Bitcoin prices.’ Excellent Opportunity to Buy the Dip With $BTC down, it’s no surprise that ‘buy the dip’ chants are echoing loud and clear. Investors, both short-term and long-term, are considering accumulating Bitcoin now that it’s available at a ‘discount.’ Plus, Santiment’s sentiment tracker found that the mentions of ‘buying the dip’ are at their highest since July 2024. It’s worth noting what happened in July-September 2024. Bitcoin claimed new highs, went sideways, threatened to dip lower but pulled back every single time, and then eventually rallied to fresh milestones. We could be seeing an almost exact replica of this now, meaning the current dip could ultimately prove to be a healthy correction before the next leg up higher sets in. Additionally, business legends like Michael Saylor have advised against selling Bitcoin . Then, Standard Chartered issued a $500K target for Bitcoin. So, all in all, the attitude is definitely positive for Bitcoin. If you’re also looking to buy the dip and do so successfully, investing in crypto presales is one of the better decisions to make, as they’re not affected by market volatility. While we’re at it, we’d suggest focusing on projects that are closely tied to Bitcoin (and the larger crypto market), seeing as that’s how you’ll be able to reap in handsome yields once the bull run kicks in. Enter BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . BTC Bull Token – A Unique Altcoin to Rally Behind Bitcoin BTC Bull Token is a new cryptocurrency that has taken the industry by storm. After all, it’s the ONLY project out there offering free $BTC airdrops as Bitcoin surges past new price points. Simply put, once you’ve bought $BTCBULL tokens and stored them in Best Wallet , you’ll get free $BTC once Bitcoin crosses $150K, $200K, $250K, and so on. Given that BTC Bull is directly tied to Bitcoin, it’ll undoubtedly benefit from the OG crypto’s growth. Additionally, the biggest reason we believe it could be the next crypto to explode is that it offers Bitcoin maximalists a cost-effective way to support Bitcoin’s rally. Why Is $BTCBULL the Next 100x Coin? Early investors won’t just see a price appreciation of their $BTCBULL tokens but also benefit from free $BTC, which is also only going to increase in value. Speaking of $BTCBULL’s price, the token is also set to benefit from the project’s deflationary model. Essentially, the developers will burn a part of the total token supply once Bitcoin reaches $125K, $150K, $175K, etc. A continuous reduction in supply will inflate the token’s demand and ultimately boost its trading price. What’s more, you also don’t have to worry about the project falling out of favor among crypto enthusiasts. That’s because the BTC Bull team has reserved 40% of the supply for PR and marketing. Not to mention that the fundamentals of the project itself, i.e., handing out free $BTC, are going to send the market in a frenzy. As mentioned earlier, BTC Bull Token is currently in presale. It has already raised a whopping $3M, and each token is currently available at a low price of $0.00239. Interested investors should hurry up, though, as prices increase in the next few hours. Check out $BTCBULL’s whitepaper and X feed for more information. Everything considered, the need for proper risk management never subsides. We urge you to only invest a small amount and then scale in once you’re confident in your investments. Additionally, none of the above is financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ZRX,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-03-01 15:28:23

Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose to $85,000, 8.5% above its lowest level this week, while the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies rose to $2.8 trillion. At press time, Bitcoin was up 2.1% and trading at about $84,600 — up 2.1% Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto,news Some of the top-performing cryptocurrencies were Hedera Hashgraph, Celestia, Official Trump, Stellar Lumens, and Sonic, which rose by over 15%. Trump will host the first-ever summit focused on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies next Friday. It will likely feature officials from the Treasury Department and a team from the crypto and AI office that David Sacks and Bo Hines lead.

Top leaders in the crypto industry, including the heads of exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken will likely attend. Most of these leaders, including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, were some of the top Trump backers during the campaign. The other potential attendees are leaders of popular made-in-the-USA cryptocurrencies like Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, Stellar’s Jed McCaleb, Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse, and Ondo Finance’s Nathan Allman. Elon Musk, who is leading the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, will likely attend. He is a big crypto backer, with Tesla holding over 11,500 Bitcoins worth over $975 million. Also, Musk is evaluating how the US government may leverage blockchain technology to cut costs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, ever since Gary Gensler resigned as chair, has ended some litigations including those involving companies like Uniswap , Coinbase, and Gemini. As Trump considers a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, there is a likelihood that Bitcoin and other altcoins will rally ahead of this summit. While Trump has been pro-crypto, some of his policies have contributed to the recent weakness. The most notable one is tariffs on American imports, which critics say will lead to higher inflation and market volatility.

Based on a double top formation, Bitcoin is expected to head to $76,000 before re-establishing an uptrend. However, market analyst Cryptododo7 has indicated the possibility of a lower market bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Are Hoarding Their Crypto Despite Plunge—Here’s What It Means Bitcoin Bears In Control: Will $67,000 Emerge As Ultimate Support Level? The Bitcoin market fell under siege in the last week with total liquidations reaching $670 million. During this period, the assets crashed by over 15% from an opening market price of $95,000 confirming the formation of a double-top pattern. For context, the double top is a bearish reversal chart pattern that appears after an uptrend. It consists of two peaks at a similar price level, separated by a pullback. This formation is well represented by Bitcoin’s price at $108,000 in December and $109,000 in January separated by the price correction in late December. Amid the falling prices in the past week, Bitcoin dipped below the double top neckline level at $91,500 confirming a price reversal. In accordance with the bearish signal, Bitcoin is expected to return to $76,000 around which it embarked on its price rally to its initial peak at $108,000. However, Cryptododo7 explains there is potential for BTC to rapidly drop to its maximum Fibonacci level at $67,000 which would serve as the support level with no further downside. In gauging the eventual ultimate Bitcoin support level, Cryptododo7 notes that market reaction at $73,000-$76,000 will be quite important as strong buying pressure at this level could result in a sharp price rebound.

Historically, such developments usually occur at major market turning points i.e. either peaks driven by new entrants rush or bottoms due to panic selling and opportunistic buyers. According to IntoTheBlock, this surge in on-chain activity could indicate that the BTC market could be at a crucial turning point, however, investors should note that no single metric guarantees a price reversal. At press time, BTC trades at $84,961 with a 2.54% increase in the past day. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is up by 13.69% and valued at $71.43 billion.

Some believe history is repeating itself—past crashes have often been followed by strong rebounds. However, others warn that resistance levels could stall any upward momentum, keeping XRP in a prolonged struggle. Can XRP crack $5 or is there another setback on the horizon? Meanwhile, focus shifts to JetBolt (JBOLT) with a thrilling presale performance of nearly 340 million tokens. Its zero-gas technology and Web3 innovations are setting a new standard in the crypto space. As excitement builds, the question isn’t just about JetBolt’s rise—but how far it can go. Will XRP recover from the recent dips as JetBolt’s presale continues to soar? Let’s delve into the details. XRP Price Prediction: Can XRP Conquer the $5 Dream? XRP’s latest price drop has investors watching closely. Some believe this could be a turning point, as past dips have led to strong rebounds. Historical trends show that XRP has recovered from major corrections, including the SEC lawsuit crash and the COVID-19 market slump in 2020. A number of analysts suggest that if XRP holds its current support level, a gradual uptrend is possible. However, resistance remains a challenge, and breaking past key price points won’t happen overnight. Institutional interest in XRP is growing, especially for cross-border payments, but broader market sentiment and regulatory uncertainties still cast a shadow over its future. XRP’s 7-day price chart from CoinGecko. While a rally is possible, a surge to $5 anytime soon is unlikely. The crypto market is in a slump, with Bitcoin’s plummet causing a widespread ripple across assets. XRP’s technical indicators show potential for recovery, but broad market momentum needs to be built first. The first major resistance level sits at $2.25, with a stronger barrier around $2.30–$2.35. A clean break above these levels could open the door for a larger move, but failure to push through might lead to another period of sideways trading—or worse, a deeper decline. For now, XRP is holding its ground, but the real test is still ahead. 335 Million and Counting: What’s Behind the JetBolt Focus? JetBolt (JBOLT) is gaining momentum as one of the most talked-about altcoins in the market. While XRP struggles to reclaim bullish movement, JetBolt has already sold nearly 335 million tokens since launch, drawing significant attention from whales and developers. JetBolt’s appeal goes beyond hype—JetBolt introduces zero-gas technology, eliminating gas fees entirely. This makes it an attractive option for developers building Web3 applications, blockchain-based games, and decentralized platforms. With gas fees being a long-standing barrier for blockchain adoption, JetBolt’s cost-efficient approach is positioning it as a serious contender in the crypto space. Speed and usability are also at the core of JetBolt’s rise. Transactions process almost instantly, providing a smoother experience for users. The platform’s next-gen Web3 wallet adds convenience with biometric logins, facial recognition, and self-custodial security, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced traders. Beyond payments, JetBolt integrates an AI-powered tool, delivering blockchain insights based on sentiment data and market analysis. It also introduces Proof of Attendance and Worth (PAW), a staking mechanism that rewards users for daily logins, staking, and community engagement. The ongoing presale adds further excitement, offering early adopters up to 25% in bonus tokens when buying in batches through Alpha Box bundles. With whales’ focus shifting to JetBolt, all eyes are on this rising coin, making the space more exciting. Summing Up: Can XRP Crack $5 as Focus Shifts to JetBolt? XRP has a difficult road to $5. While historical trends suggest the potential for a rebound, resistance levels and broader market conditions could stall progress. Institutional interest may provide support, but XRP still has hurdles to clear before a true breakout can happen. Market observers will be watching closely for signs of a shift. Meanwhile, JetBolt is rapidly gaining traction. With its zero-gas technology and seamless transactions, JetBolt positions itself as a serious player in the market. The presale success hints at growing confidence, but whether JetBolt can maintain its momentum remains to be seen. As XRP fights for a breakout and JetBolt surges ahead, one thing is clear—the crypto landscape is shifting, and the biggest moves may still be ahead.

The market is now turning its attention to potential Federal Reserve policy changes, particularly interest rate cuts and monetary expansion. Bitcoin’s Shift from Political Sentiment to Economic Drivers During certain political transitions, Bitcoin experienced increased speculation, with investors associating policy changes with favorable conditions for cryptocurrency markets. However, this trend has diminished as broader economic factors take precedence. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions, particularly regarding interest rates and liquidity expansion, are now at the forefront of Bitcoin’s market movement. Traders are closely monitoring signals that could indicate shifts in economic conditions that may impact Bitcoin’s trajectory. Federal Reserve Rate Cuts and Their Impact on Bitcoin A potential reduction in interest rates could lead to increased capital inflows into risk assets, including Bitcoin. Lower rates typically make borrowing cheaper and encourage investment in alternative assets. Additionally, an expansion of the money supply could drive further demand for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Liquidity Expansion and Bitcoin’s Market Response Beyond interest rate policies, the Federal Reserve’s approach to liquidity expansion will also play a role in Bitcoin’s price movement. If the central bank increases liquidity to support economic growth, Bitcoin could see renewed demand from institutional investors looking for alternative stores of value. Conclusion As political speculation surrounding Bitcoin fades, macroeconomic factors such as Federal Reserve policies on interest rates and liquidity expansion will become the primary drivers of market sentiment.

In a new press release , the CME Group announces that it will be rolling out two Solana-based futures contract options on March 17th – a micro-sized one worth 25 SOL and a macro-sized contract worth 500 SOL. However, the firm notes that the launch of the products is still pending regulatory review. According to Giovanni Vicioso, CME’s global head of crypto products, the rollout of the contracts is happening due to burgeoning client demand for regulated products based on digital assets. As stated by Vicioso, “With the launch of our new SOL futures contracts, we are responding to increasing client demand for a broader set of regulated products to manage cryptocurrency price risk. As Solana continues to evolve into the platform of choice for developers and investors, these new futures contracts will provide a capital-efficient tool to support their investment and hedging strategies.” Solana contracts will join Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) futures in the company’s arsenal of derivative products. According to previous reports, the firm first launched BTC futures in 2020 and Ethereum futures in 2022.

One project gaining traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi contender that has already raised over $1.7 million in its presale. With its decentralized lending system, passive income opportunities, and a structured financial model, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself for major growth in 2025, attracting both early investors and institutional interest. Bitcoin ETF outflows and futures traders pull back amid market uncertainty In February, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced outflows of $3.4 billion, with a single-day record withdrawal of $1.13 billion on February 25. This was as the price of Bitcoin declined by 12.48%, prompting investors to adopt a more defensive approach. Analysts, however, point out that ETF flows do not necessarily dictate Bitcoin’s long-term price direction. At the same time, futures traders have been exiting positions, with open interest on CME futures dropping. Lower futures premiums suggest weaker confidence in the market, while the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has hit extreme fear levels. Some see this as a buying opportunity, but others suggest waiting for clearer signs of recovery. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) As the crypto market shifts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum, securing its place as a promising DeFi project ahead of the 2025 bull run. The presale has already entered its second phase, raising about $1.8 million with nearly 3,500 holders onboard. For just $0.015 per token, investors get the rare opportunity to invest early before the price increases through the following presale phases and future exchange listings. Mutuum Finance, in simple terms, is a decentralized lending protocol that allows for lending and borrowing of cryptocurrency assets. It features two lending models—peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P)—that offer customers an unmatched degree of freedom in using their capital. Under the P2C model, users lend assets to liquidity pools and therefore earn passive returns, and the borrowers obtain loans by collateralizing. The P2P model, on the other hand, allows users to negotiate loan terms between other users, thus allowing supporting assets that are not supported by conventional pools of lending. This means that meme coins like DOGE, PEPE, and SHIB can be used in lending and borrowing operations, thus giving users more choices. Security is Mutuum Finance’s top priority. The platform’s smart contract will be audited by a reputable blockchain security firm, thereby ensuring end-to-end security for users. For instance, a crypto investor holds 10,000 USDT and is looking to generate passive income with no active trading. Therefore, they opt to put their funds in the peer-to-contract (P2C) liquidity pool offered by Mutuum Finance. In return, they receive mtUSDT at a 1:1 ratio, which represents their deposit and continuously accrues interest over time. If the annual yield is 11%, their deposit could generate 1,100 USDT in passive income after a year. The investor can withdraw their initial deposit along with earned interest at any time, as long as liquidity is available in the pool. As a borrower, a trader owns 5 ETH but doesn’t want to sell it, believing its price will rise in the future. Instead, they use their ETH as collateral to borrow USDT through Mutuum Finance. Based on the assigned Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, they can borrow a percentage of their ETH’s value while keeping ownership of their assets. If the investor needs money to get into a new investment or cover immediate needs, they can access liquidity without parting with their ETH. Once the loan is repaid, they once again retain full ownership of their ETH and can enjoy any future appreciation in price. In addition, the team is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be US dollar-pegged and issued on the Ethereum network. This asset will be collateralized directly by collateral within the protocol, unlike with centralized stablecoins, giving users transparent and secure access to stable borrowing and liquidity. With its structured lending system, passive income opportunities, and strong investor interest, Mutuum Finance is drawing attention from those looking for long-term growth. The combination of a trusted smart contract audit, flexible lending models, and an upcoming stablecoin makes it a top contender in the DeFi space. As the presale progresses, more investors are recognizing the potential of MUTM, positioning it as a token to watch in 2025.

DAO Presale Phase in Final Countdown,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/cardano-smart-contracts-or-skyren-smarter-contracts/,"The post Cardano Smart Contracts or Skyren Smarter Contracts? DAO Presale Phase in Final Countdown appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is evolving rapidly, with blockchain projects continuously pushing the limits of innovation. While Cardano’s smart contracts have long been seen as a major development in the industry, a new contender is gaining traction—Skyren DAO, a project that crypto enthusiasts and experts are calling a game-changer. With its unique airdrop collection model, high-yield staking, and AI-driven governance, Skyren is redefining decentralized rewards. As Phase 4 of its presale nears completion, investors are taking notice of its high ROI potential and passive income model. Cardano Smart Contracts vs. Skyren’s Smarter Approach Cardano has positioned itself as a strong competitor in the smart contract space, aiming to provide a secure and scalable blockchain environment. Its smart contract functionality, launched through the Alonzo upgrade, enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the network. However, despite its progress, Cardano’s smart contract adoption has been slower than anticipated, with criticisms over its complex scripting language and execution delays. On the other hand, Skyren DAO isn’t just another smart contract platform—it’s a revolutionary approach to decentralized earning. Instead of solely relying on DeFi applications like lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision, Skyren’s primary focus is on airdrop farming. This means Skyren DAO actively collects airdrops from emerging blockchain projects and distributes these rewards to holders of its native token, $SKYRN. The contrast is clear—while Cardano provides infrastructure for dApp development, Skyren delivers direct, diversified rewards to its investors, creating an entirely new earning model that appeals to those seeking passive income and DeFi innovation. Skyren DAO: The World’s First Airdrop Collection DAO Skyren is the first DAO to focus heavily on airdrop farming, making it an unparalleled opportunity in the DeFi space. Instead of relying solely on traditional yield-generation mechanisms, Skyren diversifies its earnings through multiple avenues: Airdrop Collection: Skyren strategically participates in airdrop events across different blockchain networks, ensuring continuous rewards for $SKYRN holders. AI-Driven Governance: The DAO utilizes AI-powered decision-making to optimize governance and maximize earnings for token holders. High-Yield Staking: Investors can stake their $SKYRN tokens for substantial APY returns, with the platform targeting an average ROI of 216% annually. By leveraging these earning strategies, Skyren DAO ensures consistent value generation, making it a highly attractive option for investors looking for sustainable, high-yield DeFi opportunities. In addition, Skyren DAO’s Telegram group is the perfect place to engage with other crypto enthusiasts, get help when needed, and keep track of the latest updates. Skyren’s Unmatched Features: More Than Just a DAO What makes Skyren stand out is not just its airdrop farming innovation but also its ecosystem of cutting-edge financial tools: NFT Contributor Keys: Skyren introduces NFT Contributor Keys, which provide special access and governance rights to key community members, allowing them to influence strategic decisions and earn additional benefits. Liquidity Support for Emerging Projects: By offering liquidity to promising blockchain startups, Skyren earns tokens that are later distributed to $SKYRN holders. Referral Program: Skyren incentivizes community-driven growth by rewarding users who refer new investors to the platform. Fully Audited Security: The platform has undergone comprehensive audits , reinforcing its commitment to transparency and security. Skyren’s Presale: Final Countdown to a High-ROI Opportunity The Skyren presale is in its fourth phase, and demand is soaring. Currently priced at $0.044 per $SKYRN, the token is set to increase to $0.048 in the next phase, with a projected launch price of $0.16. This presents an ROI potential of 500%, making it one of the most lucrative presale opportunities in the market today. Crypto influencers and DeFi analysts are heaping praise on Skyren, with many influencers like Crypto Volt , Crypto Legends , and Crypto League calling it the next big thing in decentralized finance. Its verified listing on Polygonscan further solidifies its legitimacy, attracting even more investors looking to capitalize on its unique earning model. Conclusion Cardano’s smart contracts focus on decentralized infrastructure, but Skyren DAO’s Smarter Contracts take DeFi to the next level. Through airdrop farming, high-yield staking, and AI-driven governance, Skyren creates a more rewarding and dynamic ecosystem for token holders. As the presale nears its final stages, the excitement around Skyren continues to grow. With its verified Polygonscan listing, security audits, and innovative earning strategies, Skyren DAO is proving to be more than just another DeFi project—it’s a game-changer for long-term investors. The clock is ticking—secure your SKYRN before it’s too late!

The stolen USDT was transferred to Ethereum before the ETH was split among 10 addresses and deposited into Tornado Cash. ZachXBT attributes this hack to the notorious North Korean Lazarus Group. Onchain Lens disclosed that ZachXBT had uncovered another malicious attack by a hacker, leading to the unknown victim’s loss of about 3.19M USDT. According to TronScan, the USDT was transferred to the Ethereum blockchain, where it was swapped for ETH and then split among 10 addresses before being deposited into Tornado Cash (96 X 10 ETH, 4 X 100 ETH, 78 X 1 ETH, 5 X 0.1 ETH). ZachXBT pointed out that the hacker reused a theft address from the Michael Kong (Fantom/Sonic CEO) hack in October 2023, which had been previously attributed to the Lazarus Group as part of a ‘spearphishing campaign’ in a March 2024 report published by the UN. On February 22, ZachXBT also revealed that the Lazarus Group had connected the Bybit hack to the Phemex hack directly on-chain by ‘commingling’ funds from the initial theft address for both incidents. Lazarus Group adds unknown victim to the long list of crypto theft Zach ( @zachxbt ) reported that a user was scammed by the Lazarus Group on Tron for approximately $3.2M $USDT The stolen funds were transferred from #Tron to #Ethereum . The $ETH was then split among 10 addresses and deposited into Tornado Cash as follows: 96 x 10 ETH, 4 x 100 ETH,… pic.twitter.com/JRQ03rtflA — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) March 1, 2025 According to ZachXBT, the Lazarus Group is suspected to have struck once again, this time targeting an unknown victim on Tron and stealing over 3.19M USDT. The loot was then quickly transferred to the Ethereum chain, swapped for ETH, and split among ten addresses before being deposited into Tornado Cash. TronScan data showed that the hacker(s) used two addresses, TYQ3455gFNeqyw and 0xcced1276382f4d, to siphon 3,199,779 USDT from a victim with the address TDNaLds1A1g6vYRU. The malicious attack attributed to the North Korean hacking group suspected state links comes after a recent heist where the group reportedly stole over $1 billion from the Bybit exchange. Bybit was the victim of a record-breaking ~$1.5 billion Ethereum hack. North Korea’s Lazarus Group was the prime suspect in a sophisticated attack where the hackers infiltrated Bybit’s cold wallet and stole over 400K ETH. Elliptic’s research claims the Bybit heist is arguably the largest crypto theft in history. The Lazarus Group is suspected of stealing over $6 billion worth of crypto assets since 2017. The proceeds were reportedly spent on North Korea’s ballistic missile program. Elliptic follows the Lazarus Group’s patterns According to Elliptic’s research, the Lazarus Group followed a characteristic pattern to launder stolen crypto tokens. The first step was to exchange any stolen tokens for a “native” blockchain asset such as Ether. The group reportedly opted for this method because tokens have issuers who, in some cases, can ‘freeze’ wallets containing stolen assets, but no central party can freeze Ether or Bitcoin. That was exactly what happened in the minutes following the Bybit theft and the latest Tron hack involving an unknown victim. Hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen tokens were exchanged for ETH. They used decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to avoid any asset freezes that may happen if they use centralized exchanges (CEXs) to launder stolen funds. As per Elliptic’s report, the second step of the laundering process was to conceal the transaction trail by ‘layering’ the stolen funds. These layering tactics can complicate the tracing process, buying the launderers valuable time to cash out the assets. The layering process includes sending funds through large numbers of cryptocurrency wallets and moving funds to other blockchains using cross-chain bridges or exchanges. It also includes other tactics like switching between different crypto-assets using DEXs, coin swap services, or exchanges and using ‘mixers’ such as Tornado Cash or Cryptomixer. eXch has also emerged as a major and willing facilitator of this laundering.

Polkadot ( DOT ) fell to a low of $4, slightly higher than the critical support level at $3.60, where it has failed to fall below several times since 2022. The token has held steady above this support level for two main reasons. First, Grayscale and 21Shares have filed for a spot DOT exchange-traded fund , which they hope will be popular among Wall Street investors. Spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs have done fairly well among investors, as they attracted a combined $40 billion in assets. Second, Polkadot price has remained steady as the network prepares to launch Polkadot 2.0 which will introduce new changes. It will introduce features like agile coretime, elastic scaling, and asyncronous backing. The upgrade’s goal is to reduce the average block time to just 6 seconds and allow dynamic scaling, which will make it one of the fastest layer-1 networks in the crypto industry. Polkadot 2.0 will also lower the barriers to developers aiming to build on the chain.

That price is a crucial one since DOT has formed a quadruple bottom since 2022. Like a double bottom, a quadruple one is a highly bullish sign in technical analysis. Polkadot price has also formed a small falling wedge pattern, which happens when there are two falling and converging trendlines. These two lines are now nearing their confluence levels, pointing to an eventual rebound. The first target for this price action is $11.72, the highest swing in November last year and 170% above the current level. The second target will be at $23.80, the 38.2% retracement level.

While attempting to add $280 to the customer’s balance, Citigroup mistakenly credited the client with $81 trillion, reports the Financial Times. The payment, for an account in Brazil, was manually executed due to sanctions concerns using a rarely-used system – with an employee failing to correct a pre-filled field of 15 zeros. The transfer happened in April of 2024, and the customer’s account maintained the whopping balance for several hours. The error slipped past two people who work at the bank and was luckily caught by a third employee in what the bank described as a “near miss.” The report cites a “person with knowledge of the matter” who says the transfer was disclosed to both the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Citigroup noted that its “detective controls promptly identified the inputting error between two Citi ledger accounts and we reversed the entry,” stating that its internal systems would also have prevented any of the money from actually leaving the account. According to the report, internal documents show Citigroup reported a total of 10 near miss events in 2024, with each erroneous transaction amounting to $1 billion or more.

The dip in prices saw the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunge to 10, a level that hadn’t been seen since the 2022 bear market. However, it has since recovered to 20 while still being in the “extreme fear” range. Bitcoin’s price has now risen more than 3% in the last 24-hour period to now trade above $84,400, while the broader CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) rose 1.5% in the same period to 2,700. Its performance is being affected by SOL dipping nearly 3% in the period, while other components are up for the day. The cryptocurrency market seemed to have caught a bid after the White House announced that U.S. President Donald Trump will host a crypto summit on March 7. Summit attendees are set to include “prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto industry, as well as members of the President's Working Group on Digital Assets, according to a press release. The event is the latest sign of the Trump administration’s pro-crypto policies. It comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped lawsuits against Coinbase and MetaMask developer Consensys, as well as investigations Into Robinhood, Gemini, Uniswap Labs, and OpenSea. In addition, the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has added a 1% to 2% allocation of its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to one of its model portfolios . These models propose portfolio and rebalancing strategies that are subsequently executed by advisors and platforms. This is the first time BlackRock has decided to add IBIT to any of its models, opening up the potential for a new wave of demand for bitcoin ETFs.

These altcoins are attracting attention for their unique features and growth potential. Pepe Coin’s rise has been fueled by its growing community and meme coin appeal, while Ripple (XRP) remains a strong contender with its revolutionary cross-border payment system. However, Lightchain AI is quickly emerging as a leader, thanks to its innovative combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), setting it apart from other projects. With its presale priced at just $0.006, Lightchain AI is poised for explosive growth. For investors looking to capitalize on the next big thing in crypto, these three coins present a compelling opportunity. Why Holding Cryptocurrencies is Important Keeping cryptocurrencies has become increasingly essential in today’s evolving financial landscape, offering a unique opportunity to participate in a decentralized economy. Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies provide individuals with full ownership and control over their wealth, independent of centralized financial systems. As digital assets gain popularity, they serve as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, preserving long-term value. Beyond financial security, holding cryptocurrencies allows investors to benefit from the rapid advancements in blockchain technology, from smart contracts to decentralized applications. Additionally, many cryptocurrencies offer staking opportunities, enabling holders to earn passive income. In a world transitioning toward digital solutions, cryptocurrencies represent both an investment and a gateway to the future of finance and innovation. 3 Cryptos to Hold for Future Millionaire Status Pepe Coin (PEPE), Ripple (XRP), and Lightchain AI are three cryptocurrencies that could potentially turn early investors into millionaires by 2025. Pepe Coin, with its meme coin appeal, has gained significant attention in the crypto community, making it a strong contender for growth in the coming months. Ripple (XRP), with its innovative approach to cross-border payments, remains one of the most established cryptocurrencies, offering consistent growth and long-term value. However, it’s Lightchain AI that stands out due to its groundbreaking integration of blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI). Positioned at a presale price of just $0.006, Lightchain AI presents an exciting opportunity for early investors to secure tokens at an affordable rate before it explodes in value. With its innovative technology and growing demand for AI-powered solutions, Lightchain AI could be the next big crypto to deliver extraordinary returns. Why Lightchain AI Has More Potential Than Others Among the three, Lightchain AI stands out with its unique blend of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), positioning it for explosive growth in 2025. While Pepe Coin (PEPE) rides on meme coin popularity and Ripple (XRP) leverages its cross-border payment system, Lightchain AI has the potential to revolutionize the AI and blockchain space by providing decentralized solutions with real-world applications. Its innovative AI-driven platform, combined with a low presale price of $0.006, presents an unmatched investment opportunity. As demand for AI-powered decentralized applications surges, Lightchain AI’s ability to integrate blockchain with cutting-edge AI technologies gives it a distinct competitive advantage. For investors looking to capitalize on the future of AI and blockchain, Lightchain AI holds greater long-term potential, making it the top pick among these three cryptocurrencies. https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://t.me/LightchainProtocol https://twitter.com/LightchainAI",Press Release,EN,0,0,XRP|PEPE|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-01 16:04:15

An analyst recently predicted that the DOGE price could go from $0.2 to $1.3 soon, and DOGE holders are watching closely. On the other hand, a new presale token called FXGuys ($FXG) is pushing to become the next 100x altcoin ahead of leading memes like DOGE. Keep reading to see why investors believe $FXG will achieve this goal! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Dogecoin Has Entered the Boring Phase, Says Trader Allen On February 20, 2025, Trader Allen (A leading crypto pattern analyst on X) suggested that Dogecoin is now in its ‘boring phase.’ According to Allen, traders should expect a tight consolidation at Dogecoin’s current level over the next few weeks. When this Dogecoin consolidation finally ends, a massive DOGE rally may kick off and take the price of the meme coin to $1.3. Already, smart investors believe DOGE might be the next 100x altcoin, and they have termed the next few weeks as the buy phase. Currently, Dogecoin is showing the same patterns it did during the October to November 2017 pre-bull cycle season. Based on historical data, analysts have concluded that DOGE is one of the few good crypto investments in 2025. For now, Dogecoin is still on a bearish trajectory, and DOGE recorded a double-digit loss in late February. On February 17, DOGE traded at $0.24. A week later, DOGE had lost over 18% of its value and sold for $0.20. Even if Dogecoin doesn’t eventually become the next 100x altcoin, investors have diversified their options with good crypto investments like $FXG. FXGuys Will Likely Dominate the Prop Firm Market in the Coming Months Prop firms have become a major part of the retail trading industry over the years because they provide funding in a capital-intensive market. However, most retail traders have to deal with issues such as platform downtime, limited capital, and rigorous KYC practices. Thankfully, smart developers created a decentralized community-driven trading protocol called FXGuys. The FXGuys prop firm is backed by brokers and used by retail traders from all backgrounds. Crypto, forex, indices, and commodities traders are all welcome on FXGuys. Unlike most prop firms that only give out up to $100,000, FXGuys funds skilled traders with up to $500,000. New traders are given trading challenges, and the best performers automatically get funded with $200,000 to $500,000. For new (and other traders) who execute trades on the platform, FXGuys has something amazing. The FX Guys platform runs a unique Trade2Earn program that ensures you get rewarded with $FXG tokens anytime you make a trade on the platform. Moreover, FXGuys operates a staking rewards program for investors who don’t have a taste for trading. You can lock down your $FXG tokens in a pool and secure a 20% APY. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG Will Likely Top List of Good Crypto Investments and Become the Next 100x Altcoin in 2025 Last year, FXGuys began its presale process, and the platform scored some big points. To start with, $FXG has sold over 150 million tokens, and investors have bought almost $4.4 million worth of $FXG tokens so far. If $FXG sustains investor interest, analysts believe the token could trade for $10 before the year ends. This trend shows that $FXG is on a clear path to becoming the next 100x altcoin. Right now, $FXG is selling for $0.05 in Stage 3 of its public presale, and the presale token will launch at $0.10 on CEXs in a few months. Hop on the winning team today!

If we assume that this bull market cycle has come to a halt, which is very speculative, to say the least, can it all lead to January 20 – Trump’s inauguration day? Was that the ultimate ‘sell-the-news’ date? Was That the Signal? Financial markets, and especially crypto, are often moved by rumors instead of the actual news and the subsequent implementations. In the more recent BTC history, recall that the asset had neared $50,000 in early January 2024 on anticipation of the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the States. The products were expected to be a big deal and they became such, but BTC tumbled below $40,000 once they went live. It took weeks to recover the losses and months to break BTC’s 2021 all-time high. Let’s go back to another peak registered in April 2021, which also solidifies the aforementioned theory. Bitcoin’s surge above $60,000 came on the heels of Coinbase going public . Once it became a reality, BTC crashed below $30,000 in the next weeks, and it took months, until November, to break past its then-record. The ETFs in 2024 marked the start of a new bull cycle, according to some, but bitcoin’s price moves had calmed at around $60,000 for months on the way to the US elections. Even the halving couldn’t shake the consolidation off. However, Trump’s dozens of pro-crypto promises and his landslide win in the elections brought the hype back and BTC, alongside many altcoins, skyrocketed. In fact, the months leading to his inauguration were among the best for the crypto market in its history, as BTC even managed to break above $100,000 and peaked at over $109,000 on January 20 – yes, the day Trump was sworn into office. In the following month and a half, BTC’s price lost nearly 30% of its value and crashed to $78,000 on Friday. In fact, Trump has received much of the blame due to his controversial tariffs against numerous countries as well as his actions in the Ukraine-Russia war. So, was that inauguration day the beginning of the end? BTCUSD. Source: TradingView What’s Next? Now, let’s assume that the bull market is not over. Crashes like the aforementioned one are nothing new to bitcoin and crypto. But if the bull cycle is to be resumed soon, what could be the propeller? Well, the safe bet was to go back to the source of most moves that happened since November – Donald J. Trump. Some of his many promises included making the US a bitcoin and crypto hub, as well as stopping the sales of confiscated BTC and incorporating it in the country’s national reserves. Senator Lummis has consistently urged for this and believes the US will be the leader. Should that indeed happen, even though Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains skeptical, to say the least, it could give BTC a huge price boost. Improving inflation rates and interest rate cuts could also benefit bitcoin and crypto, as well as reduced trade war and actual war tension.

Instead, they are increasingly drawn towards the emerging RCO Finance (RCOF) due to its innovative AI features and projected rally. Let’s examine why you should capitalize on this investment opportunity! RCO Finance: The Next-Gen Financial Ecosystem The shift of traders moving away from Solana to embrace RCO Finance (RCOF) may seem unexpected at first glance, but this change becomes more understandable when considering the innovative approach of integrating AI technology with financial services. At the core of RCO Finance is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, which democratizes access to advanced investment strategies. By utilizing machine learning, it provides personalized recommendations that adapt to market changes, making sophisticated strategies accessible for traders of all levels. The Robo-Advisor can identify potential downturns, such as those seen with the LIBRA memecoin, alerting users to sell their holdings. This proactive approach helps mitigate losses and enhances the likelihood of maintaining a robust portfolio in a volatile market. RCO Finance boasts over 120,000 tradable assets across 12,500 asset classes, including tokenized real estate and commodities. This extensive selection allows everyday investors to diversify their portfolios and access previously unattainable financial opportunities. The exciting part? RCO Finance’s recently launched beta platform allows you to explore these features before the official launch. Unlike many DeFi trading platforms that wait until after their presale to introduce such functionalities, RCO Finance invites users to experience the platform early, providing valuable feedback to enhance the final product. The DeFi trading platform prioritizes privacy with a KYC-free ecosystem, appealing to users who value anonymity. Robust security measures, such as regular audits of its smart contracts by the reputable SolidProof team, enhance trust and confidence in RCO Finance’s integrity. Solana Drops to Three-Month Low, $100 Fears Mount Solana (SOL) has faced significant pressure in the bearish market, recently hitting a three-month low of $132. Compounding this, Binance sold a large amount of Solana tokens in a short time, prompting some analysts to predict a potential drop to $100. The downturn in Solana’s network activity has resulted in an outflow of about $500 million over the past month. Solana remains below the Ichimoku Cloud, with the Tenkan-sen (conversion line) positioned under the Kijun-sen (base line). Currently trading around $143.97, Solana is down 16% for the week and below the critical support level of $150. The recent price movement has also created a “death cross” pattern, where the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, indicating potential further declines. RCOF Presale Stuns AS Final Stage Looms – Don’t Miss Out! As traders investors turn their attention to its promising presale, RCOF is emerging as the altcoin to watch. Projections indicate a staggering 50,000% increase in token value by 2025, igniting significant interest in acquiring RCOF tokens. Currently priced at just $0.10 , RCOF presents an enticing opportunity. Analysts forecast that the token could rise to between $0.40 and $0.60 by the end of the presale, which translates to a potential growth of over 300%. For those seeking to seize this crypto opportunity, now is an excellent time to invest in RCOF tokens. Use the code “RCOF40” at checkout to enjoy a 40% discount, and gain exclusive access to the robo-advisor during the presale. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by—consider purchasing RCOF presale tokens today!

But while SOL navigates uncertain waters, a new disruptor is quietly positioning itself for a meteoric rise. PropiChain (PCHAIN) , an under-the-radar gem, is making waves with its game-changing fusion of AI, blockchain, and real estate tokenization. With whispers of a staggering 765x surge in just 15 days, the question isn’t whether PCHAIN can compete with Solana, it’s whether it’s about to leave it in the dust. Solana’s Struggles Open Doors for a New Blockchain Leader Amid the buzz of emerging blockchain innovations, Solana (SOL) , once heralded for its advanced architecture and SOL’s meteoric rise, now faces a stark reality. Following a market-wide correction, Solana’s transfer volume has collapsed dramatically from $1.99 billion in November 2024 to a mere $14.57 million today, reflecting waning network activity and eroding investor confidence. This steep decline, combined with persistent selling pressure, has pushed SOL to its lowest trading levels since September 2024. As market sentiment turns bearish, SOL struggles to sustain key support zones, notably trading below $150, with analysts warning of further downside risks. In this uncertain environment, investors are increasingly exploring innovative alternatives. With PropiChain offering a fresh perspective on asset tokenization and AI integration, the gap widens between aging protocols like Solana and cutting-edge competitors positioned for explosive growth. Investors face a choice: cling to outdated platforms burdened by waning activity, or embrace forward-thinking projects promising exponential returns. PropiChain (PCHAIN): The Next Big Disruptor in Real Estate Investment As traditional cryptos like Solana (SOL) face mounting challenges, investors are shifting their focus to new opportunities that combine real-world utility with blockchain efficiency. PropiChain (PCHAIN) offers a unique approach to real estate investment through artificial intelligence (AI) and tokenization. Unlike speculative cryptos that rely solely on hype, PropiChain integrates AI-driven analytics to optimize real estate investments. This advanced technology processes vast amounts of data, offering predictive insights that help investors make informed decisions Instead of relying on market speculation, PCHAIN users gain access to real-time data that highlights the best investment opportunities, minimizing risks and maximizing returns. Additionally, AI-driven automation allows users to set predefined parameters, enabling transactions to be executed automatically when certain market conditions are met. This hands-free approach ensures that investors can capitalize on market fluctuations without constantly monitoring trends. Another standout feature of PropiChain is its innovative fractional ownership model. Through blockchain tokenization, investors can purchase shares of high-value properties instead of buying entire assets. This token system removes the financial barriers typically associated with real estate investment, allowing participants to own portions of prime properties. Whether it’s a luxury penthouse in Miami or a beachfront villa in Bali, PCHAIN democratizes access to high-end real estate, making it accessible to a broader audience. Security is at the core of PropiChain’s ecosystem and by eliminating the need for intermediaries, PCHAIN not only reduces costs but also minimizes the risk of fraud and human error. To further boost investor confidence, the project has undergone a deep audit by BlockAudit , confirming the integrity of its smart contract infrastructure. Adding another layer of innovation, PCHAIN integrates the Metaverse into its platform through “Propiverse.” This feature allows investors to access properties in a fully immersive 3D environment. Breaking geographical barriers, Propiverse makes real estate investment more interactive and accessible to all. The legitimacy of PropiChain is reinforced by its growing recognition in the crypto space. With a recent listing on CoinMarketCap , investor sentiment has turned highly bullish, with confidence levels nearing 100%. The PropiChain (PCHAIN) Presale: A High-Growth Opportunity For investors looking to enter a market with massive upside potential, the PropiChain presale presents an unmatched opportunity. The initial price of PCHAIN started at $0.004 and has already climbed to $0.011 in the second presale stage. As the token progresses through its next phases, prices are set to rise to $0.023 in Stage 3 and $0.032 by the final presale round. Early investors stand to gain up to 800% returns even before the token goes live on major exchanges. Crypto analysts predict an explosive price trajectory for PCHAIN, with projections estimating a surge to $7 by mid-2025. This translates to a jaw-dropping 40,000% return on investment, making it one of the most promising opportunities in the crypto space. A modest $500 investment at current presale prices could potentially grow into $200,000, eclipsing the gains of established cryptos like Solana. Beyond capital appreciation, investors in the PropiChain ecosystem enjoy additional benefits, including a 20-25% purchase bonus during the presale, governance rights, and staking rewards of up to 225%. This not only enhances profitability but also strengthens long-term engagement within the PropiChain community. As Solana (SOL) struggles with declining network activity and increasing volatility, PropiChain presents a compelling alternative for investors seeking stability and high-growth potential. Now is the time to secure a stake in this transformative platform before the rest of the market catches on.

This Indicator Suggests Price Could Rebound To $130,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-the-bitcoin-bull-cycle-over-price-rebound-to-130000/,"The past week has been a rollercoaster ride for the cryptocurrency market, as the value of most large-cap assets took a significant hit over the last seven-day period. Specifically, the Bitcoin price fell beneath $80,000 for the first time since that almost vertical surge in November 2024. As expected, the market downturn has led to discussions and commentary about the price of Bitcoin already reaching its top in this cycle. Nevertheless, the latest on-chain data suggests that the premier cryptocurrency might still have room for a final upward rally. How BTC Price Could Go For A Final Peak In This Cycle In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Tarekonchain revealed the “truth” behind the current cycle, saying the latest market crash might be an opportunity for investors to buy the dip. This prediction is based on a key on-chain indicator, the MVRV Ratio. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Declines 67% In Three Months – Can Meme Coins Recover? The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio is an indicator that tracks the ratio between a coin’s market cap and its realized cap. When the value of this ratio is greater than 1, it implies that more investors are considered to be in profit at the moment. High MVRV ratios are considered price top signals, as traders typically show a propensity to sell off their assets when they are in the green. According to Tarekonchain, the price of Bitcoin peaked in every previous cycle when the MVRV ratio crossed 3.5. However, on-chain data shows that this indicator only reached 2.7 as the price of Bitcoin notched a new all-time high around the $110,000 region. Tarekonchain noted that the Bitcoin price might not have topped out in the current cycle as its MVRV ratio is yet to reach 3.5 as it did in previous cycles. The Quicktake analyst also noted that while BTC’s slump beneath the 365-day moving average is undeniably a bearish signal, the premier cryptocurrency still has an opportunity to rebound from the critical $65,000 support level. “This does not mean the price must reach $65K, but rather that it’s a strong support level,” Tarekonchain added. According to the analyst, the MVRV ratio needs to at least cross 3.0 to be able to confirm the Bitcoin price reaching the cycle top. If the premier cryptocurrency finds support and successfully rebounds, investors could see BTC target new all-time highs — the final peak of this cycle — around $120K–$130K. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $85,000, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Is Solana In A Macro Trend Move?

The figure capped an eight-day streak of outflow during which investors pulled over $3.2 billion from these funds as digital asset prices fell. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest spot bitcoin ETF by assets under management, was one of the outliers that saw $244.6 million in outflows on Friday. Meanwhile, other large ETFs, including Fidelity’s FBTC, brought in $176 million from investors, while the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF saw the largest inflows, bringing in $193.7 million, according to Farside Investors data . The inflows came as the cryptocurrency market started showing signs of recovery after the price of bitcoin hit a $78,000 low in the early hours of Feb. 28. Bitcoin is now trading around $84,900 after rising 1.6% in the last 24 hours, while the broader CoinDesk 20 Index rose 0.3% to 2,705. Over the past week, BTC is still down by roughly 12%, while the broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, fell by 15.8%. Spot bitcoin ETFs had been enduring a significant outflow streak since Feb. 14, a day in which these funds saw $66.2 million inflows. Spot ether ETFs, on the other hand, have maintained an ongoing outflow streak on the last day of February, with $41.9 million leaving these funds. Since their last day with a positive net flow, $357.5 million exited these funds, according to data from Farside. The recent market recovery comes as the White House announced that U.S. President Donald Trump will host a crypto summit on March 7 and after the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, added a 1% to 2% allocation of its spot bitcoin ETF to one of its model portfolios.

41014601,https://invezz.com/?p=2594747,1740848629,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Weekly crypto recap: Bitcoin loses key support level, IP leads altcoin gains",https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/01/weekly-crypto-recap-bitcoin-loses-key-support-level-ip-leads-altcoin-gains/,"This week, Bitcoin broke below its multi-month support level at $90,000 and wiped out mostly all of the gains accrued in the post-election rally that began in November after President Donald Trump won the 2024 elections. Macroeconomic pressures were the key factor behind this week’s downturn, with the total cryptocurrency market capitalization dropping approximately 13% to $2.91 trillion at the time of writing. Market sentiment dropped to record lows into the extreme fear territory to 16, a level last seen in June 2022. Similarly, most altcoins succumbed to market pressures and lost significant value, with several large-cap cryptocurrencies posting double-digit losses. Why is Bitcoin going down? The latest sell-off comes amid growing macroeconomic concerns, with Bitcoin and the broader crypto market reacting to fresh US tariff policies targeting China, Mexico, and Canada. On Feb. 27, President Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, bringing the total to 20% starting March 4. He also confirmed that 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports will take effect the same day. In response, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned of an “immediate and extremely strong” countermeasure. The uncertainty surrounding these tariffs has rattled risk assets, including crypto. Bitcoin’s sharp drop in February also hurt demand for spot ETFs, triggering outflows of about $3.65 billion. On Feb. 25 alone, investors pulled $1.1 billion—the largest single-day withdrawal since the ETFs launched. With poor macro conditions and investor sentiment at its lowest in nearly two years, Bitcoin’s price remains under pressure, and traders are closely watching key support levels for signs of stability. What’s next for Bitcoin? The general consensus among experts is that the current downturn would likely continue until the situation cools down on the global level. According to Bitget analysts, the next key support level is at $75,000 based on historical patterns. Others like, Global Macro Investor Raoul Pal expects a deeper correction to $70,000, although Bitget’s Ryan Lee says such a scenario is less likely without any new bearish catalysts in play. Lee noted that while a drop to $70,000 isn’t off the table, it would likely require “sustained panic or macro deterioration beyond current pressures.” He pointed to $75,000 as a more immediate level of support. Meanwhile, well-followed analyst Rekt Capital said Bitcoin is in its first price discovery correction, and the current scenario could last another couple of weeks if historical patterns repeat. He noted that while the ongoing 25% drawdown is milder compared to past cycles, where Bitcoin has seen corrections of 30% or more, its duration is aligning more closely with the 2013 cycle, which lasted 13 weeks. If this trend holds, Bitcoin could still experience some downside pressure before stabilizing. At the time of writing, one Bitcoin was selling for $84,261 down over 14% this week. Altcoin market tanks The total altcoin market cap dropped roughly 10% in the past week to $1.19 trillion by late Friday. Most altcoins erased their gains accrued over the past months, and the Altcoin Season Index had slipped to a yearly low of 21 at publication time. Story (IP) was the only cryptocurrency among the top 99 tokens by market cap to maintain significant gains, rising 17.4% during the period. As of press time, its market cap was approximately $1.42 billion. Most of these gains came after IP broke out of a descending channel pattern that kept its price in a downtrend between Feb. 21 and Feb. 25 and flipping the resistance at $6 as its support. Story Protocol’s RWA platform, Aria, acquired and tokenized part of the copyright for The Truth Untold, a song by BTS and Steve Aoki which stirred community excitement leading to most of its gains over the past week. Other altcoins, such as Maker (MKR) and Mantra (OM), saw most of their gains erased amid a broader altcoin market downturn, which shed nearly $135 billion and fell below a $1.2 trillion market cap.

Many see these new moves as a breakthrough moment, especially for Ethereum-based tokens that thrive in decentralized finance. Rollblock also benefits from such favorable winds, drawing interest from those who expect big returns from emerging projects. Yet behind the hype lies a deeper narrative: a revived DeFi ecosystem where innovative tokens can flourish under the watchful eye of fewer regulatory hurdles. Investors now wonder which tokens will soar next. Rollblock fosters trust through transparent governance Rollblock is a DeFi platform built on Ethereum technology, aiming to merge iGaming and finance in one ecosystem. It boasts over 7,000 games, live sports betting, and an online casino that rewards users with weekly dividends. During its presale, Rollblock has already raised $10.7 million , offering RBLK tokens at $0.06 each: a bargain for those seeking early-stage growth. Holders benefit from up to 30% APY through staking. The more tokens they hold, the greater their passive returns. Transparency is key, which is why Rollblock uses Ethereum-backed smart contracts to secure transactions. The project's weekly buybacks and token burns reduce supply, creating lasting value. 60% of purchased tokens are burned, while 40% are shared with stakers to encourage long-term holding. Analysts view Rollblock as a low-cap gem with potential for high gains, especially as more investors pour into ETH-powered DeFi. Besides extensive gameplay, the online casino experience stands out for its rakebacks, VIP bonuses, and user incentives. Rollblock is described as a 'blue chip in the making' thanks to a focus on real-world utility and strategic tokenomics. Early adopters can claim presale tokens at the lowest possible price, positioning themselves to profit from the platform's future momentum. Trump's policies & ETH mean a new era for crypto Under the latest Trump crypto order, the U.S. government has reversed past restrictions, clearing the path for decentralized networks. This bold shift benefits ETH more than any other chain, as its total value locked in DeFi surpasses 60 billion dollars. Many see the plan to officially recognize stablecoins on Ethereum as a game-changer since permissionless finance can expand without fear of sudden bans. By embracing open protocols, the administration shows a willingness to legitimize projects that run on ETH. As a result, investors eye tokens on Ethereum and rival blockchains, including Solana, for potential gains. However, analysts argue that Ethereum's robust developer community and first-mover advantage still give ETH the upper hand. While Solana attempts to attract meme coin hype, it lacks the deep liquidity and user trust found in ETH markets. Observers believe the executive directive marks a turning point, with more capital set to pour into Ethereum-based projects. Nevertheless, competition remains fierce, prompting some to question whether Trump's crypto reforms might also spur lesser-known chains. For now, Ethereum's dominance looks solid, and tokens built on ETH continue to flourish in a friendlier regulatory climate. The future of decentralized finance may well hinge on this pivotal policy shift moving forward. Conclusion Ethereum's strengthened footing and Rollblock's dynamic ecosystem highlight how policy can reshape the crypto landscape. With ETH now backed by friendlier regulations, new tokens can thrive in DeFi. While competition remains active, many see Rollblock as a standout. Truly, this changing political climate might be the catalyst everyone's been awaiting, and with its 50% presale bonus now live, buyers are racing to secure early returns before the token's expected 50x surge.

Latest SEC Moves Spark Speculation For Rally,https://nulltx.com/ripple-xrp-news-ripple-to-bounce-much-sooner-than-anticipated-latest-sec-moves-spark-speculation-for-rally/,"Ripple’s ongoing battle with the SEC has taken yet another turn, and this time, it could be the catalyst for an earlier-than-expected XRP price surge – we’ll cover this topic below in detail. While this is happening, Bitcoin’s slow speeds and high fees remain a persistent issue for users. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) , a hybrid Layer-2 solution, could solve this by upgrading Bitcoin’s efficiency. With its advanced scaling technology and quicker block times, it could make transactions faster and significantly reduce costs. Let’s check out the deets. New Advancements In the SEC vs. Ripple Trial Might Bring a New Surge for XRP – Here’s What’s Happening The SEC has unexpectedly dropped six crypto-related enforcement cases in the past week, which is a major hint at a possible shift in its regulatory stance. Its investigation into Gemini has concluded, and a settlement may be in the works for its case against Tron. The sudden wave of dismissals has brought speculation that the agency is reassessing its enforcement approach. As for the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, the case remains in the appeals phase after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP sales to retail investors do not qualify as securities transactions—a partial victory for Ripple. Legal expert Rispoli has suggested a straightforward resolution in his post on X – both parties drop their appeals, with Ripple paying a $125 million penalty to finalize the case. He dismissed concerns over potential delays, stating the outcome is inevitable. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Amonyx predicts that if Ripple continues to prevail, XRP could surge beyond $20 in the next few months. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Is a New Hybrid L2 Platform That Could Solve Bitcoin’s Biggest Challenges in 2025 Bitcoin’s slow transactions and high fees have long restricted its potential as a scalable digital currency over the past few years. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) , a hybrid Layer-2 platform, might be able to fix these inefficiencies while introducing major new features to the ecosystem. Currently, Bitcoin block confirmations take around 10 minutes, which makes transactions sluggish and costly. PlutoChain’s hybrid Layer-2 framework could process them in just 2 seconds, which is a potentially huge boost in speed and usability. Another key advantage could be its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, which may help developers seamlessly port projects between networks. This integration could finally bring decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts to Bitcoin, something its core infrastructure has struggled to support for over a decade. Early tests show that PlutoChain can process over 43,200 transactions per day, proving its scalability and potential readiness for real-world use cases. Security is also a priority, with audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi ensuring code integrity. Additionally, PlutoChain introduces a governance model that could allow users to vote on key decisions, which brings greater control to the entire community. By addressing Bitcoin’s long-standing inefficiencies, PlutoChain could make digital payments faster, cheaper, and more accessible—helping Bitcoin finally realize its full potential in the decentralized finance sector. The Bottom Line With the SEC dropping enforcement cases and the Ripple lawsuit nearing a resolution, speculation is growing that XRP could see a major price surge. If Ripple successfully fends off further regulatory pressure, some analysts believe XRP could break past $10-$20. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s scalability challenges remain a roadblock to wider adoption, but PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could offer a potential solution. With its hybrid Layer-2 technology, PlutoChain may bring faster transactions, lower fees, and even smart contract functionality for Bitcoin. This article does not offer financial advice.

The Bank of Japan’s integration with Ripple (XRP) would be a game-changer that brings crypto deeper into mainstream banking. At the same time, StratoVM ($SVM) might push Bitcoin beyond just a store of value by introducing DeFi, smart contracts, and AI applications to its network. These kinds of shifts show how crypto is not only gaining acceptance in traditional finance but also expanding its real-world use cases in the digital economy. Here’s what you need to know. Can XRP Skyrocket to $20 After the Bank of Japan’s Bold Move? The Bank of Japan (BOJ) took a major step by adopting Ripple’s XRP for cross-border payments. This move is expected to make international transactions faster and cheaper, which will be a big shift toward cryptocurrency in traditional banking. A key player in this adoption is SBI Holdings, a major financial institution in Japan. Its CEO, Yoshitaka Kitao, has been supporting XRP for a while and believes it could transform global remittances. Reports suggest that by 2025, around 80% of Japanese banks may integrate XRP, which could reshape international finance. With Japan’s $6.37 trillion banking industry getting behind XRP, demand for the cryptocurrency could rise, which would push its price higher. However, there are challenges ahead. Japan has strict financial regulations, which could slow down XRP’s full integration. While the BOJ’s support is a big win, the overall regulatory landscape will determine just how far XRP can go. As of now, XRP is trading at $2.19, down 0.45% over the past 24 hours. Even though analyst BUTCHER isn’t a fan of XRP, he admits the chart looks very bullish and predicts a potential run to $20. StratoVM: The Bitcoin Layer-2 That Could Bring DeFi, AI, and Smart Contracts to BTC For years, Bitcoin has been known primarily as a secure store of value. However, its lack of smart contract functionality has kept it on the sidelines while other blockchains, like Ethereum and Solana, dominate DeFi, AI, and meme coin ecosystems. That might be about to change with StratoVM ($SVM) , an emerging Layer-2 solution that aims to bring scalability, smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi) to the Bitcoin network. Currently trading at $0.1403, StratoVM has risen by 2,537% in just a week, according to CoinGecko . SVM 7-day chart, Source: CoinGecko With its mainnet launch around the corner, excitement is building fast. If successful, this Layer-2 solution could expand Bitcoin’s role beyond a store of value and into a powerhouse for DeFi, AI applications, and beyond. Despite its recent surge, StratoVM is still in its early stages. Its market cap sits at just $2.4 million, a fraction of CoreDAO’s $500 million valuation. This means there’s the potential for further growth—if adoption continues to increase. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s DeFi sector (BTCFi) is booming. According to DeFiLlama , the Total Value Locked (TVL) in Bitcoin DeFi projects has skyrocketed from $307 million in early 2024 to $5.85 billion in early 2025. This rapid expansion shows an increasing demand for Layer-2 solutions like StratoVM that could enhance Bitcoin’s utility, speed, and efficiency. The momentum is already strong. A Uniswap listing has put StratoVM on the radar, and there are also rumors of a centralized exchange (CEX) listing. The testnet has shown impressive numbers—over 113,312 wallets created and more than 56,200 daily transactions. If StratoVM can deliver on its promises, it could usher in a new era of DeFi, AI, and smart contract innovation on the world’s most secure blockchain. The Bottom Line The Bank of Japan is embracing Ripple (XRP), and this might be what it needs to reach $20. Meanwhile, StratoVM ($SVM) could lead to new possibilities for Bitcoin by bringing DeFi and smart contracts to the network. Both could impact the future of crypto, but StratoVM’s early-stage growth might make it one to watch for those looking for potential protocol expansion. This article is not financial advice.

After soaring in 2023 with a 150,000% run that took it to an all time high of 0.000028, it is sad to see that PEPE is now losing steam. Traders are also losing faith as its daily transactions are reducing and bearish signals hint at a drop to $0.000005. Luckily, investors have Panshibi (SHIBI) , an Asian meme coin sensation that is just in the stage 4 of its presale. This gives investors enough chance to ape in before it goes through its 15 presale stages. However, there are less than 25 days to become an early Panshibi adopter. Find out more about Pepe’s woes and why its holders are buying Panshibi instead. Pepecoin Crypto Holders Cut Losses to Rotate into New Coin Pepecoin (PEPE) holders are racing to offload their tokens as the PEPE price nosedives in 2025. This has prompted a desperate shift to fresher prospects. Once a memecoin darling with a 150,000% surge in 2023, PEPE is now at $0.0000079 with more than a 70% crash from its all-time high . This brutal drop has slashed its market cap from $10 billion to $3.3 billion since December, leaving its 407,081 holders reeling. Posts on X(formerly Twitter) call it a “bearish bloodbath,” with the PEPE price teetering on the edge of more price dips as analysts say there are more red candles ahead. Now, investors are cutting losses, tired of waiting for a rebound that’s nowhere in sight. The PEPE price woes stem from fading hype and a brutal market shift. Daily transactions have slumped and whale activity is down too. This shows that even big players are bailing. Analysts warn of an 80% market cap wipeout by year-end if trends hold, with some pegging a fall to $0.000005. PEPE’s Fear & Greed Index sits at 30 as more investors have a bearish sentiment about it. Holders who rode the PEPE wave up are now rotating funds into coins with brighter sparks. One such spark is Panshibi ($SHIBI), a new Asian-inspired memecoin making waves. Panshibi Rises in This Bear Market to Offer Investors High Hopes In today’s unpredictable bear market, where even the PEPE price has tumbled over 70% from its all-time high, Panshibi ($SHIBI) emerges as a beacon of hope for investors. This innovative crypto project unites Asia’s vibrant culture, the charm of pandas, and the energy of meme coins. With its presale gaining unstoppable momentum, Panshibi promises a lifeline for those seeking big returns amidst the gloom. The Panshibi presale, now in stage 4 with tokens priced at $0.005, is capped at $10 million and has just 24 days remaining. Offering 60% of its 2 billion total supply, this presale is structured across 15 stages, with prices set to surge 1,200% before launch. Also, analysts forecast a jaw-dropping 145,000% increase after listing on Uniswap and other centralized platforms. This increase will be fueled by a liquidity pool locked for 10 years and unsold tokens burned to boost scarcity. Now, the Panshibi presale has already raised over $1.19 million, showcasing investor trust despite the PEPE price crash and bearish trend shaking the meme coin space. Unlike many projects rattled by volatility, Panshibi prioritizes safety and transparency. Its smart contract, audited by Coinsult, passed with flying colors, reassuring investors. Also, presale holders gain exclusive entry to the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club In addition, these holders can stake $SHIBI for up to 1,200% APY which will help them turn idle tokens into passive income. With the meme coin market valued at $115 billion in January 2025 and projected to soar later in a favorable 2025 regulatory climate, Panshibi’s timing is impeccable. Conclusion As the PEPE price struggles to recover, Panshibi’s presale offers a bold alternative. With less than 24 days to go, more investors are now struggling to get a piece before it launches. Thanks to its easy platform, purchasing is like a walk in the park. With this panda-powered token, Panshibi is set to redefine meme coin success, giving investors high hopes in this bearish storm.

Many investors are shifting their attention to Panshibi (SHIBI) during its last presale phases as Dogecoin (DOGE) shows unpredictable price movements and could fall below $0.1. Let’s delve into why DOGE Crypto holders are making a major move toward Panshibi’s final presale buys as the countdown nears its end. Analysts Expect Dogecoin Price Will Pump In 2025: Panshibi Will Surge Better The DOGE crypto price is currently at $0.1967 and has experienced a 5.8% decrease from yesterday. But the price still falls short of last week's value which has seen Dogecoin’s market cap reduced to $29 billion. Market analysts observe that the bearish trend matches wider market forces which have pushed Bitcoin below $85,000 while causing investors to lose trust in meme coins. Some experts, citing Polymarket data, peg a 22% chance of Dogecoin reaching a new all-time high above $0.73 by mid-2025, potentially spurred by speculation around a DOGE ETF approval. Still, the consensus is cautious; a modest pump to $0.50 or even $1 might be in the cards, but explosive growth seems tempered by its massive market cap and reliance on hype rather than utility. The contrast couldn’t be starker as 2025 progresses. Dogecoin’s price might see a boost from community enthusiasm or regulatory tailwinds like the SEC’s nod to Grayscale’s DOGE ETF filing, but its ceiling feels lower than Panshibi’s sky-high potential. Panshibi Has Investors Convinced It Is Poised for Explosive Growth In 2025 In stark contrast to Dogecoin’s struggles, Panshibi is now irresistible, drawing DOGE Crypto holders with its impressive presale performance and innovative vision. This Ethereum-based, panda-themed token has already amassed over $1.19 million, now in Stage 4 of its presale with tokens priced at an enticing $0.005 The buzz around Panshibi isn’t just hype; it’s rooted in its clever ecosystem and aggressive staking rewards that set it apart from the old meme coins still making rounds in the crypto world today. Experts highlight its solid tokenomics and well-thought-out roadmap as reasons it might skyrocket, possibly even hitting a 100x increase in value, which has seasoned investors genuinely excited. This shift toward practicality and lasting potential is pulling in former DOGE cryptosupporters, sparking a noticeable rush of funds as the presale clock winds down. With only a handful of days left before the presale wraps up, the pressure’s on. Investors are racing to lock in their spots at the current low entry price, convinced that Panshibi could leave older tokens in the dust and claim a spot among top altcoins next year. This wave of enthusiasm from DOGE crypto fans points to a bigger trend: a growing appetite for top Defi projects that blend innovation with real staying power, making Panshibi a magnet for new capital. Why DOGE Holders Are Moving To Panshibi Now As Dogecoin faces declining momentum and an uncertain future, its holders are taking action. Panshibi’s token presale, with its blend of high-yield staking, audited security, and a clear path to major exchange listings, is a no-brainer for these smart money investors. The final days of this new ICO are a critical window: a $1,000 investment at $0.005 could theoretically balloon to $100,000 if the 10,000% projection holds a prospect that dwarfs Dogecoin’s current trajectory. With 25 days already elapsed and the clock ticking, the rush to secure SHIBI tokens is intensifying..

Crypto analysts are optimistic about Shiba Inu’s price predictions as strong internal dynamics position the token for growth. Meanwhile, Panshibi is a rising crypto presale and has raised over $1.19 million with just 23 days remaining. Expected to be the biggest Asian-inspired meme coin of 2025, its $SHIBI token price is set to soar 1,200% before launch. Early investors will receive substantial ROIs from this new crypto presale, which could redefine crypto investing. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Whale Activity Surges as Bullish Momentum Builds Shiba Inu has surged recently, fueling speculations that Shiba Inu might be on track for a potential rebound. Crypto experts have highlighted the surprising stability in the Ethereum blockchain as the main driver of this new growth, given that the Ethereum ecosystem recently survived a Bybit hack by the North Korea-linked hacker groups. Shiba Inu has now emerged as one of the best-performing tokens on the Ethereum ecosystem, with analysts hinting at a potential rally amidst strong interest from large investors and fueling positive market sentiment around SHIB’s future. Despite the prevailing market volatility, Shiba Inu seems off to a good start in March 2025 amid strong internal momentum. Shiba Inu price predictions are also bullish, reflecting strong performance against broader macroeconomic pressures. If whale demand remains strong, SHIB could sustain its rebound and move higher. However, a slowdown in accumulation may cause the price to retest key support at $0.000012 before another potential breakout. Panshibi Buys Overtake Shiba Inu Momentum: 23 Days Left Before Explosive Gains Panshibi , the newest contender in the meme coin space, is rapidly gaining traction as investors rush to secure early-stage tokens. Inspired by pandas and Asian culture, Panshibi merges social-fi and community driven quests to reward its growing community. With $SHIBI as the native token, holders can stake for up to 1,200% APY and gain VIP access to the exclusive Bamboo Private Club. The presale has already raised over $1.19 million, reaching stage 4 at $0.005, 23 days before major price surges. With a 1,200% price increase expected during presale and a projected 145,000% surge post-launch, Panshibi is poised to be the biggest meme coin in 2025. The $10M-capped presale spans 60 days and features 15 stages, with the price increasing after each phase. The project’s credibility is backed by a smart contract audit from blockchain security firm Coinsult, which ensures transparency and safety. Unlike many new tokens, Panshibi will list on major centralized exchanges immediately after launch. Investors are flocking to Panshibi as liquidity is locked for 10 years, and team tokens remain locked for two years, reducing potential sell pressure. Experts believe this Asian-inspired meme coin could outpace Shiba Inu, driven by strong community backing and high staking rewards. With only 23 days remaining in the presale, buyers looking for explosive gains are moving fast before the next price hike. Those who join now stand to benefit from the highest potential returns before the token goes live on major exchanges. Panshibi Buys Overtake Shiba Inu Momentum: 23 Days Left to Secure Massive Gains! Shiba Inu has surged recently, reclaiming key price levels as Ethereum-based tokens rebound from recent market turbulence.

However, a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart signals a potential reversal, with growing accumulation as Pepe holders surpass 406,000. This rising demand fuels speculation that a significant surge could be on the horizon. Meanwhile, Panshibi , a new presale sensation, has already raised nearly $1.2 million, offering lucrative staking rewards of up to 1,200% APY. Early investors gain exclusive access to the Bamboo Private VIP Club, with $SHIBI currently priced at $0.005 in stage 4. With only days left in the presale, now is the perfect time to join before prices rise. PEPE Crypto Poised for a Massive Breakout—Is a 245% Surge Ahead? Pepe has been in a prolonged downtrend , shedding over 70% from its all-time high in December. However, technical indicators suggest a potential reversal with the formation of a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart. If momentum builds, crypto analysts opine that the price prediction of Pepe could point at a strong rally toward its peak of $0.00002830. Beyond technical signals, on-chain data reveals that 17% of Pepe whales have never sold their holdings, reflecting firm conviction among major investors. Additionally, the total number of Pepe holders continues to grow, exceeding 406,000. This accumulation trend suggests increasing demand, reinforcing the case for a rebound. With concerns rising over the sustainability of Solana meme coins, some traders may rotate into more established tokens like Pepe, further fueling its recovery. From a valuation perspective, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator has dropped to an opportunity zone, signaling that Pepe is currently undervalued. The last time the MVRV-Z score hit this level, the price saw a massive rally, hinting at history potentially repeating itself. With multiple bullish indicators aligning, the latest Pepe price prediction remains optimistic, projecting a potential surge of 245%—unless it dips below the critical support of $0.0000060. 100X Favourite Panshibi (SHIBI) Hits World Stage As Days Remain To Buy: $0.005 SHIBI Available Now Panshibi is a revolutionary crypto project uniting Asia, meme culture, and the beloved panda into one robust ecosystem. As the next top meme coin, Panshibi leverages Social-Fi and driven features to offer engaging quests, rewards, and exclusive benefits to its community. Its native token, $SHIBI, unlocks a host of utilities, including high-yield staking with APYs of up to 1,200% and VIP access to the Bamboo Private Club for early investors. Experts predict Panshibi will dominate the meme coin space in 2025, solidifying its status as the ultimate Asian-inspired memecoin. With a $10 million presale cap and only 60 days to participate, demand for $SHIBI is skyrocketing. The token price is set to surge by 1,200% during presale and could explode by 145,000% post-launch. A total of 15 presale stages will gradually raise the price before its highly anticipated listings on major centralized exchanges. To ensure long-term stability, the liquidity pool will be locked for 10 years, while team tokens will remain locked for two years—enhancing investor confidence in Panshibi’s long-term vision. Panshibi has undergone a rigorous smart contract audit by blockchain security firm Coinsult, passing with zero issues to guarantee safety and transparency. Panshibi has raised nearly $1.2 million, setting new standards for ICOs and crypto investments.

However, Rollblock (RBLK) has defied market trends, delivering exceptional growth that has caught the attention of experts and traders. With an innovative approach to blockchain-based gaming, RBLK has surged in price, offering returns of over 500% to early backers and establishing itself as one of the most promising projects of 2025. Rollblock: A Rising GameFi Star Defying Market Volatility Rollblock (RBLK) is emerging as a major success in 2025, even as the market momentum slows. Since the RBLK presale launched at $0.015, the token has surged to $0.06, marking an over 450% return to early holders. Retail investors and institutional players are fueling this rise, with over 50,000 active users drawn to Rollblock’s impact on the gaming and DeFi sectors. The platform offers over 7,000 blockchain-focused games and a sports prediction league, rivaling top legacy platforms. The Blockchain integration ensures transparency and fairness, positioning Rollblock as an influential challenger in the $540 billion online gaming industry, which is riddled with trust issues. Investors are also drawn to its revenue-sharing model, which allocates a portion of platform earnings to RBLK holders. Rollblock’s staking mechanism provides passive income opportunities, offering an impressive 30% APY. The platform’s buyback and burn strategy reduces the circulating supply, creating scarcity and increasing long-term value. As interest in Rollblock grows, investment is ramping up, as over $10.7 million has been raised in funding. With major exchange listings approaching, stage 10 tokens are selling out quickly at $0.06. Investors can also take advantage of a 50% limited-time bonus on all RBLK purchases heading into March. Cardano (ADA) Remains Strong Despite Market Pressure Cardano has dropped over 20% in value in the last 30 days, but a breakout above $0.83 could trigger a short-term rally. Source: TradingView Popular analyst, Ali_charts on X , has identified the $0.67 to $0.80 range as a critical zone for ADA’s bullish momentum. This level has played a key role in Cardano’s price movement, acting as resistance and support in previous cycles. If ADA holds above this range, it could fuel a further price surge. However, a drop below this zone might trigger a deeper correction. Investors are watching closely as ADA navigates this crucial price level. In other ADA news, the Plomin hard fork update is one of the primary reasons Cardano holders are optimistic about the network’s outlook. The new update will provide on-chain governance features while raising transparency levels and accountability standards, strengthening investor beliefs about Cardano’s future potential. Another key factor driving the growing investor interest in Cardano is Grayscale’s current application for a spot Exchange-traded fund (ETF). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged the filing and begun its review process. If approved, the ETF would list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca, opening Cardano to a wave of institutional investment. Could XRP’s Legal Win Over the SEC Boost Its Price? XRP’s price has dropped by over 22% this month and is now trading around $2.25. Many holders are selling off their bags due to ongoing regulatory concerns. While XRP still commands a $130 billion market cap, its short-term outlook remains uncertain. Source: TradingView Nonetheless, Ripple recently announced plans to enhance compliance functions and expand lending services on the XRP Ledger. This move aims to help institutions offer new lending products while meeting regulatory standards. However, uncertainty around XRP’s future persists. Ripple’s legal dispute with the SEC might persist, creating downward pressure on XRP price movements. Crypto analysts at Currency Analytics are divided on XRP’s 2025 price trajectory. Their analysis shows that if Ripple succeeds in resolving its regulatory issues, XRP will reach $3.99 by the end of 2025. In contrast, the mounting regulatory complications and extensive market declines could drive XRP a bit below its current level to settle at $2.15. Investors are paying close attention to Ripples’ plans which could help shape XRP’s future price trajectory. Rollblock is Projected to Outperform Cardano and XRP While Cardano and XRP remain dominant forces in the crypto market, Rollblock’s explosive rise has captured the attention of investors worldwide. With its innovative tokenomics, lucrative staking rewards, and over $10.7 million raised in presale, RBLK is proving to be the next big opportunity in 2025.

The answer is clear: Solaxy, Lightchain AI, and Rollblock. Among the three, Rollblock stands out with its massive growth potential. The GameFi protocol is tapping into the $450 billion gaming industry, strategically using a portion of its revenue to drive demand for RBLK. As Rollblock expands its market presence and increases revenue, analysts believe RBLK could surge 100x, potentially reaching $1. Here’s why these 3 presales stand out. Solaxy Solves Solana’s Biggest Problems Solana continues to face network congestion, transaction failures, and high validator costs, limiting its scalability. Blockchain expert Evan Luthra has pointed out these ongoing issues, citing costly hardware, centralization risks, and repeated network outages from 2022 to 2024. These fundamental problems are also contributing to Solana’s underperformance in 2025, with the layer 1 registering a 40% decrease in the past 30 days alone. Solaxy is launching Solana’s first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution to address these challenges. The blockchain has already raised over $23 million in presale, showing strong investor confidence. Solaxy’s Layer-2 rollup aims to boost Solana’s transaction speed, scalability, and reliability. Reducing congestion ensures seamless transactions even during peak usage, unlike previous MEMECOIN surges that slowed Solana’s network. With Hyperlane integration , Solaxy enables effortless cross-chain transfers between Solana and its Layer-2 rollup, improving fund movement and asset transfers. The $SOLX token is available at $0.001646 during presale, offering a 173% APY for staked tokens. LightchainAI Combines AI with RWA The Real-World Asset (RWA) market is expanding rapidly, with experts from McKinsey projecting that it could hit $3.8 trillion by 2030 as regulatory clarity and adoption improve. Currently, on-chain RWAs are valued at $17.59 billion across 110 issuers, according to RWA.xyz . Lightchain AI is emerging as a leader in RWA tokenization, integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain to enhance liquidity, security, and scalability. Its AI-powered PoI consensus reduces network congestion, ensures data integrity, and optimizes decentralized asset management for real estate, intellectual property, and financial assets. Currently priced at $0.006, Lightchain AI has raised $16.72 million with a total supply of 10 billion LCAI tokens. With 4 billion tokens allocated to the presale, investor interest in Lightchain AI is strong. Positioned as a key player in AI-powered blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI tackles scalability, privacy, and security challenges in DeFi. Is Rollblock Taking First Place Among The Best Crypto Presales? Rollblock’s presale continues to surge, raising over $10.7 million from over 50,000 investors in just ten rounds. Unlike speculative memecoin projects, Rollblock’s success is built on real utility, offering a secure and transparent gaming experience powered by blockchain technology. The platform features over 7,000 AI-powered games, including live dealers and sports betting, fully on-chain via the Ethereum blockchain. This ensures every game outcome is recorded, preventing fraud or tampering. Rollblock further strengthens its credibility with an Anjouan Gaming Authority license and a SolidProof audit, verifying smart contract integrity. Beyond security, Rollblock tackles slow transaction issues that plague traditional gaming. Players can deposit and withdraw funds in seconds using 20+ cryptocurrencies. The recent integration of Apple and Google Pay allows seamless fiat transactions, expanding accessibility. At the core of Rollblock is RBLK, its native token that drives governance, VIP rewards, and staking. RBLK follows a deflationary model, using up to 30% of platform revenue to buy back and burn 60% of tokens while distributing the remaining 40% as staking rewards. This reduces supply, increases demand, and supports long-term price growth. With GameFi becoming one of the most profitable sectors in 2024 and expected to maintain momentum into 2025, Rollblock is well-positioned for continued success. Its 50% limited-time presale bonus is drawing strong interest, further accelerating investor participation. Can Rollblock Outperform Lightchain AI and Solaxy? Rollblock is on track to outperform Lightchain AI and Solaxy in 2025, fueled by its strong protocol and the growing demand for GameFi projects. The platform continues to attract thousands of new investors each week, reinforcing its momentum. Currently priced at $0.06, RBLK has already surged 500% across ten presale rounds. If this trend continues, analysts predict the token could reach $1 by year-end. With major exchange listings approaching, stage 10 tokens are selling out quickly. Investors also have a limited-time opportunity to secure a 50% bonus on all RBLK purchases this week. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Vana ( VANA ) is a layer-1 network for user-owned data. The project aims to allow users to contribute, tokenize, and share their data to create next-generation artificial intelligence (AI)-focused applications. The project’s native asset, VANA, launched in December and is trading at $8.88 at time of writing. The 228th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 3% in the past day and more than 37% in the past week. VANA’s gains largely materialized after YZi Labs, formerly known as Binance Labs, announced a new investment in the layer-1 project. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) also joined Vana as an advisor. Explains YZi Labs, “This marks YZi Labs’ first AI investment since its rebranding, reinforcing its expanded focus on transformative innovations beyond Web3, including AI and biotechnology. With CZ joining Vana as an advisor, the team is well-positioned to accelerate its vision of powering the next generation of AI breakthroughs. The personal data economy is estimated to be worth $1 trillion, with 329 million terabytes of data expected to be generated daily by 2025. However, the vast majority of this value is captured by a handful of corporations rather than the individuals who create the data. Vana is changing this paradigm by introducing a programmable data sovereignty layer that enables individuals to decide who uses their data and how it is monetized.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The cross-border remittance giant that won hearts after its legal victory has been battered by market uncertainty. As of press time, the XRP price has plunged 28% MoM following President Trump’s tariff announcement on the EU. The bearish headwind is intensifying. Futures Open Interest is at an all-time low this year as traders and investors diversify with a new top performer: Rollblock . The iGaming revolution, which doubled as a house-edge staking crypto, is challenging the status quo. While XRP struggles, Rollblock has raised a whopping $10.7M, and the rising momentum begs the question: Are we witnessing the dawn of an ‘XRP Killer’? Rollblock’s ascent: New GambleFi utility token overtakes XRP in presale There’s no denying that the recent market dump has dealt a big blow to many investors’ portfolios. But the smart ones know that value-driven utility always wins, and that’s why Rollblock’s staking crypto has struck a chord with many DeFi enthusiasts. This new utility token has dominated the market with its high-demand presale. The draw was its decentralised iGaming revolution, which brings more secure, transparent and immutable gambling. It leverages the Ethereum smart contract to infuse provably fair gaming in over 7,000 titles. Another game-changing feature is its integration of traditional and crypto payment methods for lightning-speed transaction processing. With early investors already seeing triple-digit gains, market sentiment suggests Rollblock’s momentum is far from over. The utility aspect has also been a spectacular feature of Rollblock. Apart from offering a deflationary revenue-sharing scheme, the RBLK token doubles as a staking crypto that offers up to 30% APY. The wait is almost over! The Rollblock token presale is in its final hours after growing 500% and even outpacing XRP. XRP price dropped 27% MoM amid President Trump’s tariff decision It’s a completely different narrative for the XRP price. The geopolitical tension that springs up after Trump’s recent tariff decision has crippled Ripple. The aftermath was a 28% MoM decline that drove the price near psychological support at $2 after Trump announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on the EU. The market reaction was swift and brutal. Bitcoin fell to a three-month low of around $82K, and XRP’s already faltering momentum followed suit. Analysts predict that a sustained bearish momentum could push the altcoin further to $1.80. Adding to the jitter, open interest in the futures market declined to its lowest level in 2025. This followed a $79 million three-day liquidation that suggests waning confidence. However, the swirling ETF speculations could offer some glimmer of hope. Last week, Brazil approved the first spot XRP ETF backed by Hashdex Nasdaq—a move that has reignited institutional interest in the altcoin. However, XRP bulls remain on shaky ground, especially with the SEC appeal and Trump’s tariff rattling its price action. Conclusion XRP’s reign is hanging by a thread. But in contrast to its uphill battle, Rollblock is witnessing an explosive rise with its value-driven utility and disruptive GambleFi solution. With over $10.7M raised and momentum accelerating, RBLK is no longer just an underdog—it’s a force to be reckoned with. Its presale demand is growing exponentially, selling at just $0.06 in presale stage 10. As the presale nears its end, one question remains: Is Rollblock the true ‘XRP Killer’? The market may have already made its decision. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

XRP and Ethereum have demonstrated potential, but which one currently offers the best value? This article examines their latest developments and analyzes key factors to determine which cryptocurrency may be poised for significant growth. XRP: Past Rebound and Current Bearish Pressure in Key Zones Past month performance shows a steep decline with prices dropping nearly 29% and a weekly fall of around 16%, contrasting a dramatic half-year gain of almost 296%. The surge over six months indicates a strong recovery from low levels, though recent activity has been volatile and marked by short-term losses. The figures reveal a coin that bounced back significantly over the long term while experiencing a clear pullback in the immediate period. Current trading ranges from $1.60 to $2.88 with key support at $1.06 and resistance near $3.61. Negative momentum indicators, including an Awesome Oscillator of -0.39 and Momentum of -0.57, combined with an RSI of 34.22, point to short-term bearish control. No clear trend emerges, suggesting cautious trading near these levels with focus on potential rebounds from support or retests of resistance. Ethereum Behavior: 28.56% Drop Over the Last Month, Bearish Trends Persist Ethereum price tumbled by about 28.56% over the last month while showing an 8.41% drop in the half-year span. The data reflects a period marked by bearish sentiment, with technical oscillators indicating ongoing decline and volatility. These past moves highlight the market's sensitivity to downside pressure and investor caution as the coin attempted to stabilize amid fluctuating momentum. Currently, Ethereum trades within a range of $1766 to $3021, with nearby support at $1294.59 and resistance at $3803.80. Bears dominate as clear downward pressure persists without a strong trend emerging. Traders might focus on short-term opportunities by monitoring price movements around these levels and positioning for potential breakouts or reversals. Conclusion XRP and ETH both have strong potential for growth. XRP is known for its speedy transactions and low costs. ETH, on the other hand, is praised for its wide range of applications and solid network. Both coins have unique strengths that make them appealing. Judging which one is the most undervalued is challenging. It depends on what one values more: transaction speed or wider usage. Both have room to grow and could be seen as good opportunities.

Amid the hype, there are a few projects that stand out. Whether it’s the unique technology behind Qubetics or the scalability promises of Arbitrum (ARB), there’s something for everyone. But here’s the real kicker: What makes the best crypto to buy right now? That’s the million-dollar question, and it is diving in to explore it! In recent months, the hype around blockchain technology has reached new heights. It’s not just about price swings or hype cycles anymore; people are genuinely starting to care about utility, innovation, and the potential to solve real-world problems. And that’s where coins like Qubetics, Celestia, and Arbitrum come into play. With each offering something unique, you’ll want to know how they stack up against each other and which one fits your future strategy best.

Its ongoing presale and strong momentum show just how eager the market is for something different.

Qubetics: A Game Changer for Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics ($TICS) is a name you’ll hear a lot about in the coming years. Why?

Celestia: The Layer-1 Revolution Celestia might not be as well-known as some other crypto projects, but it’s certainly making waves with its innovative approach to scalability and blockchain infrastructure. Celestia isn’t just another layer-1 blockchain; it introduces a modular architecture that separates consensus and execution layers, enabling greater flexibility and scalability.

By offering a way for projects to have their own customizable chains while still benefiting from Celestia’s security and infrastructure, it lowers the barrier to entry for creating new decentralized projects. Arbitrum (ARB): Scaling Ethereum with Optimism Arbitrum has emerged as one of the most talked-about Layer-2 solutions for Ethereum, and for good reason. The project aims to scale Ethereum by providing a platform that handles transactions faster and cheaper than the Ethereum mainnet. Using a technology known as Optimistic Rollups, Arbitrum ensures that Ethereum’s security is maintained while transactions can be processed off-chain, easing congestion and reducing fees. In terms of the best crypto to buy right now, Arbitrum holds strong potential due to its role in Ethereum’s scalability. As Ethereum continues to be one of the most widely used blockchains, Arbitrum provides a way to ease the network’s burdens while maintaining Ethereum’s robust security. This makes it an attractive option for anyone looking to buy crypto that has a real utility and potential for widespread adoption. The Future of Cross-Border Transactions: How Qubetics is Leading the Way Cross-border transactions have long been one of the most frustrating aspects of global finance. Traditional methods are slow, expensive, and prone to delays. However, blockchain technology has offered solutions, with Qubetics taking this to the next level.

Conclusion: The Best Crypto to Buy Right Now The landscape of crypto is full of opportunities, but finding the best crypto to buy right now requires careful consideration.

With bullish momentum set to build following this market crash, these established assets are expected to reach new all-time highs as the 2025 bull run unfolds. Meanwhile, Rollblock is reshaping blockchain gaming, integrating play-to-earn mechanics with traditional casino games to create a next-generation iGaming experience. As the sector gains traction, RBLK has the potential to surge in value, following the path of successful gaming tokens from previous market cycles. The Next Gaming Giant Is Here With Rollblock Rollblock is reshaping the iGaming landscape with an innovative play-to-earn model, heavily prioritizing security and community-driven growth. With a thriving user base of over 50,000 and over $10.7M raised in the presale, Rollblock is quickly becoming a dominant force in blockchain gaming. Boasting a massive gaming library of over 7,000 titles, Rollblock delivers a gaming experience that appeals to both traditionalists and blockchain gaming pioneers. The integration of sports betting has further enhanced the platform’s market appeal, attracting a wider audience seeking an all-encompassing blockchain entertainment experience. Rollblock prioritizes security with cutting-edge encryption and AI-powered fraud detection, ensuring a safe and fair gaming environment. Certified by SolidProof and holding an Anjouan Gaming license, the platform meets stringent regulatory standards, reinforcing trust in an industry often fraught with security risks. Designed for long-term sustainability, Rollblock’s tokenomics model dedicates 30% of revenue to RBLK buybacks, burning 60% to reduce supply while distributing 40% as staking rewards. This strategic approach enhances token value and promotes a thriving ecosystem, solidifying Rollblock’s place as a leader in the blockchain gaming revolution. Bearish Price Prediction Hits Solana In Late February Solana has faced sharp declines, dropping nearly 20% in 24 hours to $137.77 on February 24, fueled by concerns over the upcoming FTX unlock of 11.2 million Solana and broader market weakness. Meanwhile, Solana’s network activity has plummeted, with daily active addresses falling from 5.7 million to 3.5 million and application revenue sinking from $58.4 million to $4.5 million. Reputational damage has also hit Solana following the Libra meme coin collapse and the Bybit hack, which saw $1.4 billion laundered through Solana-based memecoins. However, VanEck remains bullish, projecting a potential price target of $520 by year-end if institutional adoption accelerates, making Solana a volatile but promising asset to watch. Price Prediction For XRP Bullish Overall As The Top Performing Altcoin Overall Institutional demand for XRP is rising, with regulatory momentum bringing it closer to mainstream adoption. In addition, the SEC’s review of Bitwise’s spot XRP ETF and Brazil’s approval of its first spot XRP ETF have reinforced legitimacy. Unlike Bitcoin and other altcoins that hit new lows, XRP outperformed 92% of the top 100 cryptos , holding stronger support during the market downturn. Despite this resilience, whale activity has introduced volatility, with 370 million XRP, worth $800 million , dumped in just four days, triggering a 27% drop from $2.67 to $2.06. However, XRP has rebounded 8% to $2.18, cutting weekly losses. Analysts believe an approved US ETF could drive billions in inflows to XRP , setting the stage for further gains if investor confidence remains intact. Meme Coin Woes In 2025 Impact Dogecoin’s Price Prediction Dogecoin has erased most of its post-election gains, plunging 59% from its December high of $0.48 to around $0.21. The meme coin sector remains weak, with Dogecoin losing 15.8% in the past week, ranking among the biggest underperformers alongside Solana . Despite the downturn, Dogecoin remains the leading meme coin, driven by speculation about its integration into Elon Musk’s blockchain-based payment systems. Moreover, institutional interest is growing, with Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF filing raising hopes of major capital inflows. If Dogecoin reclaims $0.24 , a rebound could follow, but slipping below $0.20 may lead to further downside. Don’t Miss Out On Rollblock’s Bullish Potential! Currently priced at $0.06 in its tenth presale phase, RBLK presents a rare opportunity in the rapidly expanding blockchain gaming market.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending protocol, is quickly gaining recognition for its structured financial model and utility-driven demand. Currently in its presale phase at just $0.015 per token, the project has already raised over $1.8 million, positioning itself as a serious competitor in the DeFi space. With analysts predicting a 39x surge post-launch, many investors are eyeing MUTM as a promising alternative to traditional blockchain networks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is not just a token—it is a decentralized lending, borrowing, and passive income-generating protocol. Unlike speculative tokens with very little use in the physical world, Mutuum delivers an official financial system that has numerous ways for users to earn and engage in the network. The platform is designed to work efficiently without go-betweens so that users can submit assets and earn yield or borrow collateral without selling their positions. One of the key draws of Mutuum Finance is that it runs a dual lending model, which consists of peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. The P2C mechanism allows users to lock assets into liquidity pools where they receive interest in terms of their utilization rates proportionally. The P2P model does have one-on-one negotiation between borrowers and lenders, though, allowing access to a greater range of assets, including popular memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). More user flexibility for planning finances while offering high liquidity within the system. The MUTM presale is moving very quickly, already on its second phase at $0.015 per token, and more than 40% of the presale is done. With 11 total presale phases, the price will gradually increase, culminating in a launch price of $0.06. This alone offers early investors a 400% return before the token even hits exchanges. However, many analysts believe the real potential for MUTM will be unlocked post-launch, predicting a 39x price surge as adoption increases. This projection is based on multiple factors, including the rising demand for DeFi lending solutions, Mutuum’s passive income potential, and its unique buy-and-distribute mechanism. A major factor contributing to MUTM’s long-term value is its buy-and-distribute mechanism. Instead of relying purely on speculation, the platform reinvests a portion of its revenue to buy back MUTM tokens, which are then distributed to mtToken holders as rewards. This system ensures constant buy pressure, reinforcing the token’s value while rewarding long-term participants. By increasing token demand and reducing sell pressure, this approach provides sustainable price growth for MUTM. Security is a top priority for Mutuum Finance, and the smart contract is set to be audited by a well-known cybersecurity firm to ensure reliability and protection against vulnerabilities. This audit will provide additional confidence for investors and future platform users. Additionally, the team is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be pegged to the US dollar and minted on the Ethereum blockchain. The stablecoin will be a core part of the lending ecosystem, offering users a secure way of accessing liquidity without needing to sell their assets. The release of this stablecoin will further increase demand for MUTM, making it a key piece of the project’s long-term success. Mutuum Finance has quickly become one of the most interesting projects in DeFi, combining structured lending, real-world utility, and long-term growth potential. The rapidly advancing presale, strong financial model, and demand-driven tokenomics set it apart from other emerging projects. With the upcoming beta launch of its platform aligning with the token’s exchange debut, demand is expected to rise significantly, reinforcing MUTM’s 39x growth projection. For investors looking for a DeFi project with strong fundamentals, sustainable demand, and real earning potential, Mutuum Finance stands out as a top contender for 2025 and beyond.

33767162,[object Object],1740850229,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Turns Negative – Spot Selling, ETF Outflows Weigh On Price Action",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-coinbase-premium-turns-negative-spot-selling-etf-outflows-weigh-on-price-action/,"Bitcoin is trading below the $85K mark as the entire market struggles to hold above key demand levels. The recent sell-off has triggered panic selling and increased speculation about the future of BTC, with many investors fearing that a prolonged bear market could be on the horizon. The rapid price drop has shaken confidence, and sentiment remains deeply bearish across the crypto industry. Key data from Coinglass reveals that BTC’s Coinbase Premium has retreated into the negative territory recently. This indicates a surge in spot selling over the past few days, which aligns with the large ETF outflows and overall bearish price action. Historically, a negative Coinbase Premium suggests that U.S. investors are offloading BTC at a discount compared to other global exchanges, reinforcing the growing fear in the market. For Bitcoin to recover, the premium must turn positive again, signaling renewed spot demand. Until then, the market remains fragile, with analysts closely watching whether BTC can reclaim key resistance levels or if further downside is imminent. The coming days will be crucial in determining Bitcoin’s next move as investors await signs of stability amid growing uncertainty. Bitcoin Continues To Struggle Bitcoin is trading around $85K as the broader crypto market, particularly altcoins and meme coins, continues to face extreme selling pressure. BTC has lost critical weekly support around the $90K level, and volatility remains a key factor in short-term price action. Bulls must defend current demand zones to prevent further declines and initiate a potential recovery phase. Crypto analyst Daan shared Coinglass data on X , revealing that BTC’s Coinbase Premium has gone into the negative zone recently. This suggests that a significant amount of spot selling has occurred over the past few days, aligning with large ETF outflows and a prevailing bearish sentiment. Historically, when the Coinbase Premium turns negative, it indicates that US-based traders are offloading BTC at a discount compared to other exchanges, reflecting a lack of confidence in short-term price action. For Bitcoin to bounce back strongly, the Coinbase Premium must return to positive territory, signaling renewed spot demand. Currently, the premium is attempting to recover following the recent bounce, suggesting that some buying pressure is returning. However, Daan cautions that he will be monitoring this trend closely to determine whether it sustains over the coming days. The next key resistance levels lie around $88K–$90K, and a push above these levels could confirm a bullish recovery. However, if selling pressure persists and BTC fails to reclaim lost ground, the price may continue consolidating or even drop further. The coming days will be crucial in defining Bitcoin’s next move as the market navigates ongoing volatility and uncertainty. BTC Price Action Bitcoin is trading at $84,900, sitting below the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) but still holding above the 200-day moving average (MA). The price has dropped 18% since Monday, marking one of the most significant corrections of the year. Bulls are struggling to reclaim key demand levels, and market sentiment remains cautious as investors monitor price action for signs of a recovery. If BTC holds above the $85K level in the coming days, bulls could attempt to push the price toward $88K, a short-term resistance level that needs to be reclaimed for a potential recovery rally. However, the lack of strong demand at current levels is a concern, as bearish momentum has dominated the market in recent sessions. On the downside, a break below $85K would indicate further weakness and could lead to a deeper correction into lower demand levels. Key support areas to watch in case of a breakdown include $82K and $80K, where buyers may look to step in. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether BTC can stabilize and initiate a rebound or if further downside movement is on the horizon.

Thanks to its fast transactions, low fees and strong DeFi ecosystem, it has grown to become one of the biggest success stories in crypto. However, due to the ongoing correction in the crypto market, it has broken significant support levels at $183.18 and $153.13 on the Pivot Point Indicator (Fibonacci), diving even further below. Sadly, this decline has cast doubt on SOL’s short-term performance, shaking investors’ confidence. Although Solana crypto has delivered strong returns in the past, many traders and investors are now looking for new explosive opportunities with bigger upside potential as they prepare for the next bull run. One name keeps popping up as the best alternative - Panshibi (SHIBI) , the viral meme tokens tipped for 100x gains as seen on Finbold . But why is Solana’s momentum decelerating while SHIBI’s is accelerating? Is SHIBI really the best meme coin to buy right now? If yes, how high can SHIBI go once it is listed on major exchanges? With Solana crypto experiencing increased volatility, we must explore why investors are switching to SHIBI before its presale sells out. SOL’s Struggles: What’s Causing the Price Drop? Without a shadow of a doubt, Solana has been a top performer in the past, but recent price movements suggest that traders are tilting toward the cautious side. According to Forbes , below are possible fundamental reasons for SOL’s price making new lows: ● Market-wide risk-off sentiment: With Bitcoin facing price resistance, many altcoins, including Solana, are seeing profit-taking.● Increased competition from other blockchains: Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) have been gaining ground, challenging Solana’s dominance.● Liquidity moving into meme coins: As investors chase faster gains, many shift capital from established altcoins into high-potential meme projects like SHIBI. With Solana crypto struggling to hold key price levels, SHIBI is capturing investor attention as the better opportunity. Panshibi (SHIBI): The Viral Meme Coin Outshining Solana Unlike Solana, which is facing increasing sell pressure, Panshibi (SHIBI) is experiencing record-breaking presale demand. Taking a glance at SHIBI’s tokenomics, one can quickly tell why SHIBI is becoming the top meme coin to buy: Feature SOL SHIBI Market Cap $40B+ Still in Early Presale Token Supply Millions Limited + Burn Mechanism Price Growth Potential 50-100% (Short-Term) 100x (Presale to Exchange Listing) Utility Smart Contracts, DeFi Meme Coin Hype + DeFi Utility Staking Rewards Low Up to 1,200% APY Liquidity Lock None 10 Years Locked Presale Status N/A Still Available ($0.005 per token) ● Early-stage growth translates to higher profit potential: Solana is already a top-10crypto, limiting its potential for 100x growth. SHIBI is still in presale, offering early investors a massive opportunity before its exchange launch.● Scarcity-driven price model: Unlike SOL, which has millions of tokens circulating, SHIBI features a burn mechanism, ensuring a steady supply reduction and long-term price appreciation.● High-yield staking rewards: SOL’s staking rewards are relatively low, while SHIBI holders can stake their tokens and earn up to 1,200% APY.● 10-year liquidity lock for security: Unlike Solana, which has experienced network slowdowns and liquidity risks, SHIBI is fully secured with a 10-year liquidity lock and team token lock. With the price of Solana Crypto struggling, SHIBI is becoming the go-to pick for smarter investors who want to capitalize on the 100% tipped high-upside movement to recoup their losses from the current downtrend. How to Buy SHIBI Before the Presale Ends With more than $1,180,000 raised in funding, no smart investor wants to miss out. Here’s how to join early investors who are securing their positions before SHIBI lists on major exchanges: ● Visit the Panshibi official website.● Connect your preferred wallet – ensure you have a compatible wallet, such asMetaMask or Trust Wallet.● Secure your SHIBI tokens before the price rises.

LUNC: Terra Classic’s Journey to Stable Global Payments Terra is a blockchain platform aiming to make global payments fast and affordable. It uses stablecoins, digital currencies tied to traditional money like the U.S. dollar or South Korean won. This means their value stays steady, making them useful for everyday transactions. By blending the stability of regular money with the benefits of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Terra offers quick and secure payments without the usual price swings. In May 2022, Terra launched a new chain, and the original became Terra Classic. Its main token was renamed LUNA Classic (LUNC). This shift is similar to the split of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic in 2017. The change followed significant challenges with Terra’s stablecoin earlier that year. Now, LUNC continues to support stablecoins linked to various currencies, focusing on stable and efficient global transactions. In a market where many cryptocurrencies face high volatility, LUNC’s approach to combining fiat stability with blockchain technology offers a unique path. As the crypto landscape evolves, projects like LUNC highlight the potential for digital currencies to become a regular part of everyday finance. XLM Shines Bright: Stellar’s Role in Today’s Crypto Market Stellar Lumens (XLM) is a digital coin that’s changing the way people send money around the world. Since 2014, Stellar has helped move billions of dollars quickly and cheaply. It doesn’t favor any one country’s money. Instead, it lets people send any kind of money, whether it’s dollars, euros, or even other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Big companies have partnered with Stellar because it helps them make fast, low-cost payments. People can use Stellar apps to send money globally, and businesses can build their own apps on the network. Stellar stands out because it wants to work with existing financial systems, not replace them. This makes it different from many other cryptocurrencies. The Stellar Development Foundation supports the network, helping it grow and add new features like smart contracts and NFTs. In the current market, where some cryptocurrencies are struggling, Stellar’s focus on real-world applications makes it attractive. It’s building bridges between different kinds of money, which could be a big advantage. Compared to other coins that are just digital assets, Stellar offers practical tools for people and businesses. This could help it shine brighter in the crypto world. Kaspa: The Lightning-Fast Cryptocurrency Aiming to Change the Game Kaspa is a new cryptocurrency that’s turning heads. It’s built on proof-of-work, like Bitcoin, but with a clever twist. Instead of following a single chain of blocks, Kaspa lets multiple blocks exist together. This means it doesn’t waste any blocks created at the same time. As a result, Kaspa can produce blocks very quickly—currently one every second. The goal is to reach 10 blocks per second, and the dream is 100. This speed could make transactions much faster and smoother for users. Kaspa’s technology has the potential to shake up the crypto world. Its ability to handle many blocks at once without slowing down is impressive. It also includes features that make future improvements easier, such as support for additional layers on top of the main network. In a market where speed and efficiency matter, Kaspa stands out. Compared to other coins, its focus on rapid block production and quick confirmations could make it attractive to investors. With trends favoring scalable and efficient cryptocurrencies, Kaspa might be one to watch in the current market cycle. TRON (TRX): Empowering Creators in the Decentralized Internet TRON is a blockchain platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. It aims to give content creators full control over their work. Instead of relying on big companies like YouTube or Facebook, creators can connect directly with their audience. This means they earn more rewards without sharing profits with middlemen. TRX, the digital coin of TRON, started on the Ethereum network but moved to its own in 2018. TRON supports smart contracts and apps that run without a central authority. Developers can build diverse applications on it. Users can share content freely without worrying about fees. Compared to Ethereum, TRON offers faster and cheaper transactions. In today’s market, where there’s a push for decentralization, TRX stands out. Its focus on helping creators sets it apart from other coins. As people look for direct connections online, TRON could play a key role in the internet’s future. Conclusion While LUNC, XLM, KAS, and TRX show strong potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) offers even greater promise with its sports-meme platform aiming for massive growth.

The model ensures that token unlocking is tied to continuous price increases and is regulated by a smart contract with a third-party controlled key. CZ outlined the proposed mechanism in a recent statement, describing it as a “crazy idea” for tokenomics. Key features of this model include: Initial Release: 10% of the total token supply is unlocked at launch and the proceeds are allocated to project development, marketing, salaries and platform growth. Subsequent Unlock Conditions: Tokens can only be unlocked if they meet the following criteria: A six-month gap between unlocks. The token price must have maintained at least 2x the previous unlock price for more than 30 consecutive days before a new unlock. A maximum of 5% of the token supply can be unlocked at a time. For example, if a token’s initial price is $1 in January, no additional tokens can be unlocked unless the price exceeds $2 for 30 days. If this happens by August, 5% more tokens could be released into circulation. The next possible unlock date would be in March of the following year, assuming the token price doubles again to $6. Related News: Cryptocurrency Announcement from the White House: On This Date, Donald Trump and His Administration Will Meet For Cryptocurrencies CZ emphasized that project teams will have the discretion to delay or reduce the unlocking, but will not be able to accelerate or increase them beyond the specified limits. The tokens will remain locked via a smart contract, and control of the keys will be entrusted to a neutral third party. Despite introducing the concept, CZ clarified that he has no plans to launch a new token under this model. Instead, he shared the idea to spark discussion within the cryptocurrency community. *This is not investment advice.

After hitting an ATH of $0.00008845 in Oct 2021, the coin has since stabilized its price. With its vibrant community and growing ecosystem, the question now is: where will Shiba Inu’s price go from here? Price predictions for SHIB between 2025 and 2030 suggest a broad range, from modest gains to more ambitious projections. Shiba Inu Price Projections for 2025-2027 By 2025, the Shiba Inu price prediction could rise to between $0.0001 and $0.0003. This prediction assumes the coin sees increased adoption, especially within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, including Shibaswap and Shibarium. The continued token burn efforts would further reduce supply, potentially pushing SHIB’s price up. If the broader cryptocurrency market enters a bull cycle, it could provide an additional boost to SHIB’s value. In 2026, SHIB could reach a price range of $0.0005 to $0.001. With more widespread use in DeFi, NFTs, and other sectors, Shiba Inu would likely become more integrated into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The growing interest of institutions in meme coins would boost demand and elevate the value of SHIB. The expansion of the SHIB ecosystem will impact its price through increased widespread usage. By 2027, Shiba Inu might reach a price range of $0.001 to $0.005. As the cryptocurrency market matures, SHIB could benefit from a broader market adoption and integration into mainstream finance. Continued token burns would decrease the circulating supply, helping drive prices higher. Demand from retail and institutional investors would likely continue to support SHIB’s price growth. In 2028, Shiba Inu could reach a price between $0.005 and $0.01. If SHIB successfully grows its ecosystem and user base, it could establish itself as a top 10 cryptocurrency. Greater use cases in finance, gaming, and even as a medium of exchange could drive SHIB’s price upward. A potential “flipping” of Dogecoin (DOGE) might further boost SHIB’s market position and value. By 2030, an optimistic scenario could see SHIB’s price between $0.05 and $0.10. This would require significant adoption, especially from institutional investors, and an ongoing reduction in supply through token burns. SHIB would also need to compete with established cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap and real-world use cases to achieve this level of price growth. Shiba Inu Price Analysis The Shiba Inu price is hovering around $0.00001355, which represents a 0.22% decrease in the last hours. The price has recently fluctuated between a range of $0.00001351 and $0.00001365. The broader crypto market is also struggling to recover markets trades in sideways. Currently, the RSI at 40 is nearing an oversold condition, potentially signaling a buying opportunity if it approaches 30. The MACD is showing a neutral stance with a minimal crossover between the blue and orange lines, indicating no clear momentum. The first significant support level is at $0.00001300, followed by $0.00001200. A recovery might push the price to the first resistance at $0.00001405. If this is breached, further resistance could be seen at $0.00001500 and $0.00001600. Shiba Inu Price Chart: Tradingview In conclusion, while predicting the exact future of Shiba Inu price is uncertain, the potential for growth remains. Investors should keep an eye on market trends, adoption, and regulatory changes as SHIB’s price may rise depending on how these factors unfold.

41015632,https://nulltx.com/?p=146179,1740850928,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"XYZVerse Price Potential: Examining the 99,900% Gain Claim",https://nulltx.com/xyzverse-price-potential-examining-the-99900-gain-claim/,"The cryptocurrency space is no stranger to bold promises and jaw-dropping price predictions. XYZVerse, a rapidly growing meme coin project, has captured the attention of investors with its ambitious goal of a 99,900% increase by the time of its listing. Such a meteoric rise might seem improbable, but is it entirely out of reach? Let’s break down the numbers, analyze XYZVerse’s tokenomics, and assess whether the project’s roadmap can support this aggressive growth target. The 99,900% Gain—A Feasible Goal or a Pipe Dream? A 99,900% increase means that XYZVerse’s token price must multiply 1,000 times from its lowest presale price. The earliest investors had the opportunity to acquire $XYZ at $0.0001 , and it is intended to reach $0.10 upon listing, as outlined in its presale plan . Currently in stage 11, the token costs $0.0025, and the price is set to increase to $0.003333 at the next stage. Given that the project has already raised nearly $9 million in presale , with demand remaining strong and no signs of early sell pressure, such a surge is within the realm of possibility— if key factors align in XYZVerse’s favor : Massive Hype and FOMO : Meme coins thrive on viral marketing, and XYZVerse’s strong community backing could drive aggressive post-listing demand. Exchange Listings : The roadmap hints at major CEX and DEX listings soon after launch. If XYZVerse secures top-tier exchange support, the increased liquidity and exposure could accelerate price appreciation. Deflationary Mechanics : With 17.13% of the supply set to be burned , token scarcity could play a significant role in supporting value over time. No Pre-Listing Sell-Offs : A common issue with presale projects is early investors dumping their holdings at listing. However, if the current buying momentum continues, XYZVerse might avoid this risk. While these factors provide strong bullish signals, achieving a 999x return pre-listing is still an enormous challenge . Most meme coins that experience such exponential growth (e.g., SHIB, PEPE) took months—sometimes years—to reach those valuations. The real test for XYZVerse will be sustaining demand beyond the listing hype. Learn more about XYZ presale Smart Tokenomics Built for Sustainability XYZVerse has structured its tokenomics with long-term sustainability in mind. Its design balances scarcity, liquidity, and incentives for community participation. Initial Total Supply : 100 billion tokens Liquidity Reserve : 15% allocated for liquidity, ensuring stability and smooth trading operations Deflationary Burns : 17% of the total supply is reserved for regular burns which would gradually decrease the circulating supply The combination of a fixed supply, consistent burns, and liquidity reserve allocation suggests an effort to create scarcity and price stability. Following the completion of each presale stage, the team reduces the supply by 1 billion tokens as reflected in the Polygonscan metrics. This measure could support price growth if demand remains high. However, the effectiveness of these measures depends on whether market interest sustains beyond the initial hype. If trading volume decreases post-listing, deflationary mechanisms alone may not be sufficient to prevent price corrections. Ambitious Roadmap with Clear Milestones XYZVerse’s roadmap outlines structured growth phases, emphasizing exchange listings, marketing, and partnerships. Following presale completion, the Token Generation Event (TGE) will take place, with $XYZ tokens launching alongside a promotional campaign. The project plans to list on both CEX and DEX platforms to increase accessibility. Community engagement initiatives will focus on fostering an engaged community through events and rewards. The project is also working on securing collaborations with sports organizations and influencers to expand visibility. XYZVerse’s roadmap reflects a structured approach to growth, focusing on user adoption, market expansion, and community engagement. The emphasis on exchange listings is critical, as accessibility and liquidity play a pivotal role in sustaining price action. The integration of sports partnerships presents a unique differentiation strategy, potentially attracting a niche audience. However, successful execution will depend on securing meaningful partnerships rather than speculative announcements. Final Verdict: Will XYZVerse Hit Its 99,900% Goal? XYZVerse has a strong presale performance, well-structured tokenomics, and a roadmap focused on long-term growth . Given the current momentum, a listing price of $0.10 is achievable , which would fulfill the ambitious 99,900% increase goal— at least for early presale buyers who got in at $0.0001 . However, whether XYZVerse sustains or surpasses this valuation post-listing depends on its liquidity depth, continued investor demand, and effective execution of token burns and partnerships. For those considering XYZVerse, the project presents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity . If the hype holds strong , this could be one of the biggest meme coin launches of the year. However, as with any speculative crypto investment, due diligence is key .

Rollblock’s Web3 gaming platform is experiencing massive adoption right now, with its generous staking rewards and deflationary revenue-sharing model positioning it for up to 50x gains in 2025. Meanwhile, Chainlink continues to provide critical infrastructure for DeFi projects but faces growing competition. Here’s why Rollblock could be the best-performing token this year. Rollblock (RBLK): Soaring Growth And Generous Staking Rewards Attract Investors Rollblock’s ( RBLK ) Web3 gaming platform has witnessed rapid expansion in recent weeks, with month-on-month growth in new signups, total deposits, and wagered bids. This promising GameFi project has already raised $10.7 million in presale inflows, showing massive investor confidence in its unique model. The platform features over 7,000 classic games, including poker and blackjack, alongside an innovative sports prediction league that has proven immensely popular with Rollblock’s close-knit community. All bids and payouts are secured on the Ethereum blockchain, bringing unprecedented transparency to this $500 billion industry. Gamers can now verify without having to trust a centralized platform to do the right thing and honor their bids faithfully. The recent integration of fiat deposits via Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard lowers the barrier to entry and will only accelerate Rollblock’s mainstream adoption. What sets the RBLK token apart is its deflationary revenue-sharing scheme, which creates a controlled scarcity of supply. The platform allocates 30% of its revenue each week to buying back RBLK tokens on the open market, with 60% of these buybacks burned to reduce the number of coins in circulation and 40% used to fund staking rewards of up to 30% APY for holders. With generous staking rewards, investors can earn attractive passive income while benefiting from long-term price appreciation. Currently, RBLK is in stage 10 of its presale and priced at just $0.06, with major exchange listings on the horizon. Prices are set to increase soon, making now the perfect time to invest. A limited-time 50% bonus is available on all RBLK purchases this week. With such strong fundamentals and a comparatively tiny presale valuation, Rollblock takes some beating as an investment at this time. Chainlink (LINK): Further Downside Likely - Time To Short? Chainlink has long been a cornerstone of the entire crypto ecosystem, providing reliable oracles for DeFi applications across many blockchains for years now. However as new competitors emerge, Chainlink has struggled to maintain its dominance. Chainlink’s recent developments include the expansion of its CCIP (Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol), which enables instant data transfers across multiple chains. Chainlink is currently trading at $ 14.63, having lost 18% in the last seven days of trading. LINK saw a surge to $25.71 earlier this month before retracing due to the current market wide consolidation. Trader Rai advises taking a short position on Chainlink right now , stating that ‘If price fails to reclaim $15.50, further downside is likely.’ While Chainlink remains a crucial player in the space, its upside potential may be limited compared to high-growth opportunities like Rollblock. Rollblock (RBLK) Remains Hands Down The Best Crypto To Buy Now While Chainlink continues to develop its oracle technology, Rollblock’s explosive growth, generous staking rewards, and deflationary mechanics make it the standout investment of 2025. With RBLK still at just $0.06 and a 50% bonus offer live this week, now is the best time to buy before major exchange listings light the touchpaper on an explosive rally that will stun the gaming market.

In a recent post on X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author dismissed ETFs as a tool of financial elites, claiming they serve the interests of big institutions rather than individual investors. Robert Kiyosaki Rejects Bitcoin ETFs Kiyosaki, a longtime critic of Wall Street and traditional banking systems, expressed his concerns about Bitcoin ETFs, stating that they place control of the digital asset in the hands of financial institutions. According to him, this contradicts the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Is BITCOIN a SCAM? It might be…. But not a big a scam as the US Dollar and the US Banking System…. Starting with the Fed. They are BANKSTERS. For example…. When they F. U. and lose billions…. The criminals at the Fed bail them out. They should go to jail. That’s… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) March 1, 2025 “Please protect yourself from the banksters,” he said, “Buy real gold, silver, and Bitcoin. No gold, silver, or Bitcoin ETFs which are bankster’s money.” His stance reflects a broader skepticism towards financial intermediaries. While Bitcoin was designed to give people direct control over their wealth, Kiyosaki argues that ETFs reintroduce middlemen who profit off investors and manipulate the market. Institutional Control and Market Manipulation Kiyosaki’s latest remarks come as institutional interest in Bitcoin continues to grow. Since the approval of spot BTC ETFs in the U.S., billions of dollars have flowed into these investment products. Proponents argue that ETFs make Bitcoin more accessible to traditional investors , providing a regulated and secure way to gain exposure to the asset. However, Kiyosaki remains unconvinced. He has repeatedly compared Bitcoin ETFs to gold and silver ETFs, which he claims allow financial institutions to manipulate prices and limit the true value of the assets. He believes direct ownership of Bitcoin is the only way to achieve financial security. Bitcoin vs. the Financial System Despite his criticism of BTC ETFs, Kiyosaki remains a strong supporter of Bitcoin. While he acknowledges that cryptocurrency has flaws, he insists they are minor compared to the problems within the traditional financial system. Over the years, he has frequently criticized central banks, the U.S. dollar, and the Federal Reserve, warning of an impending financial collapse. He argues that Bitcoin and physical gold and silver protect against economic instability. His latest comments also come amid speculation about Bitcoin’s price movement. Kiyosaki has previously predicted that the cryptocurrency could reach between $175,000 and $350,000 in 2025. While some view his projections as overly optimistic, he maintains that Bitcoin remains a key asset for those seeking financial independence.

After meeting with Republican lawmakers in Washington, D.C. on the subject of “debanking,” Dimon told reporters that Chase never drops customers over their religious or political affiliations. Instead, Dimon said unclear federal guidelines, especially around anti-money laundering rules, force banks to deny services out of compliance fears, reports Yahoo Finance. When squarely asked if regulators are to blame for debanking, Dimon responded, “Pretty much, yeah.” “There are a lot of things that should be fixed. [Anit-Money laundering laws] are extraordinary, and it does cause a lot of people to be pushed out of the system because banks were afraid of being sued, fined, because if, after the fact, something goes wrong — coulda, woulda, shoulda — you could pay a billion dollars.” Dimon’s remarks come after President Trump hammered Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase during a virtual World Economic Forum session, accusing them of wrongly denying conservatives access to bank accounts. Republican lawmakers are now pushing for legislation that would clearly explain when banks can and cannot reject services for customers. The list of bankers included in the closed-door meeting in Washington included Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf, Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank and CEOs from several other large US financial institutions.

The 100/1 Wild Card Ripple Crypto Holders Are Backing,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/why-have-xrp-investors-moved-into-panshibi-shibi-the-1001-wild-card-ripple-crypto-holders-are-backing,"XRP investors are making a surprising move, shifting their focus toward Panshibi (SHIBI) , the meme coin tipped for massive gains. With XRP’s price struggling to break key resistance levels, traders are looking for faster gains. Panshibi’s presale, currently at $0.005, has already raised over $1.19 million, with projections of a 100x surge post-launch. As Ripple holders seek fresh opportunities, SHIBI is emerging as the ultimate high-reward wild card for 2025. Institutional Interest in XRP ETF Continues to Grow Rapidly XRP crypto is hovering near its lowest levels , but seasoned investors understand that market consolidations tend to produce powerful price jumps. Historical data shows that XRP has generated substantial price gains when it has bounced back from these price zones. The XRP ETF has gained significant traction in the market, which is a driving force behind bullish market predictions. This ETF will allow financial and retail investors to gain exposure to XRP passively. As more institutional money flows in, XRP’s price could see a significant boost. However, its performance still hinges on Ripple’s continued progress in cross-border payments and regulatory clarity. While the ETF provides a structured entry for traditional investors, it hasn’t yet sparked the rapid gains many traders were hoping for. With XRP crypto moving sideways, many of its holders are looking for alternative opportunities that offer higher short-term growth potential. Experts Predict Massive Gains for Panshibi as XRP Movement Stalls Panshibi (SHIBI) is quickly becoming one of the most sought-after meme coins, capturing the attention of investors looking for high-upside opportunities. While XRP faces resistance and struggles to gain momentum, many of its holders are shifting their focus to SHIBI. The project’s presale is moving at lightning speed, with over $1.19 million raised and three stages already sold out. As XRP investors search for the next major breakout, Panshibi’sstructured growth and viral appeal are proving irresistible. Now in Stage 4, Panshibi is selling at just $0.005, offering a massive early entry advantage before it skyrockets to its listing price of $0.026. Analysts predict that post-launch, SHIBI could deliver an unprecedented 145,000% surge, turning early adopters into major winners. But beyond the price speculation, what makes Panshibi stand out is its mix of community-driven engagement, AI-powered utilities, and rewarding staking mechanisms. Unlike standard meme coins that rely solely on hype, Panshibi has built a strong foundation with real incentives. Holders can stake their SHIBI tokens to earn up to 1,200% APY, unlocking passive income while contributing to the project’s long-term growth. The panda-themed branding, inspired by Asian culture, has already created a strong identity, attracting crypto traders looking for the next major trend. Panshibi Offers Investors a 100x Wild Card Opportunity With XRP experiencing slow movement despite ETF speculation, Ripple holders are hedging their bets with SHIBI . The presale structure ensures that early buyers get the best value, with each stage bringing a price increase before the token officially launches on major exchanges. As a result, the rush to secure Panshibi tokens before the next price jump is intensifying. For those looking to capitalize on the next major meme coin breakout, Panshibi is shaping up to be the ultimate wild card. With time running out in the presale and XRP traders jumping on board, the window for early gains is closing fast.

OFFICIALMAGACOIN vs. Aptos (APT) Aptos, known for its focus on scalability and security, is valued at $6.21, reflecting a 7.25% increase. While Aptos shows promise, OFFICIALMAGACOIN ‘s rapid fundraising success and potential for exponential returns make it a more enticing option for investors seeking significant gains. OFFICIALMAGACOIN vs. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink, a decentralized oracle network, stands at $15.36, experiencing a 2.29% decrease. Although Chainlink plays a crucial role in connecting smart contracts to real-world data, its growth trajectory appears steady.

CZ theorizes a smart contract-controlled unlock for tokens designed to prevent flooding the market with new tokens. Binance Founder Explores New Standards For Tokenomics Under CZ’s proposal , only 10% of tokens will be unlocked for sale with the remaining 90% remaining untouched. The Binance founder says the proceeds for the 10% will be deployed for development costs, marketing, salaries, and community building. A key feature of his “crazy idea” involves strict conditions to be fulfilled before future token unlocks. He argues that issuers must wait for six months after the previous unlock before proceeding with a new unlock. However, the token price must have doubled its previous unlock price for over 30 consecutive days before the next unlock. According to the Binance founder, token issuers will be allowed to unlock a maximum of 5% of the total holdings each time. While the maximum unlock is pegged at 5%, the project team has the right to reduce and delay the unlock sizes. Unlocks have the potential to send token prices crashing, accentuated by the incoming $2 billion SOL unlock and tumbling asset price. “If they don’t want to sell more, they don’t have to,” said CZ. “But the maximum they can sell each time is 5%, and then they have to wait for at least another 6 months AND the price to double again.” Incentivizing Long-Term Builds And Preventing Token Rug Pulls Right off the bat, the upsides to CZ’s proposal are clear as a strict vesting schedule prevents early dumping. Improper tokenomics standards have fuelled a wave of exit scams in the cryptoverse with the Libra token crash leaving a sour taste in the mouth of investors. CZ’s idea involves locking tokens with a smart contract and an independent third party controlling the keys. “This avoids new tokens flooding the market when prices are low,” said the Binance founder. “It also gives the project team incentives to build for the long term.” Zhao has previously expressed his displeasure over sharp practices in the space, pledging support for memecoin victims . CZ clarified that he has no plans to launch a new token and that the theory is open for discussion.

While ETH struggles, a viral Asia-inspired meme coin is taking off, with analysts predicting a massive surge. As this new crypto frenzy spreads, early buyers are rushing in to secure their positions. So what’s so special about this up and comer and why is Ethereum dwindling? Ethereum Crypto on the Brink: Could ETH Drop Below $2,000? Ethereum (ETH) is facing serious downward pressure, crashing 10.6% in the last 24 hours and sinking 32.4% over the past month. Currently trading at $2,119, ETH is dangerously close to the $2,000 psychological threshold - a key support level that, if broken, could trigger massive sell-offs and push prices even lower. Analysts warn that a sustained drop below this mark could send ETH tumbling toward $1,740 , mirroring broader market weakness. Despite the slump, Ethereum crypto is gearing up for major upgrades in 2025, with the Pectraupgrade set to enhance scalability and security. Sharding improvements, quantum-resistant cryptographic measures and data optimization are all in the works. Additionally, VitalikButerin has outlined a plan to strengthen Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling, addressing Ethereum's long-standing congestion issues. While Ethereum crypto remains the dominant smart contract platform, the immediate concern is whether it can hold $2,000. If it doesn’t, we could see another wave of panic selling - but long-term, Ethereum’s upgrades could restore confidence and fuel a comeback. A New Meme Coin Shakes Up The Market The meme coin space has seen its fair share of viral sensations, but Panshibi (SHIBI) is turning heads with a game plan that goes beyond hype. While many projects rely solely on internet buzz, this panda-powered phenomenon brings real investor incentives, a structured presale and a growing ecosystem designed for long-term success. The early momentum suggests that Panshibi could be the next big breakout, combining the best aspects of social-fi, staking rewards and an unwavering commitment to security. Unlike the never-ending presales that leave investors in limbo, Panshibi operates on a clear 60-day timeline, with a structured pricing model that rewards early adopters. With each stage selling out, the token price climbs, building FOMO among those still on the sidelines. As of Stage 4, the price stands at just $0.005, giving investors an opportunity to position themselves before the final stages push valuations higher. But Panshibi isn’t just about fast presale gains - it’s about utility and community engagement. The project integrates social-fi elements, allowing token holders to participate in engaging quests, earn rewards and tap into exclusive benefits like the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. For those looking to maximize their holdings, the staking platform is a major draw, offering high APYs of up to 1,200% per annum. Security remains a top priority for serious investors and Panshibi has already passed a full smart contract audit with flying colors. Blockchain security firm Coinsult conducted the review, ensuring that the project operates on a transparent and tamper-proof foundation. To further cement trust, liquidity will be locked for 10 years and the team’s token allocation is secured for two years. Beyond the financial appeal, Panshibi is also making a real-world impact through its panda conservation initiative. A portion of the project’s earnings will be directed toward global conservation efforts, adding a meaningful layer to an already compelling investment. Panshibi Presale Nears $1.2M Milestone as Hype Builds Investors aren’t hesitating to get in on the action and the numbers prove it. The Panshibi presale is rapidly approaching the $1.2 million mark, fueled by crypto enthusiasts who recognize its potential. Analysts predict that the presale price could surge by 1,200%, with even bigger gains expected once the token goes live on major exchanges. For those looking to secure a spot in one of 2025’s most talked-about crypto projects, now is the time. Panshibi’s structured roadmap, high-yield staking and social-fi ecosystem make it a standout in a crowded meme coin market. With the clock ticking on the presale, securing tokens at this stage could be the difference between watching from the sidelines and riding the next big wave in crypto.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A new altcoin, Remittix, is making waves in the market, with analysts comparing its potential impact to XRP. Some see early PEPE-like momentum. Table of Contents Pepe begins recovery after massive drop Ripple shows resilience Remittix, expected to repeat the 2023 massive surge of PEPE Why Remittix is a top crypto option PEPE took the crypto space by storm in 2023, turning small investments into life-changing fortunes almost overnight. Now, analysts are spotting similar early-stage momentum in a rising altcoin, Remittix (RTX). Unlike meme coins, Remittix is bringing real utility to the blockchain space, aiming to change the market like XRP. With around $13 million raised in presale and thousands of investors already on board, Remittix could be the crypto gem the market is waiting for. Its value is expected to skyrocket by 10x this year, mirroring the viral growth of the PEPE coin. Pepe begins recovery after massive drop Among the top crypto coins, Pepe suffered one of the biggest declines. Over the last 30 days, the Pepe coin price has plunged by more than 40%, leading to a drop to the support level of $0.000007500. The meme coin appears to be moving past its recent breakdown. CoinMarketCap’s data shows that the Pepe price has rebounded at the support level and has now recovered above $0.000008200. According to the analyst known as RoccobullboTTom on X, the price of Pepe could soar above $0.0000500. UNKNOWN TRADER has set a lower Pepe price target, suggesting that the meme coin can rally to $0.00000915 first. PEPE chart shared by UNKNOWN TRADER Ripple shows resilience Ripple’s XRP has shown strong momentum in the past few weeks. The altcoin is still trading around the $2 region despite a massive selloff in the general market. A recent tweet from Ali Martinez revealed that whales sold over 370 million XRP recently. In the past week, CoinMarketCap data shows the XRP price has been trading between $2.13 and $2.74. XRP chart over the last 30 days: TradingView The XRP price has plunged by 13.6% on this level due to the selling pressure. However, analysts believe the approval of Ripple ETF and the end of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit might propel the XRP price to a new peak. BarriC forecasts the XRP price might surge beyond $3 to $5 over the next month. Afterward, the analyst said the XRP price could pump to $10. Based on technical analysis, most technical indicators including the Fear and Greed Index are bearish. However, the Stochastic Fast (14) and Williams Percent Range (14) are flashing a buy signal. Remittix, expected to repeat the 2023 massive surge of PEPE Since the presale started, Remittix (RTX) has attracted a lot of attention and has raised over $12.8 million. The RTX token is currently valued at $0.0671 and has attracted investors because of its low market cap and utility. Its price trajectory is expected to mirror that of PEPE in the coming months. Remittix is changing the way cross-border payments are made by bridging the gap between the DeFi market and conventional banking systems. This unique service allows the exchange of over 100 cryptocurrencies for more than 30 fiat currencies with a direct transfer to any bank account. This is because Remittix offers a direct approach to the transfer of funds, hence making the transactions fast and cheap. The platform is easy to use for customers and has a strong API that allows businesses to integrate the cryptocurrency payment system into their operations. With the current evolution and growth of Remittix and the services that it offers, the project is well-positioned to transform the future of international money transfers. Why Remittix is a top crypto option From history, those who join a project early make the biggest returns as in the case of PEPE. Currently, those who missed out on PEPE have another chance with Remittix. This DeFi project seeks to enrich the cross-border payment sector, which is worth billions of dollars.

With Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) making waves in the market, investors are scrambling to secure their positions. While XRP and BNB are also making headlines, it’s Arctic Pablo’s groundbreaking presale that’s drawing the most attention. This article will cover the developments and updates of Arctic Pablo Coin, XRP, and BNB—breaking down why these are the top crypto to buy today. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale Adventure – Staking, Rewards & Massive ROI Potential The Arctic Pablo Coin presale isn’t just another launch—it’s an entire journey. Currently stationed in Penguinopolis, the 12th location of its thrilling expedition, APC has already completed 11 successful stops in just 45 days. And the numbers speak volumes: Current Price: $0.000067 Total Raised: Over $1.64 Million Launch Price: $0.008 Potential ROI: A staggering 11,844.78% from its current phase to launch! But that’s not all. Investors can take advantage of staking rewards with a 66% APY, ensuring passive income even before APC hits exchanges. On top of that, the project offers exclusive referral incentives and community competitions, making it one of the top crypto to buy today. Arctic Pablo’s Unique Presale Model – Why Penguinopolis is a Game-Changer Unlike typical presales, Arctic Pablo Coin follows a location-based structure. Each phase marks a new stop in its global adventure, and the price increases as it progresses. Now that APC has arrived in Penguinopolis, early investors are locking in their positions before the next phase brings another price hike. One of the most compelling aspects? The token burn mechanism. Every week, unsold tokens are permanently eliminated, driving up scarcity and long-term value. Plus, any remaining tokens after the presale will also be burned, ensuring deflationary pressure that benefits holders in the long run. With over $1.64 million already raised, Arctic Pablo Coin is quickly becoming a must-have in the crypto space. But with each new location bringing a higher price, securing APC at $0.000067 is an opportunity that won’t last long. If you’re looking for the top crypto to buy today, Arctic Pablo Coin’s meme coin presale should be on your radar. XRP’s Latest Surge – What’s Behind the Bullish Momentum? XRP is turning heads again after a significant price rebound. With ongoing legal battles nearing resolution, investor confidence is surging. Ripple’s recent partnerships with major financial institutions are also fueling optimism, leading to increased adoption and trading volume. Analysts predict that if this momentum continues, XRP could see a breakout rally, making it a coin to watch in the coming months. BNB’s Strategic Moves – How Binance’s Token is Holding Strong BNB remains a powerhouse in the crypto market, thanks to Binance’s continuous ecosystem expansion. The exchange recently announced new trading pairs, staking options, and lower transaction fees, reinforcing BNB’s utility. With increased institutional interest and Binance’s strategic developments, BNB is proving why it remains a dominant force in the crypto industry. Final Thoughts – Arctic Pablo Coin Leading the Charge While XRP and BNB are making significant moves, it’s Arctic Pablo Coin ’s presale that’s stealing the spotlight. With a unique presale structure, massive staking rewards, referral incentives, and an aggressive token burn mechanism, APC is positioning itself as the ultimate top crypto to buy today. With prices set to rise as Arctic Pablo continues its journey, now is the time to jump in before it leaves Penguinopolis behind. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to grab APC at just $0.000067 before the price surges further! For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Arctic Pablo Coin (APC)? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is a new meme coin with a unique presale model, offering staking rewards, referral incentives, and a strong token burn mechanism to boost scarcity and value. How does the Arctic Pablo presale work? The presale follows a location-based structure, where each phase represents a new stop on its journey. Prices increase with each new location, making early investment highly attractive. What is the potential ROI for Arctic Pablo Coin investors? At its current price of $0.000067, investors could see an ROI of over 11,844.78% if APC reaches its launch price of $0.008. What makes Arctic Pablo Coin different from other meme coins? Unlike typical meme coins, APC offers real incentives such as staking rewards, referral bonuses, and an aggressive deflationary model through its token burn mechanism.

Panic? Maybe for some. But for those who know how these cycles work, this isn’t the end - it’s the setup. And right now, whispers are turning into full-blown chatter about Panshibi , the underdog meme coin that might just flip the script. As analysts reassess market movements and shifts, one sentiment is clear - early adopters win big. With Panshibi’s presale accelerating and major investors shifting focus, this could be the next breakout sensation LINK Crypto’s Slippery Slope: Can This “Breakthrough” Stop Its Market Bleed? Chainlink’s latest CCIP v1.5 upgrade was supposed to be a game-changer, introducing cross-chain token standards and streamlined onboarding. But despite the hype, LINK crypto hasn’t been able to shake off its downward momentum. Even after a brief surge to $15.72, it quickly slipped back to $14.27 , reflecting broader uncertainty in the market. Investors are starting to question whether LINK’s so-called “breakthrough” is enough to stop its decline. While some still see potential, many are shifting focus toward early-stage projects with higher upside potential - like Panshibi (SHIBI), which is rapidly gaining traction as the next big meme coin breakout. Ethereum’s Next Big Move? Or Just More of the Same Old Story? Ethereum’s price swings have been a headache for investors, with whales controlling the action through aggressive buy-and-sell cycles. While some see a buying opportunity, others are dumping their holdings, unsure of ETH’s next move. The uncertainty isn’t helping Ethereum’s case, as market confidence wavers. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s Pectra upgrades promise better transaction speeds, but skeptics argue they're just another technical tweak that won’t fix its deep-rooted scalability issues. Even LINK crypto investors are looking elsewhere - if Ethereum can’t stabilize, the market may start favoring newer, more efficient alternatives. Solana’s ETF Hype Hits a Wall - Is the Party Over? For all the noise around Solana’s futures ETFs making it to the DTCC, the market’s reaction has been underwhelming. Instead of a breakout, SOL has slumped 19.8% over the last 7 days, dropping to $144.7. Even talk of an 80% inflation cut hasn’t been enough to spark real momentum. Investors are starting to question whether Solana’s glory days are behind it. With LINK crypto also losing steam, traders are hunting for fresh opportunities. And guess what? Many are turning to Panshibi (SHIBI), a wildcard pick that’s heating up fast - while Solana and its ETF dreams struggle to get off the ground. The 100x Meme Coin Play? Why Panshibi (SHIBI) Has Investors Buzzing As LINK crypto, Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) wrestle with steep losses, investors are scanning the horizon for the next big breakout. Enter Panshibi - the meme coin that’s quietly setting the stage for a potential 100x explosion. Unlike the usual meme plays that rely on hype alone, SHIBI is building an ecosystem designed for sustainability, fueling speculation that it could be the next major success story in crypto. What sets Panshibi apart? Beyond its viral panda branding, SHIBI’s presale has been gaining massive traction, drawing investors eager to get in before the inevitable price surge. With AI integration, Social-Fi mechanics and high-yield staking, Panshibi isn’t just riding the meme wave - it’s reshaping it. As its presale rapidly sells out, early adopters are positioning themselves for what could be one of the biggest profit runs of 2025. Meanwhile, LINK crypto struggles to maintain investor confidence and SOL’s volatility is keeping traders on edge. But Panshibi is telling a different story. With meme coin market caps surging and a clear demand for fresh, innovative projects, SHIBI’s rapid growth is making its 100x potential seem less like speculation and more like an inevitability. Some analysts believe Panshibi could be the next Shiba Inu - only faster, stronger and smarter. Could this be the ultimate meme coin moonshot? If momentum continues at this pace, SHIBI might not just hit 100x - it could set a new gold standard for meme coin success. With time running out before the presale ends, those who miss out might be left wondering why they didn’t grab their slice of the next big thing in crypto. Final Call: Will You Watch or Win? The writing's on the wall - while LINK crypto, ETH and SOL wrestle with losses, Panshibi is charging ahead. The presale is moving fast and the 100x window won’t stay open forever.

Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds have seen the largest outflows among the fund, with Bitcoin ETFs recording approximately $2.7 billion in outflows, while Ethereum ETFs recorded about $294 million in outflows as of February 28. The Bitcoin ETF markets , which saw a fruitful first year after their approval in January last year, are some of the biggest losers this year. K33 Research’s head of research, Vetle Lunde, shared that the second-largest outflows in Bitcoin ETFs were recorded in May last year when the funds saw 11,964 BTC in outflows compared to the 14,579 BTC in outflows recorded this week. Graph of the daily fund flow of Bitcoin investment products. Source: K33 Research U.S.-based BTC and ETH ETFs accounted for most of the weekly outflows recorded across global crypto investment funds. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) had the largest outflows among U.S.-based BTC ETFs, with $244.6 million in outflows on February 28. VanEck’s HODL and Grayscale’s GBTC also recorded outflows yesterday of $7.7 million and $33.3 million, respectively. February 28 was also the only day the ETFs had positive flows, recording over $94 million in inflows. U.S.-based ETH ETF outflows this week were led by the BlackRock ETHA ETF, which recorded over $30 million in outflows as of February 28. The Grayscale ETHE ETF also recorded outflows of $11.7 million on February 28. Other ETFs, including 21Shares, Bitwise, and Fidelity, had no activity yesterday. Outflows affect crypto-related stocks BREAKING: MicroStrategy stock, $MSTR , falls -57% from its all time high seen on November 21st. $MSTR has now lost an average of -$720 million of market cap PER TRADING DAY for 62 days straight. That's -$45 billion of market cap. https://t.co/F7tqpbDKcE pic.twitter.com/c2pawDXzwt — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) February 28, 2025 Crypto-related stocks have dropped significantly as the crypto market sentiment remains negative. The crypto and capital markets commentary The Kobeissi Letter outlined on February 28 that the Strategy (MicroStrategy) stock MSTR had dropped by 57% from its all-time high in November. The commentary added that the MSTR stock has also lost an average of $720 million from its market cap per trading day for the past 62 days, bringing the total amount lost from its market cap to about $45 billion. Strategy was among the largest institutional investors in BTC, with Bitcoin Treasuries data revealing that the company’s BTC holdings currently stand at 499,096 BTC. The Japanese company Metaplanet has also lost about 54% from its peak. Other companies affected include Tesla, Robinhood, RIOT Platforms, Hut 8, and Coinbase. A Finance Yahoo report from yesterday still indicated that some of the stocks had surged slightly after BTC recovered above $80,000. Bitcoin’s price plunged yesterday to about $78,457, the lowest recorded since the beginning of November. However, the coin recovered by over 1.6% today, hovering between $84,000 and $85,000. BTC’s current price is down over 17% over the past seven days. CoinMarketCap data indicated that several other coins, including ETH, XRP, DOGE, ADA, and SOL, have also lost double-digit percentages in the past week. The crypto plunges have led to significant sell-offs this month, seen across exchanges and crypto-related investment products. Professional Capital Management CEO and founder Anthony Pompliano still believes that the sell-offs are “normal” and could indicate that a bull market is close. Pompliano added that bull runs in the past were preceded by plunges of up to 30% due to volatility. Political uncertainty is one of the reasons behind the current volatility The Head of Research at CoinShares, James Butterfill, recently shared that the current volatility and fear in crypto markets mainly resulted from political uncertainty. President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs have put a strain on crypto markets, especially since his insistence on implementing suggested tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico. The president confirmed on February 27 that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect on March 4. Butterfill still outlined that the policies the Trump administration wanted to implement concerning crypto would have a positive effect on digital assets in the long term. The CoinShares head of research pointed out President Trump’s recently signed executive orders related to boosting digital asset technology innovation and growth in the U.S. Butterfill also mentioned Trump’s plan to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. The market plunges also came after the Federal Reserve expressed bearish sentiment toward the U.S. GDP in this year’s first quarter. The Fed Reserve Bank of Atlanta recently speculated that the country’s GDP would drop by 1.5% in Q1 2025. However, the GDPNow tracker still indicated later that the GDP would increase by over 2% in the first quarter. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

However, after the initial rally, TRUMP has retraced, now trading lower at $12.98 as resistance at $13.98 holds. $TRUMP 30min showing strength. Above 13.67, takes you to 15.34, and 16.26. @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr pic.twitter.com/PMjpWWU70b — Trading Nomadic (@TradeNomadic) February 28, 2025 The surge followed a tense diplomatic fallout between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and former U.S. President Donald Trump, which led to increased market speculation. Despite the initial spike, TRUMP is now showing bearish momentum, with traders closely watching key support levels at $12.19 and $11.05 to determine the next move. Trump-Zelenskiy Standoff Sends Shockwaves Through Crypto Markets, Boosts “Official Trump” Token Diplomacy took a backseat as Trump and Vice President JD Vance clashed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accusing him of ingratitude over U.S. military aid. What was meant to be a high-stakes negotiation over U.S. access to Ukraine’s oil, gas, and rare minerals ended in a diplomatic fiasco, with Zelenskiy reportedly shown the door. The fallout has widened the rift between Kyiv and Washington, fueling uncertainty over Ukraine’s security and economic future. Zelensky just got kicked out of the White House, clear proof that Trump does what he says. If you don’t listen, you’re out. Now imagine what that means for crypto. Trump & his pro-crypto family (Melania, Barron) want to win with Bitcoin & stablecoins as reserves. #trump pic.twitter.com/Ldcq5wqRhW — Ed | DeFi Ninja (@Satanic_Shinobi) February 28, 2025 Meanwhile, Europe scrambled to contain the damage. French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte convened emergency talks with Zelenskiy, while Britain prepared a security summit to discuss contingency plans. German chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz also weighed in, pledging continued European support for Ukraine. As tensions escalated, traders rushed into the “Official Trump” token, betting that Trump’s hardline foreign policy stance could boost both his political capital and assets tied to his brand. While Trump-related tokens soared, the broader crypto market wobbled under the weight of geopolitical uncertainty, reflecting unease over potential policy shifts. Trump-Vance clashed with Zelenskiy, ending a key U.S.-Ukraine deal and straining ties. European leaders backed Ukraine, with Macron and NATO holding emergency talks. “Official Trump” token surged, while broader crypto markets faced pressure. Trump’s Tariff Bombshell: Canada, Mexico, and China Brace for Economic Fallout If the diplomatic crisis wasn’t enough, Trump turned up the heat on global trade, slapping fresh tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. A 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports takes effect on March 4, while Chinese goods face an additional 10% tariff, raising total duties to 20%. The move sent ripples through markets, raising fears of a full-blown trade war. Donald Trump confirmed today tariffs on Mexico and Canada will start on March 4 at 25%. China's will increase from 10% to 20%. Prepare yourself for 5% inflation and the US dollar will be devalued. Ultimately, this will great, but in the near term it's gonna sting. pic.twitter.com/Ihg4439itQ — Booker (@RealBookerScott) February 27, 2025 Analysts had hoped for a delay, but Trump’s uncompromising stance signals a shift towards protectionism. With China’s National People’s Congress on the horizon, Beijing is expected to retaliate with countermeasures, further straining international trade relations. As investors navigated the turbulence, many piled into politically-driven assets like OFFICIAL TRUMP, speculating that Trump’s economic and geopolitical maneuvering could push the coin’s value higher. However, market watchers warn that the hype may be short-lived. If diplomatic tensions ease or alternative trade agreements emerge, the coin’s rally could reverse just as quickly as it started. Trump imposed new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, raising trade war fears and market instability. Investors speculated on Trump’s policies, driving the “Official Trump” token’s surge. Analysts warn of volatility, as the coin’s gains may fade if tensions ease. TRUMP/USDT Price Analysis: Rally Stalls as Resistance Holds The TRUMP/USDT 4-hour chart shows that while the token surged 19.7% to a high of $13.98, it has since pulled back to $12.98, indicating that resistance remains strong. The rejection from the descending trendline and 50 EMA suggests that bullish momentum is fading. Currently, support at $12.19 is holding, but if it breaks, $11.05 and $9.53 could be the next downside targets. On the upside, reclaiming $14.44 could shift market sentiment, opening the door to a retest of $16.15. The trend remains bearish, with lower highs forming consistently. A breakout above key resistance levels, supported by strong volume, would be needed to confirm a potential trend reversal. Until then, traders should watch support zones and geopolitical developments for further cues.

With fears of XRP price declining below $1, this article looks into Remittix, which is attracting investors with its cross-border payment platform. Table of Contents XRP forecast: Analyst expects further drop Investors anticipate massive rallies for Remittix in 2025 Remittix vs. XRP The XRP crypto price has continued to decline as the altcoin slides into the bear zone. According to data from Coinglass, the Open Interest in XRP’s futures has dropped to its lowest in 2025. This suggests that the bullish momentum has weakened as analysts fear a further drop in the coming days. To recover from losses, investors are diversifying to high-potential projects like Remittix, the new cross-border payment platform that is changing the $67b DeFi industry. Designed with a robust security architecture, Remittix is seen as the future of DeFi with analysts projecting as high as 1,000% rallies on launch. XRP forecast: Analyst expects further drop With news of possible 25% new tariffs for the European Union by the Trump administration, the crypto market will likely continue to struggle, which will affect altcoins like XRP . According to CoinMarketCap, XRP price has dropped by 28% in the past month and 16% in the past week. The XRP market cap has also dipped from over $180b to less than $140b in the same timeframe. Source: CoinMarketCap In a tweet on X, Ali Martinez claimed that the XRP coin price is breaking out of an ascending parallel channel, which might see the altcoin price drop to $1.65. In another tweet, Ali noticed that whales have sold 370m XRP tokens in the past few days, suggesting that investors’ confidence is low even with the news of a possible XRP ETF approval in the year. Source: Ali Martinez on X In terms of technical analysis, the XRP Fear and Greed index is 21 (Extreme Fear), with a bearish market sentiment. However, with speculations that the SEC will drop the ongoing case in the coming days and possible ETF approval in the year, the XRP price is likely to rebound soon. A rally above its $3.84 ATH is still possible when the general crypto market bounces back.

At $0.08 right now, Dogecoin is still well below its peak value. With the potential to make you millions of dollars in a matter of months, Mutuum Finance is stealthily taking over their attention. Before it takes off, the cryptocurrency that everyone wants to invest in is rapidly becoming the future star. The second phase of Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) $0.015 presale is now underway. With MUTM anticipated to list at $0.06, investors who lock up their positions now stand to make a 300% return. With over $1.8 million raised and over 3,400 holders secured in record time, the idea has quickly garnered popularity. Dogecoin (DOGE) Stuck at $0.085 The first meme currency, Dogecoin (DOGE), reached an all-time high of $0.73 after riding waves of enthusiasm. It is currently stuck around $0.08, unable to gain any traction in a sluggish market. With retail excitement waning and no significant catalysts in sight, many investors are questioning if DOGE’s greatest days are already behind it. Some are searching for greater opportunities abroad, while others continue to hold out hope for a comeback. Analysts predict that MUTM will rise to $1, indicating that it has genuine growth potential in contrast to DOGE’s reliance on conjecture. This could be a better choice for people who want to use a little stake to get wealthy. Mutuum Finance Presale Booms as Traders Swell In Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is taking serious momentum with over $1.8 million in capital raised and over 3,400 investors making their early bets. At Phase 2 price of just $0.015 per token, investors are flocking to secure the deal before MUTM goes to $0.06 on release, which holds potential for enormous upside.

Safety is the priority, all transactions are conducted on audited smart contracts with fixed and variable interest rate choices to appeal to different levels of risk tolerance. Massive Growth Potential & Exclusive Investor Privileges Mutuum Finance is poised to expand long-term.

To incentivize initial investors, an enormous $100,000 give-away is active, wherein 10 users are being rewarded $10,000 each in the form of MUTM tokens. There’s a referral incentive that rewards individuals who bring on-board new investors too, fueling further growth for the community. Mutuum Finance is soon emerging as one of the most blazing prospects for crypto and the first movers are already reaping gains, courtesy its groundbreaking DeFi model coupled with strong investor interest. Dogecoin (DOGE) may have paved the way for meme coins, but its hype is gone, and speculators want the next big thing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly positioning itself as a front-runner, blending cutting-edge DeFi tech with massive growth potential. MUTM is attracting serious investor interest, with a strong presale, game-changing lending models, and a solid roadmap for long-term success.

Emily Nicolle, a crypto reporter for Bloomberg, gave her take on Bitcoin as the firstborn cryptocurrency plunged 13% and entered bear territory. This might have been due to macroeconomic uncertainty and political factors. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees 95% Drop In Network Activity—Trouble Ahead? ‘Very Risk-On Asset’ Nicolle said in a Bloomberg TV interview that the current movement in Bitcoin is highly correlated with the changes in the macroeconomic landscape, adding that anything that happens on Wall Street could affect the cryptocurrency. The crypto reporter explained that investors can never discount the impact of the macroenvironment on Bitcoin, saying, “Everything that’s happening to stocks that knocks on crypto too.” Nicolle described Bitcoin as “very risk-on assets.” “So, when there’s turmoil happening in the S&P 500, you’re going to see that in Bitcoin as well. And so that is definitely catapulting this,” she added. The analyst added that aside from the macroeconomic environment, the cryptocurrency sector went through a rough period. “We’ve had a 1. 5 billion hack last week. We’ve had some turmoil in terms of what’s going on in politics as well,” she continued. Only a little over a week ago, the cryptocurrency faced a setback after a North Korean-based hacker group stole an estimated $1.5 billion worth of crypto from Bybit, which could be the largest cryptocurrency hacking in history. “In terms of what people are expecting to see going forward, it’s still very much up in the air as to how Bitcoin could perform even in, even today,” Nicolle said in the interview. Political Uncertainty Nicolle also noted that political uncertainty is another factor driving Bitcoin into bearish territory. United States President Donald Trump vowed to establish clearer regulations on cryptocurrency, but these have not been met. “Some of the things that Trump promised to do on the campaign trail have not yet come to force and those are the kind of catalysts that we’re looking to as potential upsides for Bitcoin in the weeks ahead, things like a strategic Bitcoin reserve,” she explained. The crypto analyst pointed out that the macroenvironment is weighing very heavily on Bitcoin’s potential. “If we don’t get any movement on that, if things don’t start to look up elsewhere, Bitcoin will continue to be down,” she predicted. Closely Watching The $70k Mark Nicolle said that crypto traders are closely watching the $70,000 mark, which is the crucial psychological and technical support zone. “We’re all looking at about the $70,000 mark at the minute. So, if it does continue to go down, which is kind of to be expected in the current environment, then that is the next point at which we’re going to be starting to think. That is where a lot of the risk is happening,” she explained. Related Reading: Dogecoin Demand Slumps—Nearly 70% Drop In Open Interest Raises Concerns The analyst described Bitcoin as the “tide that lifts all boats” so when it goes up, other cryptocurrencies also go up too. “But those smaller cryptocurrencies are hit harder when there’s tumult in markets.

Speaking to the Tamedia group, Schlegel cited three primary concerns surrounding cryptocurrencies. The first one is their volatility, which he said makes them unsuitable for long-term value preservation. “Second, our reserves need to be highly liquid so that they can be used quickly for monetary policy purposes if needed,” Schlegel told Tamedia before pointing to a lack of security inherent in being software-based assets. “We all know that software can have bugs and other weak points.” The Swiss National Bank President’s words come amid a growing debate in Switzerland over the nascent asset class. A recent initiative is pushing for a constitutional amendment requiring the SNB to hold bitcoin in its reserves alongside gold, the article said. The initiative, launched in December and led by entrepreneur Yves Bennaim, does not go into details when it comes to the bitcoin allocations but specifies it should be built up from the bank’s earnings. It has 18 months to collect 100,000 signatures in a bid to trigger a nationwide vote on the topic. Despite Switzerland’s growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies, with various Swiss banks offering customers cryptocurrency-related services , Schlegel dismissed the asset class as a “niche phenomenon.” Currencies, he told Tamedia, have already been in competition, and Schlegel maintained the bank is “not afraid of competition from cryptocurrencies,” citing the continued strength of the Swiss franc.",Markets|Swiss National Bank|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-01 18:31:14

In a recent post, Kiyosaki criticized the Federal Reserve and the banking sector, accusing them of corruption and mismanagement. He referred to central bankers as “banksters,” alleging that they receive government bailouts despite losing billions. Robert Kiyosaki Calls US Dollar a Scam, Urges Bitcoin Investment In a recent post on X platform, Robert Kiyosaki questioned whether Bitcoin is a scam but stated that the U.S. dollar and the banking system are worse. He emphasized that the Federal Reserve and the banking sector manipulate the financial system, benefiting from government bailouts while the general public suffers losses. Kiyosaki also warned against Bitcoin ETFs, stating that they are controlled by financial institutions. He urged investors to own real assets such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin rather than relying on financial products managed by banks. He expressed concerns that banking institutions could manipulate these ETFs, reducing investors’ control over their holdings. Moreover, the financial writer recently shared insights ahead of the predicted market crash, advising individuals to focus on assets that maintain value. Kiyosaki emphasized the importance of gold, silver, and Bitcoin as protection against inflation and financial instability. Kiyosaki also encouraged investing in essential businesses and real estate opportunities that emerge during downturns. Bitcoin Price Market Volatility Viewed as an Opportunity During a period of Bitcoin price fluctuations, Robert Kiyosaki reiterated his confidence in the cryptocurrency. On February 27, he commented on Bitcoin’s declining price, stating that it was an opportunity to buy rather than a cause for concern. He referred to Bitcoin as being “on sale” and reaffirmed his commitment to purchasing more. Kiyosaki blamed America’s financial structure rather than Bitcoin for market instability. He maintained that traditional financial institutions are responsible for the country’s economic instability. Similarly, earlier this year, Kiyosaki highlighted reasons why Bitcoin holds an advantage over the US dollar. He pointed to Gresham’s Law, stating that bad money, like fiat currencies, pushes good money into hiding, making Bitcoin a preferred store of value. He also referenced Metcalfe’s Law, emphasizing that Bitcoin’s growing network strengthens its value and global acceptance. U.S. Debt Crisis and Inflation Concerns Robert Kiyosaki also expressed concerns about the growing U.S. debt. He claimed that the total financial obligations, including unfunded liabilities, exceed $230 trillion. He predicted that when major holders like Japan and China stop purchasing U.S. bonds, inflation will rise, further weakening the dollar. According to Kiyosaki, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies are unsustainable. He stated that inflation is not caused by rising asset prices but by the declining value of the dollar. Kiyosaki believes that the weakening currency will push more investors towards tangible assets like Bitcoin, gold, and silver. Preference for Physical Assets Over ETFs Robert Kiyosaki urged investors to buy real gold, silver, and Bitcoin instead of ETFs linked to these assets. He called Bitcoin ETFs “bankster’s money” and stated that they do not offer the same level of financial security as direct ownership. Kiyosaki warned that financial institutions manipulate ETFs and do not provide real protection during economic crises. At press time, Bitcoin price is trading at $85,162.67, reflecting a 1.69% increase in the past 24 hours. The market cap stands at $1.68 trillion, while the 24-hour trading volume dropped to $37.22 billion.

41017739,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=685181,1740854446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41017739.jpeg,Binance’s founder CZ suggests new idea for token issuance,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/binances-founder-cz-suggests-new-idea-for-token-issuance/,"Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has proposed a new way for crypto projects to issue tokens, laying out a structured plan via an X post today that ties token unlocks directly to price performance and time intervals. CZ’s idea is tokens should only be unlocked in stages, and only if the price doubles and stays above that level for 30 days straight before the next release. How CZ’s proposed system would work The concept is designed to stop projects from flooding the market with tokens at low prices, a common issue that leads to sudden price crashes. CZ said : “Each future unlock must meet ALL of the following conditions: 1. Six months after the previous unlock. 2. ONLY IF the token price has sustained above 2x of the previous unlock price for more than 30 days immediately before the unlock. 3. Up to 5% of tokens maximum each time.”. Under CZ’s model, let’s say a token starts at $1 in January with its initial 10% unlock. By June, if the price is still below $2, no additional tokens can enter the market. But if it reaches $2 or more and holds that level for at least 30 days, then by August, 5% more tokens can be unlocked. If the price hits $3 on August 3, the next possible unlock won’t happen until March 3 of the following year, and only if the price has surged beyond $6 for another 30-day period. “The project team does NOT have the discretion to shorten or increase the size of the next unlock. The tokens shall be locked by a smart contract where a third party controls the keys. This avoids new tokens flooding the market when prices are low. It also gives the project team incentives to build for the long term,” said CZ in his post. Right now, crypto token issuance varies widely depending on the blockchain and the project. Some, like Bitcoin, have a fixed maximum supply—only 21 million BTC will ever exist, and once they’re mined, that’s it. Others, like Ethereum, don’t have a cap and continue issuing tokens as part of their economic model. It is important that blockchain-based projects and cryptocurrencies, in general, detail how the process of token issuance works for their specific system. As there are numerous consensus mechanisms out there, different crypto blockchains have various setups when it comes to token issuance. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and Ethereum Co-founder Vitalik Buterin together at Binance’s Desci Day event in Bangkok, Nov 13, 2024. Source: X CZ’s idea would bring more structure to token issuance, making sure projects don’t just release new tokens whenever they feel like it. The smart contract-based lockup system the Binance founder described would remove manual control, ensuring that unlocks happen only under predefined conditions. Token issuance also plays a role beyond cryptocurrencies. Tokenization—the process of putting real-world assets on the blockchain—relies on token issuance to create digital versions of assets like real estate, stocks, and commodities. While CZ’s idea focuses on crypto tokens specifically, the principles of controlled issuance could have wider applications. For now, CZ made it clear that he has “no plans to issue a new token” himself. But with this idea now out in the open, it remains to be seen whether crypto projects will adopt it—or if it will start a debate on how tokens should be released in the future.

The firm estimated illicit crypto transactions in 2024 to be $40.9 billion, down from $46.1 billion in 2023. However, this figure is projected to exceed $51 billion as more illegal addresses are identified. Shift to Stablecoins and Ransomware Attacks Bitcoin, once the primary currency for bad actors, has been overtaken by stablecoins, which now account for 63% of all illicit crypto transactions. Chainalysis highlighted that financial sanctions have led to the shift toward stablecoins, as they offer speed, liquidity, and regulatory blind spots that make laundering funds easier. Further, these assets provide near-instant transactions and eliminate concerns over price fluctuations. Some stablecoin issuers, including Tether, have frozen hundreds of addresses linked to illegal activity. In response, some criminals have turned to privacy coins like Monero (XMR), privacy wallets, and DeFi-based laundering schemes. Ransomware payments dropped 35% in 2024, with less than half of recorded attacks resulting in payments. Chainalysis attributes this decline to law enforcement crackdowns and a reduced willingness among victims to pay. However, groups engaged in the activity are adapting. Following the takedown of LockBit, smaller syndicates such as RansomHub have absorbed displaced operators and remain operational. The report also highlighted that ransomware tactics are shifting toward data theft and extortion. Meanwhile, market manipulation on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) continues to thrive. In 2024, an estimated $2.57 billion in illicit trading volume was artificially generated, with 3.59% of newly minted tokens showing rug-pull characteristics. Crypto Theft and AI-Driven Fraud Increase The New York-based firm revealed that crypto theft grew by 21% in 2024, reaching $2.2 billion. While DeFi platforms accounted for most stolen funds, centralized services became the primary targets in the second and third quarters. North Korean hackers were responsible for 61% of these thefts. Fraud and scams remained widespread, with high-yield investment schemes and “pig butchering” among the most successful. Chainalysis revealed the growing use of AI tools by lawbreakers to bypass KYC measures and automate fraud. The analysis described this as part of a broader trend in cybercrime, where AI is being leveraged to enhance deception and evade detection. Bad actors in the crypto space have also become more professional, with hackers, scammers, and extortionists behind $10.8 billion of the estimated $40.9 billion in digital asset crime last year. Chainalysis further examined the SEC’s crackdown on $2.57 billion in market manipulation schemes, detailing evolving criminal tactics and enforcement efforts. As regulators respond to stablecoins’ growing role in money laundering, oversight is expected to tighten. Meanwhile, AI-driven fraud is projected to expand, making deepfakes, synthetic identities, and phishing attacks increasingly difficult to detect.

Or get in on Shiba Inu before it made millionaires overnight? That’s the kind of opportunity BTFD Coin (BTFD) is handing investors right now—except this time, you’ve got an edge. A 100% bonus edge. Meanwhile, Pudgy Penguins and Toshi are making waves, but BTFD is bringing a game-changing presale that’s got crypto bulls rushing in among the top new meme coins to buy today. BTFD Coin’s presale has been unstoppable, raising over $6.21 million since its presale launch. The 14th stage is live, and here’s the kicker—you can double your holdings instantly with the LAUNCH100 bonus code. That means 550% ROI potential by the time BTFD hits its listing price. And if you thought meme coins were just about hype, BTFD is flipping the game with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a thriving Bulls Squad community. But this bonus deal? It won’t last forever. Let’s dive into the top new meme coins to buy today and rack in big gains. BTFD Coin: The Ultimate Dip Buying Opportunity with 100% Bonus Imagine putting in $4,000 at the current presale price of $0.00016 per BTFD coin. That gets you 25 million BTFD tokens. But wait—apply LAUNCH100, and you get 50 million BTFD coins instead. When BTFD launches at $0.0006, your stash will be worth $30,000. That’s an insane 550% ROI, and that’s without the market even factoring in post-launch hype. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a community-driven movement designed for those who know that buying the dip is where real money is made. BTFD has burned all unsold tokens from Stage 13, meaning a tighter supply and stronger demand. With over 70 billion BTFD sold and 11,100+ Bulls already in, this presale is gearing up for a massive takeoff. BTFD’s P2E Game and Staking: Passive Income with Real Rewards BTFD isn’t just about buying low and waiting for the moon—it’s about earning while you hold.

It’s known for building a strong community and creating collectible NFTs that hold long-term value. Investors love the crossover appeal, but while it’s a great hold, it doesn’t offer the kind of multiplying potential that BTFD’s presale does. Toshi: The Meme Coin with a Smart Twist Toshi (TOSHI) is the latest community-powered meme coin that has caught fire on social media. Built on the principles of decentralization and meme culture, it’s gaining traction among younger investors looking for the next viral crypto play. While TOSHI lacks the staking, gaming, and presale hype of BTFD, it thrives on organic hype and strong community backing. If it continues riding its momentum, it could become another meme sensation in 2025. Time is Running Out—Secure Your BTFD Bonus Now!

The founder of Consensys and co-creator of Ethereum (ETH), Joe Lubin is hopeful about this change . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to drop its lawsuit against his Ethereum software firm. Lubin believes this could open new doors for blockchain growth. Speaking at Ethereum Denver 2025, Lubin said the U.S. government’s view on crypto is changing for good. He believes this shift is because President Donald Trump took office in January after defeating Joe Biden in the November 2024 elections. Crypto in the U.S: From Hostility to Cooperation Under former Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC was seen as unfriendly and unclear about crypto rules . Many in the industry accused the agency of relying on enforcement instead of giving clear guidelines. In July 2024, the SEC sued Consensys, claiming its MetaMask staking service was selling unregistered securities. Fast forward to 2025, things are changing. On Thursday, Consensys said the SEC had agreed to drop the case and is awaiting final approval. The SEC has also ended lawsuits and investigations into other big crypto firms, including Coinbase, Robinhood, Uniswap Labs, and OpenSea . A New Administration, A New Approach Lubin thinks the Trump administration has changed how the government sees crypto in a good way. Unlike the previous government, which he described as restrictive, the new leadership appears open to the potential of blockchain technology. President Trump had already signaled his support for the crypto sector during his electoral campaign in 2024. He vowed to create a more favorable environment for blockchain businesses in the U.S. Now, Lubin sees that promise turning into action. Consensys and MetaMask Expand Amid Regulatory Relief The SEC’s decision comes at a time of growth for Consensys. At the public event, the company announced that its popular MetaMask wallet will now support Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL), expanding beyond Ethereum (ETH) and other EVM-compatible chains. This change shows that MetaMask is growing into a platform that supports many blockchains, making it more useful for people worldwide. For Lubin and other blockchain leaders, the new rules mean more than just stopping lawsuits. It shows that the U.S. is now open to crypto innovation instead of blocking it.

The analyst alluded to the Elliott Wave Theory to explain how XRP could reach this ambitious price target. How XRP Price Will Rally To $66 This Year In an X post , Egrag Crypto predicted that the XRP price could rally to between $20 and $66 this year. He asserted that his analysis is grounded in mathematical principles rather than speculative hype. The analyst then explained how the Elliot Wave Theory forecasts that XRP can reach as high as $66. The analyst’s ultra-bullish prediction for XRP comes just as another analyst, Dark Defender, predicted that XRP will reach $8 irrespective of the outcome of the Ripple SEC case . Egrag Crypto noted that the Wave 1 has demonstrated a remarkable increase of 510%. He stated that this percentage serves as the baseline for subsequent wave calculations. The crypto analyst then proceeded to Wave 2, where he remarked that he was still assessing the nature of the corrective formation. Egrag Crypto opined that XRP is witnessing an irregular and expanded flat corrective formation. Typically, for an expanded or irregular formation to play out, the B wave must surpass the starting point of the A wave, which he noted has occurred in this case. As to how this corrective wave could play out, Egrag Crypto anticipates that wave E may dip below $1.77, setting up a potential bear trap. However, before wave E concludes, he remarked that there needs to be a bull trap targeting around $3.7 to $3.9. He warned market participants that this correction could exceed 50%. How Wave 3 And 4 Could Play Out For Wave 3, Egrag Crypto noted that, as the most impulsive wave, it stands out clearly fueled by overwhelming bullish sentiment. In accordance with the Elliot Wave Theory, the analyst noted that wave 3 typically extends to 1.618 times the length of wave 1. Since the XRP price rallied 510% on wave 1, the crypto could witness an 800% to 1,000% on wave 3, which would send it to between $17 and $20. For the corrective wave 4 move, the crypto analyst noted that XRP typically retraces between 14.6% and 38.2% of wave 3. During this period, Egrag Crypto remarked that new buying opportunities arise as prices consolidate sideways. He noted that volume typically drops, making this period a good buying point for those anticipating the wave 5 impulsive move. The analyst predicts that XRP could drop to between $6 and $7 as it experiences a pullback of around 38.2%. He warned that this may frustrate traders due to the prolonged sideways movement. How XRP Will Reach $66 On Wave 5 Based on the Elliot Wave Theory, wave 5 represents the final ascent in this upward trend, sending the XRP price as high as $66. Egrag Crypto noted that during this phase, there will be overwhelmingly positive news and a bullish sentiment surging through the market. The analyst derived the price target of $66 based on various metrics of Wave count number 5. He stated that the range between inverse 1.236 and 1.618 times wave 4 indicates a price target between $20 and $29. Meanwhile, a rally of 510%, similar to the one experienced in wave 1 puts the XRP price at around $44. Lastly, 61.8% of wave 1 and wave 3 position XRP at around $66. The analyst’s accompanying chart suggested that the crypto could reach this $66 price target between March and May. Interestingly, legal expert Matt Hougan predicts the Ripple lawsuit will conclude between April and May. Therefore, this could be the catalyst for this parabolic rally for the XRP price.

They see XRP (Ripple) showing potential to outpace Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in the coming months. XRP’s recent surge comes from increased adoption of RippleNet and the successful launch of its stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD). However, while XRP’s corporate adoption grows, Web3Bay has emerged as February’s most discussed cryptocurrency. It attracts investors with a record-breaking presale and a decentralized e-commerce platform that promises utility and substantial returns. As of February 2025, XRP trades at $2.61 with a $261 billion market capitalization. This reflects a 2.62% daily increase. Despite only a 34% gain between 2019 and late 2024, XRP’s improved regulatory landscape and technological advancements have reignited investor interest. Yet, Web3Bay’s rapid fundraising, over $1.6 million raised and 395 million tokens sold, indicates it is more than just another presale. It is a movement redefining crypto investments. XRP’s Revitalized Momentum: The Forces Driving Optimism XRP faced years of challenges due to an SEC lawsuit. This limited its price activity and corporate adoption. However, recent regulatory clarity has boosted investor confidence. The key factor? Ripple’s introduction of Ripple USD (RLUSD) in December 2024. RLUSD, fully backed by U.S. dollars and government bonds, enables faster, stable transactions on RippleNet. This offers an alternative to using XRP directly for payments. RippleNet’s increasing adoption by financial institutions demonstrates growing trust in XRP’s ecosystem. The new administration’s quick replacement of the SEC chairman has reduced regulatory uncertainty. This encourages banks to explore Ripple’s solutions more openly. Notably, $100 million moved into RLUSD within two months of its launch. Although mostly on the Ethereum network, this influx highlights Ripple’s broader adoption story. Ripple plans to use RLUSD for tokenizing real-world assets like commodities and securities. This further expands the utility of its ledger. With these developments, analysts suggest XRP could outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum in the next year. This will be driven by corporate demand and improved transaction efficiency. Web3Bay: February’s Breakout Crypto With Tangible Utility While XRP’s prospects are improving, Web3Bay is delivering results now. Its presale has become one of the fastest-selling events this year. It raised over $1.6 million and sold more than 395 million tokens in a few weeks. Currently, in stage 5 of its 28-stage presale, the 3BAY token is priced at $0.00524. Projections indicate it will reach $0.1959 at launch. This represents a 4200% ROI for early participants. What distinguishes Web3Bay from speculative tokens is its utility-focused strategy. The platform is developing a decentralized e-commerce marketplace. This allows users to buy and sell digital assets without intermediaries. Transactions are powered by blockchain technology. This ensures transparency, security, and ownership of user data. Unlike traditional marketplaces that dictate policies, Web3Bay operates on community-driven governance. Holders of the 3BAY token can propose and vote on platform changes. This gives users a direct say in its development. Web3Bay’s commitment to decentralization is further strengthened by its decision to renounce ownership of its smart contract after the presale concludes. This ensures no central authority, including Web3Bay, can manipulate the system. This gives the community complete control over its future. Investors are not just attracted to potential price gains. Web3Bay offers staking rewards. This allows token holders to earn passive income while supporting the network. Also, purchases made with 3BAY tokens come with a 5% discount. This adds real-world incentives for long-term adoption. The platform’s Layer-1 blockchain ensures fast transaction speeds. Decentralized storage solutions like IPFS keep user data secure and resistant to tampering. Why Web3Bay Could Outperform XRP Despite Ripple’s Corporate Push XRP’s bullish case depends on corporate adoption and RippleNet’s growing utility through RLUSD. With $100 million flowing into Ripple’s stablecoin and reduced regulatory obstacles, XRP could indeed outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum in the coming year. However, XRP’s price growth remains tied to external factors. These are mainly regulatory clarity and corporate willingness to adopt its technology at scale. In contrast, Web3Bay’s momentum comes from immediate investor demand and clear, user-focused value propositions. While XRP’s corporate gains are promising, Web3Bay’s presale data shows widespread retail enthusiasm. With four presale stages already sold out and the remaining stages filling quickly, the market’s confidence in Web3Bay is evident. Web3Bay also offers broader utility beyond payment processing. Its decentralized e-commerce ecosystem taps into the global demand for peer-to-peer marketplaces. This provides practical use cases that extend beyond the crypto space. Token holders not only benefit from potential price appreciation but also from the platform’s transaction discounts, staking rewards, and governance opportunities. For those seeking short-term gains and long-term utility, Web3Bay stands out as the more compelling investment. Its decentralized architecture, strong presale performance, and community-driven governance offer a comprehensive solution that appeals to both retail investors and future platform users.

While tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) still attract retail traders, larger investors are looking for projects with real utility. Mutuum Finance, now in its presale at $0.015 per token, has already raised over $1.8 million, gaining attention as a decentralized lending protocol with practical financial applications. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The MUTM token presale is advancing quickly, currently in its second phase at $0.015 per token, with over 40% of the presale already completed. So far, the project has raised over $1.8 million, with more than 150 million tokens already sold. Across its 11 total presale phases, the price will progressively increase, leading to a launch price of $0.06, giving early investors an opportunity for a 400% return before exchange listings. Analysts expect further growth post-launch, fueled by the increasing adoption of DeFi lending and the platform’s ability to generate sustainable revenue. The project’s financial model, structured around passive income generation and long-term buy pressure, sets it apart from speculative assets, making it a preferred choice for experienced investors. Mutuum Finance is a fully decentralized liquidity protocol built for lending, borrowing, and passive income generation. Unlike speculative tokens with limited utility, Mutuum offers a structured financial system that enables users to supply assets, earn yield, or borrow against collateral without having to sell their holdings. The protocol is designed to operate without intermediaries, ensuring an efficient and trustless financial environment. One of the aspects that truly makes it stand out is its dual lending model that consists of both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. The P2C model allows users to supply assets to liquidity pools, where they receive interest based on utilization rates. Meanwhile, the P2P model gives borrowers and lenders the ability to negotiate custom loan terms, extending support to assets not commonly available in traditional pools, including memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB). Mutuum Finance employs a buy-and-distribute mechanism to support price stability and maintain strong demand. A portion of the platform’s revenue is used to buy back MUTM tokens, which are then distributed to mtToken holders as rewards. This approach creates consistent buy pressure, reinforcing the token’s value while benefiting users who actively participate in the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a total supply of 4 billion tokens, which are strategically allocated to fund the long-term project development. Much of it goes to the presale so that early investors can secure their positions ahead of the token release. Others go to liquidity mining and incentives, where users are rewarded for usage in the ecosystem of the platform. Others go to ecosystem expansion and developer bounties, encouraging continued updates to the protocol. Liquidity reserves are being kept in storage to support listings on exchanges, as well as stable markets, while some are stored for partnerships, as well as for community incentives to encourage participation, as well as growth. Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 contest to encourage early adoption and create community buzz. The contest enables entry in return for easy steps such as posting on social media and inviting friends. Full details and rules are available on the official website. Why whales are turning to Mutuum Finance Bitcoin whales and institutional investors are shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as they look for projects with strong financial utility and sustainable growth. With its decentralized lending system, passive income opportunities, and buy-and-distribute mechanism, Mutuum offers a long-term value proposition that speculative assets lack. The combination of rising presale demand, structured tokenomics, and an upcoming platform launch makes MUTM a standout choice in DeFi. As adoption grows, whales recognize its potential for sustained price appreciation, positioning Mutuum Finance as a top contender in the market for 2025 and beyond.

With the crypto market growing faster than ever, early buyera are constantly hunting for the next big thing. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant, many altcoins have emerged as high-growth alternatives that are shaking up the investment scene. But which of these projects are truly worth your time and money? Enter Qubetics , SUI, and Astra—three standout projects redefining the crypto space. Each has carved out its own niche, offering unique solutions to modern digital asset challenges. Whether you’re looking for a cutting-edge Web3 aggregator, a high-performance blockchain, or a bridge between traditional finance and DeFi, these projects have proven themselves as the best crypto for huge gains. Let’s dive into their milestones, market positions, and why they’re catching the attention of early adopters worldwide. Qubetics: The World’s First Web3 Aggregator Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project—it’s an industry disruptor. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it’s on a mission to unify the fragmented blockchain ecosystem by offering seamless access to decentralized services, wallets, exchanges, and dApps, all in one place. This means users no longer have to juggle multiple platforms just to manage their crypto assets or access different Web3 services. Whether you’re a business owner looking for better financial tools, a freelancer needing fast, secure payments, or a gamer diving into the metaverse, Qubetics is making blockchain technology more accessible and convenient for daily life. One of Qubetics’ standout innovations is its decentralized VPN (dVPN)—a major upgrade from traditional VPNs. Unlike centralized VPN services that rely on a single provider and can be shut down or compromised, Qubetics’ dVPN operates on a peer-to-peer network, enhancing security, anonymity, and accessibility. Picture this: A journalist in a country with strict internet censorship needs unrestricted access to global news. Or a business wants to protect sensitive communications from corporate espionage. Even casual users can benefit by preventing ISPs and advertisers from tracking their data. With Qubetics’ dVPN, these scenarios become a reality—offering true digital freedom in a way centralized services never could. Qubetics has achieved remarkable milestones, currently in its 23rd presale stage with the $TICS token priced at $0.0888. The project has attracted over 21,700 token holders and raised more than $14.3 million, with an impressive 492 million $TICS tokens sold. By the end of the presale, when $TICS reaches $0.25, participants can expect a 181.52% ROI. If the token hits $1 post-presale, the ROI soars to 1,026.09%, while a $5 valuation boosts it to 5,530.44%. At $6, returns climb to 6,656.53%. Following the mainnet launch, a $10 price point would generate an 11,160.88% ROI, and at $15, the return skyrockets to 16,791.32%, presenting a highly lucrative investment opportunity. SUI: The High-Performance Blockchain Built for Scale SUI, developed by Mysten Labs, is a high-speed Layer 1 blockchain revolutionizing transaction efficiency. Unlike traditional blockchains, SUI enables parallel execution, ensuring unmatched scalability. Designed for dApps, DeFi, and gaming, SUI’s low-latency architecture supports real-time processing with minimal fees. Institutional early buyers and developers favor SUI for its security and high throughput. Its developer-friendly ecosystem simplifies smart contract deployment, fueling innovation and rapid project growth. With its scalability-first design, SUI stands out as the best crypto for huge gains in the blockchain space. Astra: Bridging the Gap Between Traditional Finance and DeFi Astra is revolutionizing DeFi by bridging traditional finance with blockchain innovation. With a $1.17 token price, Astra’s steady growth reflects strong market trust. It tackles regulatory uncertainty, ensuring compliance with global financial laws, making it easier for institutions and retail community members to enter DeFi confidently. Astra’s ecosystem offers a user-friendly dashboard for yield farming, staking, and lending, seamless fiat-to-crypto conversions, and institutional-grade security. Unlike complex DeFi platforms, Astra simplifies access with intuitive interfaces and low fees. For early buyers seeking DeFi exposure without technical hurdles, Astra stands out as the best crypto for huge gains in the crypto space. Conclusion: Which Crypto is Right for You? If you’re looking for the best crypto for huge gains, it’s clear that Qubetics, SUI, and Astra each offer something unique. Qubetics is revolutionizing Web3 with its aggregator model and decentralized VPN, making blockchain services more accessible. SUI is leading the way in high-speed blockchain technology, perfect for developers and large-scale applications. Astra is bringing DeFi to mainstream buyers, making decentralized finance more intuitive and compliant. With Qubetics’ crypto presale heating up, now might be the perfect time to get in before prices surge.

At the time of publication, Polymarket participants estimated a 19% probability of Zelenskyy’s premature exit. Meanwhile, European Union leaders are set to convene on Sunday to address Russia and a peace plan for Ukraine. Another meeting is planned for March 6. You might also like: Polymarket users spin $16m volume on Trump’s picks What went wrong with the US? On Friday, Zelenskyy visited the White House to discuss with President Donald Trump, who often touts his dealmaking skills as an asset, an end to Russia’s war with Ukraine. The talks concluded without a deal. Also, Trump rebuked Zelenskyy for not showing appreciation to the U.S. “You have to be thankful. You don’t have the cards right now,” he said. For weeks, Trump has been urging Ukraine to give up a sizable portion of its mineral assets to the U.S., but offered almost nothing in return, according to the Associated Press . “You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out, and if we’re out, you’ll fight it out and I don’t think it’s going to be pretty,” Trump added. “I’m not playing cards,” Zelenskyy replied. “I’m very serious, Mr. President. I’m the president in a war.” Russian President Vladimir Putin has refused to accept Ukraine’s sovereignty and independent statehood, often mischaracterizing historical events to justify Russia’s invasion. Vice President JD Vance also chimed in during the meeting, criticizing Zelenskyy rather than expressing disapproval of Putin’s actions. “Have you said thank you once this entire meeting?” Vance asked. In reality, Zelenskyy has thanked the U.S. nearly three dozen times, CNN tallied. That includes recently, on Feb. 12 , just over two weeks before Friday’s White House visit. “I am grateful to President Trump for his interest in what we can accomplish together,” Zelenskyy posted on X, formerly Twitter. I had a meaningful conversation with @POTUS . We long talked about opportunities to achieve peace, discussed our readiness to work together at the team level, and Ukraine’s technological capabilities—including drones and other advanced industries. I am grateful to President Trump… pic.twitter.com/2SIOTX3jEp — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) February 12, 2025 Zelenskyy to Vance: ‘Come once’ Vance also berated Zelenskyy for attempting to “litigate” the conflict resolution in the Oval Office, calling it disrespectful and noting Ukraine’s struggles with manpower. “Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?” Zelenskyy asked. “Come once.” Vance, seemingly flustered, responded: “I’ve actually watched and seen the stories, and I know that what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President. Do you disagree that you’ve had problems, bringing people into your military?” Trump, who has a co-writing credit on the 1987 book “The Art of the Deal,” went on to blame Zelenskyy’s “hatred” toward Putin for complicating the talks. “That’s very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate,” Trump said. According to Lostarmour.info and UALosses.org , about 62,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died since Russia launched an invasion in February 2022. Over 95,000 people in Russia’s military have died, BBC recently reported . Trump summed up the meeting with a smirk, adding: “This is going to be great television.” EU extends support Foreign Minister Georg Georgiev said on X: “Ukraine, be brave, be strong! We are all by your side.” Ursula von der Leyen, President of the EU Commission, shared a similar sentiment. “Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President Zelenskyy,” she said. “We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace.” Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people.

Those who are not in are already late — this presale is flying through stages at the speed of a champion’s knockout punch. Pepe Pepe (PEPE) has seen significant price changes lately. In the past week, its value dropped by nearly 10%. Over the last month, it fell by about 35%. Yet, over six months, the price increased by around 8%. This suggests some long-term strength despite recent declines. Currently, PEPE trades between $0.00000863 and $0.00001037. The nearest support is at $0.00000790. If prices dip more, this level might halt the fall. On the upside, the closest resistance is $0.00001138. If PEPE climbs above this, it could reach the next resistance at $0.00001312. Technical indicators give a mixed view. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, near $0.00000846, suggesting price stability. The Relative Strength Index is 55.39, indicating a neutral market. The Stochastic is at 64.82, also showing no strong trend. The MACD level is low, hinting at little momentum. Based on these data, PEPE’s price might stay steady for now but could move if key levels are crossed. Bonk Bonk (BONK) has seen volatility, trading between $0.00001448 and $0.00001731. Over the past week, its value fell by 11.72%, adding to a 47.27% drop in the past month. Despite this, over six months, BONK is down only 22.14%, showing some longer-term stability. Technical indicators are sending mixed signals. The RSI is 55.64, indicating a neutral stance. The Stochastic oscillator is at 71.36, nearing overbought levels. The 10-day and 100-day SMAs are close to the current price, at $0.00001382 and $0.00001399, respectively. A positive MACD level of 0.0000001247 suggests potential upward momentum. If BONK breaks the nearest resistance at $0.00001887, it could rise by about 19%. Supported by positive indicators, this move may signal a rebound. However, a drop below the support at $0.00001321 could lead to a 17% decline, possibly testing the second support at $0.00001038. Traders are watching to see if BONK can reverse recent losses.

Ethereum Q2 Breakthrough May Trigger an Epic Rally Ethereum (ETH) is ready for the long-awaited Q2 breakthrough as experts anticipate a strong upside from its current price of $2,160. As the second-largest cryptocurrency, ETH still gets to reap the benefits of institutional expansion, network growth, and growing DeFi adoption. Future catalysts like Ethereum’s next Dencun upgrade, increasing Layer 2 usage could fuel the strong bullish momentum. On top of this, with majorline Ethereum ETFs and significant institutions adding more positions, ETH demand should increase further and have the potential to set the stage for a monster rally.

This buying spree has sparked discussions among traders and analysts about a potential Dogecoin price rally toward the $1 mark. Whales Accumulate DOGE Amid Market Volatility Data from on-chain analytics platforms indicates that whales have been actively purchasing Dogecoin, signaling strong confidence in its future price movements. Large transactions involving millions of DOGE tokens have been recorded, suggesting that institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals are positioning themselves for an uptrend. Whale accumulation often influences market sentiment, as it reduces the available supply and can lead to increased buying pressure. The recent purchases coincide with DOGE maintaining key support levels, which analysts believe could serve as a foundation for further price increases. Moreover, crypto analyst Javon Marks has highlighted Dogecoin price strong breakout performance, noting that the cryptocurrency has already gained over 600% since its initial surge. He emphasized that DOGE reached $0.6533 before pulling back and believes the next breakout could push the price beyond this level, potentially reaching $1.22. Dogecoin Price Holds Support as Analysts Predict Uptrend Dogecoin’s price is currently above a crucial support zone around $0.185. According to market analyst Ali Martinez, holding this level could allow DOGE to challenge higher resistance points in the near term. If buying momentum continues, analysts suggest that DOGE could retest the $0.25 and $0.33 resistance levels before targeting new highs. Market expert Trader Tardigrade has also identified an “order block zone,” where a concentration of buying and selling orders could determine Dogecoin’s price next move. If demand outweighs supply, the price may push upward, setting the stage for a broader rally. Technical Indicators Suggest a Potential Breakout Technical analysis shows that Dogecoin’s price recently rebounded from recent lows, gaining 12.46% in a single session. This recovery aligns with historical patterns where Dogecoin price has experienced strong rallies following periods of accumulation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 43, indicating neutral momentum, but a move above 50 could signal growing bullish strength. Meanwhile, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator is at -0.06, showing mild selling pressure. If this value turns positive, it could confirm renewed buying activity. DOGE/USD 4hr price chart (Source: TradingView) Additionally, the 4-hour chart shows a double bottom pattern, a common indicator of potential upward movement. If this pattern holds, Dogecoin’s price may see further gains in the coming weeks.

Bloomberg, citing a BlackRock investment outlook that its journalists had viewed, reports that the firm added a 1-2% allocation for IBIT in model portfolios that allow for alternative investments. Model portfolios are a basket of different investments crafted by a financial advisor. Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, reportedly wrote in an investment commentary this week that the firm believes Bitcoin has “long-term investment merit and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios.” In January, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that sovereign wealth funds could drive the price of Bitcoin higher if they attempt to hedge against “local fears,” such as inflation and political or economic uncertainty. “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency or you’re frightened of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears. And so I’m a big believer in the utilization of that as an instrument, and so if that becomes true and you see that it could be a proper hedge against hope securities or equities, the question is, could you see it be a 2% or 5% allocation? I was with a sovereign wealth fund during this week and that was the conversation. Should we have a 2% allocation? Should we have a 5% allocation? If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin.” IBIT is the largest Bitcoin ETF, with $47.89 billion worth of assets under management (AUM), according to data from Coinglass . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs for trading in July.

Daniel A. Acebo was hired by a New York bank – which hasn’t yet been named – as a business banker, according to local reports . One of his jobs was to tally up the cash in the bank’s vault at the end of each day, but according to a probable cause arrest affidavit, Acebo allegedly stole the money and concealed the theft by creating false reports and forging his supervisor’s signature. In what may have been an attempt to keep the theft undiscovered, Acebo reportedly requested an exception to a 1997 New York banking regulation that requires employees in sensitive positions to be absent from their duties for a minimum of two consecutive weeks each year. As stated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, “Such a requirement enhances the viability of a sound internal control environment because most frauds or embezzlements require the continual presence of the wrongdoer.” However, Acebo’s request was turned down by his employer. The incident happened in 2023, and while Acebo was on vacation in December of last year, another teller was counting the cash and discovered that only about $100,000 was in the vault, despite Acebo reporting that there was $1,145,050 inside. Video footage allegedly shows Acebo practicing his supervisor’s signature while at work. Other surveillance shows him slipping money into a backpack or in his sock while pretending to tie his shoe before leaving the bank. Between June 1st and December 17th of last year, Acebo allegedly made 135 cash deposits at various ATMs throughout the state totaling $600,000. Acebo was subsequently charged with embezzlement and misapplication by a bank officer in a U.S. District Court in White Plains, New York.

Crypto community members continue to anticipate an SEC Ripple settlement considering that the Commission has already dropped a number of high-profile crypto cases. XRP Lawsuit: Why The SEC and Ripple May Have Yet To Settle In an X post , while giving his take on the XRP lawsuit, MetaLawMan revealed his theory about the SEC’s “unexplained” delay in dismissing the Ripple case. The legal expert opined that the delay might not be from the SEC but Ripple, which could be negotiating hard to get the Commission to vacate some or all of Judge Analisa Torres’ decision. The lawyer further remarked that the Torres decision was “unquestionably” great for XRP holders. However, he added that the court’s finding of securities laws violations and the injunction are not so great for Ripple, which could explain why the crypto firm is trying hard to get the SEC to vacate Torres’ decision. Lawyer Fred Rispoli also recently commented on the delay in a SEC Ripple settlement in the XRP lawsuit. Unlike MetaLawMan, Rispoli suggested that the delay in the Ripple vs. SEC case is from the Commission as he opined that the acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce may not want to take responsibility for modifying the $125 million penalty against Ripple. Ripple May Be Negotiating Hard Because Of An IPO MetaLawMan remarked that his theory on a delay in settling the XRP lawsuit is plausible especially if Ripple is considering a future exempt securities offering or Initial Public Offering (IPO). He believes the SEC would have quickly accepted a settlement in which both sides withdrew their appeals and the crypto firm paid the $125 million penalty. This seems to be why he is convinced that Ripple is stalling and not the Commission, stating that it makes sense that the crypto firm could be negotiating for a better deal than that. The legal expert had previously predicted that the SEC Ripple case could take longer to resolve than other crypto cases because of the complexity of negotiating a resolution. He noted that the Ripple case is the only live crypto case with a final judgment in place. However, MetaLawMan predicted that the case would conclude before April 16, the deadline for Ripple to file its brief in the appeal.

Michelle Gill, general manager of PayPal’s small business group, said the goal of the stablecoin was to encourage merchants to invite their vendors into the network and promote faster transactions. “A lot of the payments we’re expecting”, wrote Gill, “are going to be cross-border because merchants in the US are seeking to pay vendors and suppliers abroad. The thesis was: Can we facilitate that on PYUSD rails so as not to have the currency conversion, the friction, as well as time”? Merchants currently face many fees and delays when buying from suppliers online. The fees mainly come from currency conversion, making the process of business cumbersome and expensive. PayPal’s stablecoin could solve this problem by providing a single token that merchants can use without the hassle of constantly exchanging currency. PayPal wants to expand PYUSD to include cross-blockchain functionality. Currently, the token is accessible on Cardano due to Wanchain’s cross-chain capabilities. Access to blockchains will allow PYUSD to be used to make digital payments online. PayPal wishes to expand upon this ability by removing more restrictions for merchants. In August 2023, PayPal launched PYUSD on the Ethereum blockchain. In May 2024, PayPal expanded its network to Solana to take advantage of faster speeds and lower transaction fees. PYUSD has already impacted the cryptocurrency space, having a market cap of $1 billion in December 2024. The stablecoin already has many applications. The boost in market cap is attributable to the 100 million users in the U.S. market, using services like PayPal and Venmo, but also including other applications, such as the fee-free cross-border payment app Xoom, adding further exposure to the stablecoin. PayPal further acquired Hyperwallet, specifically to target online payments. Clients can pay freelancers and contractors from across the globe using the stablecoin PYUSD to cut down on costs and red tape. Integrating a stablecoin into PayPal’s established business challenges the dominance of traditional banks. “We’ve been talking about blockchains for like a decade now”. Said Alex Chriss, President of PayPal. “The concept of these things never becomes real until you actually can start to spend it”. The financial services company Hyperwallet was acquired by PayPal for $400 million in 2018. PayPal expects to handle payouts in mid-2025 using the PYUSD token. Meanwhile, the Ripple stablecoin RLUSD boasts a $120 million supply and operates on Ethereum and Ripple networks. Due to the extra market exposure from PYUSD, the extra boost in stablecoins may affect the Bitcoin price in the short term, placing extra pressure on the cryptocurrency and boosting supply.",Cryptocurrency|News|PayPal|stablecoin,EN,0,0,PYUSD|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|USDT,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-01 19:53:25

While the altcoin initially succumbed to the downward pressure, the price of LTC has recovered to its former highs before the downturn. Thanks to its recent positive momentum and resilience, the Litecoin price is outperforming Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Now, the question is — how long can LTC keep this up against the Bitcoin price? LTCBTC Rises 25% In February In its latest post on the X platform, market intelligence firm Santiment shared that the price of Litecoin has been doing excellently against the Bitcoin price in recent weeks. According to the on-chain analytics firm, LTC is one of the few altcoins that has improved its price dominance against Bitcoin in February. Related Reading: Cardano Price Set For $8.11 ATH In 2025 With This Bullish Wave According to data from CoinGecko, the Litecoin price (LTC/BTC ratio) increased by more than 25% against the premier cryptocurrency in the past month. However, Santiment believes that the altcoin is at risk of a mild correction in the near future. This projection is based on the increasingly positive sentiment among Litecoin investors, especially over the past few days. Santiment revealed in its post on X a notable uptick in the number of active addresses on the Litecoin network over the past 24 hours. According to the market intelligence platform, the number of active LTC addresses crossed 445,000 for the first time since February 1, 2025. While this significant rise in addresses signals increased network participation, the increasing social media and online discussions around LTC is the more worrying trend. Santiment highlighted that the number of positive social media comments toward Litecoin is double that of negative comments for the first time since February 10. The overly bullish commentary spike can be bearish for the LTC/BTC ratio, signaling price exhaustion and investor fatigue in the short term. Moreover — from a historical perspective, prices tend to move in the opposite direction of the crypto crowd. Litecoin Price — What’s Next? As of this writing, the price of LTC stands at around $127, reflecting a 4.5% increase in the past 24 hours. The altcoin has nicely recovered after briefly falling below $110 in midweek, trimming its weekly losses to less than 1%.

According to popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the Litecoin price is currently within a consolidation range. However, the altcoin could be set for a run to the upside once it successfully breaks out and closes above $136 on the daily timeframe.

BNB Defies Volatility; Is DOGE A Good Investment?,https://thecoinrise.com/save-the-date-blockdags-keynote-3-drops-on-march-28-bnb-defies-volatility-is-doge-a-good-investment/,"Crypto traders are closely watching discussions surrounding Binance Coin’s (BNB) market resilience in the current volatile market. It’s got a track record of outperforming in downturns, making it a go-to for traders looking for stability. Dogecoin’s investment potential has also sparked fresh discussions, as some bet on another wild comeback, while others question if the meme magic can last. At the same time, the BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining momentum as a top trending crypto ahead of its Keynote 3, which drops on March 28th. Having raised over $199.5 million and shown early buyers a 2,380% ROI, traders are securing BDAG before the keynote reveals big updates and demand for the coin grows higher. Plus, with the BDAG800 bonus code dishing out a 400% boost on coin purchases, those looking to load up before the next phase are making their moves now. BNB Market Resilience: Surviving Volatile Swings Binance Coins (BNB) market resilience is drawing interest after the coin once again found support near $586. Some recall that BNB’s market resilience helped it outpace Bitcoin and Ethereum during previous downturns, reassuring those who look for steady assets in a shaky environment. The Binance Coin’s market resilience was especially clear in 2021–2022, when it recovered faster than most major cryptocurrencies, even after a 73.3% drawdown. Recent data shows BNB attempting to stay above $600, with a slight decline of 3.5% over 24 hours. Analysts point to on-chain metrics and the coin’s supportive community as key factors in BNB’s market resilience. A successful defense of the $565 level might set the stage for a rebound toward $647 or $685. Dogecoin Investment Potential: Another Rally In Store? Many traders are revisiting Dogecoin’s (DOGE) investment potential, especially as DOGE hovers below $0.30 after dropping from a high near $0.47. Some point to the coin’s massive 285,000% surge from its all-time low, fueling discussions that the DOGE’s investment potential exists if market sentiment shifts. Dips triggered by exchange hacks have not shaken all investors, who cite past rallies as evidence of possible recovery. Others remain cautious, reminding the market that earlier success does not ensure similar gains ahead. Despite differing views, Dogecoin investment potential appeals to those who think new endorsements or developments might reignite demand. For now, many watch regulatory changes and broader market trends, hoping to see whether DOGE can mount a significant comeback. Traders Buying Up BlockDAG Coins Ahead of Keynote 3 Crypto followers have circled March 28th on their calendars as BlockDAG prepares for its Keynote 3 launch. Speculation grows over a Hollywood-level production that might exceed all previous events, sparking curiosity among BlockDAG community members and crypto traders. Many anticipate a detailed roadmap outlining fresh partnerships, major tech upgrades, and maybe even a mainnet launch tease. If history is any indicator, past keynotes have fueled serious presale momentum, boosting confidence in BDAG’s commitment to hitting milestones on time—and keeping things transparent.. BDAG is showing strong demand currently in batch 27, pulling in over $199.5 million and 18.6 billion coins sold. The coin price currently stands at $0.0248, offering early participants an approximate 2,380% return to date. The hype surrounding the keynote has put BDAG among the top trending cryptos , especially if the project drops details about the mainnet launch and global exchange listings. The limited-time BDAG800 bonus code also gives traders an additional advantage, offering a 400% bonus on their BDAG coin purchases. If previous BlockDAG announcements are anything to go by, we could be looking at another major price surge. Smart money is already getting ahead of the curve—grabbing the bonus, stacking up on BDAG, and gearing up for what could be another massive run. Where Do Traders Go Next? Enthusiasts who are tracking BNB market resilience and Dogecoin investment potential are discussing how each coin might shape their strategies in the coming months. Some see BNB’s steady track record as a way to balance risk, while Dogecoin’s unpredictable swings lure those who favor higher stakes. Meanwhile, BDAG’s upcoming Keynote 3 is rumored to be a full-scale Hollywood-level production, possibly revealing huge ecosystem updates that could propel its presale totals even further. As the project prepares to drop the Keynote 3 on March 28, many are recalling how past BlockDAG events led to big demand spikes. BDAG’s presale has surpassed $199.5 million, reflecting increased confidence in its potential. The extra perk of a 400% bonus code gives traders a chance to accumulate more coins before any major announcements in the keynote.

The news follows Tuesday’s announcement of Aya Miyaguchi leaving that role to become the EF’s new president. The leadership shake-up follows intense debate among the community about the EF’s role in the ecosystem, as some have blamed the organization and its leadership for the blockchain’s token ether (ETH) price lagging behind other cryptocurrencies, while the blockchain attracted for the first time less new developers than its competitor Solana. Wang has been at the EF since 2017, where she helped do research on concepts like shardin g, as well as contributed to Ethereum’s major overhaul known as “the Merge.” Stańczak founded Nerthermind, one of the largest software or clients that operate the Ethereum blockchain. “Over the next few years, the Ethereum ecosystem needs to navigate the challenging transition from being an early-stage project serving a small number of enthusiasts to being a robust permissionless censorship-resistant base layer of the global finance and software stack,” the Foundation said in their blog post. More shuffling In addition to Wang and Stańczak assuming their new roles, ex-EF researcher Danny Ryan shared that he would be joining Etherealize, the new project aimed at bringing ETH to Wall Street. The firm was founded by former banker Vivek Raman, who shared previously with CoinDesk that one of the goals of Etherealize is to bridge the gap between Ethereum and the banks by educating institutions and marketing ETH as a serious crypto asset. In a post shared on X, Ryan said that he intends “to build a new Ethereum institution with Real World Ethereum as its north star.” “The world is ready to come on-chain, and we’re here to do the hard work necessary to make it happen,” Ryan added.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Despite market struggles, Lightchain AI thrives, raising $16.8m in presale, thanks to its strong fundamentals and AI-driven solutions. While the broader cryptocurrency market struggles to find its footing, Lightchain AI stands out by continuing to grow. The project recently raised $16.8 million in its presale, demonstrating investor confidence even as the market faces tough conditions. Although many cryptocurrencies are grappling with challenges such as regulatory uncertainty, declining liquidity, and slow adoption, projects with strong fundamentals and real-world applications are holding their ground. Lightchain AI’s unique AI-driven blockchain solutions have positioned it as a top choice for investors in 2024. You might also like: Is Lightchain AI the next big cryptocurrency? $16.8m raised in presale Why many cryptos are struggling to recover As of February 24, 2025, the crypto market continues to face difficulties. Several factors have contributed to its slow recovery. For one, recent inflation data exceeded expectations, with a 0.5% monthly increase and a 3% rise year-over-year. This has sparked concerns that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates, which makes traditional assets like U.S. Treasuries more attractive to investors, diverting funds away from crypto. In addition, China’s new AI model, DeepSeek, has heightened competition in the tech sector, prompting investors to rethink their positions in technology-focused assets, including cryptocurrencies. Despite the launch of Bitcoin ETFs and a pro-crypto U.S. administration, market volatility persists, with Bitcoin struggling to maintain levels above $100,000. These macroeconomic and geopolitical factors have made it harder for the crypto market to recover fully. What sets Lightchain AI apart from struggling cryptos While other crypto projects falter, Lightchain AI continues to thrive, thanks to its unique approach to real-time network efficiency. This solution allows its blockchain to self-optimize based on transaction demand, ensuring low transaction fees, fast speeds, and scalability even in uncertain times. Another key differentiator for Lightchain AI is its secure federated learning system, which enables participants to collaboratively train AI models while safeguarding data privacy. This is especially important for industries that prioritize security and confidentiality. By combining cutting-edge technology with strong security features, Lightchain AI is setting a new standard for blockchain performance. Its ability to adapt to market conditions has made it a beacon of success in a rapidly evolving space. Can Lightchain AI continue its growth in 2025 and beyond? Despite the ongoing challenges in the broader crypto market, Lightchain AI appears well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory. With a well-defined roadmap and several key milestones planned for 2025, including expanded partnerships and the launch of more AI-driven solutions, the future looks bright for the project. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s research and development team is consistently innovating to improve scalability, security, and efficiency. This commitment to continuous improvement has attracted significant investor interest, as evidenced by the recent presale success, which raised $16.8 million. In conclusion, Lightchain AI’s strong fundamentals, cutting-edge technology, and ability to adapt to market conditions make it one of the most promising projects in the blockchain and AI space today. Even as the broader market faces difficulties, Lightchain AI’s potential to continue growing and attracting investors remains high.

The suit charged Heart with raising over $1 billion through unregistered cryptocurrency offerings and the theft of $12.1 million for the purchase of luxuries, including the world’s largest black diamond. Lack of US Jurisdiction Judge Carol Bagley Amon ruled that the SEC failed to demonstrate US jurisdiction over Heart’s alleged deceptive conduct. In Amon’s Feb . 28 ruling, the transactions were alleged to have been conducted globally and were not specifically targeted at US investors. “The alleged misappropriation occurred through crypto asset platforms and digital wallets, none of which were alleged to have any connection to the United States,” Amon stated. The judge further stated that even if Heart had employed fraudulent mixer transactions to steal funds, such actions were conducted beyond US borders. Crypto Prices Soar After Ruling After the court ruling, Heart’s related tokens saw dramatic price surges: HEX (HEX): 78% up PulseChain (PLS): 36% up PulseX (PLSX): 67% up Heart welcomed the ruling on X (formerly Twitter), pointing out that “HEX has run without a hitch for over five years” and terming the judgment as a “welcome relief” for the cryptocurrency industry. SEC May Re-file Complaint by March 20 Though the court has rejected the action, Amon stated that the SEC can re-state the complaint by surmounting the deficient areas within 20 days with March 20 being the date. Heart’s Spending Spree Under Attack The SEC claimed Heart used investor funds to make expensive purchases like: “The Enigma” black diamond (555 carats) – $3.97 million McLaren and Ferrari sports cars Four Rolex watches – $3.02 million (purchased between Aug. 3, 2021, and Sept. 2022) Legal woes continue to pursue Heart While the SEC case was dropped, Heart has other court cases in Finland. He was arrested by Finnish authorities on Sept. 13, 2024, on tax fraud and assault charges. He remains missing, with Interpol putting out a Red Notice for his arrest on Dec. 22. Finnish authorities have managed to seize $2.6 million worth of watches suspected to have been abandoned by Heart. Heart Remains Active Online Despite ongoing legal troubles, Heart still promotes his cryptos and speaks with fans via social media, openly tweeting on X and posting videos on YouTube.

Then people apply the big fool theory and it’s like musical chairs, the last person sitting down loses,” Musk said, noting the unpredictable and often volatile nature of memecoins. Musk’s words reflect growing concerns about the sustainability of such assets, which often experience sharp rises followed by sharp declines. Related News: Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) Proposes Changes That Could Deeply Impact Altcoins Despite his skepticism, Musk has acknowledged the fundamentals of Dogecoin, a project he once openly supported. He pointed to the project’s playful origins, saying it was “like a joke coin with jokes and dogs.” But his recent statements signal a shift in tone, urging investors to exercise caution rather than blind enthusiasm. Podcast host Joe Rogan echoed Musk’s concerns, calling the memecoin craze “crazy.” He questioned the logic behind pouring real money into highly speculative assets, especially when the crypto market is facing increasing turbulence. The recent collapse of several Solana-based memecoins, including the much-talked-about Libra memecoin, has heightened concerns and contributed to a broader market correction. Analysts suggest investors are starting to get frustrated, and many are starting to realize the undue influence that insiders have on market dynamics. *This is not investment advice.

Table of Contents Become a pioneer with RBLK and discover its bullish potential Sentiment shifts for Shiba Inu overnight though caution should remain Memes suffer across the board as Dogecoin tumbles In February Get in before Rollblock’s expansion takes off The cryptocurrency market is at a pivotal moment in 2025, with meme coins such as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin facing increased uncertainty following recent price troubles. As investors navigate their next move during the bull run, opportunities in other more unexplored hype-based sectors are beginning to stand out. One such opportunity is Rollblock, which is making waves in blockchain gaming with its expanding user base and commitment to secure and transparent gameplay. With the GameFi sector projected to rebound in 2025, Rollblock is positioning itself as a leading force in the next wave of blockchain entertainment. Here’s the scoop on RBLK’s bullish potential. You might also like: Solana in consolidation as analysts expect Rollblock to make great returns Become a pioneer with RBLK and discover its bullish potential Rollblock is changing the iGaming industry with its unique play-to-earn platform, seamlessly merging blockchain technology with traditional gaming. Secured by a SolidProof audit and an Anjouan Gaming license, the platform prioritizes security and transparency, positioning itself for exponential growth as the crypto-gaming sector gains momentum in 2025. With a vast selection of over 7,000 games, Rollblock caters to a broad audience, including traditional games and unique blockchain games seldom seen elsewhere. The introduction of sports betting has further expanded the platform’s appeal, transforming Rollblock into a comprehensive entertainment hub. Designed for long-term sustainability, Rollblock’s tokenomics model directs up to 30% of platform revenue toward RBLK buybacks. Of these, 60% are permanently burned to reduce supply, while 40% are allocated to staking rewards, reinforcing token value and ensuring investor participation. In addition to this, by integrating both play-to-earn and hold-to-earn mechanics, Rollblock fosters a continuously expanding ecosystem. The project has already attracted a rapidly growing community, with over 50,000 members and $10.7 million raised during its presale, positioning itself as a leading force in the blockchain gaming revolution poised to rally and 100x akin to 2021’s gaming surge. Sentiment shifts for Shiba Inu overnight though caution should remain Shiba Inu has faced sustained sell pressure as memes continue to struggle overall. Despite a 531% surge in its burn rate, Shiba Inu’s massive 589 trillion circulating supply remains a major challenge for price growth. However, recent market action has shown signs of recovery, with Shiba Inu surging 11% in the last 24 hours to reclaim levels above $0.000014. Whale transactions have increased by over 300% since the start of the week, indicating growing accumulation as Ethereum-based assets rebound. Additionally, on-chain data shows a sharp rise in large transactions, which often signals the beginning of a sustained uptrend. If accumulation continues in an optimistic scenario, Shiba Inu could challenge resistance at $0.000015, with a potential breakout toward $0.000017. With Shiba Inu inflows skyrocketing 206%, sentiment around Shiba Inu appears to be improving quickly. However, investor caution must be upheld, as another Bitcoin crash could see speculative assets such as Shiba Inu suddenly plummet with little warning. Memes suffer across the board as Dogecoin tumbles In February Dogecoin has erased nearly all of its post-election gains, dropping over 59% from its December peak of $0.48 and currently trading near $0.21. The meme coin market has been hit hard, with Dogecoin losing 19% in the past week alone, ranking among the biggest mainstream losers alongside Solana. Despite the decline, Dogecoin remains the leading meme coin, benefiting from speculation about its potential role in Elon Musk’s blockchain-based financial systems. Institutional interest is also growing, with Bitwise filing for a Dogecoin ETF, which if approved, could hearken in significant capital inflows. With Dogecoin now trading near long-term demand levels, the next few days will be crucial in determining whether bulls can regain control or if further selling pressure will push it deeper into correction territory. If Dogecoin can reclaim the $0.24 resistance level, a relief rally may be in sight. However, failure to hold above $0.21 could open the door for extended downside, making this a critical moment for Dogecoin’s price action. Get in before Rollblock’s expansion takes off Currently available for $0.06 in its tenth presale round, RBLK offers a prime entry into the surging blockchain iGaming sector. Analysts predict a potential 100x surge, making this a standout investment for those seeking high-upside opportunities. Get in early before Rollblock’s rapid expansion takes off!

From Pepe and Doge to Floki and Shiba Inu, the crypto jungle has been a never-ending battle of who can meme harder and moon faster. But if you think the best plays are behind you, hold onto your crypto wallets because one of the top meme coin presales to buy now could change the entire game! With a high-reward P2E game and a presale that’s already amassed over $6.21 million, BTFD Coin is catching fire. Oh, and here’s the kicker: Every $BTFD you buy in Stage 14 is DOUBLED when you use the LAUNCH100 bonus code! More tokens, more gains, and more reasons to join the Bulls. Keep reading to explore how BTFD Coin is shaking up the meme coin world and why Floki and Shiba Inu are still flexing their influence. BTFD Coin: P2E Game Rewards That Could 36X Your Gains BTFD Coin is making waves not just for its explosive presale but for its Play-to-Earn (P2E) ecosystem that lets gamers rack up $BTFD tokens like it’s free money. Imagine this: You’re grinding levels, smashing through challenges, and each win stacks your bag even higher. Unlike traditional gaming where rewards are just digital dust, here, your in-game earnings can be converted into real tokens, tradable on exchanges post-launch. What’s more, experts are eyeing a massive price jump once BTFD Coin lands on exchanges, with projections hitting $0.0006 initially and a potential moonshot of $0.006. That’s a 3650% ROI if you jump in at the current price of $0.00016. With only two more presale stages left, now’s the best time to get in before the window slams shut. Beyond its P2E goldmine, BTFD Coin boasts high-APY staking , an ultra-engaged community known as the Bulls Squad, and a meme-driven roadmap designed for virality. Plus, with the LAUNCH100 bonus code, your investment is effectively doubled, setting you up for bigger plays when this gem hits exchanges: Begin your road to 2X tokens by heading over to the presale page . Connect Your Wallet – Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Enter the Bonus Code – Locate the bonus code field, enter LAUNCH100, click “Apply,” and confirm the message with your wallet. Enter Purchase Details – Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy. Confirm and Buy – Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Floki Inu: The Viking Dog That Won’t Back Down Floki Inu has built a name as one of the most aggressive meme coins in terms of utility expansion. What started as a Dogecoin spin-off is now a multi-faceted ecosystem featuring DeFi products, NFT marketplaces, and its own Metaverse game, Valhalla. The token has managed to stay relevant by constantly innovating. It even has FlokiFi, a DeFi platform designed for staking and lending, proving that this Viking pup is far from just another meme. Recent partnerships and exchange listings have also helped Floki maintain a stronghold in the meme coin space. While it’s already seen massive growth, Floki Inu’s continued expansion into gaming and DeFi suggests there’s still room for upward movement. Investors looking for meme coins that deliver both fun and function might find this Norse-themed powerhouse an attractive long-term hold. Shiba Inu: The OG Meme Coin Titan Still Flexing Shiba Inu’s rise to dominance was nothing short of legendary. Initially dubbed the “Doge Killer,” SHIB quickly built its own empire with ShibaSwap, Shibarium Layer-2, and a metaverse project that aims to integrate Web3 gaming and real-world utility. Even after its initial hype wave, Shiba Inu remains a top-tier meme coin with a dedicated army of holders (SHIBArmy), strategic token burns, and continued ecosystem growth. The team’s focus on building rather than relying solely on meme hype is what keeps SHIB in the conversation when it comes to the top meme coins to buy now. With Shibarium now rolling out cheaper, faster transactions, SHIB is proving that it’s more than just a viral token—it’s a real contender in the crypto space. Conclusion: Why BTFD Coin’s P2E Model Stands Out While Floki and Shiba Inu continue to dominate, BTFD Coin is bringing something new to the table with its high-reward P2E ecosystem, an exclusive staking model, and a red-hot presale that’s already sold over 70 billion tokens. The real kicker? That LAUNCH100 bonus code is still doubling every Stage 14 purchase. Meme coin markets are unpredictable, but those who strike early often see the biggest gains. BTFD Coin is on the verge of major exchange listings, and once it crosses the launchpad, those who waited will wish they hadn’t. Buy now, double up, and ride the Bulls to the moon!

This event marks a major step in shaping the future of digital assets in the United States. As reported by Coindesk, the summit will bring together top industry leaders, investors, and policymakers to discuss the role of cryptocurrency in the nation’s economy. Donald Trump: A Shift in Crypto Policy David Sacks, the White House Crypto and AI Czar, and Bo Hines, the executive director of a working group on digital assets, will lead the event. President Trump will speak at the event to reinforce his support for crypto innovation in the U.S. A press release on Friday confirmed that the summit will discuss regulation, financial growth, and technological advancements. During a press conference on February 4, Sacks emphasized the importance of retaining financial innovation within the country. He stated that financial assets are destined to become digital, just as every analog industry has. The White House wants to create value in the United States rather than give it to other countries. This shift signals a departure from previous regulatory policies that many believe hindered the growth of the digital asset industry. U.S. SEC Crypto Crackdown Eases The news comes at an important time for the crypto industry. Earlier today, a judge approved the SEC’s request to drop its case against Coinbase. The agency had earlier said that it planned to end the lawsuit . Additionally, industry leaders such as Joe Lubin, CEO of Ethereum incubator ConsenSys, and Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, reported that the SEC had ended its investigations into their companies. The SEC has also paused its case against the Tron Foundation, its founder, Justin Sun, and Consensys. In addition, it has ended lawsuits and investigations into other major crypto companies like OpenSea Coinbase, Robinhood, and Uniswap Labs. These developments show that the current government’s view on crypto rules is changing for good. A Fresh Start for Digital Asset Firms Many believe President Trump’s administration’s approach represents a new chapter for digital finance. In a statement, the White House said that the last administration treated the digital asset industry unfairly. However, President Donald Trump’s plans mark a new beginning for digital finance. His administration is focused on creating clear rules, supporting innovation, and protecting economic freedom. With the upcoming summit, the U.S. is poised to lead the global digital economy.

BTC was trading at $85,372 at press time, marking a 7.41% gain over the past 24 hours. On the other hand, Ethereum (ETH) climbed 6.61% to $2,231.66, while XRP surged 9.2% to $2.18. The broader market followed suit, lifting total cryptocurrency market capitalization by 6.31% to $2.83 trillion. Notably, the surprise rally comes in the wake of a landmark announcement from the White House. On Friday, David Sacks, the White House AI and Crypto Czar, confirmed that President Donald Trump will host the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on March 7. According to an official White House letter, the summit will advance President Trump’s campaign pledge to revamp the cryptocurrency sector. “ Previously, President Trump pledged to be America’s ‘first crypto president,’ and in his week-one Executive Order 14178, he declared that ‘the policy of my Administration [is] to support the responsible growth and use of digital assets … across all sectors of the economy,’ ” the letter stated The White House further emphasized that Trump’s administration aims to establish a regulatory framework that fosters innovation while ensuring economic freedom. The letter also criticized the previous administration’s “unfair prosecution” of the digital asset industry, positioning Trump’s approach as a new era for financial technology. Notably, the summit will convene top industry leaders, including founders, CEOs, and investors, alongside members of the President’s Digital Asset Task Force. Moderated by Sacks, discussions will center on regulatory clarity, market oversight, and the role of government in shaping the crypto economy. Adding to the bullish momentum, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is later set to launch a five-part roundtable series named “Spring Sprint Towards Crypto Clarity” to clarify cryptocurrency regulations. The first session, scheduled for March 21, will explore the theme “Defining the Security State,” according to sources who talked to FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett. Regulatory tensions further eased this week as the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase , following a similar move with Binance. The agency also closed its investigation into Gemini without pursuing enforcement action. In another significant shift, the SEC announced that meme coins will be classified as collectibles rather than securities, effectively removing them from its regulatory scope. Beyond regulation, speculation is mounting over a potential U.S. government Bitcoin reserve. While no formal announcement has been made, discussions about Bitcoin’s strategic role in financial markets have fueled renewed institutional interest in the asset.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-01 20:22:06

With bold storytelling, rewarding incentives, and massive profit potential, Catzilla is primed to challenge the old order and dominate the market. SOL, ADA: Poised for a major comeback? Despite recent volatility, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are showing signs of resilience, with experts forecasting a potential rebound this year. Both altcoins have established themselves as leading smart contract platforms, attracting developers, institutions, and investors who see long-term value in their ecosystems. Solana Solana has maintained its reputation as one of the fastest blockchain networks, securing partnerships with major projects in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. With increased institutional adoption and improvements in network reliability, SOL could reclaim its previous highs, with some analysts predicting a surge back to the $200-$250 range by the end of 2025. Cardano Cardano’s transition to full on-chain governance through its recent Plutus upgrade enhances decentralization, making ADA an even more attractive choice for blockchain innovation. With potential ETF approval, new DeFi integrations, and growing adoption in enterprise blockchain solutions, ADA could break out from its current lows. Analysts project ADA could trade between $1.50-$2.50 in a bullish market scenario. Conclusion While SOL and ADA may have limited short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as a promising meme coin aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With a presale offering up to 700% returns, starting from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages, it provides governance features, rewards for loyalty, and staking options for passive growth.

This unexpected decline in Litecoin’s capital inflow has led the LTC token into a period of price volatility. LTC jumped 37.8% from $102.09 to $140.62 just seventeen days into January 2025, but LTC’s price dipped by 4.33% to $134.54 on January 31.

The proposal, submitted by asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, seeks to bring options trading for Ethereum ETFs. A number of exchanges are affected by the postponement, among them the Cboe Exchange, which had applied to list options for Ethereum ETFs such as the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF and the Bitwise Ethereum ETF. As a reaction, the SEC created a new timeline in May 2025 following an extension of the review process. Changing Regulatory Negotiations The postponement occurs at the time of negotiation for potential modifications to regulations around cryptocurrencies following the reelection of President Donald Trump. Regulation of cryptocurrencies remains complicated, and the SEC demands thorough thinking before the approval of new products. SEC Requests Public Input on ETH ETF Options Trading In the latter part of last month, an SEC filing found that the agency seeks public input on a proposal to amend a rule allowing options trading in Bitwise, iShares, and Grayscale ETH spot ETFs. The Cboe Exchange stated in its filing: “The Ethereum Funds are nearly identical to the Bitcoin Funds, the only difference being that such funds invest in Bitcoin (a different cryptocurrency) rather than Ethereum, which trade on the Exchange.” The largest two are the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), which together maintain billions of dollars of assets. Trump Jr. Calls for Crypto Regulations at ETHDenver On Wednesday, Donald Trump Jr. spoke at DeFi World in Denver, advocating for a regulatory environment that defines crypto and DeFi regulations while allowing businesses to operate safely in the U.S. He reiterated the need for policies that promote asset repatriation to the U.S. and faulted past administrations for suppressing innovation with overly restrictive regulations. Trump Jr. had hoped the administration would be able to implement well-crafted regulations founded on advice from both the mainstream finance professionals and DeFi, resulting in industry growth and attracting global talent. Rethinking Risk in the Digital Arena While the SEC delays consideration of Ether ETF alternatives, the new landscape of regulation invites further contemplation of risk in digital finance. This delay gives investors a chance to analyze how new policy directives might redefine market dynamics and influence strategic choices. Rather than surrendering to uncertainty, use this as a time to refine your knowledge and strategy for market threats. Check your portfolio’s strength and reflect on adjustments that would better align regulatory moves in progress.

In a series of posts on X, EF updated the community on a shift from the previous order of a sole Executive Director to a co-executive Director. The New Ethereum Foundation Directors According to the announcement , Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Stańczak have been appointed to serve as co-Executive Directors effective March 17th. Their appointment marks a strategic shift in leadership structure and a move to support Ethereum’s growing ecosystem. On Monday, March 17, the duo will assume the role of former sole Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi. Interestingly, Miyaguchi has been elevated to serve in a new capacity. The former ED now serves as the president of the Ethereum Foundation. Until Wang’s appointment as co-Executive Director, she has contributed to community building in Taiwan, as well as to the beacon chain. However, Wang is most renowned for her seven years of research experience at the Foundation. In an acceptance post, Wang expressed excitement at the opportunity to serve in the new role. She acknowledged that different people have different perspectives on EF, which would not affect the organization’s core values. Wang maintained EF would continue to evolve along with Ethereum while upholding its core values. Wang’s co-Executive Director, Stańczak, is Nethermind’s founder. He is expected to provide technical expertise and growth to the Ethereum ecosystem. Stańczak’s expertise borders on technical leadership, talent development, and organizational growth. This makes him a strong addition to EF’s leadership. EF and Further Operational Management Reshuffle Before the new EDs were appointed, Buterin had a high autonomy over the direction of the chain. While industry figures like Charles Hoskinson criticized this autonomy , the appointment is a major change in course. With this development, the Ethereum Foundation’s leadership structure now has two Executive Directors and a president. The former Executive Director, Aya Miyaguchi, has been elevated to serve as president. Miyaguchi served as Executive Director for seven years before this new promotion. Interestingly, many in the Ethereum community had criticized Miyaguchi’s leadership style, believing she lacked competitiveness. Meanwhile, in an informal poll, the community overwhelmingly supported Danny Ryan, a former researcher with EF. Ryan received 99% of the support from the community. However, the new leadership structure has Ryan as co-founder of Etherealize, a new institutional marketing and product division. He is to collaborate with Vivek Raman as co-founder of Etherealize. Vitalik Buterin has formally congratulated all the newly appointed leaders. Since Buterin teased leadership changes were underway, the community had expected who the new appointees would be. A New Trajectory for Ethereum The crypto ecosystem has always been particularly concerned with leadership structure. This is critical to the ecosystem’s development trajectory and the frequency of upgrades on the blockchain. Hence, Ethereum’s new leadership structure might set the ecosystem on a new trajectory that could transform it. With the Pectra upgrade underway, the leaders have an immediate innovation to oversee.

A new update on the T-Mobile Data Breach Settlement website says payments will begin in April. The 2021 breach affected about 76 million people, exposing sensitive information like names, Social Security numbers and birth dates. Those who faced out-of-pocket losses could claim up to $25,000, while others may receive $25 – or $100 for Californians – with no additional steps required for eligible class members. The data breach was executed by John Binns, an American hacker based in Turkey who exploited a misconfigured internet-exposed router to access the company’s internal network. Over weeks starting in early 2021, he used brute force attacks and specialized tools to breach the company’s servers. The payments are the result of a class action lawsuit that T-Mobile decided to settle rather than fight in court. People who used T-mobile in 2021 can reach out to the administrator on the settlement’s website or call 1-833-512-2314.

This surge comes amid significant market turbulence and critical commentary from prominent figures in the cryptocurrency space. XRP Price Rebounds 14% Despite Intense Market FUD In the face of prevailing market fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), XRP investors have shown steadfast commitment, preventing a close below the crucial $2 support level. On February 28, Ripple price dipped to a new 2025 low of $1.95. However, bullish investors swiftly intervened, propelling the price back to $2.17 at press time—a commendable 14% recovery. XRP Price Analysis This resilience is particularly noteworthy given the broader market downturn and negative sentiment surrounding Ripple. The swift rebound underscores investor confidence in XRP’s long-term potential, even when faced with external criticism and market challenges. Ripple CEO Advocates for Diversity US Strategic Crypto Reserve As discussions around US Bitcoin strategic reserves rages, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has weighed in, emphasizing the importance of diversification and “maximalism”, hinting that the goverment should not adopt Bitcoin alone. “If a govt digital asset reserve is created—I believe it should be representative of the industry, not just one token (whether it be BTC, XRP, or anything else).” – Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Garlinghouse’s perspective highlights the need for a balanced approach to digital asset reserves, reflecting the diverse and multifaceted nature of the cryptocurrency industry. This viewpoint advocates for inclusivity, with potential of to enjoy upsides from each of the various digital assets’ unique value propositions. Bitcoin Enthusiast Labels Ripple a ‘Fundamental Crypto Scam’ Contrasting Garlinghouse’s inclusive stance, prominent Bitcoin supporter Tuur Demeester expressed a starkly opposing view. Responding to Garlinghouse’s comments, Demeester declared, “Crypto scams like Ripple fundamentally undermine rule of law in this country. You bet that bitcoin is an enemy of ‘crypto’—just like gold is an enemy of fool’s gold.” Demeester’s critique reflects a broader skepticism among some Bitcoin purists regarding Ripple’s legitimacy and its alignment with the foundational principles of cryptocurrency. This sentiment highlights the ideological divides within the crypto community, particularly between Bitcoin maximalists and those supporting more centralized and efficient projects like XRP. Why Is XRP Price Going Up? Despite the negative sentiments and market FUD, XRP’s price has managed a notable rebound. Several factors may be contributing to this upward movement: XRP Social Dominance Increased Social Dominance: On-chain data indicates a surge in XRP’s social media mentions. Santiment’s Social Dominance metric shows XRP’s share of cryptocurrency discussions rising to 5% on February 28, signaling heightened investor interest and engagement. Speculations Surrounding Altcoin ETFs: Positive speculations about the approval of altcoin ETFs, including those potentially involving XRP, have fueled investor optimism. The anticipation of increased institutional investment through ETFs may be driving demand for XRP. Resilient Investor Base: The swift recovery from the recent price dip suggests a strong and committed investor base that views lower prices as buying opportunities, thereby providing support against further downside risks in the week ahead. While external criticisms and ideological debates continue, XRP’s price action reflects a market driven by investor sentiment, technological developments, and regulatory considerations. The interplay of these factors will likely influence XRP’s trajectory in the coming months. XRP’s recent 13% price rebound amidst market FUD and external criticism showcases the asset’s resilience and the community’s confidence in its long-term prospects. As discussions about digital asset reserves and ETF approvals progress, XRP remains one of the most in-demand crypto assets. XRP Price Forecast: Bulls setting up for consolidation above $2 XRP has shown resilience after testing lows near $1.95, now trading at $2.1668. The price action exhibits a potential double bottom pattern, suggesting a possible reversal if buyers maintain momentum. The Keltner Channel (KC) bands indicate a struggle near the mid-line resistance at $2.4408, with a successful breach potentially paving the way for a move toward the upper band at $2.8212. XRP Price Forecast However, failure to sustain above the lower KC boundary at $2.0604 could invite further downside pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 34.00, approaching oversold conditions, hinting at a possible relief rally. Yet, the RSI remains below its signal line (43.05), reinforcing short-term bearish momentum. Volume analysis reveals a notable spike, suggesting active participation from traders. If bullish momentum strengthens, XRP may consolidate above $2.20 before challenging key resistances. However, rejection at immediate resistance could see another dip toward $2.00, where liquidity pockets may determine the next direction.

PEPE, which lost 30% over the last month and trades at $0.0000737, is hovering around its significant support levels while technical indicators point towards a reversal. Concurrently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its second presale stage at $0.015 and has collected $1.85 million in backing from 3,550 holders. Both tokens are reported by analysts to have potential for tapping millionaire-making opportunities, but both embark upon sharply divergent paths of risk and reward. Pepe (PEPE): Volatility and Opportunity Pepe’s recent downtrend stands in contrast to its 500% year-to-date record, creating a paradox of optimism and caution. The token hovers between $0.0000700, a level of support which will determine its short-term destiny. A breach of resistance at $0.0000891 can revive the bull run, maybe repeating its past rallies. However, PEPE’s sensitivity to sentiment and meme-based hype brings in volatility, and therefore it is a high-risk gamble and not a systematic investment. Technical indicators like the oversold RSI of 29.89 and declining bearish MACD suggest that a rebound can occur, though its sustainability is questionable without fundamental usage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Strategic Presale Gains Following its success in the presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is raising its price to $0.02 for the subsequent round by 33.3%. Its early bird who purchases it today at $0.015 has a wait 400% reward before it reaches exchanges at $0.06. In addition to presale profits, project tokenomics also have a buy-and-disperse process that reinvests platform revenue into repeated MUTM buys. This aligns with PEPE’s hypothesis, wherein it rewards and expects the holders to wait with a self-enforcing cycle. For $0.015, $2,500 in MUTM receives 166,666 tokens. That’s $10,000 at the previous price of $0.06. Terminal valuations of $8 per token—a value tied to estimates of utilization projections—would place the same stake at $1.33 million. Such appreciation would be accompanied by real-world utility of Mutuum Finance: decentralized lending, mtToken accrued interest, and overcollateralized loans decrease default risk and incremental ecosystem growth. In contrast, PEPE’s relative second-class status in underlying usefulness subjects millionaire potential to mere boom-and-bust marketplace volatility and demands perfect timing and greater risk appetite. The project token allocation and presale are both positioned for long-term growth. Incentives for activity include liquidity mining rewards, mtToken flexibility, and an early contributor airdrop valued at $100,000. Over 3,550 holders have locked tokens already, and phase one sold out almost immediately. Phase two’s $0.015 price range is temporary before going higher, so it encourages speedy action not to miss the entry at the bottom. Last Chance for Strategic Entry Pepe’s technical value in rebounding is short-term excitement, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides an engineered pathway to life-altering wealth. Its phase two presale is concluding, then the subsequent price run-up leaves the stragglers behind. With analysts estimating a run-up of more than $8 upon launch and with sustained demand mechanisms built in, MUTM is beyond meme coin volatility. The millionaire-maker difference is the difference between short-term hype and engineered growth. Investors wishing to enter at MUTM’s all-time low are running out of time. Go to Mutuum Finance’s official website to buy tokens before phase two ends and the prices go up. In the cryptocurrency market, luck is on the side of the bold—don’t let this window shut without you.

MetaMask announced this week that Solana would be added in May, which represents the wallet’s first native non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support. The project plans to add Bitcoin compatibility sometime in Q3. SOL defied a wavering crypto market on Friday and surged by 7.5%. The sixth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $147.49 at time of writing. MetaMask announced the new features amid a swelling user base. In a statement issued in February, the wallet’s developer Consensys said that the project’s monthly active users (MAU) rose from 19 million to more than 30 million between September 2023 and January 2024. That’s an increase of over 55%. The number of monthly active users nearly matches MetaMask’s historical high of 31.7 million recorded in January 2022. The wallet also recently inked a partnership with retail trading giant Robinhood that enables MetaMask users to purchase crypto assets directly within the wallet using Robinhood’s order engine. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also recently agreed to drop its lawsuit against Consensys after suing the blockchain software firm over MetaMask last year.

However, as market dynamics evolve, a new meme coin presale token, FloppyPepe (FPPE) , is emerging as a serious competitor. With its outstanding growing potential, could this meme coin presale surpass Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the next bull run? FloppyPepe (FPPE): The AI-Driven Meme Coin Set To Dominate The Next Bull Run While Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles with stagnation and declining investor interest, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is emerging as the next-generation AI-driven meme coin. Compared to other meme coins that rely purely on community hype, it integrates artificial intelligence with viral meme culture, creating a project with real-world utility and long-term sustainability. One of the biggest reasons investors are flocking to FloppyPepe (FPPE) is its AI-powered ecosystem, which sets it apart from legacy meme tokens. The AI Video Agent, FloppyX, allows users to generate viral videos with simple text prompts, making it a game-changer for content creators and influencers. Similarly, the recently launched AI Image Generator Meme-o-Matic enables users to create and monetize high-quality AI-generated meme art. These ingenious tools position FloppyPepe (FPPE) as more than just a meme coin; it is a functional, AI-driven platform with real use cases. Beyond its technological edge, FloppyPepe (FPPE) boasts deflationary tokenomics designed for sustained growth. With 1% of every transaction permanently burned, the total supply continuously decreases, creating scarcity and increasing value over time. Also, 1% of each transaction is redistributed to token holders, rewarding long-term investors and guaranteeing community engagement. Unlike Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) weak burn model, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) built-in burn mechanism guarantees consistent deflation and price appreciation. Security is a major concern in the meme coin space, where many projects suffer from rug pulls or exploits. FloppyPepe (FPPE) has passed an audit by SolidProof, which further solidifies its transparency and boosts investor trust for the next bull run. Investor confidence in FloppyPepe (FPPE) is already surging, as seen in its private sale, which sold out within 24 hours. The project has also gained recognition from major crypto influencers, including Nass Crypto , with 1M+ YouTube subscribers, who labeled it an “AI gem” with mind-blowing potential. Compared to Shiba Inu (SHIB), which is struggling to maintain relevance, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is still in its early stages, offering massive upside potential. With its outstanding features, it is set to outperform legacy meme coins and dominate the next bull run. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Legacy Meme Coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) was one of the standout performers in the 2021 bull run, riding the wave of meme coin hype to achieve an all-time high of $0.000086. The coin built a massive community and secured a place among the top meme tokens in the market. However, despite its early success, it has faced challenges in maintaining its momentum. Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price is heavily influenced by whale activity , with large holders frequently dumping tokens. This creates instability and prevents sustained upward momentum. Additionally, its high circulating supply requires massive demand to generate meaningful price increases. The rise of AI-integrated meme tokens like FloppyPepe (FPPE) is diverting investor attention away from Shiba Inu (SHIB). Unlike traditional meme coins, AI-driven projects offer real-world utility, automated tokenomics, and outstanding features that set them apart. As the market evolves, Shiba Inu (SHIB) risks becoming outdated unless it undergoes significant upgrades. FloppyPepe (FPPE) To Lead The Next Bull Run Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a strong competitor with legacy status and community strength. However, FloppyPepe (FPPE) brings AI-driven creativity, superior tokenomics, and early-stage momentum, positioning it as a high-growth opportunity. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) may see gains in a broad market rally, its rival offers the kind of explosive potential that meme coin investors seek.

The AI token is building a vibrant ecosystem driven by cutting-edge AI meme-generation tools and community-led developments. With investors flocking to its ongoing presale, crypto insiders are giving the green light to a massive gain. ATH Out Of Reach, But Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) Adoption Hits New Heights Shiba Inu (SHIB) reached its all-time high (ATH) price of $0.00009000 on September 9, 2021. As of February 22, 2025, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.0000154, approximately 82% below its ATH. Despite the price decline, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem has seen significant growth.

This development is not surprising for those who follow the BEP-20 cryptocurrency networks, as Binance Coin (BNB) has also risen nearly 1% today. The price of BNB is striving to break through resistance and maintain a value of $600, indicating a potential shift in investor sentiment towards the BNB Chain. This shift has generated new interest in this innovative store of value assets. Additionally, Solana (SOL) and its blockchain have experienced significant migrations of investor funds, which could further explain the strong support for BNB and BEP-20 network-based cryptocurrencies. However, the largest growth of activity from within the Binance-Chain ecosystem is “Bitnance,” a new digital store of value asset positioned as an alternative and competitor to Bitcoin (BTC). The token symbol for this cryptocurrency is $BTN. Currently in its presale phase, the circulating news is offering investors a chance to purchase a scarce cryptocurrency at a discounted rate of $0.37; more importantly, before it lists on crypto exchanges at $0.53 [cents]. Bitnance Token Presale Soft Cap The BEP-20 token is surging towards its debut crypto exchanges, contingent upon reaching a soft cap of $1,500,000. Currently, over US$41000 has been raised from investors, and the presale soft cap is now slightly above 5%, with numbers continuing to grow rapidly. In the past week, there has been a notable surge in presale activity, with an impressive increase of over 1000% in purchases by investors. This influx may be attributed to experienced traders who have capitalized on recent market volatility and are now seeking secure options to store their funds until the current bearish trend subsides. Summary Stats On This Presale: Token name: BitnanceToken symbol: $BTNToken price: $0.357Presale Soft Cap: $1.5M Tokens Already Sold: 114,937 Presale Allocation Acquired: 6%CEX Listing day price: $0.53 Listing Day Return on Investment: +41% 2025 ATH Forecast: $6 10 Year ATH Forecasts: $1,300 What is this used for? Store of ValueAny dAPPS? No Total Token Supply: 10,000,000Network: BEP-20 Blockchain: BNB Chain Unlikely to match Bitcoin’s ROI Yields but exceptional returns on investment expected There’s belief that the SOV token could rise in value by over +20,000% long term. If this materializes, anyone who’s invested 1 BNB coin or more into the presale will have a life changing sum at their disposal. A healthy return, still it’s a small profit yield in comparison to the Bitcoin, who’s initial coin offering investors from 2011 have seen over a +10,000,000% ROI today. More importantly however, the recent notice of KYC verification for the project founder may have given ‘watching eyes’ enough sense of security to make their move. Crypto Exchange Listing Day Price is a +41% ROI Short term the +41% profit that’s to be delivered on crypto exchange listing day could also be the reasons for the bullish buying activity. As Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and other major altcoins are plummeting downward with months of downtrends expected, the easy 41% currently appears to be a safer bet. Token presales that end with listings on a popular crypto exchanges tend to grow in value 10x-40x in value when they have utility per ChatGpt. And though the 41% is already secured by the whitepaper dialogue , the BTN is more likely to reach an all-time high of over $1 on it’s listing day; far over +41% ROI yields. What is Bitnance for? Bitnance is a store of value assets for the BEP-20 cryptocurrency community and BNB blockchain. An effective release of the store of value asset could eliminate cross-blockchain fees for those looking to swap into Bitcoin (BTC). How many people use BNB-Chain daily? Per a BiInance report , over 1-million cryptocurrency traders used the BNB-chain daily in 2024. Those numbers are increasing in 2025 and not inclusive to the fact that the Binance.com crypto exchange, which is a part of the BNB-Chain ecosystem, has over 200 million users. The actual number of wallets holding BEP-20 cryptocurrencies and $BNB coin is believed to be in the multi-millions. These traders will also be able to easily access this new digital store of value asset targeting BNB-Chain users; who will see little to no fees for trading $BTN. Important blockchain Stats:How many users on this blockchain daily? 1,000,000 How many users on Binance exchange? 200,000,000 How many crypto wallets hold BEP-20 tokens? Over 4,000,000 How many will have access to trade Bitnance after it launches? 2,000,000+ Thus far over 115,000 store of value tokens have been purchased by investors before its debut on crypto exchanges via Bitnance.net .

That record might be about to break. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) is making changes that could stop benefits for 72.5 million Americans in the next 30 to 90 days, according to Martin O’Malley, the former Social Security commissioner. “Ultimately, you’re going to see the system collapse and an interruption of benefits,” O’Malley told CNBC. He warned that people should start saving now because the disruption is coming fast. He blames D.O.G.E. for making staff cuts and pushing changes to the agency’s technology, which he says will cause IT system failures. So far, neither the Social Security Administration nor the White House has said a word about what’s happening. D.O.G.E. is slashing leadership and staff D.O.G.E. is not a real government department. It was created by Donald Trump and given to Elon Musk to cut government spending. Since then, it’s been gutting federal agencies, and Social Security is one of its biggest targets. President Donald Trump together with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC – BusinessInsider First, leadership fell apart. Michelle King, the acting commissioner, resigned after clashing with D.O.G.E. over access to sensitive Social Security data. Before her, O’Malley quit in November to run for chairman of the Democratic National Committee—which he lost to Ken Martin. Now, Frank Bisignano, the CEO of Fiserv, is supposed to take over Social Security, but he hasn’t even had a Senate confirmation hearing yet. While waiting, the agency appointed Lee Dudek as acting commissioner. Dudek lasted barely a month before he got put on administrative leave for working too closely with D.O.G.E. He had written a post on LinkedIn saying his priority was to make sure payments went out on time, but now he’s out of the picture. Meanwhile, the agency is pushing employees out the door. On February 19, the Social Security Administration told workers they have until March 14 to take an early buyout. This time, it’s not just upper management—even service employees, the ones who process claims and answer customer calls, are being offered cash to leave. Who will lose benefits first? Not all Social Security recipients will feel the impact at the same time. Jill Hornick, a union leader at the American Federation of Government Employees, says people already getting benefits may not see immediate cuts since their payments are mostly automated. But new applicants? They’re in trouble. Hornick says if someone applies for retirement or disability benefits, their claims could take months to process—because there won’t be enough employees left to handle them. People filing for survivor benefits might be forced to wait too, even if they submit the right documents. “Not everybody can do things electronically,” says Maria Freese, a senior legislative representative at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. A lot of seniors still rely on in-person help, but D.O.G.E.’s cuts could mean longer waits or denied benefits just because there’s no one left to process claims. While Social Security falls apart, D.O.G.E. is hitting other agencies too. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is also being gutted, with plans to fire almost all of its 1,700 employees. CFPB is being wiped out by D.O.G.E. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created after the 2008 financial crisis, is being dismantled. Employees say they’ve been told the agency will be gone within 90 days. “My team was directed to assist with terminating the vast majority of CFPB employees as quickly as possible,” an employee using the pseudonym Alex Doe said in testimony released Thursday. The layoffs are happening in three phases: First, probationary and term employees will be fired. Then, 1,200 more employees will be cut. Finally, the agency will be reduced to almost nothing—a handful of people left before the final shutdown. Meanwhile, big banks are getting off easy. The CFPB had ongoing cases against major financial firms like Capital One, but D.O.G.E. dismissed at least four of them on Thursday, despite billions of dollars in consumer harm. For now, a federal judge has put the shutdown on hold until March 3, thanks to a case filed by the CFPB’s union. But that delay might not last long. If D.O.G.E. gets its way, the CFPB will disappear, and Social Security will follow right behind it. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The announcement was made by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in San Diego this week, nearly four years after the attack. Uranium Hack Seizure The hack, which occurred on April 28, 2021, exploited a critical vulnerability in Uranium Finance’s smart contracts during its transition to the V2.1 protocol. The flaw in its pair contracts allowed the attacker to withdraw nearly all available assets. This resulted in a theft of roughly $50 million in various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Binance USD (BUSD), Polkadot (DOT), Cardano (ADA), Tether (USDT), and Uranium’s native token, U92. Initially, suspicion surrounding the attack grew due to its timing, which occurred mere days after Uranium Finance launched its V2 upgrade. Adding to the controversy, the project’s contract repository was suddenly removed from GitHub, which led many in the community to speculate about potential insider involvement. Doubts about the platform’s security also intensified, especially since it had already experienced a $1.3 million breach earlier in the same month. The attacker quickly laundered the stolen funds with the help of controversial crypto mixer Tornado Cash, and AnySwap, a cross-chain bridge, to transfer assets across blockchains. Despite these obfuscation attempts, law enforcement managed to recover a significant portion of the stolen funds. Attacks on Crypto Platforms The latest seizure comes as cryptocurrency-related cybercrimes continue to rise, with a recent high-profile hack targeting Bybit which lost an estimated $1.4 billion in crypto assets. The FBI has officially attributed the heist to North Korea, further cementing the country’s role in global crypto theft. With total stolen funds in 2024 reaching $2.2 billion, this marks the fifth time in the past decade that annual losses have exceeded $1 billion. Interestingly, North Korea’s cybercriminal operations now account for 61% of the total stolen crypto this year and 20% of all hacking incidents, The post US Authorities Seize $31M in Crypto Tied to Uranium Finance Hack appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bybit|DeFi|Hacks|North Korea,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|ADA|ASIA|BTC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-03-01 21:11:10

This innovative approach transforms how transaction costs are managed on the network, allowing users to exchange a few minutes for reduced or eliminated transaction fees. It marks a significant shift in the Ethereum ecosystem. The Advent of Ad-Sponsored Gas Fees The concept of ad-sponsored gas fees has been discussed within the Ethereum community. Notably, a product designer named Danii proposed waiving gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain by allowing users to watch ads, effectively trading their time to cover transaction costs. This proposal has sparked conversations about integrating advertising models to subsidize user expenses. Building on this concept, platforms like AdFuel have emerged, offering solutions where users can watch advertisements to earn credits toward their gas fees. AdFuel allows users to choose between short or long ads, with longer ads providing double the gas fee coverage based on current rates. Sponsors fund these advertisements, with a portion of their contributions allocated to users’ gas fees and the remainder supporting the platform’s operations. MetaMask’s Gas Station Feature MetaMask, a widely used Ethereum wallet, has introduced a feature known as the Gas Station. This update includes network fees in the quotes users receive, simplifying the transaction process by incorporating gas costs upfront. While MetaMask’s Gas Station does not directly involve watching ads to pay for gas fees, it represents a broader effort to make gas fee management more user-friendly. Community Reactions and Implications The introduction of ad-sponsored gas fees has elicited mixed reactions from the Ethereum community. Some users express enthusiasm about the potential to reduce transaction costs by watching ads, viewing it as a practical solution to high gas fees. For instance, discussions on platforms like Reddit have highlighted user interest in such features, with comments noting the willingness to watch ads to avoid paying traditional gas fees. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, others raise concerns about the feasibility and implications of this model. Critics argue that relying on ad revenue to subsidize gas fees could disrupt the incentive mechanisms that secure the Ethereum network. Validators who depend on gas fees as rewards for confirming transactions might see reduced earnings, potentially impacting network security and decentralization. Additionally, there are concerns about user experience, such as the potential for lengthy ad durations and the possibility of users circumventing the system by running ads in the background without engagement. Future Outlook The integration of advertising to offset Ethereum gas fees represents an innovative approach to addressing transaction costs. As this model evolves, it will be crucial to balance user benefits with the sustainability and security of the Ethereum network. Ongoing discussions and developments will determine how effectively this strategy can be implemented without compromising the foundational principles of blockchain technology. Paying Ethereum gas fees by watching advertisements introduces a novel method for users to manage transaction costs. While this approach offers potential benefits, such as reduced fees and new revenue streams for advertisers, it also presents challenges that need careful consideration.

The high-profile event is expected to set off a chain reaction for positive crypto regulation by the Trump-led government. Here’s all there is to know about the first-of-its-kind event by the US executive. White House Crypto Summit Will Have Industry Behemoths In Attendance An official disclosure from the White House for a crypto summit has sent the industry buzzing with excitement. Per the announcement , US President Donald Trump will deliver key remarks at the event scheduled for March 7. Led by crypto czar David Sacks, the report confirms that the White House Crypto Summit will be administered by Bo Hines, executive director of The Presidential Council of Advisers on Digital Assets. Insiders claim that the summit will feature 25 individuals from the cryptoverse, including exchange founders and thought leaders. Exact names are shrouded in mystery but sources say an official list will be published in the coming days. The event is coming on the heels of a wave of SEC case dismissals against prominent crypto sector players, signaling a new dawn for the industry “Attendees will include prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto industry, as well as members of the President’s Working Group On Digital Assets,” read the White House statement. The Summit Will Explore Digital Asset Regulation Issues The event will broach several issues but sources say regulation will be at the top of the pile. Crypto czar David Sacks and Bo Hines have been blowing hot on a raft of new forward-thinking regulations for stablecoins and other digital assets. In particular, the summit will feature conversations around cross-agency crypto regulations while interfacing with the private sector. There is speculation that the White House Crypto Summit may replace the previously touted Crypto Advisory Council. Several pundits say a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for the US will feature prominently in the White House Crypto Summit discussions. The summit will be the first in a long streak of conversations between the White House and the private sector. Experts say the summit’s composition will change each edition as the White House seeks diverse opinions for new regulations.

The claim is based on chart patterns and technical indicators that signal a potential reversal in price action. CryptoBull’s analysis focuses on a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart. Falling wedges are typically bullish indicators, often signaling the end of a downtrend before an upward breakout. The chart highlights a convergence of multiple trendlines, suggesting that XRP may be nearing a key support zone. The asset’s current price of $2.15 places close to the convergence point of these trendlines, reinforcing the likelihood of a reversal. #XRP is bottoming here and then goes above $4! pic.twitter.com/M1BaMTmag9 — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) February 28, 2025 This chart is an update from his previous analysis showing a falling wedge on the 1-hour chart. According to his assessment, XRP could see an initial rise to $2.20 before continuing its larger upward trajectory. The breakout scenario suggests that once XRP clears its resistance levels, the price could accelerate toward higher targets. XRP Could Be Gearing Up For Something Big CryptoBull also suggested recently that XRP is in the disbelief phase of the market cycle . This phase follows a downtrend when investors remain skeptical of a potential recovery. Historically, the disbelief phase often precedes strong rallies, as prices rise despite lingering uncertainty among traders. CryptoBull’s prediction aligns with this theory, as many traders remain hesitant despite XRP’s remarkable resilience in the market’s current bearish phase. If CryptoBull is right, the digital asset could be on the verge of significant gains, mirroring past market cycles.

A recent analysis drew attention to the asset’s incredible strength relative to BTC , which could indicate growing investor confidence. When altcoins perform well against Bitcoin, it often signals an incoming bullish trend for the broader market. This relative strength, combined with the falling wedge formation, adds to the argument that XRP is positioning itself for a breakout. A move above key resistance levels could open the door for a rapid ascent, potentially surpassing $4. CryptoBull’s analysis, backed by technical chart patterns and market sentiment, suggests that XRP may be approaching a significant upward move. The falling wedge formation, and the asset’s current position in the market all reinforce the bullish sentiment shared by many in the community.

His comments, made in an interview with newspaper group Tamedia, come amid a wider debate in Switzerland over Bitcoin’s potential role in the country’s monetary policy. Schlegel said cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and therefore not suitable for long-term reserve management. “Our reserves need to have high liquidity so that they can be used quickly for monetary policy purposes when necessary,” he said. He also noted the security risks associated with digital assets. “Cryptocurrencies are essentially software, and we all know that software can have bugs and other vulnerabilities,” Schlegel said. Related News: Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) Proposes Changes That Could Deeply Impact Altcoins Despite the SNB’s reservations, a grassroots initiative is pushing for Bitcoin to be made mandatory as part of the central bank’s reserves. Launched in December, the “For a Financially Strong, Sovereign and Accountable Switzerland (Bitcoin Initiative)” aims to gather 100,000 signatures within 18 months to put the proposal to a national vote. The initiative calls for a constitutional amendment requiring the SNB to hold a portion of its reserves in Bitcoin and gold, but the proposal does not specify the exact amount of Bitcoin that would be included. Schlegel downplayed the importance of cryptocurrencies in the global financial system, describing them as a “niche phenomenon.” He also dismissed concerns about digital assets competing with traditional currencies, reaffirming his confidence in the stability of the Swiss franc. *This is not investment advice.

Bulls have lost control of the price action, and DOGE is now at risk of further declines if it fails to hold key support. The broader meme coin market has also been hit hard, contributing to Dogecoin’s struggles as sentiment remains weak. Related Reading: Ethereum Retraces To Critical Monthly Demand Level – Can ETH Hold Selling Pressure? Top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that DOGE is testing a high-time-frame support level around $0.18. This level has historically acted as a strong demand zone, making it crucial for bulls to defend it. If DOGE manages to hold above this support and reclaim the $0.22 level, a short-term recovery rally could be possible. However, if selling pressure persists and DOGE loses the $0.18 support, the next stop could be significantly lower. Market conditions remain uncertain, and traders are closely watching whether Dogecoin can stabilize or if further downside is on the horizon. The next few days will be critical in determining whether DOGE can recover or if it will continue to follow the bearish trend that has dominated the market in recent weeks. Dogecoin Testing Long-Term Demand Level Dogecoin is trading below the $0.25 mark, a key price level that will determine short-term direction. Analysts are warning of further downside risks as the market continues to face heavy selling pressure. The meme coin sector has been hit the hardest during this correction, and Dogecoin is leading the way with a 36% drop in the past two weeks. Sentiment remains bearish, and investors are looking for signs of stability before considering any potential recovery. Martinez shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Dogecoin is trading above a critical support level around $0.18. This level is crucial for maintaining the long-term bullish structure. If bulls manage to hold above this mark, it could prevent further downside and provide a foundation for a recovery rally. Martinez also notes that DOGE is currently holding around the lower boundary of a macro ascending channel. Historically, this level has acted as a strong support zone for price rebounds. Related Reading: Is Solana In A Macro Trend Move? Charts Show Potential Shift If Dogecoin holds this level, a massive rally could follow, potentially pushing the price back toward the $0.25 resistance level. However, if the support fails, DOGE could experience a deeper correction. The next few days will be critical in determining whether DOGE can sustain its bullish structure or if it will continue its downward trend. Crucial Phase For DOGE Price Action Dogecoin is trading at $0.20, sitting at a crucial short-term resistance level just below $0.21. Bulls are trying to regain control, but selling pressure remains strong, making it difficult for DOGE to break above this key price point. If bulls successfully reclaim the $0.21 level and push above the $0.25 mark, a strong rally into higher prices could follow, potentially shifting market sentiment in favor of buyers. However, the downside risk remains significant. If DOGE fails to hold its current levels and loses support at $0.18, it could trigger a deeper correction, pushing the price toward lower demand zones. This level has historically acted as a critical support for Dogecoin, and losing it could lead to further sell-offs in the broader meme coin market.

A breakout above resistance could signal the start of a recovery, while a failure to hold key levels may result in further bearish momentum.

These guys are now called “superbillionaires” by Forbes, because they have a new level of extreme wealth and power. Forbes’ first billionaires list in 1987 had 140 people worth a combined $295 billion. Back then, the richest person was Japan’s Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, a real estate magnate with $20 billion. Today, the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, is worth $419.4 billion, which is 21 times what Tsutsumi had at his peak and over 2 million times more than the median U.S. household. Japan’s Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, widely known as the world’s richest man in 1990 – Forbes Superbillionaires amass extreme wealth To qualify as a superbillionaire, a person needs to have at least $50 billion. Among them, 16 have over $100 billion, making them centi-billionaires. A decade ago, these kinds of fortunes barely existed. In 2014, this group held only 4% of all billionaire wealth. Now, their slice has quadrupled. “Billionaires have always obviously controlled significant amounts of wealth, but now you’re talking about differences in the billionaire population themselves,” said Maya Imberg from Altrata, a global wealth intelligence firm. “It’s quite staggering just how much the net worths of some of these people have grown.” Their money fuels luxury real estate, and every single one of them owns at least $100 million in personal residential properties. That figure is likely understated since many hold real estate under corporate names or through partners. Markets like New York, Los Angeles, Miami, and Aspen have seen a surge in nine-figure home sales and tall residential towers built specifically for the billionaire class. Tech founders dominate the superbillionaire list Most of the superbillionaires made their money in tech or industries boosted by technology. Of the 10 richest people, 6 come from tech, including Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Sergey Brin, and Steve Ballmer. Unlike industrialists of the past, today’s tech billionaires built fortunes based on stock prices rather than physical assets. Their wealth can fluctuate by tens of billions in a single year, depending on investor sentiment. Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang have all had swings of that scale. Tech monopolies have also helped these billionaires amass their fortunes. Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, pointed out that current antitrust laws were designed for companies like Standard Oil, not tech giants. “Monopoly power has given rise to the potential of enormous amounts of wealth,” he said. He also highlighted tax loopholes, calling them key to modern billionaire wealth accumulation. “These guys have, both at the corporate level and at the individual level, been even better at avoiding taxes than in making good products,” he said. The Tesla CEO’s $50 billion compensation package is one example of this system at work. New money replaces old wealth Unlike the generations that came before, where fortunes were built over decades, today’s tech-driven economy has also allowed founders to amass enormous sums in a matter of just a few years. Before his arrest in 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried, the now-disgraced founder of FTX, was worth $26 billion before the age of 30, for instance. A 2024 Heritage Foundation report noted that names like Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Vanderbilt have largely disappeared from the billionaire lists. “The great American fortunes of today are new money, not old,” the report stated. Of the 97 billionaires who inherited wealth from the 2005 Forbes 400 list, less than half remain. Those who are still there were three times more likely to have fallen in rank than to have risen. The shift started in the 1980s and 1990s, when globalization and technology reshaped industries. The internet and digital platforms allowed entrepreneurs to scale businesses faster than ever before. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced crypto billionaire, built a $26 billion fortune before turning 30—though he lost it just as fast. At the same time, wealth inequality has surged. In 2024, the top 1% of American households controlled $49.2 trillion, or 30% of all U.S. wealth. In the late 1980s, that figure was 23%. With fortunes of this scale, superbillionaires have outsized influence over politics, media, and the economy. Musk owns Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter), Bezos owns The Washington Post, and Zuckerberg controls Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. Their power extends beyond wealth, shaping public opinion, policy, and markets. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Unfortunately, moments after the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, dropped to $85,000 and Ethereum fell to $2,200. Reports show that the overall NFT sales volume also diminished drastically. NFT Sales Drop 28.9%, But Trading Activity Stays Strong According to market data, NFT sales fell by 28.93%. This means they slid from $152.9 million to $107.1 million in the past seven days. Despite the current market decline, market participation remained positive and activity-driven. The number of NFT sellers increased by 32.81% to 314,871. In addition, the total number of transactions remained stable, rising slightly by 0.86% to 1.56 million. This suggests that while NFT prices are declining, traders are still actively buying and selling digital assets. Ethereum Sales Take a Major Hit While Bitcoin NFTs Gain Ground Now, not only NFT sales saw this massive market depreciation. In addition, Ethereum-based NFTs saw the most disappointing decline. Its market sales dropped by 67.86% to $25.3 million. However, the number of buyers increased by 20.27% to 50,056. A paramount factor in this decline was the terrible loss in wash trading, which reduced by 92.83% to $2.7 million. In contrast, Bitcoin NFTs moved in the opposite direction, with sales increasing by 16.73% to $24.3 million. The number of Bitcoin NFT buyers also grew by 30.71% to 30,203. Other blockchains experienced mixed results. For example, Mythos Chain saw a slight drop in sales, while Polygon and Solana posted gains of 45.35% and 12.41%, respectively. Pudgy Penguins and Other Top Collections Struggle Meanwhile, there is a promising development for the NFT collection. This is because some projects held strong while others had a big low. In this case, Courtyard reached the top spot with $12.1 million in sales, up 39.55%, followed by Ordinal Maxi Biz, which surged 450.88% to $12.0 million. However, once-popular collections such as Pudgy Penguins suffered a steep decline . Pudgy Penguins fell to tenth place with $1.6 million in sales, marking an 80.69% drop. This sharp decline reflects shifting buyer interest and the impact of the overall market downturn. Still, with the total crypto market cap dropping from $3.18 trillion to $2.84 trillion, the NFT market remains volatile. Another noteworthy event that happened with the current market decline was President Donald Trump organization that announced plans to launch a metaverse and an NFT trading platform.

This deadline is final, with no further extensions planned. “As part of our ongoing mission to ensure inclusivity, fairness, and maximum participation in the Pi Network ecosystem, the Grace Period has one last extension to 8:00 a.m. UTC on March 14, 2025—the sixth anniversary of the project’s official launch.” – Pi Network Team, Feb 28, 2025 While previous extensions provided ample time for verification, Pi Network developers insist the migration must conclude to maintain security and decentralization. Those failing to complete KYC by the deadline risk forfeiting unverified balances permanently. Why Did Pi Network Extend the Migration Grace Period? Pi Network’s leadership says the extension is necessary to uphold inclusivity and accessibility across its global user base. The decision also aims to reengage early Pioneers who played a critical role in Pi’s initial adoption but became inactive over time. With the Open Network live, renewed interest has prompted the need for one final grace period. The project cites several key reasons for the extension: Reengaging early adopters: Pi Network wants to ensure those who contributed to the ecosystem’s growth but lapsed in activity have a final chance to verify and migrate their balances. Ensuring inclusivity: Pi’s mission revolves around offering access to a broad audience, and extending the migration deadline aligns with this principle. Addressing verification obstacles: The extension provides a buffer for Pioneers facing difficulties in completing KYC due to regulatory or logistical challenges. Strengthening the network: A real, verified, and decentralized network is vital for Pi’s long-term success. Allowing more users to transition to Mainnet ensures a stronger, more robust ecosystem. Despite these considerations, Pi Network maintains that this extension is the absolute last. The transition must move forward to establish full network functionality without unverified or inactive balances weighing down the system. What Happens If You Miss the Pi Network Migration Deadline? Pioneers who fail to complete KYC and migrate their Pi holdings before March 14, 2025, will lose most of their mobile wallet balances. However, Pi Network has clarified that any Pi mined within the last six months before migration will remain accessible. Pi Network Team announces “Last Chance” for Migration This means that users holding older, unverified Pi must take action before the deadline or risk losing their assets permanently. The migration process ensures that only verified users retain access to their balances, aligning with Pi Network’s commitment to maintaining a decentralized and authenticated blockchain. Can Pi Network Price Reach $10 Before March 14? With Pi’s price surging 53% last week, moving from its opening price of $1.20 on Sunday Feb 23 before opening trading at $2.10 on Saturday March 1 mark . Speculation is now mounting over PI’s potential to climb towards to the $10 level before the migration deadline. The market’s reaction suggests growing confidence in the project’s long-term viability, but whether Pi can reach $10 hinges on multiple factors. Market sentiment is also crucial. Increased adoption, successful migrations, and expanding use cases could fuel further rallies. However, failure to meet migration targets or lingering doubts about Pi’s utility post-Mainnet could dampen bullish momentum. Pi Network price trajectory remains uncertain, but one thing is clear—the March 14 deadline is a defining moment for the project’s future. Users still holding unverified balances have a narrow window to act before their assets disappear. Whether Pi’s price continues its ascent or retraces in the coming weeks, the network’s transition to full Mainnet functionality will be a turning point that determines its long-term prospects. Pi Network Technical Analysis: Close Above $2 Could Spark $10 Attempt Before Migration Deadline Pi Network price is consolidating near $1.95 after posting a 53% rally over the past week. The chart suggests a key decision point, with technical indicators offering mixed signals on whether PI can sustain its upward momentum toward $10. The Parabolic SAR, a key trend-following indicator, remains bullish at $1.1446, suggesting that buyers still control the broader trend. Pi Network Technical Analysis However, the latest red candlestick near $2 indicates selling pressure, signaling a potential retracement if bulls fail to hold current support levels. A decisive close above $2 would reinforce bullish momentum, while a failure could see PI revisiting the $1.50-$1.60 range. Volume analysis shows a recent decline in bullish momentum, with the Volume Delta flipping negative, indicating more sell-side pressure. If buyers step in to absorb selling, a breakout above $2.50 could trigger a sharp rally, with $3.20 as the next resistance before a potential parabolic surge to $10. However, failure to sustain above $2 risks a prolonged consolidation phase, delaying any upward breakout ahead of the March 14 migration deadline.
