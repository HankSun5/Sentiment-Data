A recent announcement has sent ripples of excitement across the digital asset landscape: a groundbreaking Chainlink Mastercard partnership . This collaboration promises to open up direct on-chain crypto purchases for a staggering 3 billion Mastercard users, according to insights shared by crypto platform Unfolded on X. This isn’t just another integration; it’s a monumental step towards mainstream cryptocurrency adoption , potentially reshaping how billions interact with digital assets. The Chainlink Mastercard Partnership: Bridging Traditional Finance and Web3 Imagine a world where buying cryptocurrency is as straightforward as any online purchase, directly from your bank account or credit card, and instantly on the blockchain. This is the vision the Chainlink Mastercard partnership aims to realize. For too long, the process of acquiring cryptocurrencies has been complex for many, often involving multiple steps, third-party exchanges, and concerns about custody. Chainlink, a leading decentralized oracle network, plays a pivotal role in this integration. Its secure and reliable infrastructure is essential for connecting real-world data and traditional payment systems to blockchain networks. Mastercard, a global payments giant, brings its immense network and user base to the table. This synergy is designed to simplify the user experience dramatically, allowing individuals to acquire digital assets directly on a blockchain without needing to navigate complex exchange interfaces or worry about off-chain custody risks. This partnership signifies a profound shift in Mastercard’s strategy, moving beyond just facilitating crypto transactions through third parties to enabling direct interaction with on-chain assets. It’s a clear signal that traditional financial powerhouses recognize the inevitability and potential of blockchain technology. Revolutionizing On-Chain Crypto Purchases: What Does It Mean for You? The core of this partnership lies in enabling direct on-chain crypto purchases . But what exactly does ‘on-chain’ mean, and why is it significant for the average user? Direct Ownership: When you purchase crypto directly on-chain, the assets are immediately transferred to a blockchain address you control (your wallet). This means you have direct custody of your funds, eliminating the need to trust a third-party exchange with your assets. Enhanced Security: By leveraging Chainlink’s robust oracle services, the process of connecting traditional payment rails to the blockchain is secured and verified, minimizing risks associated with data integrity and transaction execution. Streamlined Experience: The goal is to make the buying process as seamless as possible. Instead of depositing fiat into an exchange, converting it, and then withdrawing to a personal wallet, users could potentially buy crypto and have it delivered directly to their chosen on-chain address. Consider the typical journey of buying crypto today versus the potential future with this partnership: Current Crypto Purchase Method (Typical) Future with Chainlink Mastercard Partnership (Potential) Sign up for a centralized exchange (CEX). Utilize a Mastercard-enabled interface (e.g., dApp, wallet service). Complete KYC/AML verification. Leverage existing Mastercard verification processes. Deposit fiat currency to the CEX. Directly pay with Mastercard. Place a buy order for desired cryptocurrency. Initiate an on-chain purchase transaction. Crypto held by the CEX (custodial). Crypto sent directly to your self-custody wallet (non-custodial). Optional: Withdraw crypto to personal wallet. No withdrawal step needed; it’s already on-chain. This simplification is a game-changer, reducing barriers for new users and providing greater control for existing crypto holders. Accelerating Cryptocurrency Adoption: A Major Milestone? The scale of this collaboration cannot be overstated. With access to nearly 3 billion Mastercard users, this partnership has the potential to dramatically accelerate cryptocurrency adoption on a global scale. What makes this so impactful? Mass Market Accessibility: Mastercard’s reach extends to virtually every corner of the globe, bringing crypto within reach of billions who might otherwise find it inaccessible or intimidating. Trust and Legitimacy: A major financial institution like Mastercard endorsing and integrating direct crypto purchases lends significant credibility to the digital asset space, potentially easing concerns for traditional investors and consumers. Reduced Friction: By simplifying the on-ramp process, the partnership removes a significant hurdle for new users, making it easier for them to experiment with and eventually embrace cryptocurrencies. Institutional Confidence: Such high-profile collaborations signal to other financial institutions that engaging with blockchain and digital assets is not just viable but necessary for future growth. This move positions Mastercard and Chainlink at the forefront of a financial revolution, transforming niche technology into a mainstream utility. It’s a clear indication that the financial world is moving beyond simply acknowledging crypto to actively integrating it into its core services. Web3 Innovation at the Forefront: Shaping the Decentralized Future This partnership is not just about buying crypto; it’s a significant leap forward for Web3 innovation . Web3 envisions a decentralized internet where users have more control over their data and digital assets, powered by blockchain technology. This collaboration perfectly aligns with that vision by enabling direct, user-controlled access to digital assets on a decentralized network. Chainlink’s role as the secure middleware is crucial here. As a decentralized oracle network, it provides the reliable, tamper-proof data feeds and connectivity that smart contracts need to interact with real-world events and traditional systems. This capability is fundamental for bridging the gap between the existing financial infrastructure and the burgeoning decentralized applications (dApps) of Web3. The implications extend beyond simple purchases: Enhanced DeFi Access: Easier on-ramps mean more users can participate in decentralized finance protocols, lending, borrowing, and yield farming. NFT Market Growth: Simplified access to cryptocurrencies could fuel further growth in the NFT market, making it easier for users to acquire the necessary crypto to purchase digital collectibles. New Use Cases: The seamless integration could pave the way for entirely new types of decentralized applications that require real-world payment interactions. This initiative underscores the growing synergy between established corporations and cutting-edge blockchain protocols, demonstrating how Web3 technologies can be integrated into everyday life. Unlocking Seamless Digital Asset Payments for Billions The ultimate goal of this partnership is to unlock seamless digital asset payments for a global audience. While the initial focus is on purchasing crypto, the underlying infrastructure and simplified user experience could pave the way for broader applications. Imagine using your Mastercard to pay for goods and services directly with cryptocurrency, without complex conversions or delays. While not explicitly part of this initial announcement, the foundation being laid for direct on-chain interaction suggests a future where digital assets are as liquid and usable as traditional fiat currency. The partnership could facilitate: Cross-Border Payments: Leveraging blockchain’s efficiency for international transactions, potentially reducing costs and settlement times. Merchant Adoption: If users can easily acquire and hold crypto, merchants might be more inclined to accept it as a form of payment. Financial Inclusion: In regions with less developed traditional banking infrastructure, direct access to digital assets could provide new financial opportunities. By making the entry point to crypto incredibly simple, Chainlink and Mastercard are not just selling a product; they are building a bridge to a more interconnected and digitally native financial future. Challenges and the Road Ahead While the prospects are exciting, implementing such a large-scale integration comes with its own set of challenges: Regulatory Landscape: The global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Navigating different jurisdictions’ rules will be crucial for widespread adoption. Scalability: Ensuring that blockchain networks can handle the immense transaction volume from 3 billion potential users will require robust scaling solutions. User Education: Despite simplification, educating a broad user base about self-custody, blockchain security, and the nuances of digital assets remains vital. Technical Integration: Seamlessly integrating complex traditional payment systems with decentralized blockchain protocols is a significant technical undertaking. However, the commitment from both Chainlink and Mastercard suggests a long-term vision and a willingness to overcome these hurdles. Their combined expertise positions them well to address these challenges head-on. The Impact: What This Means for the Crypto Ecosystem This collaboration is a clear win for several key players and the broader crypto ecosystem: For Chainlink: It significantly enhances its utility and validates its position as the industry-standard oracle network, driving demand for its services and potentially its native token. For Mastercard: It solidifies its position as an innovator in the financial sector, ensuring its relevance in the rapidly expanding digital economy and potentially attracting a new generation of users. For Users: Unprecedented ease of access to digital assets, empowering individuals with greater financial autonomy and participation in the decentralized economy. For the Crypto Market: Increased liquidity, stability, and legitimacy, potentially attracting more institutional investment and reducing market volatility over time. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Digital Assets The Chainlink Mastercard partnership marks a truly transformative moment for the cryptocurrency world. By enabling direct on-chain crypto purchases for billions of users, it is not merely simplifying a transaction; it is fundamentally reshaping the landscape of cryptocurrency adoption . This strategic alliance represents a powerful fusion of traditional financial might and cutting-edge Web3 innovation , paving the way for seamless digital asset payments that could soon become commonplace. As the lines between traditional finance and decentralized technology continue to blur, this partnership stands as a beacon, guiding us towards a more accessible, integrated, and decentralized financial future.

For institutions and individuals alike, a clear signal from top regulators can make all the difference. Recently, a significant statement from Jerome Powell , Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, has sent ripples through both the banking and crypto sectors, offering much-needed clarity on the path forward for crypto services within established financial frameworks. What Did Jerome Powell Say About Bank Crypto Adoption? In a pivotal moment for the industry, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell explicitly stated that banks are indeed permitted to offer services to the crypto industry and engage in related activities. This isn’t a blanket endorsement without caveats, however. The crucial condition, as reported by PiQSuite on X, is that these activities must ensure the “safety and soundness of the financial system.” This statement marks a significant step, moving beyond mere acknowledgment to a qualified approval, provided the necessary precautions are in place. For years, traditional banks have approached the burgeoning digital asset space with extreme caution, often due to a lack of clear regulatory guidance. This ambiguity created a challenging environment for both banks wanting to innovate and crypto companies seeking legitimate financial partners. Powell’s recent remarks provide a foundational understanding: Permission Granted: Banks can actively engage with the crypto industry. Conditional Engagement: All activities must uphold the safety and soundness of the financial system. Clearer Path: This offers a more defined regulatory stance compared to previous general warnings. This clarity is vital for fostering responsible innovation while mitigating potential risks, setting a precedent for how traditional finance can embrace digital assets. Unlocking Bank Crypto Adoption: The Green Light for Financial Institutions The Federal Reserve’s stance, articulated by Jerome Powell , essentially gives a green light for bank crypto adoption, provided it’s done responsibly. This isn’t just about banks offering basic services like holding crypto assets; it opens the door for a much broader range of activities. Consider the potential benefits for financial institutions: Benefit for Banks Description New Revenue Streams Offering custody, trading, and lending services for digital assets can tap into a growing market. Client Retention & Acquisition Meeting the evolving demands of tech-savvy clients and attracting new ones interested in crypto. Competitive Edge Staying ahead of fintech companies and other traditional institutions by embracing innovation. Enhanced Product Offerings Integrating digital assets into existing portfolios, potentially creating hybrid financial products. This strategic move allows banks to capture a share of the rapidly expanding digital asset market, which has largely operated outside the traditional banking system. By providing regulated avenues for crypto engagement, banks can enhance trust and security for investors, potentially reducing the risks associated with unregulated platforms. This also means that more mainstream investors might feel comfortable venturing into crypto, knowing their assets are handled by regulated entities. Ensuring Financial Stability: The Fed’s Prudent Approach to Crypto Services The caveat about ensuring “safety and soundness” is paramount and reflects the Federal Reserve’s core mandate: maintaining financial stability . While open to innovation, the Fed remains acutely aware of the potential risks that digital assets, with their inherent volatility and novel technological underpinnings, could pose to the broader financial system. The phrase “safety and soundness” is not new; it’s a bedrock principle of banking regulation, encompassing: Operational Resilience: Ensuring systems are robust against cyberattacks, technical failures, and human error. Risk Management: Implementing stringent controls for market, credit, liquidity, and operational risks associated with crypto. Consumer Protection: Safeguarding customer funds and data, and ensuring transparent disclosures. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Preventing illicit use of digital assets. This cautious yet progressive stance indicates that the Fed is not looking to stifle innovation but rather to guide it within a secure framework. Banks engaging in crypto services will be expected to demonstrate robust capabilities in these areas, likely requiring significant investment in technology, expertise, and compliance infrastructure. The regulatory bodies, including the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC, are expected to continue collaborating to develop comprehensive guidelines that address these concerns, ensuring a harmonized approach to digital asset oversight. Navigating the Landscape of Crypto Regulation: Challenges and Opportunities While Jerome Powell ‘s statement offers a positive outlook, the path to full-scale crypto regulation and integration for banks is not without its challenges. The fragmented nature of U.S. regulatory oversight, where multiple agencies have jurisdiction over different aspects of digital assets, can create complexity. Banks must navigate a labyrinth of existing and evolving rules, including: Licensing and Approvals: Obtaining necessary permissions from various state and federal regulators. Compliance Costs: Significant investment in technology and personnel to meet AML, KYC, and other regulatory requirements specific to crypto. Technological Integration: Safely integrating blockchain technology and crypto infrastructure with legacy banking systems. Volatility Management: Developing strategies to manage the extreme price fluctuations inherent in crypto assets, which can impact balance sheets and capital requirements. Cybersecurity Risks: Protecting digital assets from hacks, theft, and other cyber threats, which are particularly prevalent in the crypto space. Despite these hurdles, the opportunities are immense. A clear regulatory framework fosters greater institutional participation, leading to increased liquidity, reduced market manipulation, and ultimately, greater legitimacy for the entire crypto ecosystem. Banks that successfully navigate these challenges will be well-positioned to become leaders in the digital finance era, offering secure and compliant access to a new class of assets. The Future of Banking and Digital Assets: A Converging Path The pronouncement from Jerome Powell is more than just a statement; it’s an acknowledgment of the inevitability of digital assets in the financial landscape. It signals a future where traditional banking and the crypto world are not separate entities but rather converging paths. This convergence could lead to: Hybrid Financial Products: Blending traditional securities with tokenized assets, offering new investment opportunities. Improved Payment Systems: Leveraging blockchain for faster, cheaper cross-border payments. Enhanced Financial Inclusion: Providing access to financial services for underserved populations through digital channels. Innovation in Lending and Borrowing: Exploring decentralized finance (DeFi) principles within a regulated environment. This evolving landscape will require ongoing dialogue between regulators, financial institutions, and crypto innovators. The goal is to build a robust, secure, and efficient financial system that leverages the benefits of digital assets while safeguarding against their inherent risks. The emphasis on financial stability means that any integration will be methodical and data-driven, rather than rushed or reckless. Actionable Insights for the Evolving Market For various stakeholders, Jerome Powell ‘s remarks offer important takeaways: For Banks: Begin or accelerate your strategic assessment of crypto opportunities. Focus on building robust compliance frameworks, investing in cybersecurity, and developing in-house expertise. Consider pilot programs or partnerships with established crypto firms. For Crypto Companies: Continue to prioritize regulatory compliance and build strong relationships with traditional financial institutions. Demonstrate your commitment to security, transparency, and consumer protection to attract banking partners. For Regulators: Continue to provide clear, consistent, and adaptable guidance. Foster innovation while upholding the core principles of financial stability and consumer protection. For Investors: Be aware that increased institutional participation could bring more stability and legitimacy to the crypto markets, but also understand that regulatory oversight will shape which assets and services are available through traditional channels. The journey towards full integration will be incremental, but the direction is clear: digital assets are here to stay, and traditional finance is finding its way to responsibly embrace them. Conclusion: A New Era for Bank Crypto Integration The recent statement from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell represents a landmark moment in the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world. By affirming that banks can offer crypto services under the crucial condition of ensuring “safety and soundness,” Powell has provided much-needed clarity and a foundational framework for responsible innovation. This guidance is a powerful signal that the Federal Reserve, while cautious, is committed to allowing regulated entities to participate in the digital asset economy, ultimately fostering greater financial stability and consumer protection. While significant challenges remain in terms of crypto regulation , compliance, and technological integration, the path forward is now clearer. Banks are empowered to explore new revenue streams and enhance their offerings, while the crypto industry gains further legitimacy and access to mainstream financial infrastructure. This is not merely an allowance but an invitation for the financial sector to evolve, adapt, and build a more inclusive and technologically advanced future, all while upholding the integrity of the financial system.

The claims came from Vasily Girya, the owner and CEO of the industrial player GIS Mining, the Russian Prime news agency reported. Girya said: “The crypto industry remains attractive to market players. In a moderately positive scenario, the price of Bitcoin in the second half of summer could reach an all-time high of $115,000. It could target $130k”. Bitcoin: $130k By End of Summer? At the time of writing, Bitcoin prices are wavering around the $105k mark following a brief foray into $111,000 territory in mid May. GIS Mining is one of Russia’s top 10 industrial miners, and mainly specializes in mobile units and mining hotel facilities. Per recent figures, the company’s mining capacity for Financial Year 2024 was 53 MW. Inside a GIS Mining data center. (Source: GIS Mining/YouTube/Screenshot) The country’s 10 biggest mining firms posted a collective total of $200 million in revenue in FY2024. Over half of this revenue came from the nation’s two biggest miners: BitRiver and Intelion . Girya explained that the Russian mining sector is set for another burst of growth this year. He said that the sector was experiencing “record-breaking” demand for new crypto mining data centers with a capacity of up to 100 MW. The mining chief added that demand for equipment capable of “energy-intensive blockchain computing” was also skyrocketing. Insiders say that in the first half of 2025, demand for crypto mining hardware outstripped supply. They claim that since Moscow legalized and began regulating crypto mining in 2024, more investors have entered the market. The ruble’s rise against the dollar this year has also made crypto mining investment more viable for many. RUB-USD prices over the past year. (Source: Google Finance) Sandbox ‘Driving Russian Mining Investment’ Girya added that over the next two to three years, more of the coins mined in Russian jurisdiction will be used in the national economy. He pointed to the Central Bank-run “experimental legal regime (ELR)” as evidence. The ELR is a crypto sandbox comprising exchange firms, cross-border trade companies, and Bitcoin miners. The bank is using the ELR as a means of bypassing US, EU, and UK-led sanctions on Russia. The sanctions have effectively frozen Russian firms and banks out of dollar-denominated trade. US strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites have shown the limits of Russia’s ability to defend its allies. It might yet be to Putin’s advantage https://t.co/CPVjHmgLt4 — Bloomberg (@business) June 23, 2025 Central Bank officials want crypto miners to sell their coins to exchanges within the sandbox. These exchanges can then use their coins to facilitate cross-border trades conducted in BTC or other tokens. Girya called the ELR a “powerful step toward the institutionalization of the crypto and digital currencies market.” He said that it would help “increase the inflow of investments into this new class of assets.” More Coal-powered Bitcoin Miners Heading to Siberia? Meanwhile, the authorities in the Kuznetsk Basin, a major coal-mining region in Southwestern Siberia, have proposed a Bitcoin mining -themed solution to the problem of coal depreciation. The news outlet Tsargrad’s Kemerovo Oblast branch reported that the region’s government is mulling a proposal to build crypto farms and greenhouse complexes near its coal mines. U.S. investor and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano announced on Monday the creation of a new bitcoin treasury company that would hold up to $1 billion of the world's largest cryptocurrency on its balance sheet. https://t.co/Gc30pO8Qkr — Reuters Legal (@ReutersLegal) June 23, 2025 The region’s Governor, Ilya Seredyuk, said the area’s coal could “be used to generate the energy needed to mine Bitcoin and other cryptoassets.” Seredyuk said tests are now underway as miners conduct economic calculations to determine the profitability of the plan. He said the results would be published in around a month’s time. The Governor said the BTC mining plan could help reverse a recent decline in coal mining. He also suggested that the heat released by burning coal could be used to heat greenhouses that house tropical plants – in one of the world’s most famously cold areas. He mused: “Why not create a large botanical garden and cultivate plants that require warmth?” Earlier this month, a Russian power firm announced the launch of the nation’s first bitcoin mining-focused closed-end mutual investment fund (CEF) .

Potential 12% Retrace To $92,000 Technical analyst Doctor Profit recently shared key notes on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), indicating that a substantial Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap exists at $92,000. The analyst predicts that this level will likely be eventually reached, suggesting that closing this gap could create additional fear in the market, which often plays into the hands of market makers. Related Reading: Dogecoin Crash Far From Over? Analyst Reveals The Target Doctor Profit also highlighted in his analysis the presence of significant liquidity in that area, making it a probable target for Bitcoin in the near term. This could potentially mean a 12% retrace of BTC’s price. Doctor Profit also pointed to several technical indicators that suggest a bearish trend for Bitcoin. He highlighted the Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) crossing on the daily chart and the breakdown of the critical $104,000 level. Additionally, the analyst mentioned the temporary loss of what he calls the “golden line,” which is currently situated around $103,000 for BTC, another key level to watch in order to accomplish further recoveries. Doctor Profit warned that caution is necessary, especially near pivotal levels like $100,000 and the CME gap at $92,000. He even posited that a worst-case scenario could see Bitcoin correcting all the way down to the $82,000–$84,000 range. Bitcoin Fate Hangs On Golden Line Doctor Profit further elaborated that the situation hinges on the golden line, which serves as a critical retest to confirm the breakdown that occurred yesterday. For Bitcoin to secure a bullish continuation, it needs to close above this level. Moreover, he identified a significant liquidity cluster around the $113,000 mark, noting that this area is rife with short liquidations. Should Bitcoin consolidate above the golden line, the uncertainty that has plagued traders could dissipate, allowing for a shift from protective strategies back to a more bullish outlook. Related Reading: XRP Price At Risk Of 20% Crash To $1.55 If This Level Fails To Hold In his analysis, Doctor Profit concluded by stating that while he initially expected Bitcoin to reach $90,000 before any new all-time highs (ATH), the resolution of current market uncertainty indicates that this may no longer be necessary. With the war between Israel and Iran, along with the volatility seemingly over, he believes Bitcoin can accelerate toward new all-time highs without the need to revisit the $90,000 mark. When writing, BTC trades at $105,560, recording a 3% price surge in the 24-hour time frame. At this level, the market’s leading cryptocurrency trails 5.3% below its record high of $111,800.

Litecoin Traders Betting Big,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoin-finance-mint-crypto-millionaires-alongside-ethereum-and-solana-litecoin-traders-betting-big/,"As the 2025 crypto cycle intensifies, investors are searching for the next altcoin capable of delivering life-changing returns. Ethereum and Solana have set the precedent for explosive growth, but a new contender— MAGACOIN FINANCE —is emerging as the altcoin to watch for those aiming to join the next wave of crypto millionaires. Litecoin traders are taking notice and placing bold bets on this high-upside early opportunity. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Contender MAGACOIN FINANCE has distinguished itself with a record-breaking presale, raising over $10 million and selling out each phase swiftly. Its capped 170 billion token supply, audited smart contracts, and 100% community ownership set a new bar for early-stage projects. Unlike short-lived meme tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction through disciplined execution, strong community support, and a scarcity-first model fueling real market demand. Some forecasts suggest up to %18,500 upside as the project approaches its $0.007 listing target. This mix of professionalism, viral engagement, and structural clarity positions MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top candidate for early-stage wealth creation.

This week, the cryptocurrency world is abuzz with news surrounding ProCapBTC Bitcoin , the publicly traded firm spearheaded by well-known crypto advocate Anthony Pompliano. The company has made a substantial acquisition, purchasing 3,724 Bitcoin, valued at an impressive $386.5 million. This bold move isn’t just a one-off transaction; it’s a pivotal step in ProCapBTC’s ambitious goal to accumulate up to $1 billion in Bitcoin, signaling a profound shift in corporate treasury strategies and further cementing the trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . Let’s dive deep into what this means for the future of finance and why this strategic play is capturing the attention of investors worldwide. Who is Anthony Pompliano and Why Does His Bitcoin Vision Matter? To truly understand the significance of ProCapBTC’s recent actions, one must first appreciate the mind behind it: Anthony Pompliano. Often referred to simply as ‘Pomp,’ he is a figure synonymous with Bitcoin advocacy and innovation within the crypto space. A former Facebook and Snapchat product manager, Pompliano transitioned into the world of digital assets with an unwavering conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. His influence extends far beyond his ventures; he’s a prolific writer, podcaster, and investor, known for his ability to articulate complex financial concepts in an accessible manner. Pomp’s early and consistent championing of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ and a hedge against inflation has resonated with a vast audience, from retail investors to institutional heavyweights. His vision for Bitcoin is not merely speculative; it’s rooted in fundamental economic principles and a belief in decentralized, censorship-resistant money. Pompliano has consistently argued that Bitcoin represents a generational opportunity, a paradigm shift in how value is stored and transferred. His public persona and educational efforts have played a crucial role in demystifying Bitcoin for traditional investors, paving the way for greater acceptance and, crucially, greater institutional participation. When a figure of Pompliano’s stature makes such a significant move through a publicly traded entity like ProCapBTC, it sends a clear signal: the future of finance is increasingly intertwined with Bitcoin. ProCapBTC Bitcoin: A New Era of Corporate Treasury Strategy? ProCapBTC, founded by Anthony Pompliano, isn’t just another crypto fund. Its status as a publicly traded firm adds a layer of transparency and accessibility that distinguishes it from many private investment vehicles in the crypto sphere. This structure allows traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated entity, bridging the gap between conventional finance and the burgeoning digital asset market. The recent acquisition of 3,724 Bitcoin, reportedly at an average price of $103,780 per coin, underscores ProCapBTC’s aggressive yet calculated approach to its treasury management. This single purchase, valued at $386.5 million, represents a substantial commitment and a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s current valuation and future trajectory. What makes this particular ProCapBTC Bitcoin purchase noteworthy is not just its size, but its context. It’s part of a larger, pre-announced strategy to accumulate up to $1 billion in Bitcoin. This isn’t a speculative gamble; it’s a deliberate, long-term Bitcoin Investment Strategy . For publicly traded companies, allocating such a significant portion of their capital to a volatile asset like Bitcoin is a bold move that speaks volumes about their conviction. It reflects a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations to consider Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, similar to how cash or gold might have been viewed in the past. This shift is driven by several factors: Inflationary Pressures: As central banks continue quantitative easing, companies are seeking assets that can preserve purchasing power. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin provides a non-correlated asset to traditional portfolios. Future-Proofing: Recognizing the inevitable shift towards a more digitized global economy. Shareholder Value: A belief that holding Bitcoin will ultimately enhance long-term shareholder value. This move by ProCapBTC could serve as a blueprint for other publicly traded companies considering a similar allocation, potentially sparking a domino effect across corporate America and beyond. The Ambitious $1 Billion Bitcoin Accumulation Plan Unpacked The announcement that ProCapBTC is targeting a total of $1 billion in Bitcoin Accumulation is a significant statement of intent. This isn’t just about buying a few coins; it’s about establishing a substantial, strategic reserve. To put this into perspective, a $1 billion Bitcoin holding would place ProCapBTC among the top corporate holders of Bitcoin globally, alongside giants like MicroStrategy and Tesla. This long-term accumulation strategy suggests a belief that Bitcoin’s value will continue to appreciate significantly over time, making it a superior store of value compared to traditional assets. What does a billion-dollar Bitcoin Accumulation plan entail? Phased Purchases: It’s likely that ProCapBTC will continue to make periodic purchases, potentially employing a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate volatility risks. Strategic Funding: The plan relies on ‘strategic funding,’ which could involve a mix of equity raises, debt financing, or cash flow generation specifically earmarked for Bitcoin acquisitions. Long-Term Horizon: This isn’t a short-term trading play. The $1 billion target indicates a multi-year commitment to holding Bitcoin as a core asset. Market Impact: Consistent, large-scale buying by a publicly visible entity like ProCapBTC could create sustained buying pressure, potentially influencing Bitcoin’s price trajectory. The commitment to such a large-scale Bitcoin accumulation plan by a firm led by Anthony Pompliano further validates Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate asset class for institutional portfolios. It signals confidence not just in Bitcoin’s technology, but in its monetary policy and its potential to become a global reserve asset in the digital age. Driving Forces Behind Growing Institutional Bitcoin Adoption ProCapBTC’s move is not an isolated incident but rather a powerful example of a broader trend: the accelerating pace of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . For years, Bitcoin was primarily the domain of individual investors and tech enthusiasts. However, over the last few years, a confluence of factors has led traditional financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds to seriously consider, and in many cases, actively invest in Bitcoin. What’s driving this seismic shift? Macroeconomic Environment: Unprecedented levels of global debt, quantitative easing, and inflation concerns have pushed institutions to seek alternative assets that can act as a hedge against currency debasement. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, fits this narrative perfectly. Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies are becoming clearer in many jurisdictions. The approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in various regions, for example, has provided a regulated and accessible pathway for institutional investors to gain exposure without directly holding the asset. Improved Infrastructure: The maturation of the crypto ecosystem, including robust custodial solutions, institutional-grade trading platforms, and sophisticated financial products, has made it easier and safer for large entities to engage with Bitcoin. Performance and Track Record: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin’s long-term performance has been exceptional, outperforming most traditional asset classes over various timeframes. This undeniable track record makes it increasingly difficult for fiduciaries to ignore. Growing Public Acceptance: As more companies, payment processors, and even governments explore blockchain technology and digital currencies, public perception of Bitcoin is shifting from a niche technology to a legitimate financial innovation. This wave of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption is fundamentally transforming the market. It brings greater liquidity, reduces volatility (over the long term), and lends significant credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate and essential component of a diversified investment portfolio. ProCapBTC, under Pompliano’s leadership, is not just participating in this trend; it’s actively driving it forward. Decoding ProCapBTC’s Bitcoin Investment Strategy: What Can We Learn? ProCapBTC’s approach to its Bitcoin Investment Strategy offers valuable insights for both institutional and retail investors. It’s clear that their strategy is built on a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and its potential for long-term appreciation. Here are some key takeaways: Benefits of Their Approach: Long-Term Horizon: By committing to a $1 billion accumulation, ProCapBTC demonstrates a belief in Bitcoin’s multi-year growth trajectory, signaling that short-term price fluctuations are less relevant than the long-term vision. Strategic Accumulation: Instead of a single, massive buy, a phased accumulation plan allows for dollar-cost averaging, potentially reducing the average purchase price and mitigating risk from market volatility. Transparency for Investors: As a publicly traded company, ProCapBTC provides a regulated avenue for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, which can be particularly appealing to those who prefer not to directly manage crypto assets. Leading by Example: ProCapBTC’s actions serve as a powerful example for other corporations and institutions considering Bitcoin as a treasury asset, accelerating the broader trend of institutional adoption. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. While long-term holders aim to ride out the swings, short-to-medium term fluctuations can impact financial reporting and investor sentiment. Regulatory Landscape: Despite improvements, the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving and varies significantly across jurisdictions, posing potential challenges for large-scale operations. Security Risks: Managing large quantities of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security protocols to protect against hacks and theft, a constant concern in the digital asset space. Public Scrutiny: As a publicly traded company, ProCapBTC’s Bitcoin strategy will be under constant scrutiny from shareholders, analysts, and the media, requiring clear communication and justification. Actionable Insights for Retail Investors: While most retail investors don’t have billions to deploy, ProCapBTC’s strategy offers valuable lessons: Conviction is Key: Invest in assets you truly understand and believe in for the long term. Pomp’s unwavering conviction in Bitcoin is a testament to this. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Regularly investing a fixed amount, regardless of price, can be an effective way to accumulate assets over time and reduce the impact of volatility. Research and Education: Follow thought leaders like Anthony Pompliano, read whitepapers, and stay informed about market trends. Knowledge is your best defense against market FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). Diversification (within reason): While ProCapBTC is heavily concentrated in Bitcoin, the broader lesson is to consider how alternative assets can complement your existing portfolio. ProCapBTC’s strategic move is more than just a large purchase; it’s a meticulously planned Bitcoin Investment Strategy that aims to capitalize on what its founder believes is the most significant financial innovation of our time. Conclusion: Paving the Way for Bitcoin’s Future ProCapBTC’s substantial acquisition of 3,724 Bitcoin, as part of its ambitious $1 billion accumulation plan, is a powerful indicator of the growing confidence in digital assets among institutional players. Led by the visionary Anthony Pompliano, this move not only strengthens ProCapBTC’s position but also reinforces the broader trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . It highlights Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance as a legitimate store of value and a strategic treasury asset for corporations navigating an uncertain economic future. As more firms follow suit, these large-scale investments are poised to profoundly impact Bitcoin’s market dynamics, liquidity, and overall legitimacy. This isn’t just about a company buying Bitcoin; it’s about a fundamental shift in how the world views and integrates this revolutionary digital asset into the global financial fabric. The path ahead for Bitcoin appears increasingly paved by the strategic actions of influential entities like ProCapBTC, cementing its role as a cornerstone of the future financial landscape.

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/heres-what-15000-xrp-investment-could-become-when-xrp-hits-8/,"XRP investors maintaining medium-sized portfolios may stand to gain considerably if the asset price climbs to $8. While cryptocurrency markets have faced instability in recent months, analysts remain divided on the timeline for such a surge, but the potential return remains attractive to many holders. Price Target and Market Capitalization Outlook The token is currently trading at around $2.19 . To reach the projected $8 mark, the token would need to increase by approximately 270%. If the supply stays fixed at 58.93 billion tokens, an $8 valuation would result in a market capitalization near $471 billion, significantly above its current market cap of roughly $127 billion. This potential growth trajectory represents a major shift for XRP, which last peaked at $3.84 in January 2018. A climb to $8 would not only set a new all-time high but also signal a broader recovery for the token. Forecasts from Industry Analysts The possibility of XRP hitting $8 by year-end has been the subject of various expert analyses. George Tung, founder of the cryptocurrency platform CryptosRUs, described $8 as a realistic price target. He attributes this outlook to rising institutional interest, citing the growing number of spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. Similarly, a community analyst known as Xena also supports the $8 projection but argues that it may underestimate the token’s potential. This reflects a sentiment among some XRP supporters that higher price targets are within reach given favourable market conditions. Another analyst, the pseudonymous Bearable Bull, has claimed that XRP is positioned to enter a new growth phase if it reaches the $8 mark. According to him, such a milestone would indicate a turning point in XRP’s long-term trajectory. Not all analysts agree on the timing. For example, crypto exchange platform Changelly projects that XRP might not reach the $8 threshold until 2028, suggesting a more gradual path upward. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Returns for Investors Holding 15,000 XRP For those currently holding 15,000 XRP, the financial implications of a price surge to $8 are substantial. At the current market rate of $2.19, 15,000 XRP is valued at $32,850. If the price increases to $8, the holding would be worth $120,000, resulting in a profit of $87,150. This scenario is relevant for many investors. According to XRP Rich List data , over 167,000 wallets currently contain between 10,000 and 25,000 XRP. The projected returns also apply proportionally to other holdings. For instance, an investor with 5,000 XRP, currently valued at $10,800, would see that amount increase to $40,000 if XRP reaches $8. Recent Market Activity XRP’s performance has shown some resilience in the face of broader market volatility. Over the past week, the token temporarily dropped below $2 amid geopolitical concerns, particularly related to tensions in the Middle East. However, it rebounded above $2 following the announcement of a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, reportedly facilitated by U.S. President Donald Trump. This rebound supports short-term optimism, although whether the token can maintain momentum and achieve the $8 target remains uncertain. The potential for XRP to reach $8 has sparked renewed interest among retail and institutional investors. A holder with 15,000 XRP could see their assets grow by over $87,000 if the forecast materializes. Still, investors should recognize that such projections depend on multiple variables, including market stability, regulatory developments, and sustained institutional demand.

For too long, the cryptocurrency industry in the United States has operated under a patchwork of outdated rules, leading to uncertainty and hindering innovation. But now, a significant development is on the horizon that promises to bring much-needed clarity to the crypto market structure . What is the Buzz About US Crypto Regulation? In a move that signals a serious commitment to establishing a robust framework for the digital economy, a group of influential Senate Republicans has outlined a set of key principles for upcoming legislation. Senators Tim Scott, Cynthia Lummis, Bill Hagerty, and Thom Tillis are leading this charge, aiming to provide a clear roadmap for how digital assets will be governed in the U.S. This initiative is a crucial step towards fostering a secure and innovative environment for all participants in the crypto space. The absence of clear US crypto regulation has often been cited as a major barrier to institutional adoption and broader public trust. Companies have struggled to navigate conflicting guidelines from various agencies, while investors have faced uncertainty regarding asset classifications and consumer protections. This new framework seeks to address these long-standing issues head-on, promising a more predictable and fair playing field. Unpacking the Senate Republicans’ Crypto Market Structure Principles The principles laid out by these Senate Republicans Crypto champions are designed to tackle the most pressing regulatory challenges facing the industry. While the full bill draft is still awaited, as reported by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett via X, the outlined principles give us a strong indication of their legislative intent. Let’s delve into each of these foundational pillars: Clarifying the Legal Status of Digital Assets: One of the most contentious issues in the crypto world is whether a digital asset should be classified as a security or a commodity. This distinction has profound implications for which regulatory body (e.g., SEC or CFTC) has jurisdiction. The new framework aims to provide clear definitions, reducing ambiguity and fostering legal certainty for developers and investors alike. Enhancing Regulatory Accountability: The proposed principles seek to ensure that regulators are held accountable for their actions and decisions. This means establishing transparent processes and clear mandates for agencies overseeing the digital asset space, preventing arbitrary enforcement and promoting consistent application of rules. Modernizing Outdated Rules: Current financial regulations were not designed with blockchain technology in mind. This initiative aims to update existing laws and create new ones that are fit for purpose, recognizing the unique characteristics of digital assets and the underlying technology. Protecting Trader Rights: Safeguarding investors and users is paramount. The framework emphasizes robust protections for individuals participating in the crypto market, including clear disclosure requirements, fraud prevention measures, and mechanisms for redress. Strengthening Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Measures: Ensuring the integrity of the financial system is a core objective. The principles advocate for robust AML and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures within the digital asset ecosystem, aligning with international standards and national security interests. Ensuring Clear Guidance from Regulators: The industry thrives on predictability. The framework calls for regulators to provide unambiguous and timely guidance, allowing businesses to innovate and operate with confidence, rather than fear of sudden policy shifts. Why is Digital Asset Legislation Crucial Now? The urgency for comprehensive digital asset legislation cannot be overstated. The United States has the potential to be a global leader in blockchain innovation, but a lack of regulatory clarity has often pushed talent and capital overseas. Clear rules will not only protect consumers but also unlock significant economic opportunities. Consider the benefits: Boosted Innovation: With a predictable regulatory environment, startups and established companies alike can invest more confidently in developing new blockchain applications and services. Increased Investor Confidence: Clear rules on asset classification and consumer protection will make the crypto market more attractive to both retail and institutional investors, fostering greater participation. Enhanced Market Integrity: Stronger AML measures and regulatory oversight will help weed out illicit activities, making the crypto space safer and more reputable. Global Competitiveness: A well-defined regulatory framework will position the U.S. as a desirable hub for crypto businesses, attracting foreign investment and talent. However, crafting such legislation is not without its challenges. The bipartisan nature of such a bill will be critical, requiring compromise and a deep understanding of complex technological concepts from lawmakers. Balancing innovation with investor protection and national security concerns is a delicate act. Navigating the Future of Blockchain Policy These principles represent a significant step in shaping future blockchain policy in the United States. While the full bill is yet to be seen, the bipartisan effort, especially from senators like Cynthia Lummis who has been a vocal proponent of sensible crypto regulation, offers a glimmer of hope for the industry. The focus on foundational issues like legal clarity and regulatory accountability is precisely what the market has been clamoring for. The coming months will be critical as the legislative process unfolds. Industry stakeholders, consumer advocacy groups, and technology experts will likely engage with lawmakers to provide input, ensuring that the final bill is both effective and forward-thinking. This collaborative approach is essential to create a framework that truly serves the needs of a rapidly evolving digital economy. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? For investors, businesses, and developers, these outlined principles signal a potential shift from regulatory uncertainty to a more structured and predictable environment. A well-defined crypto market structure could lead to: Greater Institutional Participation: Large financial institutions often require clear regulatory guidelines before committing significant capital to new asset classes. This framework could pave the way for more traditional finance players to enter the crypto space. New Product Development: With clearer rules, companies can confidently develop and offer new crypto-related products and services, from regulated stablecoins to tokenized real-world assets. Reduced Regulatory Risk: Businesses operating within the U.S. will have a better understanding of what is expected of them, reducing the risk of unexpected enforcement actions. While the journey to comprehensive legislation is often long and complex, the release of these principles by influential Senate Republicans is an undeniably positive development. It underscores a growing recognition within Washington of the importance of digital assets and the urgent need for a regulatory framework that supports innovation while protecting consumers and ensuring market integrity. In Conclusion: A Path Towards Clarity The unveiling of these core principles by Senate Republicans marks a pivotal moment for the U.S. crypto industry. It signifies a concrete step towards establishing a much-needed, clear regulatory environment that can foster innovation, protect investors, and solidify America’s position in the global digital economy. As the full bill draft emerges, the crypto community will be watching closely, hopeful that these principles translate into effective and forward-thinking digital asset legislation .

This figure marks a major milestone for the network as it reflects its growing dominance in the stablecoin market. Tron’s $80B USDT Milestone Since late 2020, Tron has experienced parabolic growth in USDT issuance, with notable spikes during bull markets. In 2021, supply jumped from $6.71 billion to $39.41 billion. This accounts for an increase of nearly 488%. The upward trend continued into 2025, as it rose from $59.76 billion at the start of the year to $80.76 billion as of mid-year. On November 13, 2024, Tron overtook Ethereum in total USDT circulation for the first time in three years, which highlighted user preference for its lower fees and faster transaction speeds. Importantly, Tron’s USDT growth has not been limited to bullish periods. During the relatively stagnant 2022-2023 cycle, the supply on the network still climbed steadily, amidst steady demand and adoption. Tron-Powered $2B Tether Mint The latest development comes just two days after the Tether Treasury minted $2 billion USDT on the Tron blockchain, in what appears to be the largest issuance in recent months. This was executed solely on Tron, which highlighted the blockchain’s role as Tether’s preferred network for large-scale liquidity operations due to its speed, scalability, and negligible transaction costs. The event was swiftly followed by a sharp uptick in stablecoin inflows to centralized exchanges. Interestingly, HTX Global received a net inflow of $1.24 billion in stablecoins within hours. CryptoQuant explained that such inflows often precede increased spot and derivatives activity, particularly in bullish market setups where traders seek to capitalize on short-term price movements or prepare for breakouts. Zooming out, the timing and scale of this mint suggest a strategic effort to prepare the market for upward price action. For Bitcoin, the influx of stablecoin liquidity translates into greater buying power. As traders respond to improved exchange liquidity, Bitcoin could see upward price pressure fueled by the fresh capital deployment.

Vulnerability exploits: Taking advantage of weaknesses in smart contracts or exchange infrastructure. Insider threats: Malicious actions by individuals within the organization. Private key compromise: Unauthorized access to critical cryptographic keys. Regardless of the vector, a loss of this magnitude is a severe blow, demanding immediate and decisive action. The speed with which Nobitex has moved towards service resumption suggests a concerted effort behind the scenes, likely involving forensic investigations, security audits, and potentially, negotiations or recovery efforts that are not publicly disclosed. This period of intense activity is critical for any exchange undergoing a crypto hack recovery , aiming to identify vulnerabilities and prevent future occurrences. A Phased Approach to Service Resumption : What to Expect? Nobitex’s announcement via X outlined a clear, phased strategy for its return, signaling a cautious but determined path forward: June 25 onwards: The exchange will begin its phased re-opening, gradually bringing services back online. This initial phase likely focuses on internal systems checks and ensuring the stability of the platform before full public access. June 30: Full functionality is expected to resume, including deposits, withdrawals, and trading functions. This is the critical date for users, allowing them to regain access to their funds and resume market activities. This phased approach is a common and prudent strategy for exchanges recovering from security incidents. It allows for incremental testing and monitoring, minimizing the risk of further issues. For users, it means a structured return to normalcy, though vigilance remains paramount. The promise of a full service resumption is a huge relief for those who had funds locked on the platform. Beyond the Breach: The Future of Cryptocurrency Security The Nobitex incident serves as a stark reminder of the ever-present risks in the digital asset space. For exchanges, the imperative to invest heavily in robust cryptocurrency security measures cannot be overstated. This includes: Multi-factor authentication (MFA): For both users and internal systems. Cold storage solutions: Keeping a significant portion of assets offline. Regular security audits: Engaging third-party experts to identify vulnerabilities. Bug bounty programs: Incentivizing ethical hackers to find flaws. Incident response plans: Having a clear strategy for handling breaches. For users, the lessons are equally vital: always use strong, unique passwords, enable MFA, and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. The landscape of cryptocurrency security is constantly evolving, and staying informed is key to protecting digital assets. A Resilient Comeback or a Risky Gamble? Nobitex’s rapid move towards service resumption after such a significant hack demonstrates a remarkable degree of resilience, or perhaps, an urgent necessity in a market with limited alternatives. While the comeback is certainly positive news for its users, it also places the exchange under intense scrutiny regarding its enhanced security protocols. The incident underscores the critical importance of robust cryptocurrency security for all platforms, especially those operating in complex geopolitical environments. As Nobitex re-opens its doors, the global crypto community will be watching closely to see how this prominent Iranian crypto exchange navigates its path forward, aiming to rebuild trust and ensure the safety of its users’ digital assets.

Some assets are showing solid growth potential. Uniswap (UNI) is gaining momentum again, rising 7% and aiming for the key $10 mark. This could spark even more gains. Ethereum (ETH) remains strong as well. Technical signals suggest it could climb above $2,000, thanks to steady network upgrades. Meanwhile, a newer project, Unstaked (UNSD) , is catching the spotlight. It has a major $1,000,000 giveaway underway to boost demand and grow its community. These trends show that crypto projects with real utility and strong communities are now leading the market. For buyers, this means more opportunities to get involved in valuable projects as the crypto space continues to expand. Uniswap Eyes $10 Price Milestone Soon Uniswap’s UNI token has recently surged by 7.33%, moving from approximately $6.98 to $7.72 in early Monday trading. This significant rise followed the token’s successful break above the key resistance level near $7.65 during Asian market hours. Trading volumes also saw a notable increase, especially around 08:00 GMT, highlighting growing market interest. The technical charts reveal higher lows and a breakout from the previous consolidation range, pushing UNI to levels last seen in late March. According to analyst Ali Martinez, UNI may soon reach the $10 mark if the current trend holds steady. Support remains at $6.98 while resistance near $7.70 continues to attract trader attention as momentum builds. ETH Bulls Target $3,000 Price Level Ethereum (ETH) is demonstrating renewed strength after falling below $2,500, with prices now climbing above $2,600 and showing potential for further gains. Prior to the weekend decline, ETH had formed a bullish flag pattern that hinted at a possible $3,000 retest, though bearish pressure temporarily interrupted that trajectory. Strong support remains between $2,311 and $2,392, with more than 2.4 million addresses still holding ETH at a profit within this range. The path between $2,631 and $3,027 appears less congested, suggesting the potential for an upward breakout. Large buyers have recently added nearly 600,000 ETH to their holdings. Indicators such as the Bull Bear Power (BBP) reflect strong bullish momentum, possibly propelling ETH toward $2,880 or $3,000. Unstaked Combines AI and Blockchain to Deliver Impressive Growth Potential Unstaked continues to attract significant attention within the cryptocurrency space by blending artificial intelligence with blockchain technology in an innovative manner. The project will enable users to deploy AI agents that can manage various tasks such as community interactions, content creation, and engagement across major social platforms including Twitter and Telegram. The presale has already raised over $10.4 million at Stage 21. The token is currently priced at approximately $0.011739, with an intended launch price near $0.182, offering early participants the potential for a 27 times return on asset. The platform’s Proof of Intelligence system ensures that every action performed by the AI agents is recorded on the blockchain. This provides full transparency and makes each interaction verifiable and measurable. Rewards are distributed based on actual AI performance, which positions Unstaked as one of the few platforms where utility is clearly connected to user incentives. A major highlight of the project is its active community involvement. A large $1 million giveaway campaign is currently running over five months. Twenty winners will each receive fifty thousand dollars worth of tokens. Participation is encouraged through simple actions such as sharing social content, referring friends, or purchasing a minimum token amount. Unlike many projects that claim to offer live products, Unstaked confirms that its AI agents will only become operational after the presale concludes and the official launch takes place. This strong utility focus combined with active community growth makes Unstaked a highly promising project. Final Verdict Recent market movements from projects such as Uniswap and Ethereum, combined with the growing traction of Unstaked, highlight the increasing strength within the cryptocurrency sector. Both UNI and ETH continue to benefit from solid technical fundamentals and rising buyer confidence. Ethereum maintains its leadership in smart contract infrastructure, while Uniswap continues as a dominant decentralized exchange. Meanwhile, Unstaked is carving a distinct position by offering advanced AI-driven utility with transparent, on-chain rewards. The project’s expanding presale success and active community engagement suggest strong future prospects. For buyers focusing on adoption trends and innovative platforms, Unstaked, along with UNI and ETH, remains well positioned to drive the next phase of market growth.

Bitcoin and Solana Traders Follow XRP and Uniswap,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-magacoin-finance-nearing-a-major-milestone-bitcoin-and-solana-traders-follow-xrp-and-uniswap/,"As capital rotation intensifies across the digital asset market, a growing number of seasoned investors are shifting their focus from large caps to high-potential new entrants. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most followed early-stage projects , with notable attention from Bitcoin, Solana, XRP, and Uniswap traders as it edges closer to a critical milestone. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE has already raised over $10 million through its structured pre-sale, with each phase consistently oversubscribed. Its capped supply of 170 billion tokens, verified HashEx audit, and fully community-owned governance model highlight a commitment to transparency and scarcity. With no venture capital influence and built-in staking rewards, the project appeals to both individual and institutional investors seeking fundamentals-driven upside. As participants rebalance from established assets like Bitcoin and XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing strong momentum ahead of its anticipated public launch. Bitcoin: Profits Fueling Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin’s price continues to consolidate above the $105,000 mark. While it remains the market anchor, profit-taking from BTC’s recent performance is channeling capital into smaller altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, setting the stage for the next wave of breakout candidates. Solana: Strong Ecosystem, Seeking Fresh Catalysts Solana maintains high developer engagement and ecosystem growth. Yet with price action leveling out, some traders are reallocating to emerging opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE in search of more dynamic returns. XRP: Diversifying for Early-Stage Upside XRP has seen renewed attention in recent months, but its current consolidation phase is prompting many holders to diversify into newer assets with clear tokenomic advantages—traits reflected strongly in MAGACOIN FINANCE’s structure and rollout. Uniswap: DeFi Traders Seek Value in New Entrants Uniswap continues to dominate decentralized exchange activity. Still, with market growth normalizing, UNI holders are branching out to early-stage projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, drawn by its transparent architecture and growing community base. Conclusion With a disciplined structure, transparent governance, and accelerating investor interest from across multiple major communities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming a standout in today’s altcoin landscape. As early supporters position ahead of its next milestone, the project is increasingly viewed as one of the most compelling altcoin opportunities currently in focus.

This move, while not unexpected given the SEC’s cautious stance on novel financial products, casts a shadow of uncertainty over the immediate future of Polkadot (DOT) gaining mainstream investment access through an exchange-traded fund. Understanding the Polkadot ETF: A Gateway to Innovation? For many in the digital asset space, a Polkadot ETF represents a significant step towards broader institutional adoption and easier access for retail investors. Unlike directly buying and holding DOT cryptocurrency, an ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to Polkadot’s price movements through traditional brokerage accounts, sidestepping the complexities of crypto exchanges, wallets, and custody. Polkadot, often hailed as a ‘blockchain of blockchains,’ aims to connect various specialized blockchains (parachains) into a single, scalable, and interoperable network. This unique architecture, along with its robust governance model, makes DOT a compelling asset for diversification within the crypto landscape. A spot ETF would directly hold DOT, providing a regulated investment vehicle that mirrors the asset’s real-time price. Decoding the SEC Delay: Why the Caution? The recent SEC Delay on the 21Shares Polkadot ETF application is a familiar pattern for anyone following the crypto market. The regulatory body has consistently cited concerns regarding investor protection, market manipulation, and the nascent nature of crypto markets as reasons for postponing decisions on spot crypto ETFs. While the SEC has approved Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs, and more recently, spot Bitcoin ETFs, their approach to altcoin spot ETFs remains highly conservative. The SEC’s primary mandate is to protect investors and ensure fair and orderly markets. When reviewing an ETF application, they scrutinize several factors, including: Market Surveillance: Can the underlying market (Polkadot spot market) be adequately monitored to prevent fraud and manipulation? Custody Solutions: Are the proposed custody arrangements for the underlying DOT secure and robust? Valuation Methodologies: How will the ETF accurately price its assets, especially in volatile markets? Liquidity: Is there sufficient liquidity in the Polkadot spot market to support an ETF? The delay provides the SEC with more time to deliberate on these complex issues, especially for an asset like Polkadot which, while prominent, does not have the same market depth or regulatory clarity as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The Broader Picture: Navigating the Spot Crypto ETF Landscape The journey for any Spot Crypto ETF in the U.S. has been arduous. Bitcoin’s path to a spot ETF took over a decade, marked by numerous rejections before finally gaining approval in early 2024. Ethereum’s spot ETF applications are currently under review, facing similar scrutiny. The SEC’s hesitation with altcoins like Polkadot is amplified by concerns about their classification (security vs. commodity), liquidity, and potential for market manipulation compared to the more established Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has, however, set a precedent and arguably opened the door for other cryptocurrencies. Yet, each altcoin presents its unique set of challenges. The SEC often looks for a regulated market of significant size for the underlying asset. While Polkadot is a top-tier cryptocurrency by market capitalization, it still lacks the extensive regulatory oversight seen in traditional financial markets. 21Shares: A Pioneer in the Crypto ETF Race The firm behind this application, 21Shares , is no stranger to the crypto ETF arena. As one of the leading global issuers of cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs), 21Shares has a strong track record of bringing innovative crypto investment vehicles to market, particularly in Europe. They were among the first to launch a Bitcoin ETP in Europe and have since expanded their offerings to include various altcoins. Their partnership with Ark Invest has also been instrumental in their U.S. efforts. Their persistent efforts to bring a Polkadot ETF to the U.S. market underscore the growing institutional demand for diversified crypto exposure beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. 21Shares’ expertise in structuring and managing crypto ETPs provides a strong foundation for their application, but ultimately, the decision rests with the SEC’s evolving regulatory framework. What This Means for DOT Cryptocurrency and Its Ecosystem? For holders and enthusiasts of DOT Cryptocurrency , the SEC delay is a moment of pause, not necessarily a halt. While an ETF approval would undoubtedly provide a significant price catalyst due to increased institutional demand and liquidity, the Polkadot ecosystem continues to build and innovate regardless of regulatory timelines. Polkadot’s strength lies in its technical advancements, vibrant developer community, and growing number of parachains and decentralized applications. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead: Challenges: Prolonged regulatory uncertainty can deter some institutional investors. The lack of a clear classification for DOT by the SEC adds complexity. Opportunities: The delay allows the Polkadot ecosystem to mature further, addressing any potential SEC concerns regarding market integrity and liquidity. It also provides time for more education and advocacy regarding Polkadot’s unique value proposition. The market’s reaction to such delays is often muted, as they are largely anticipated. However, the long-term trajectory for Polkadot and other altcoins gaining ETF approval remains positive as the regulatory landscape gradually adapts to the digital asset revolution. Looking Ahead: The Path to Broader Adoption The SEC’s decision on the 21Shares Polkadot ETF is more than just about one asset; it’s a barometer for the broader acceptance of altcoin ETFs in the U.S. While the current delay might test patience, it also highlights the thoroughness of the regulatory process. As the crypto market matures and gains more clarity, the prospect of diverse spot crypto ETFs becoming a reality seems increasingly likely, paving the way for easier, regulated access to assets like Polkadot. The journey towards mainstream adoption is often incremental, marked by regulatory milestones and industry innovation. The Polkadot ETF saga is another chapter in this ongoing narrative, underscoring the dynamic interplay between technological advancement and regulatory oversight in the evolving world of digital finance.

One moment shows a bullish setup, the next flashes a warning sign. PEPE’s price action is a clear example. A bullish flag is forming, yet a whale just offloaded 2.2 trillion tokens at a $3.5 million loss. HYPE is sending mixed messages too. Eyenovia just announced a $50 million investment, yet the token slipped below $40 as traders took profits. These patterns always seem full of promise until the momentum fades. That is why Web3 ai ($WAI) feels like a shift. It is not just reading charts, it is rewriting how we use them. With $8.5 million raised and 23.4 billion tokens sold, this platform is building substance while others drift in signals. Whale Exit Shakes Confidence as PEPE Eyes Breakout Setup The PEPE price trend is caught in a tug-of-war between bearish sentiment and a bullish chart formation. A major whale recently exited with 2.2 trillion tokens on Binance, taking a $3.5 million loss. Moves like this often suggest fading confidence and increase the odds of near-term weakness. Yet on the technical side, PEPE has formed a bullish flag on the daily chart. If the price pushes above the flag’s upper line, a move toward $0.00002051 is possible. Still, with RSI hovering near oversold and momentum stalling, bulls need confirmation before any breakout claims can hold weight. HYPE Price Slips as Market Shrugs Off $50M News Hyperliquid’s HYPE token has dropped below the $40 mark just days after a high-profile $50 million investment announcement from Eyenovia. Despite reaching a peak near $45.50, HYPE has since pulled back more than 5 percent as profit-taking and market caution take over. Eyenovia’s rebrand to Hyperion DeFi and its validator ambitions on the Hyperliquid network signal strong intent, but price action says otherwise. Open interest has declined, and technical indicators point to a stall. Unless bulls reclaim key levels above $40, this HYPE price drop could shift from a short-term dip to a deeper correction. Web3 ai Is Building the Future of Crypto Trading Before the Crowd Arrives Web3 ai looks like something designed behind closed doors for elite traders. Its AI-powered trading suite combines real-time market insights, automated risk control, smart asset tracking, and built-in scam detection. All of it lives in one unified dashboard, built to keep things efficient without losing depth. The fuel of the project is the native token, $WAI, which is still sitting at $0.000443 in Stage 9 of the AI crypto presale. The confirmed listing price is $0.005242, locking in a potential 1,747% return for early backers. More than 23.4 billion tokens have already been sold, and the project has raised $8.5 million. Momentum is clearly building, but the door is not closed yet. Most projects with this kind of utility arrive too late for early access. By the time they catch attention, the price reflects the value. Web3 ai is still in that rare window between development and mass adoption. That window is closing fast, but it is still open for now. What makes Web3 ai stand out is not just the vision but the level of traction it has secured ahead of launch. When the platform goes live, it will not wait for people to catch up. The opportunity to enter early is right now, before the utility reshapes the price for good. Looking Forward PEPE’s price is caught between warning signs and technical hope, with whale exits dragging sentiment and a bullish flag still unconfirmed. HYPE tells a similar story. Even with $50 million in backing from Eyenovia, the drop below $40 and declining open interest reveal hesitation that charts alone cannot explain. Web3 ai offers a different path. No sudden swings or breakout guessing games. Just clear traction with $8.5 million raised and 23.4 billion tokens sold. With a potential 1747% return baked in, it stands out as one of the best crypto coins for 2025 gains. In this market, clarity wins.

Final Trap Or Final Chance For XRP? In his latest video analysis, the analyst sketched a scenario in which Bitcoin grinds lower toward the $92,000–$95,000 liquidity pocket “to sweep the last standing bids,” dragging major altcoins with it. “We’ve had the extra bit of flush down that we were talking about and looking for,” he said, noting that Bitcoin already wicked to $98,200 but has yet to produce the higher-low/higher-high sequence or the bullish RSI divergence that stamped the April capitulation bottom. “I think we’re close to a bottom. I don’t quite think we’re there.” Related Reading: XRP To $30 Beyond 2026? Analyst Reveals Key BTC Ratio To Watch XRP, he argues, is tracing the same pattern at a different scale. The 4-hour chart shows a conspicuous liquidity shelf at $1.89 and a deeper block stretching to $1.73. “In a world where Bitcoin does get the flush to ninety,” he observed, “could we come and take that? Yes. … Maybe $1.85, potentially on a wick.” Although he concedes a tail-risk dip toward $1.60–$1.55, that move is “not my base case.” What makes the area compelling, in CryptoInsightUK’s view, is the clustering of spot demand on each successive stab lower. He highlighted the “big red bar” of sell-side volume that marked last week’s sweep and the immediate spike in spot bids, calling it evidence of “real accumulation rather than derivative games.” Funding rates across major venues have turned modestly positive, confirming that “people are going long,” a dynamic that could yet trigger one more liquidity vacuum as over-leveraged latecomers are forced out. Related Reading: XRP Price At Risk Of 20% Crash To $1.55 If This Level Fails To Hold Springboard For $11 XRP? Technically, the trader is watching for a textbook bullish divergence: price carves a marginally lower low while the 4-hour RSI prints a higher one, mirroring the set-up that preceded April’s 140% rally. The fixed-range volume profile on Bitcoin—where the point of control sits near $97,000—offers confluence, suggesting the broader market is attempting to base on a major support shelf before rotation into altcoins. If that pattern holds, CryptoInsightUK believes XRP is positioned for a “drastic” expansionary phase that would lift the token first to the oft-cited $8 target and then, in an over-extension, to “realistically $11 to $12.” From an idealised $1.85 entry the projection implies an upside of roughly 475%. “I put my neck on the line,” he said. “Everyone’s thinking eight. I think we over-extend that a little bit.” The analyst’s conviction rests in part on his read of Bitcoin dominance, now hovering in what he calls the “reversal box.” A final push to the upper edge could spark the long-awaited altseason, he argued, with XRP—as a large-cap, high-beta play—capturing disproportionate flows once Bitcoin volatility subsides. At press time, XRP traded at $2.1781.

While USDT’s supply is becoming increasingly distributed across multiple blockchain networks, EVM giants still claim the lion’s share, with Tron leading with over $80 billion. USDT supply on the Justin Sun-linked network has grown by approximately $20 billion year-to-date. Ethereum holds the next-largest chunk with over $71.54 billion. Tron and Ethereum account for more than 90% of total USDT issuance. Distribution of Tether’s USDT supply by network. Source: Token Terminal Other fast-growing networks include Solana, Aptos, and TON, tapping into USDT’s liquidity outside EVM chains. The race for stablecoin supremacy USDT’s expansive reach mirrors its longstanding appeal as a reliable on-ramp for traders and institutions. But in the background, an intense rivalry is unfolding with Circle’s USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market share. As USDT strengthens its lead, Circle’s USDC recently exceeded $61 billion in supply, holding approximately 24% of the stablecoin market. Circle’s rise isn’t limited to blockchain data. It is also making waves on Wall Street too. Since its June 5 IPO, Circle’s stock (CRCL) has surged over 700% , placing its market cap around $68 billion, showing high investor confidence. However, one of the major investors, Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest , has begun trimming positions, becoming one of the first big players jumping from the valuation euphoria to profit-taking. Circle fills a Tether-shaped void as USDT exits the EU In a move attributed to the European Union’s (EU) stringent Markets in Crypto‑Assets (MiCA) regulation, Tether discontinued EURT, its euro-backed stablecoin, in November 2024, halting new minting and withdrawing EU support for users. Tether publicly criticized MiCA’s heavy compliance and reserve mandates as overly “restrictive.” Several exchanges across the European Economic Area have already delisted their USDT spot pairs to comply with MiCA, although custody and futures availability remain in many cases. To maintain a foothold in the European market, Tether is investing in MiCA‑compliant alternatives, namely EURQ and USDQ, built via its Hadron platform in partnership with Quantoz. Circle’s EURC has stepped up in the absence of Tether’s EURT. Source: Toke Terminal Meanwhile, Circle is expanding its euro stablecoin, EURC . Supply has risen substantially in the past year from $78.4 million to $236.1 million, with roughly 80% of this circulation is on Ethereum and Solana. This showdown between USDT and USDC also highlights the maturation of stablecoins in the global financial system. As of May 2025, Tether held over $120 billion in U.S. Treasury bills, which is enough to modestly suppress short-term yields. Circle, on the other hand, is actively positioning itself for mainstream adoption via compliance, solid capitalization, and high-profile earnings backed by its yield on reserves. However, what appears to be a lopsided two-horse race may soon get other serious contenders. Clarity from regulatory milestones such as the GENIUS and STABLE Act, as well as other legislation at different stages in the House and Senate, has piqued the interest of large American banks and corporations to explore issuing their own stablecoins to potentially challenge the Tether-Circle hegemony.

This unambiguous stance, reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, provides crucial clarity regarding the U.S. central bank’s position on digital assets and its role in the evolving financial landscape. Understanding the Federal Reserve’s Position on Cryptocurrency The news that the Federal Reserve will not be acquiring cryptocurrencies might not come as a shock to seasoned market observers, but its explicit nature from the very top of the U.S. central banking system underscores a deeply entrenched cautious approach. For years, the Fed has been carefully monitoring the rise of digital assets, acknowledging their innovation while also highlighting potential risks to financial stability and consumer protection. Powell’s statement effectively draws a clear line in the sand: the Fed’s mandate is centered on maintaining price stability, maximizing employment, and ensuring the stability of the financial system. Purchasing volatile and largely unregulated assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum falls well outside its traditional purview and current legal framework. The Federal Reserve Act, which governs the Fed’s operations, outlines specific types of assets the central bank is authorized to buy, primarily U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, as tools for conducting Monetary Policy . Key Takeaways from Powell’s Statement: Legal Constraints: The Fed currently lacks the statutory authority to purchase cryptocurrencies. No Intent to Seek Authority: This is not merely a current limitation but a declared policy choice, indicating no immediate plans to lobby for such powers. Focus on Mandate: Reinforces the Fed’s commitment to its core responsibilities of economic stability, rather than engaging in speculative asset acquisition. Why Jerome Powell’s Statement Matters for Digital Assets The words of Jerome Powell carry immense weight, influencing market sentiment and regulatory direction globally. His unequivocal declaration has several implications for the broader digital asset ecosystem: For Institutional Adoption: While private institutions, investment firms, and even some corporations have embraced cryptocurrency, the Fed’s stance signals that top-tier governmental backing for direct crypto holdings is not on the horizon. This could temper expectations for a ‘flood’ of central bank capital directly into crypto markets, emphasizing that any significant institutional adoption will continue to be driven by private sector initiatives rather than central bank balance sheets. Regulatory Landscape: The statement indirectly highlights the ongoing need for a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Without clear rules, central banks are unlikely to engage. Powell’s remarks reinforce the idea that robust regulation is a prerequisite for broader acceptance and integration of digital assets into the traditional financial system, not just for central banks but for banks and financial institutions they oversee. Market Perception: For some, the news might be seen as a dampener, removing the possibility of a massive, liquidity-injecting buyer in the form of the Fed. However, for others, it reinforces the decentralized and independent nature of cryptocurrencies, free from direct governmental control or manipulation through central bank purchases. It underscores that the value proposition of crypto, for now, remains outside the traditional tools of Monetary Policy . The Legal and Operational Hurdles: Why the Fed Can’t Buy Crypto Beyond the simple statement, there are profound reasons why the Fed , or any central bank, would be hesitant to purchase crypto assets, even if legally empowered. These hurdles are both legal and operational, touching upon the very essence of central banking: 1. Legal Framework and Mandate: As mentioned, the Federal Reserve Act dictates what the Fed can and cannot do. Its asset purchases are designed to influence interest rates and the money supply, not to speculate on asset prices or directly support specific industries. Introducing highly volatile, non-sovereign assets onto its balance sheet would fundamentally alter its risk profile and could be seen as an overreach of its mandate. 2. Volatility and Risk Management: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price volatility. Holding such assets on a central bank’s balance sheet would expose it to significant market risk, potentially undermining its financial stability and credibility. A central bank is meant to be a beacon of stability, not a participant in high-risk trading. 3. Custody and Security: Storing vast amounts of digital assets securely presents a unique challenge. Unlike traditional securities held in established depositories, the custody of cryptocurrencies involves complex cryptographic security measures, which, if compromised, could lead to catastrophic losses. The operational infrastructure required would be immense and unprecedented for a central bank. 4. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory status of many cryptocurrencies remains ambiguous across jurisdictions. Engaging with these assets before clear global standards are established would put the Fed in a precarious position, potentially legitimizing assets that could later be deemed illegal or problematic. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) vs. Cryptocurrencies: A Clear Distinction It’s crucial to differentiate between the Fed’s stance on purchasing private cryptocurrencies and its exploration of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). While both involve ‘digital money,’ their nature and implications are vastly different: Private Cryptocurrencies: These are decentralized or privately issued digital assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) that operate independently of central banks and traditional financial systems. Their value is derived from market demand and supply, and they are often subject to significant price swings. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC): A CBDC, like a potential ‘digital dollar,’ would be a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, issued and backed by the central bank. It would be a direct liability of the central bank, just like physical cash. Its purpose would be to enhance payments, financial inclusion, and potentially provide a more resilient financial system, not to serve as an investment asset for the central bank itself. The Federal Reserve has been actively researching and discussing the potential benefits and risks of a U.S. CBDC, often referred to as a ‘digital dollar.’ This exploration is about modernizing the monetary system, not about the Fed holding speculative digital assets on its balance sheet. Jerome Powell has consistently emphasized that any U.S. CBDC would require broad public and political support, and likely congressional authorization, before moving forward. Impact on Monetary Policy and the Future of Finance The Fed’s decision not to engage in direct cryptocurrency purchases has significant implications for how Monetary Policy is conducted and the future evolution of the financial system. Central banks rely on a predictable and controllable set of tools to manage inflation, stimulate growth, and maintain stability. Introducing highly volatile and unpredictable assets like cryptocurrencies into this delicate framework would severely complicate these efforts. If the Fed were to hold cryptocurrencies, changes in their value could inadvertently affect the central bank’s balance sheet and, by extension, its ability to implement effective monetary policy. This could introduce new channels of financial instability and undermine public trust in the currency. Actionable Insights: For Investors: This news reinforces that crypto markets will continue to mature largely independently of direct central bank intervention. Investors should focus on fundamental analysis, technological innovation, and regulatory developments, rather than anticipating central bank support. For Policymakers: The focus remains on establishing clear regulatory guidelines for digital assets, protecting consumers, and preventing illicit activities, rather than exploring direct central bank participation in crypto markets. The future of finance will undoubtedly involve digital assets, but the path for central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve , appears to be one of cautious oversight and potentially the issuance of their own digital currencies, rather than direct participation in the private cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: A Clear Path Forward Jerome Powell’s statement is a definitive declaration that clarifies the Federal Reserve’s position on cryptocurrency . It underscores the central bank’s commitment to its traditional mandate of financial stability and effective Monetary Policy , while avoiding the inherent risks and legal complexities associated with holding private digital assets. This clarity helps shape expectations for both the crypto industry and the broader financial world, reinforcing that the Fed’s role in the digital age will be one of careful observation, regulation, and potentially the development of a secure Central Bank Digital Currency , rather than direct market participation.

For years, the Bitcoin network has been the undisputed king of digital assets, revered for its security and decentralization. Yet, its ecosystem has often been seen as separate from the burgeoning world of decentralized finance (DeFi), especially when it comes to stablecoin utility. That’s all about to change with the groundbreaking introduction of the USDB stablecoin , poised to redefine what’s possible on the original blockchain. Imagine being able to trade directly on the Bitcoin network with a stable, dollar-pegged asset, without the complexities or risks of bridging. This summer, Flashnet and Brale are set to make this a reality, launching USDB natively on Bitcoin’s Spark layer-2. This isn’t just another stablecoin; it’s a strategic move designed to unlock unprecedented liquidity and functionality for Bitcoin users, pushing the boundaries of the Bitcoin DeFi landscape. What is the USDB Stablecoin and Why It Matters? The USDB stablecoin is a fully dollar-backed digital asset, designed to bring the stability of the U.S. dollar directly to the Bitcoin network. Unlike many stablecoins that reside on other blockchains, USDB’s native integration on Bitcoin’s Spark layer-2 is a significant development. This means users will be able to hold and transact with a stable asset directly on Bitcoin, bypassing the need for cross-chain bridges that often introduce additional security risks and complexities. Here’s a quick breakdown of what makes USDB stand out: Full Backing: USDB is fully backed by U.S. Treasury bills, offering a high degree of confidence in its peg to the dollar. This strong backing ensures transparency and reduces the volatility typically associated with cryptocurrencies. Native Integration: Launching on Bitcoin’s Spark layer-2, USDB enables direct interaction within the Bitcoin ecosystem. This is crucial for fostering a truly decentralized finance environment on Bitcoin. Developed by Experts: Flashnet and Brale, the teams behind USDB, bring expertise in blockchain technology and financial infrastructure, aiming for a robust and secure launch. The importance of a reliable, dollar-backed stablecoin cannot be overstated. In a volatile crypto market, stablecoins act as safe havens, enabling traders to lock in gains, enter positions without immediate exposure to price swings, and facilitate payments with predictable value. USDB aims to provide this critical utility directly within the Bitcoin network. Unlocking Native Bitcoin Trading: The Spark Layer-2 Advantage One of the most exciting promises of USDB is its ability to facilitate native Bitcoin trading . Historically, if you wanted to trade Bitcoin with a stablecoin, you’d often have to move your BTC to an exchange or use a wrapped version on another blockchain. This process, known as bridging, introduces several pain points: Security Risks: Bridges can be vulnerable to hacks, leading to significant asset losses. Increased Fees: Transferring assets across different chains often incurs additional transaction fees. Complexity: The process can be daunting for new users, requiring multiple steps and understanding of different network mechanics. The Spark layer-2 solution, on which USDB will launch, addresses these challenges head-on. By building on a Bitcoin layer-2 , USDB leverages Bitcoin’s inherent security while providing the speed and scalability needed for efficient stablecoin transactions. This means users can engage in stable-to-Bitcoin trading directly, securely, and with lower friction, paving the way for more sophisticated financial activities on the network. How USDB Elevates the Bitcoin DeFi Ecosystem The emergence of USDB is a pivotal moment for the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. While other blockchains like Ethereum have flourished with a rich array of DeFi applications, Bitcoin’s DeFi scene has been relatively nascent. This is largely due to the lack of native stablecoin liquidity and robust infrastructure for complex financial primitives. With USDB, several doors open for Bitcoin DeFi: Enhanced Liquidity: A reliable stablecoin encourages more capital to flow into Bitcoin-native DeFi protocols. New Financial Products: The presence of a stable asset enables the creation of lending platforms, borrowing protocols, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and yield-generating opportunities directly on Bitcoin. Reduced Volatility Risk: DeFi applications built with USDB can offer more predictable returns and lower volatility exposure for users, attracting a broader audience. A prime example of this immediate impact is the announced integration with Magic Eden. As a leading NFT marketplace, Magic Eden’s decision to integrate USDB for trading and liquidity signals a strong belief in its potential to revolutionize Bitcoin-based digital asset markets. This integration will allow users to price and trade NFTs on Bitcoin using a stable asset, a significant step forward for the ecosystem. The Power of a Dollar-Backed Stablecoin: Stability and Trust In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, the stability offered by a dollar-backed stablecoin is invaluable. USDB’s commitment to being fully backed by U.S. Treasury bills provides a bedrock of trust and transparency. This is critical for both retail users and institutional investors who require predictability in their digital asset holdings. Consider the benefits of such robust backing: Reliable Peg: The direct backing by highly liquid and secure government assets minimizes the risk of the stablecoin losing its peg to the dollar, a common concern with less transparent or algorithmically backed stablecoins. Regulatory Confidence: A clear, auditable backing mechanism can contribute to greater regulatory acceptance and clarity, fostering broader adoption. Investor Security: Users can have greater peace of mind knowing their funds are supported by tangible, low-risk assets, rather than complex algorithms or opaque reserves. This level of stability is not just a feature; it’s a fundamental requirement for any asset that aims to serve as a reliable medium of exchange or unit of account within a financial system. USDB’s design ensures it can fulfill this role effectively on the Bitcoin network. Looking Ahead: The Future of Bitcoin Layer-2 and Beyond The launch of USDB is more than just a new stablecoin; it’s a testament to the ongoing evolution of the Bitcoin layer-2 ecosystem. Layer-2 solutions are crucial for Bitcoin’s long-term scalability, enabling faster, cheaper transactions while maintaining the security of the main chain. Spark layer-2 is one of several innovative solutions emerging, each contributing to Bitcoin’s expanding utility beyond just a store of value. What does this mean for the future? Increased Utility: Bitcoin is transforming from merely ‘digital gold’ into a versatile platform capable of supporting a wide array of financial applications. Mainstream Adoption: As stablecoins and DeFi services become more accessible and secure on Bitcoin, it paves the way for greater mainstream and institutional adoption. Innovation Spree: USDB’s success could inspire further development of new protocols and applications specifically tailored for Bitcoin’s layer-2 infrastructure. Of course, challenges remain. The adoption of new layer-2 technologies takes time, and the competitive landscape for stablecoins is fierce. Regulatory clarity for stablecoins across different jurisdictions is also an ongoing discussion. However, the fundamental value proposition of a natively integrated, dollar-backed stablecoin on Bitcoin is undeniable. A New Era for Bitcoin The impending launch of the USDB stablecoin on Bitcoin’s Spark layer-2 marks a truly transformative moment for the cryptocurrency world. By enabling seamless native Bitcoin trading with a fully dollar-backed stablecoin , USDB is set to unlock immense potential for the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem.

46720003,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=754720,1750811752,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46720003.jpeg,Can crypto escrow markets survive without Telegram’s protection?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-escrow-survive-without-telegram/,"Telegram made headlines in May after closing thousands of accounts and private channels connected to crypto-related crime, including some of the most popular darknet escrow platforms like Huione Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee. These platforms acted as escrow services that handled billions of dollars in transactions related to stolen data, money laundering, and online scams. It was easy for them to grow and operate in the open for years with Telegram’s large global audience, anonymous usernames, and minimal moderation. Telegram disrupted a key part of the ecosystem that supported these crypto markets by taking down their channels. But more than 30 new marketplaces popped up in just a few weeks. Some were brand new, while others were old groups that changed their names or moved to new accounts to avoid detection. One of the most prominent successors, Tudou Guarantee, proved that the market adapted to new conditions when it doubled its user base and absorbed much of Huione’s former traffic. This swift recovery raises a far more complicated and urgent question. Can crypto escrow markets survive without Telegram’s protection, or are they evolving into something even harder to stop? If Telegram once offered these markets a powerful and convenient shelter, its crackdown may have only pushed them to scatter, innovate, and find new digital homes. Crypto escrow markets grew quickly because Telegram enabled them Cybercriminals, fraudsters, and other bad actors who don’t know or trust each other use crypto escrow marketplaces to ensure both sides hold up their end of a deal and create just enough trust to allow anonymous people to trade across borders. The buyer sends cryptocurrency to the escrow service that holds the funds. At the same time, the seller delivers the product (stolen data, fake documents, hacking tools, or laundered money) and the escrow releases the payment to the seller once the delivery is confirmed. Telegram’s chat-based interface gave escrow platforms a convenient way to communicate with buyers and sellers, offer customer support, share scam alerts , and even settle disputes because it supported both public and private channels. The platform’s bot feature also allowed escrow markets to run basic functions like verifying payments, tracking orders, or showing transaction history without a full website or separate app, as scammers could build automated tools inside group chats. In its early growth stages, Telegram had very limited moderation and avoided deep scrutiny in private groups and direct messages. Marketplaces like Huione Guarantee used the platform as storefronts to list available services, bots as transaction hubs to manage deals, and private groups as help desks to handle complaints or disputes. Telegram targets key operators and updates its privacy rules Huione Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee had spent years building out their networks on Telegram and offering illegal services through encrypted chats, trusted admin groups, and automated bots. Telegram abruptly removed these and many other accounts, which disrupted years of coordination, wiped out communication channels overnight, and forced users and vendors to either pause their operations or scramble to find alternatives. Telegram also quietly updated its privacy policy to provide law enforcement with IP addresses and phone numbers tied to users, but only under valid legal requests related to criminal investigations. Blockchain intelligence firms, such as Elliptic, confirmed that Telegram’s actions had delivered a serious blow to the operational structure of one of the most active and dangerous players in the crypto escrow world. Telegram’s aggressive move changed how criminals viewed the platform, created real uncertainty in the market, and forced both users and administrators of illegal escrow services to reconsider their dependence on the platform as a long-term home for their operations. New escrow markets appear immediately to replace the old ones When Telegram took down major crypto escrow markets, vendors lost access to their groups, buyers lost contact with sellers, and the tools that handled transactions and disputes vanished overnight. It seemed like a major win for law enforcement and the platforms trying to clean up illegal activity. However, the shutdown created chaos instead of breaking the system. The same network of users proved how flexible and determined these underground markets really are because they began spreading across new channels, rebranding old platforms, and launching entirely new services to fill the gap left behind. Blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic published clear evidence showing more than 30 new or successor marketplaces emerged shortly after Huione Guarantee went offline. Most of them stayed on Telegram despite the risk of being banned again. Telegram’s crackdown led to an explosion of activity as users scrambled to reconnect with their customers and prove that the ecosystem was resilient and designed to survive disruption by building on top of what Huione and Xinbi had already created. Tudou Guarantee became the new go-to marketplace for buyers and sellers displaced by Huione’s disappearance. Elliptic revealed that the marketplace had doubled its user base in weeks and was now processing about the same amount of cryptocurrency as Huione. There are also concerns about whether Tudou’s rise was part of a planned fallback strategy or just a lucky break because Huione purchased a 30% stake in Tudou in December, months before the crackdown. Researchers and cybersecurity experts call this sudden shift from collapse to rebound the “Hydra effect,” meaning every time you cut off one head of the Hydra, two more grow back in its place. Crypto escrow markets shift platforms and continue operating The crypto escrow markets will survive and possibly grow even stronger elsewhere because Telegram’s crackdown didn’t eliminate the forces that made those markets possible in the first place. There is still a massive demand for illegal digital products and services like stolen data, fake documents, hacking tools, ransomware kits, money laundering services, and other shady products that allow criminals to commit crimes or hide their tracks. No crackdown on a single app or platform will likely stop them entirely, since the markets will always provide a convenient, efficient way to match those buyers with sellers. Cryptocurrencies also offer the perfect payment system for these transactions because they’re anonymous and work across borders, so users can quickly move to another wallet without law enforcement being able to catch up in time when one transaction is flagged. These markets mostly build layered systems with backups, alternative communication tools, mirrored channels, and backup wallets to ensure their operations continue despite disruptions. Vendors and buyers may soon rely on smart contracts built directly into web3 platforms as they can hold crypto in escrow, verify delivery conditions, and release payments without human intervention. Ultimately, these markets will continue to find new homes, build new tools, and shift into new formats that are even harder to detect, control, or destroy as long as the demand exists and crypto enables fast and private payments. Law enforcement must trace crypto payments to disrupt these networks Removing channels, deleting groups, or suspending user accounts may slow criminals down, but they do not stop the core engine that powers these illegal markets. The true solution must come from financial disruption because criminals will simply move to new apps, create private backups, or migrate to encrypted services that are harder to monitor when communication tools disappear. Blockchain analytics firms like Elliptic and Chainalysis analyze blockchain activity to uncover patterns, trace wallets, and link anonymous-looking transactions to real-world behaviors and entities. They expose who’s in charge, where the money goes, and which platforms are helping move illicit funds using advanced tools to map out how funds move across networks into more “clean” crypto wallets or fiat off-ramps like exchanges. Countries must collaborate to share intelligence, enforce sanctions, freeze wallets, and prosecute operators, regardless of location. Law enforcement should also focus on the digital infrastructure that keeps these markets running to raise the cost of doing business for criminals, disrupt their income streams, and make it harder for them to scale operations. In addition, governments must create laws that define and criminalize specific digital money laundering techniques, allow courts to seize crypto assets tied to illegal operations, and hold platform operators accountable if they knowingly support criminal activity.

A recent report from Whale Alert caught the attention of many, confirming that a substantial USDC minted event has occurred: 250 million USDC was generated at the USDC Treasury. This isn’t just a number; it’s a critical indicator that warrants a deeper dive into what it means for the broader cryptocurrency market . Such a large injection of a leading stablecoin into the ecosystem can have profound implications, from liquidity boosts to potential market rallies. Understanding the Surge: Why is USDC Minted in Such Volumes? When 250 million USDC is minted , it’s a direct response to demand. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, backed by fully reserved assets. It’s issued by Circle and Coinbase through the Centre consortium. The act of minting new USDC typically signifies a few key things: Increased Demand for Liquidity: As more users and institutions enter the crypto space, there’s a growing need for stable, reliable digital dollars to facilitate trading, lending, and borrowing within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. On-Ramp for Fiat: New USDC is often minted when users deposit fiat currency into exchanges or platforms that support USDC, effectively converting traditional money into its digital equivalent. This acts as a crucial bridge between conventional finance and the crypto world. DeFi Growth and Usage: The burgeoning DeFi sector relies heavily on stablecoins. More USDC means more capital available for yield farming, liquidity provision, and collateralization, driving further innovation and activity within the decentralized ecosystem. Institutional Interest: Large-scale institutional investors often prefer stablecoins like USDC for their perceived stability and regulatory compliance compared to more volatile cryptocurrencies. A significant minting event could reflect increased institutional capital flowing into the market. This substantial minting operation suggests a robust appetite for dollar-pegged digital assets, underpinning the continuous expansion and maturation of the digital economy. Decoding Stablecoin Supply Dynamics: What Does This Mean for the Ecosystem? The growth in stablecoin supply is a vital metric for understanding the health and potential trajectory of the crypto market. Stablecoins serve as the lifeblood of the digital asset economy, providing a stable medium of exchange and a safe haven during periods of volatility. An increase in stablecoin supply, particularly of a well-regarded asset like USDC, often indicates a readiness for capital deployment within the market. The Role of Stablecoins in Market Liquidity: Increased stablecoin availability translates directly into enhanced market liquidity. This means: Easier Trading: Traders can move in and out of volatile assets more efficiently, reducing slippage and improving price discovery. Deeper Order Books: More stablecoins on exchanges lead to deeper order books, making it easier to execute large trades without significantly impacting prices. Fueling DeFi Protocols: Lending platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and other DeFi applications thrive on stablecoin liquidity. More USDC allows these protocols to offer better rates and more robust services. Historically, significant increases in stablecoin market capitalization have often preceded periods of upward price movement in the broader cryptocurrency market , as this capital is eventually deployed into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. While not a guaranteed predictor, it’s a strong indicator of potential buying power. Impact on Crypto Market Trends : Will Liquidity Drive New Peaks? The injection of 250 million USDC is a notable event that can influence prevailing crypto market trends . When such a large amount of stablecoin is minted, it signifies that new capital is entering the ecosystem, or existing capital is being repositioned into a stable asset, poised for future deployment. This influx of liquidity often acts as a precursor to increased trading activity and, potentially, price appreciation across various digital assets. Potential Market Implications: Bitcoin and Ethereum: A substantial increase in USDC supply could signal a build-up of buying pressure for major cryptocurrencies. Traders often use stablecoins to accumulate positions before making significant buys into Bitcoin or Ethereum, anticipating future gains. Altcoin Season Potential: Enhanced liquidity from stablecoins can also flow into the altcoin market, potentially fueling an ‘altcoin season’ where smaller cap assets experience significant rallies. Reduced Volatility (in the short term): The availability of stablecoins can sometimes help cushion market downturns, as traders can quickly convert volatile assets into USDC, reducing panic selling pressure. However, it’s crucial to remember that while increased stablecoin supply provides the ammunition for market movements, actual price action depends on a confluence of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and overall market sentiment. This USDC minted event is a positive sign of underlying demand, but not a standalone guarantee of immediate bullish trends. The Role of Whale Alert : Enhancing Transparency in a Volatile Market The news of the 250 million USDC minted transaction came to light thanks to Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracking and analytics service. Whale Alert plays a crucial role in the transparency of the cryptocurrency space by monitoring and reporting large transactions across various blockchains. This service is invaluable for several reasons: Market Insight: By tracking ‘whale’ movements (large transactions), Whale Alert provides real-time insights into significant capital flows, which can inform trading strategies and market analysis. Transparency and Accountability: In a relatively nascent and often opaque market, Whale Alert helps bring transparency by making large, otherwise obscure, transactions visible to the public. This contributes to a more informed and accountable ecosystem. Early Warning System: Unusual or large transfers, whether of stablecoins or volatile assets, can sometimes precede significant market events, serving as an early warning for traders and investors. The fact that Whale Alert promptly reported this USDC minted transaction underscores its importance in providing critical data points that help market participants understand the ongoing dynamics and potential future directions of the cryptocurrency market . Beyond the Numbers: The Broader Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market The consistent demand for stablecoins like USDC, evidenced by significant minting events, highlights their growing integration into the global financial infrastructure. This isn’t just about crypto trading; it’s about the broader implications for digital payments, cross-border transactions, and the future of finance. Challenges and Opportunities: Regulatory Scrutiny: As stablecoins gain prominence, they attract increasing attention from regulators worldwide. The challenge lies in navigating evolving regulations while maintaining decentralization and innovation. The backing and transparency of USDC are key factors in its regulatory appeal. Centralization Concerns: While stablecoins offer stability, their centralized issuance and backing by traditional assets raise questions about censorship resistance and true decentralization, a core tenet of blockchain technology. Competition: The stablecoin market is competitive, with USDT, DAI, and others vying for market share. USDC’s continued growth reflects its strong position, but innovation and adherence to best practices are crucial for long-term success. Despite these challenges, the opportunities presented by a robust stablecoin supply are immense. They facilitate efficient global commerce, enable new financial products, and serve as a reliable entry point for individuals and businesses into the digital economy. Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the Enhanced Liquidity For investors looking to make sense of this significant USDC minted event, here are some actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on stablecoin flows to and from exchanges. Increased stablecoin deposits on exchanges often precede buying activity. Assess Market Sentiment: While liquidity is crucial, market sentiment (fear vs. greed) also plays a significant role. Use sentiment indicators in conjunction with stablecoin data. Diversify Your Portfolio: A surge in stablecoin supply can signal potential upward movement, but the crypto market remains volatile. Maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance. Explore DeFi Opportunities: With more USDC in circulation, DeFi protocols may offer more attractive yields for lending or liquidity provision. Research reputable protocols and understand the associated risks. Stay Informed on Regulations: Regulatory developments can significantly impact stablecoins. Keeping abreast of global regulatory frameworks is vital for long-term investment strategies. The 250 million USDC minted transaction serves as a reminder that the cryptocurrency market is dynamic and constantly evolving, with capital flows providing valuable clues about its direction. Conclusion: The recent minting of 250 million USDC, as reported by Whale Alert, is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful signal. It underscores the growing demand for stable digital assets, the increasing liquidity within the stablecoin supply , and the potential implications for future crypto market trends . While no single event guarantees market movements, such a significant injection of capital into the ecosystem suggests a robust underlying interest and provides ample liquidity for the next phase of growth in the cryptocurrency market . Understanding these fundamental shifts is key to navigating the exciting yet complex world of digital finance.

Among them, dogwifhat (WIF), the Solana-based sensation, has captured significant attention. Now, in a groundbreaking move, DeFi Development, formerly known as Janover, has announced its ambitious plans to establish and operate dogwifhat validator nodes on the robust Solana blockchain. This isn’t just about technical infrastructure; it’s a strategic decision aimed at empowering the WIF community by sharing the generated revenue. This development marks a significant step towards integrating meme coin ecosystems more deeply into the functional fabric of decentralized networks, promising a new era of utility and shared prosperity for WIF holders. DeFi Development’s Vision: Powering Dogwifhat Validator Nodes DeFi Development, a name synonymous with innovation in the decentralized finance space, has made a pivotal announcement that could redefine community engagement for meme coins. In a recent press release, the company revealed its intention to deploy and manage WIF validator nodes directly on the Solana blockchain. This initiative goes beyond merely contributing to network security; it’s designed with the community at its heart. The core of their strategy involves sharing the revenue generated from these validator operations with WIF holders, after accounting for the necessary operational costs. This commitment to distributing rewards directly aligns with the ethos of decentralization and community ownership that underpins the crypto world. Why is this a big deal? Running a validator node requires significant technical expertise, computational power, and a substantial stake in the network’s native cryptocurrency. By undertaking this complex task, DeFi Development is not only bolstering the security and efficiency of the Solana network but also creating a direct value-sharing mechanism for the dogwifhat community. It’s a testament to their belief in the long-term viability and potential of WIF beyond its meme status. How Solana Blockchain Validators Secure Your Crypto To truly appreciate the significance of DeFi Development’s move, it’s essential to understand the role of validators on a blockchain, especially one as high-performance as Solana. The Solana blockchain operates on a unique consensus mechanism that combines Proof-of-History (PoH) with Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Validators are the backbone of this system. They are specialized computers that: Verify Transactions: They check the validity of every transaction submitted to the network, ensuring no double-spending or fraudulent activity. Maintain the Ledger: They group valid transactions into blocks and add them to the blockchain’s distributed ledger, ensuring its integrity and immutability. Participate in Consensus: Validators vote on the state of the network, helping to reach consensus on the order and validity of transactions. This process is crucial for preventing malicious actors from manipulating the blockchain. Secure the Network: By participating in the consensus mechanism, validators contribute to the overall security and decentralization of the Solana network, making it more resilient to attacks. In return for their crucial services, validators receive rewards, typically in the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain (SOL, in Solana’s case). DeFi Development’s plan to run dogwifhat validator nodes means they will be actively participating in these fundamental processes, contributing to Solana’s stability while also generating revenue from their staked WIF tokens, which they plan to share. Unlocking Crypto Staking Rewards: A Win for the WIF Community? The most exciting aspect of DeFi Development’s announcement for the average WIF holder is undoubtedly the promise of crypto staking rewards . Staking is a process where users lock up a certain amount of their cryptocurrency to support the operations of a blockchain network. In return for their contribution, they earn rewards, similar to earning interest in a traditional savings account. Here’s how this initiative aims to benefit the dogwifhat community: Direct Revenue Sharing: DeFi Development explicitly stated its intention to share the revenue generated from the WIF validator nodes with the community. This means WIF holders could potentially earn passive income simply by holding their tokens, without needing to run their own complex validator setup. Increased Utility for WIF: Beyond its meme status, WIF gains tangible utility as it becomes an asset that contributes to network security and generates rewards. This can help stabilize its value and attract more long-term holders. Enhanced Community Engagement: By involving the community in the financial benefits of network operation, DeFi Development fosters a stronger sense of ownership and participation among WIF holders. Lower Barrier to Entry: Running a validator node is technically challenging and capital-intensive. By running the nodes themselves and sharing rewards, DeFi Development lowers the barrier for everyday WIF holders to benefit from staking without the technical overhead. This model could set a precedent for how meme coin projects can evolve, moving beyond speculative trading to offer genuine value and participatory economics to their communities. It’s a strategic move that could significantly enhance the long-term appeal and sustainability of dogwifhat. The Future of WIF: What Does This Mean for Dogwifhat Holders? For current and prospective dogwifhat validator holders, this announcement opens up a new avenue for engagement and potential returns. While the specifics of the reward distribution mechanism (e.g., how often, in what form, and the exact percentage after costs) are yet to be fully detailed, the commitment itself is a powerful signal. It suggests a future where WIF is not just a cultural phenomenon but also a productive asset within the DeFi ecosystem. Actionable Insights for WIF Holders: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on announcements from DeFi Development regarding the launch of the validator nodes and the specifics of the reward distribution program. Understand the Risks: While promising, staking and validator operations come with inherent risks, such as slashing (penalties for validator downtime or misbehavior) or smart contract vulnerabilities. Ensure you understand these before participating in any reward sharing programs. Community Participation: Engage with the dogwifhat and DeFi Development communities to learn more and provide feedback. Your voice can help shape the future of these initiatives. This move by DeFi Development highlights a growing trend in the crypto space: the maturation of projects and the continuous search for sustainable value propositions. By leveraging the technical capabilities to run crucial infrastructure like WIF validator nodes , they are positioning dogwifhat for a more robust and utility-driven future. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Meme Coins and DeFi DeFi Development’s decision to operate dogwifhat validator nodes on the Solana blockchain and share crypto staking rewards with the community marks a significant milestone. It transcends the typical narrative surrounding meme coins, imbuing WIF with tangible utility and a clear path for community-driven value creation. This strategic initiative not only strengthens the underlying Solana network but also sets a compelling precedent for how meme coin ecosystems can evolve, fostering greater decentralization, community empowerment, and sustainable growth. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, such moves underscore the innovative spirit driving the industry forward, promising a more inclusive and rewarding experience for all participants.

This is one of the most ambitious software releases in XRPL history, opening new use cases for the technology and moving it and the token in line with the broader crypto and blockchain community. One interesting new feature in this flavor is the ability to batch your transactions and aggregate as many operations into a single transaction as desired. Such flexibility is even more helpful for companies, enterprises, and fintech projects, which require the ability to perform fast bulk payments or token airdrops. e.g., payroll, airdrop, and dApp token distribution services can now be cheap and have very few on-chain transactions. Integration also includes support for token escrow, a feature enabling assets, including RLUSD and other tokens, to be locked for future release. This is a must-have for financial products (vesting schedules, timed payouts, deposit management systems, etc.). It allows developers to build even more sophisticated and secure DeFi tools on the XRP Ledger. Permissioned DEXs are another major redevelopment of the platform. In contrast to the traditional DEX open to everyone, permissioned DEXs offer more versatility for developers, who can limit access according to their requirements for regulations, thus offering a more managed space for transactions. Ripple triggers a surge in XRP Ledger activity with the latest update Performance metrics of the network have been increasing in the software update quickly than expected. In the two weeks before the update, daily active addresses increased more than 7x, signaling increased user and developer interest. Analysts view this as a demand increase for XRPL’s growing scope. After previously being hyped as the chain of choice for trading with meme coins and NFTs, Solana, whose meme coin activity has since dived, has already lost most of its dominance to competitors such as BNB Chain. Furthermore, according to reports, $2.5 billion worth of capital has fled the Solana network over the past weeks. Ethereum has also been affected by scalability issues. By contrast, the XRP ecosystem is going gangbusters. According to market data, it’s attracting interest from large financial institutions. The CME Group, one of the world’s largest derivatives marketplaces, recently labeled XRP as the most-watched cryptocurrency. In addition, the XRP Ledger continues to make new collaborations with significant financial players such as Uphold and Ondo Finance. These integrations continue to push XRPL’s functionality into trading digital assets, tokenizing real-world assets, and cross-border finance use cases more commonly associated with Ethereum-based protocols. XRP price jumps 6% following Ripple’s update The XRP has also bounced back strongly after the 2.5.0 update. In the first few hours after the update, the coin spiked almost 6%, reversing last Sunday’s crushing of the market cap of heaps of cryptocurrencies. This price action tells us the investor community doesn’t think this software update will be a technical patch upgrade, but rather a fundamental upgrade. Providing features such as the ability to batch transactions and escrow tokens is a real-world utility for the XPR Ledger, so this has the potential to attract further developers, startups, and companies to build their businesses on top of the XRP Ledger. A few months ago, Mayukha Vadari, senior software engineer at RippleX, teased that version 2.5.0 would be a game changer! During her comments at a developer livestream in May, for example, she said the update could make XRPL well-positioned to overcome Ethereum and Solana in terms of scalability and institutional adoption.

Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has broken through the $10 million fundraising milestone, catching the eye of Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, and Kaspa communities for its impressive trajectory and transparency. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Altcoin Magnet MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a standout narrative in today’s altcoin discussions. With over $10 million raised and every offering round selling out rapidly, its fixed 170 billion supply , HashEx audit , and VC-free model have set a high bar for accountability and scarcity. Investors are staking their allocations and holding with conviction, pushing demand toward its public listing at a projected $0.007 . MAGACOIN FINANCE builds on infrastructure, active rewards, and a visible plan—earning comparisons to the early days of DOGE and SHIBA, but with a more robust framework and credibility. Bitcoin: The Foundation, But Seeking Fresh Multiples While Bitcoin remains a store of value trading near $105,000 , its upside is seen as stabilizing. For many holders, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a tactical pivot toward projects offering exponential ROI potential. Early participants are reallocating portions of capital, hunting multipliers that BTC no longer consistently delivers. Solana: Strong Base, But Traders Eye New Rallies Solana remains strong, backed by ecosystem support and active development. Yet, as price movements level out, attention is shifting. Many SOL holders are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE , which offers sharper entry points and community-driven momentum missing in larger cap names. Ethereum: Watching for the Next Breakout While Ethereum continues to dominate key market sectors, ETH traders are gradually diversifying. With growth tempered by scaling debates and external policy discussions, newer plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE are offering early exposure to upside cycles reminiscent of Ethereum’s own early rise. Kaspa: Steady Growth, But MAGACOIN FINANCE Offers More Kaspa ’s technical merits and long-term appeal are undisputed, but recent attention has tilted toward MAGACOIN FINANCE , where immediate community action and pre-listing excitement offer shorter-term movement for those seeking early-stage entry points. Conclusion With increasing buy-in from Bitcoin and Solana communities and growing interest from Ethereum and Kaspa holders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as one of the most closely watched altcoin launches of the year . The momentum is organic, the structure is transparent, and the opportunity—according to traders—is still early.

For crypto enthusiasts and investors in Turkey, a significant shift is underway. Turkey has just introduced a sweeping set of Turkey crypto regulations designed to bring more transparency and control to the digital asset space. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a bold step that will fundamentally reshape how transactions are conducted and how individuals interact with their digital holdings. What’s Driving Turkey’s Bold New Crypto Regulations? Turkey’s decision to tighten its grip on the cryptocurrency market isn’t a surprise to those familiar with the nation’s economic landscape. Battling high inflation and seeking to stabilize its financial system, the Turkish government has been increasingly wary of unregulated financial flows. These new rules are a direct response to concerns over capital flight, money laundering, and the financing of illicit activities. The aim is clear: to create a more secure and accountable environment for Turkish digital assets . At the heart of these new regulations are several key requirements that users and platforms must now adhere to: Detailed Transfer Notes: Every crypto transaction will now require comprehensive documentation, ensuring that the origin and destination of funds are clearly recorded. This move is designed to enhance traceability and accountability. Source Verification: Platforms will be mandated to verify the source of funds for transfers, adding an extra layer of scrutiny to prevent the movement of illicitly obtained assets. This means users might be asked for more information about where their crypto came from. Delayed Withdrawals for Non-Compliant Transactions: If a transaction doesn’t meet the new regulatory standards, withdrawals could be significantly delayed. This acts as a powerful disincentive for users attempting to bypass the rules. These measures collectively aim to create a robust framework that brings the burgeoning crypto market under a more centralized regulatory umbrella, mirroring efforts seen in other major economies. Unpacking the Fight Against Crypto Illicit Transfers One of the primary drivers behind these stringent new rules is the global push to combat crypto illicit transfers . Cryptocurrencies, while offering unprecedented financial freedom, have also been exploited by bad actors for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities due to their perceived anonymity. Turkey’s new framework directly targets these vulnerabilities. By demanding detailed transfer notes and source verification, authorities gain greater visibility into the flow of digital assets. Imagine a scenario where large sums of crypto are moved without clear provenance; under the new rules, such transactions would immediately raise red flags. The ability to delay withdrawals for non-compliant transfers gives regulators a powerful tool to freeze suspicious funds and investigate further, significantly hindering the operations of criminal enterprises attempting to use crypto for nefarious purposes. This proactive stance aligns with international standards set by bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which advocates for stronger Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) measures in the crypto space. For legitimate users, this means a safer ecosystem, even if it comes with increased scrutiny. The Impact of Stablecoin Caps: What You Need to Know Perhaps one of the most talked-about aspects of Turkey’s new regulatory package is the introduction of specific limits on stablecoin caps . Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency (like the US Dollar), are often used as a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile crypto market. Their stability makes them attractive for transfers and as a store of value, especially in economies experiencing high inflation. The new regulations impose a daily transfer limit of $3,000 and a monthly limit of $50,000 for stablecoin transactions. However, there’s a crucial caveat: these limits are applicable to non-compliant transactions or platforms that don’t meet specific regulatory criteria. For platforms that are fully compliant with the new rules, higher limits may apply, encouraging users to engage with regulated entities. What does this mean for you? If you frequently use stablecoins for larger transactions, you’ll need to ensure your chosen platform is fully compliant with Turkish regulations. This could push users towards regulated exchanges and away from peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions or less regulated platforms. While these caps might seem restrictive to some, they are intended to prevent large, unchecked flows of capital and provide the government with better oversight of financial movements within the Turkish digital assets market. Navigating the Future of Turkish Digital Assets: Challenges and Opportunities The introduction of these stringent rules undoubtedly presents both challenges and opportunities for the future of Turkish digital assets . On one hand, the increased regulatory burden could pose challenges for smaller crypto businesses and startups that may struggle to meet the compliance requirements. It might also lead to some users seeking offshore platforms, potentially creating a “grey market.” Privacy advocates may also raise concerns about the increased data collection. However, the opportunities are equally significant. A regulated environment can foster greater trust and adoption among mainstream investors and institutions who have historically shied away from the crypto market due to perceived risks and lack of oversight. Enhanced consumer protection, reduced fraud, and a clearer legal framework could pave the way for more institutional investment and the development of innovative, compliant crypto products and services within Turkey. It signals the government’s recognition of digital assets, not as a passing fad, but as a legitimate, albeit regulated, part of the financial ecosystem. For the crypto market in Turkey to truly flourish, a balance must be struck between robust regulation and fostering innovation. The coming months will be crucial in observing how these rules are implemented and how the market adapts. Why Crypto Compliance in Turkey is More Crucial Than Ever With the new rules in place, the emphasis on crypto compliance has never been stronger for both individuals and digital asset service providers (DASPs) operating in Turkey. The consequences of non-compliance are severe and designed to act as a powerful deterrent. As reported by The Crypto Basic, non-compliance may lead to significant financial penalties or even the loss of operating licenses for platforms. For individual users, engaging in non-compliant transactions could result in delayed withdrawals, frozen funds, or even legal repercussions. This underscores the importance of: Choosing Regulated Platforms: Always opt for crypto exchanges and service providers that are licensed and explicitly state their adherence to Turkish regulations. Understanding KYC/AML Requirements: Be prepared to provide detailed Know Your Customer (KYC) information and understand that your transactions will be subject to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) scrutiny. Staying Informed: Regulations can evolve. Regularly check official government announcements and reputable crypto news sources for updates on compliance requirements. For crypto businesses, investing in robust compliance infrastructure, hiring compliance officers, and continually training staff on the latest regulations will be paramount to their survival and success in the Turkish market. This shift signifies a maturation of the crypto industry in Turkey, moving from a largely unregulated frontier to a more structured and accountable financial sector. Looking Ahead: What Does This Mean for Turkey’s Crypto Future? Turkey’s new crypto regulations mark a pivotal moment for its digital asset landscape. While the immediate impact might feel restrictive to some, particularly those accustomed to a less regulated environment, the long-term vision appears to be one of stability, security, and controlled growth. By curbing crypto illicit transfers and imposing clear guidelines, Turkey aims to integrate digital assets more seamlessly into its formal financial system, potentially paving the way for greater mainstream adoption and innovation within a secure framework. The global trend is clear: governments are increasingly seeking to regulate the crypto space. Turkey’s approach, with its focus on transparency, source verification, and stablecoin caps, provides a compelling case study for other nations grappling with similar challenges. How the market adapts, how platforms implement these rules, and how users respond will determine the ultimate success of this ambitious regulatory overhaul.

While many smaller traders are bracing for more losses, a handful of massive accounts have broken the surface and put millions in a massive show of force. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Ethereum Whale Bets Surface According to on-chain data, one whale opened a long position worth $101 million at an entry price of $2,247, using 25x leverage. That bet paid off with roughly $950,000 in profit, but it also cost $2.5 million in fees. These numbers show just how high the stakes have become. High Fees Cut Into Gains This whale further withdrew 18,000 $ETH worth $40.38M from #Binance. Now, the whale holds 50,256 $ETH worth $112.62M, currently down $2.24M Address: 0x3952d69643f7a87237c7fc8bb33f8453c0b45500 https://t.co/49vC0iqMZP pic.twitter.com/rF5cX2gsXZ — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) June 23, 2025 Based on reports from On-Chain Lens, another whale moved over $40 million in Ether from Binance before opening its own leveraged trade. Combine the two wallets and you’ve got about $112 million riding on an ETH bounce. Yet those $2.5 million in fees highlight the hidden cost of big bets. Middle East Tension Hits Prices ETH slipped to about $2,113 on Sunday, marking its lowest level in 30 days. That drop came after US military strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites. United States President Donald Trump called the operation a “spectacular success” and warned of more action if Iran didn’t back down. Traders say the fallout from those strikes rattled global markets and fed crypto volatility. Retail Traders Watch Closely Retail traders tend to sell when prices drop. But these whales have the scope to weather downswings. Their large purchases indicate that they find value at current levels. Short traders might not agree, however. They’re sitting in many short positions, expecting ETH to decline further before it will rise. What The Whales See Experts say large holders tend to have lower break-even points. They can afford to wait months or years for a payoff. Some also use complex strategies across multiple markets. That makes their moves hard to read from the outside. Still, when you see $112 million on the line, it’s a hint that smart money senses a buying window. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Risks On Both Sides Leveraged trades amplify gains and losses equally. A 5% drop would trigger a forced sell-off on a 25x position. That could feed a sharp decline in ETH’s price. On the other hand, if the market turns up, those whales could pocket big returns well beyond what retail traders see. Investors will be watching every market swing. If geopolitical tensions cool and big money stays bullish, ETH could find footing above $2,200. But another shock—political or technical—might send the price tumbling again.

A recent statement from Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has ignited discussions across the globe, suggesting that digital assets are not just a passing trend but are poised to fundamentally replace traditional financial systems. This bold prediction, reported by Watcher Guru on X, underscores the growing conviction among key industry leaders about the inevitable shift towards a more decentralized and digital economic landscape. What Did the Robinhood CEO Say About Traditional Finance? Vlad Tenev, the visionary behind the popular trading platform Robinhood, has consistently voiced his optimistic outlook on the future of digital currencies. His recent assertion that cryptocurrency is set to supersede traditional finance is a powerful testament to the perceived capabilities and inherent advantages of blockchain-based systems. Tenev’s perspective isn’t merely an abstract observation; it stems from Robinhood’s direct involvement in the crypto market, offering various digital assets to millions of users. This firsthand experience likely informs his belief that the inefficiencies, high costs, and centralized control characteristic of traditional finance are becoming increasingly unsustainable in an interconnected, digital-first world. His comments highlight a growing sentiment within the tech and financial sectors: that the foundational principles of cryptocurrency – decentralization, transparency, and peer-to-peer transactions – offer a superior alternative to the legacy banking infrastructure. For a platform like Robinhood, which aims to democratize finance, the appeal of crypto’s inclusive nature is evident. Tenev’s statement serves as a significant endorsement, coming from a CEO whose platform bridges the gap between retail investors and both traditional and emerging financial markets. Why Cryptocurrency is Poised for a Financial Revolution The notion of a financial revolution driven by cryptocurrency is gaining traction for several compelling reasons. At its core, crypto offers a paradigm shift from centralized control to a distributed network, empowering individuals and fostering greater financial inclusion. Here’s why many believe crypto is not just an alternative but a superior evolution: Decentralization: Unlike traditional banks or financial institutions that act as intermediaries, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks (blockchains). This removes the need for trusted third parties, reducing transaction costs and increasing transparency. Efficiency and Speed: Cross-border payments, traditionally slow and expensive, can be executed in minutes or even seconds with cryptocurrencies, often at a fraction of the cost. This efficiency is a game-changer for global commerce and individual remittances. Accessibility: For the unbanked and underbanked populations worldwide, cryptocurrency offers an accessible entry point into the global financial system, requiring only an internet connection and a mobile device. Transparency and Security: Blockchain’s immutable ledger ensures that all transactions are recorded and publicly verifiable (though identities remain pseudonymous), enhancing security and reducing fraud. These inherent advantages position cryptocurrency as a powerful disruptor, capable of reshaping everything from everyday transactions to complex financial instruments. The Clash: Cryptocurrency vs. Traditional Finance The debate between cryptocurrency and traditional finance is not merely academic; it represents a fundamental ideological and technological divergence. While traditional systems are robust, regulated, and have centuries of development behind them, they also face criticisms regarding their speed, cost, and exclusivity. Cryptocurrency, on the other hand, offers solutions to these very problems but introduces its own set of complexities. Let’s compare some key aspects: Feature Traditional Finance Cryptocurrency Intermediary Banks, governments, financial institutions Decentralized network (blockchain) Transaction Speed Hours to days (especially cross-border) Seconds to minutes Cost Often high fees, especially for international transfers Lower fees, especially for large transfers Accessibility Requires bank account, credit checks Internet connection, digital wallet Regulation Highly regulated, established frameworks Evolving, fragmented, and often uncertain Volatility Relatively stable High, though stablecoins aim to mitigate this While traditional finance offers stability and widespread acceptance, its reliance on centralized entities can lead to bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Cryptocurrency, conversely, champions speed and autonomy but grapples with issues of price volatility, regulatory clarity, and user experience. The future likely involves a complex interplay, perhaps a hybrid model, rather than an outright replacement in the short term. Navigating the Digital Economy: Challenges and Opportunities The journey towards a fully realized digital economy powered by crypto is not without its hurdles. While the opportunities are vast, significant challenges must be addressed for widespread adoption to occur. Understanding these aspects is crucial for anyone looking to navigate this evolving landscape. Key Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. This lack of clear, unified regulation creates uncertainty for businesses and investors. Scalability: Many blockchain networks face challenges in processing a high volume of transactions quickly, which is essential for mainstream adoption. Security and Fraud: Despite blockchain’s inherent security, exchanges and individual wallets remain targets for hackers. User education on security best practices is vital. Volatility: The dramatic price swings of many cryptocurrencies make them less suitable for everyday transactions or as a stable store of value for some. User Experience: The technical complexity of managing crypto wallets and understanding blockchain concepts can be a barrier for new users. Immense Opportunities: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Offers traditional financial services like lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries, opening new avenues for financial innovation. NFTs and Web3: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are revolutionizing digital ownership, while Web3 aims to build a decentralized internet, empowering users with control over their data and digital assets. Cross-Border Payments: Lower costs and faster speeds make crypto an ideal solution for international remittances and business transactions. Programmable Money: Smart contracts enable automated, self-executing agreements, paving the way for entirely new business models and applications. Addressing these challenges while harnessing the opportunities will be key to cryptocurrency’s long-term success in reshaping the global financial system. What Does This Mean for the Future of Finance? Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev’s assertion is more than just a prediction; it’s a reflection of a paradigm shift already in motion. The future of finance will undoubtedly be heavily influenced by the advancements in blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. While an immediate, complete replacement of traditional finance seems unlikely, a profound integration and transformation are almost guaranteed. We are likely to see: Hybrid Models: Traditional financial institutions adopting blockchain technology for efficiency, offering crypto services, and potentially issuing their own digital currencies (CBDCs). Increased Interoperability: Seamless connections between different blockchain networks and between traditional and decentralized financial systems. Regulatory Evolution: Governments and international bodies developing clearer, more comprehensive frameworks to manage digital assets, fostering innovation while protecting consumers. Broader Adoption: As user experience improves and volatility potentially stabilizes (especially with stablecoins), more individuals and businesses will integrate crypto into their daily lives. For investors, businesses, and individuals, understanding these trends is paramount. The actionable insight is to stay informed, explore the potential of digital assets responsibly, and recognize that the financial landscape is continuously evolving. Platforms like Robinhood play a crucial role in making these emerging technologies accessible to a wider audience, accelerating the adoption curve. Conclusion: Embracing the Digital Dawn of Finance Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev’s bold prediction that cryptocurrency will replace traditional finance underscores a powerful global trend. While the complete overhaul of established systems may take time, the relentless innovation within the crypto space is undeniable. From enhancing transaction efficiency and reducing costs to fostering financial inclusion and enabling new forms of digital ownership, cryptocurrency is not merely an alternative; it is a fundamental evolution of how we perceive and interact with value. The journey ahead involves navigating regulatory complexities, addressing scalability issues, and continuously improving user experience. Yet, the benefits offered by a decentralized, transparent, and accessible financial system are too significant to ignore. The future of finance is digital, and understanding its trajectory is essential for everyone.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. After a tense weekend that saw the U.S. bomb an Iranian nuclear site , bitcoin btc has regained its footing, hovering around $106K as Asia begins its Wednesday session and pushing past levels from earlier this month when Israel bombed Iran . Part of the reason why crypto has recovered alongside traditional markets is just how correlated the two have become. ""Bitcoin’s sensitivity to traditional asset classes and macroeconomic indicators has evolved markedly over the past few market cycles, reflecting its growing integration into the broader macro-financial system,"" a recent report from Glassnode and Avenir Group reads. ""Institutional infrastructure has reshaped how capital engages with bitcoin. As a result, its market behavior is increasingly governed by structural liquidity, long-horizon positioning, and regulated access points."" That institutional backbone was visible again this week. Semir Gabeljic, director of capital formation and investment strategy at Pythagoras Investments, cited ETF flows as a major tailwind: ""The huge recent capital inflows in Bitcoin ETFs of $1.1 billion last week and even $350 million today alone"" are driving the positive trend. Spencer Yang, Core Contributor to Fractal Bitcoin, added that one of the reasons why BTC was able to shake off war jitters so quickly is that fundamentally, nothing has changed about the asset class due to the conflict in the Middle East. All the metrics that investors would look to for BTC are still there, and other bullish market sentiment is possibly on the way. “We’re seeing continued interest in protocols like BRC-20, especially with the recent upgrade, as well as Runes and Alkanes, which have been getting a lot of attention,"" he added. ""So overall, on‑chain activity across the board is increasing thanks to these types of assets.” The takeaway? As bitcoin becomes increasingly defined by institutional demand and macro liquidity cycles, analysts see its price action as less about reacting to headlines and more about long-term capital commitment. This structural shift is what continues to anchor BTC above $100K, despite the noise. Tim Draper: Bitcoin Is Eating Crypto as Innovation Flocks to BTC The Bitcoin blockchain is becoming the new home for crypto innovation, absorbing ideas once exclusive to altcoins, just as Microsoft once consolidated the software revolution under its operating system empire, Tim Draper argued in a recent post on X . Draper pointed to BTC dominance , a metric equivalent to its ""market share,"" rising over 60%,up from 40% after the 2017 boom-bust cycle and 50% following the 2021 peak, as proof that Bitcoin is reasserting control over the broader crypto ecosystem. Much like how Microsoft integrated or cloned early success stories like Lotus 1-2-3, WordPerfect, and PowerPoint to form its software suite, Draper says Bitcoin is now incorporating once-altcoin-exclusive innovations: smart contracts, DeFi, ordinals, and low-cost layer 2s. “All the successful innovations on other platforms are now being ported to Bitcoin,” Draper wrote, calling it an “acceleration” that mirrors Big Tech consolidation. Developers, he said, are increasingly gravitating toward Bitcoin as the most secure and valuable chain. Draper, who runs a Bitcoin-focused accelerator with Boost VC, said the next generation of entrepreneurs is building on Bitcoin not just for ideological reasons, but because the infrastructure and ecosystem are now ready. “Smart entrepreneurs are always building on the platform with the strongest gravitational pull,” he wrote. “That platform is Bitcoin.” WazirX Granted Extension to Present Revised Restructuring Plan WazirX has received a court-approved extension from the Singapore High Court , allowing it to present further arguments in support of its proposed Scheme of Arrangement. The court also extended the moratorium on creditor actions, which will now remain in place until a ruling is issued on the revised plan. In a statement released Monday, the exchange said it is awaiting further directions from the court and reiterated its commitment to resolving outstanding claims. The company’s original restructuring plan, rejected by the court last month, as CoinDesk previously reported , sought to reimburse users affected by a $234 million hack in July 2024 through the issuance of recovery tokens and a transfer of operations to a new entity, Zensui Corporation. More than 93% of creditors had approved the initial plan, but the court cited concerns around governance and transparency. Without an approved arrangement, WazirX faces the possibility of liquidation under Singapore’s Companies Act, which could lead to extended delays and reduced creditor recoveries. No date has been set for the next court hearing. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin surged past $106,000 after a ceasefire between Israel and Iran eased geopolitical tensions, triggering a breakout fueled by high-conviction buyers, bullish technical signals, and strong on-chain accumulation, while the broader CD20 index also climbed nearly 1% amid renewed market strength. ETH: Ethereum surged 4% to break above $2,450 as Trump’s announcement of an Israel-Iran ceasefire eased global tensions, triggering renewed institutional accumulation and strong on-chain buying momentum. Gold: Gold fell as much as 2% to $3,300 after Trump’s surprise Israel-Iran ceasefire announcement eased geopolitical tensions, weakening safe-haven demand even as the metal remains up over 25% year-to-date.

Cost-Effectiveness: Eliminating licensing fees reduces development and manufacturing costs, potentially leading to more affordable and accessible hardware solutions. Innovation Acceleration: A level playing field encourages broader participation and innovation, fostering a diverse ecosystem of hardware and software developers. For ZK-proofs, which are computationally intensive, having a highly optimized and customizable hardware foundation like RISC-V can lead to significant breakthroughs in speed and energy efficiency. This is precisely what Matter Labs is leveraging with Airbender. How Does Airbender Impact Ethereum Scaling and Beyond? The core promise of Airbender lies in its ability to dramatically improve Ethereum scaling . Currently, generating ZK-proofs is one of the most resource-intensive steps in a ZK-rollup’s operation. By reducing the time it takes to prove an Ethereum block to under 35 seconds with a single GPU, Airbender directly contributes to a more robust and scalable Ethereum ecosystem. Consider the implications: For ZK-Rollups: Faster Finality: Transactions on ZKSync can achieve finality on the Ethereum mainnet much quicker, enhancing user experience for applications like DeFi and NFTs. Higher Throughput: The ability to process proofs faster means the rollup can handle a larger volume of transactions, bringing Layer 2s closer to mainstream adoption levels. Reduced Operational Costs: Less time and fewer resources (GPUs) required for proof generation can lead to more cost-efficient rollup operations, which can be passed on to users in the form of lower gas fees. For the Broader Ethereum Ecosystem: Enhanced Network Capacity: As Layer 2 solutions become more efficient, they offload more traffic from the mainnet, contributing to a healthier and less congested Ethereum. Improved User Experience: Faster, cheaper transactions make decentralized applications more competitive with traditional web services, attracting a wider user base.

The decline coincided with business uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. However, the slowdown may be short-lived, as multiple foreign firms are launching multibillion-dollar manufacturing projects nationwide. Nippon Steel’s acquisition of US Steel for nearly $15 billion is also expected to boost FDI figures in the upcoming quarters. Trump’s tariff policies hinder investments in the US, slowing down the economy The lower first-quarter Foreign Direct Investment inflows contributed to a widening of the US current account deficit to a record high of $450.2 billion as businesses front-loaded imports ahead of Trump’s steep tariffs . The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis also said the fourth quarter’s current account data was revised to $312.0 billion, instead of the previously reported $303.9 billion. The data on the current account measures the net movement of goods, services, and investments in and out of the country. Notably, a big and longstanding US trade deficit has in the past been partially offset by investment inflows into US financial assets and foreign direct investment. This majorly consists of plant and equipment, corporate mergers, and acquisitions. Meanwhile, the first-quarter FDI inflows were the smallest in dollar terms since the $42.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, a time of high post-pandemic inflation. Other than that drop, quarterly FDI has been above $61 billion since the COVID-19 pandemic eased, reaching a high of $135 billion in the third quarter of 2021, the Commerce Department reported. Economists have cautioned that the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariffs might hinder companies from making investment choices and could slow economic growth. On the other hand, Trump claims that his tariffs are causing a surge in investments as companies try to bring manufacturing back to the US to avoid these tariffs. Paul Ashworth, a chief North American economist at Capital Economics, shared his opinion on the topic of discussion. According to Ashworth, while uncertainty could have influenced some investment decisions, quarterly FDI was difficult to forecast and could be influenced by specific transactions, like mergers, acquisitions, or large projects. He called the first-quarter figures “probably noise” instead of suggesting a more serious issue regarding FDI entering the US. Economists warn against the longer-term risk to the dollar In the first quarter, the US current account deficit grew to an all-time high because companies rushed to bring imports to avoid President Donald Trump’s large tariffs on imported goods. The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said the current account deficit, a measure of the flow of goods, services, and investments into and out of the United States, surged from $138.2 billion, or 44.3%, to a record of $450.2 billion. Fourth-quarter data was revised to show the shortfall at $312.0 billion instead of $303.9 billion, as reported last month. Economists polled had also anticipated the deficit would increase in the fourth quarter to $443.3 billion. The deficit was equal to 6.0% of gross domestic product, the highest since the third quarter of 2006, when it was 6.3%. That was higher than 4.2% in the October-December quarter. Goods imports surged $158.2 billion to an all-time high of $1.00 trillion. That rise was driven mostly by nonmonetary gold and consumer goods, notably medicines, dental goods, and pharmaceuticals. Contrastingly, service imports dropped $1.8 billion to $217.8 billion. Reduced payments for using intellectual property, such as licenses for research and development results, primarily drove this decline. Still, economists cautioned that the growing current account gap and burgeoning federal government budget deficit represent a longer-term risk to the dollar. Furthermore, Trump’s across-the-board tariffs have dulled some of the dollar’s safe-haven status.

Recently, the crypto world has witnessed a welcome surge in the price of Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This ETH price recovery has brought a sigh of relief to many who weathered the preceding downturn. However, a closer look at underlying market indicators reveals a fascinating paradox: despite the upward trend in price, a palpable sense of caution continues to grip Ethereum investors. Why is this the case? What hidden signals are preventing a full embrace of bullish enthusiasm? Let’s delve into the complex layers of market sentiment and on-chain data to uncover the truth. Understanding Ethereum Investor Sentiment : A Deeper Dive At the heart of this cautious stance lies a meticulous analysis of various market metrics, painting a picture that extends beyond mere price charts. One key indicator that has drawn attention is the monthly futures premium for ETH. Cointelegraph’s analysis recently highlighted that this premium has fallen to a bearish 3% level. For those new to the derivatives market, the futures premium reflects the difference between the price of a futures contract and the current spot price of an asset. A low premium, especially one hovering around 3% or lower, suggests that traders are not willing to pay a significant premium for future delivery, indicating a lack of strong bullish conviction and even a potential for bearish expectations. This metric is crucial because it often serves as a barometer for institutional and sophisticated investor sentiment. When the premium is high, it signals strong demand for leveraged long positions, indicating confidence in future price appreciation. Conversely, a low or negative premium points to either weak demand for longs or an inclination towards shorting the asset. The current 3% level is a clear signal that, despite the spot market’s rebound, derivative traders remain hesitant to place significant bets on further upside, preferring to remain on the sidelines or even hedge against potential downturns. Furthermore, this caution is not new. Investors have been noticeably avoiding leveraged long positions since June 12, a period coinciding with ETH’s struggle to maintain the $2,700 price level. This reluctance to take on additional risk through leverage underscores a broader narrative of risk aversion. After experiencing significant volatility and drawdowns in previous market cycles, many investors are now prioritizing capital preservation over aggressive speculation. This shift in risk appetite is a natural response to market uncertainty and speaks volumes about the current state of investor sentiment within the Ethereum ecosystem. Key Takeaways on Investor Caution: Low Futures Premium: A 3% monthly futures premium indicates a lack of strong bullish conviction among derivatives traders. Avoidance of Leveraged Longs: Investors are shying away from high-risk, high-reward positions, suggesting a preference for caution. Risk Aversion: The market’s recent history has instilled a more conservative approach to investing. The Curious Case of ETH Price Recovery and Lingering Bearishness While the spot price of ETH has shown resilience, the underlying reasons for the cautious sentiment are multifaceted. One significant factor contributing to this slow recovery of investment sentiment is the comparison between network fees and the Total Value Locked (TVL) within Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. TVL represents the total value of assets staked in DeFi protocols, serving as a proxy for the health and adoption of the ecosystem. Historically, high fees on the Ethereum network were a common complaint, yet they also indicated intense demand for block space and network utility. However, if network fees are relatively low compared to a high TVL, it can signal a few things. It might suggest that while assets are locked in protocols, the actual transactional activity generating fees is not as robust as it once was, or that users are migrating to Layer 2 solutions where fees are significantly lower. While lower fees are generally beneficial for users, a sustained period of very low fees relative to the vast amount of value locked could raise questions about the profitability for validators (post-Merge) or the overall economic viability of certain dApps, especially when considering the competitive landscape. This dynamic contributes to the nuanced view of the current ETH price recovery , as investors look beyond mere price appreciation to the underlying economic health of the network. The market’s current state is a testament to the adage that not all recoveries are created equal. A price rebound that isn’t accompanied by strong fundamental signals, such as robust on-chain activity and high demand for network services, can leave investors wary. The memory of previous market corrections is still fresh, making market participants more discerning about the sustainability of any upward movement. This cautious approach is a sign of a maturing market, where investors are increasingly looking at deeper metrics rather than just superficial price action. Why Are Decentralized Applications (dApps) Causing Concern? Another critical element contributing to investor hesitation is the intensifying competition in decentralized applications (dApp) activity. For years, Ethereum reigned supreme as the undisputed king of dApps and DeFi. Its first-mover advantage, robust developer community, and extensive ecosystem made it the go-to blockchain for innovation. However, the landscape has evolved dramatically. New Layer 1 blockchains and Layer 2 scaling solutions have emerged, each vying for a slice of the dApp pie. Chains like Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, and Optimism have gained significant traction by offering faster transaction speeds and, crucially, lower gas fees compared to Ethereum’s mainnet. These alternative networks are attracting developers and users alike, leading to a fragmentation of dApp activity. While Ethereum still hosts the largest TVL and a vast number of prominent dApps, the increased competition means that its dominance is no longer unchallenged. Investors are keenly observing whether Ethereum can maintain its competitive edge and continue to attract the next wave of innovation amidst this fierce rivalry. The success of dApps is vital for Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. They drive network usage, generate fees, and attract new users to the ecosystem. If a significant portion of dApp activity shifts to other chains, it could potentially impact Ethereum’s network effects and overall economic model. This competitive pressure forces investors to consider the broader ecosystem health and not just Ethereum in isolation. The narrative is no longer solely about Ethereum’s growth but also its ability to defend its market share against agile and innovative competitors. The Evolving dApp Landscape: Increased Competition: New L1s and L2s offer faster, cheaper alternatives to Ethereum. Market Fragmentation: dApp activity is spreading across multiple blockchains. Impact on Ethereum: Potential challenges to network effects and long-term value proposition if market share erodes significantly. Navigating the Broader Crypto Market Analysis Beyond Ethereum-specific metrics, the overall sentiment in the broader crypto market analysis plays a significant role. The crypto market, as a whole, has endured a challenging period marked by macroeconomic uncertainties, regulatory scrutiny, and high-profile industry events. These factors have collectively contributed to a more risk-off environment across all asset classes, including digital assets. Investors are not just looking at individual coin performance but also at the macro picture, including inflation rates, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions. This broader market caution naturally spills over into specific assets like Ethereum. Even if Ethereum’s fundamentals appear strong, a bearish macro environment can dampen enthusiasm and prevent significant capital inflows. The memory of past market crashes, often triggered by external economic factors, makes investors particularly sensitive to global financial indicators. Therefore, while Ethereum’s internal metrics are crucial, its fate is also inextricably linked to the ebb and flow of the global economy and the wider crypto market’s perception of risk. However, it’s not all doom and gloom. The options market skew, which measures the difference in implied volatility between call and put options, currently stands at a neutral 2% level. This neutrality is a fascinating counterpoint to the bearish futures premium. While the futures market indicates a lack of aggressive long bets, the options market suggests that traders are not overwhelmingly betting on a downside either. A neutral skew means that the demand for protection against price drops (puts) is roughly balanced with the demand for participation in price rallies (calls). This balance indicates that while caution prevails, there is also an underlying expectation or hope for a bullish turn, preventing a complete capitulation of positive sentiment. This neutrality in the options market could be interpreted as a ‘wait-and-see’ approach. Investors are not rushing to open aggressive positions in either direction, suggesting that they are keenly observing further developments before committing. This balanced outlook provides a glimmer of hope that a catalyst, whether it be a significant network upgrade, a positive macroeconomic shift, or a surge in dApp adoption, could tip the scales towards a more pronounced bullish sentiment. What’s Next for Ethereum ? Actionable Insights Given the mixed signals, what does this mean for investors and enthusiasts of Ethereum ? The current environment presents both challenges and opportunities. The challenges include the persistent competition from other blockchains, the need to demonstrate sustained on-chain activity beyond just TVL, and the broader macroeconomic headwinds. However, Ethereum also possesses inherent strengths that cannot be overlooked. Its robust network effect, the largest developer community in the crypto space, and ongoing scalability improvements (like the continued development of Layer 2 solutions and future EIPs) position it well for long-term growth. The successful completion of The Merge, transitioning to Proof-of-Stake, was a monumental achievement that significantly reduced its energy consumption and set the stage for further upgrades focusing on scalability and efficiency. Actionable Insights for Investors: Look Beyond Price: Focus on fundamental metrics like network usage, developer activity, and fee generation relative to TVL. Monitor Competition: Keep an eye on the growth and innovation happening on alternative L1s and L2s. Understand Derivatives: Pay attention to futures premiums and options skew as indicators of sophisticated investor sentiment. Long-Term Perspective: For those bullish on Ethereum’s technology and ecosystem, periods of caution can present opportunities for strategic accumulation. Diversify: Consider a balanced portfolio that accounts for the inherent volatility and evolving competitive landscape of the crypto market. The current situation is a testament to the growing maturity of the crypto market. Investors are no longer simply chasing hype but are increasingly engaging in sophisticated crypto market analysis , scrutinizing on-chain data, derivatives markets, and competitive landscapes. This level of diligence is crucial for navigating the inherent volatility and identifying sustainable growth opportunities. Conclusion: A Cautious Optimism for Ethereum’s Future The paradox of a rising ETH price coupled with lingering investor caution highlights the complex dynamics at play in the cryptocurrency market. While the ETH price recovery is a positive sign, the bearish futures premium, the slow recovery of investment sentiment due to low fees relative to TVL, and intensifying competition from other decentralized applications are valid concerns that keep investors on edge. The neutrality in the options market, however, suggests that outright bearishness is not the dominant sentiment, leaving room for a potential bullish turn if underlying conditions improve. Ultimately, Ethereum’s journey is one of continuous evolution and adaptation. Its ability to innovate, scale, and maintain its competitive edge against a backdrop of increasing competition will dictate its long-term trajectory. For investors, understanding these nuanced signals is key to making informed decisions in a market that continues to surprise and challenge even the most seasoned participants. The current caution isn’t a sign of weakness, but rather a reflection of a discerning market, patiently awaiting stronger fundamental signals to fully embrace the next phase of growth for Ethereum.

Understanding Synaptogenix’s Strategic TAO Token Acquisition Synaptogenix, a name typically associated with neurodegenerative disease research, has now firmly planted its flag in the digital asset landscape. Their press release confirmed the purchase of TAO token , the native cryptocurrency of Bittensor, a groundbreaking decentralized machine learning network. This isn’t a small, experimental allocation; Synaptogenix had previously declared its intent to invest up to $10 million in TAO, underscoring a serious commitment to this emerging asset class. What makes this particular investment so noteworthy? Institutional Validation: A Nasdaq-listed company making such a direct investment in a cryptocurrency, especially one tied to a complex AI network, lends significant credibility to the space. It moves digital assets further into the mainstream. Forward-Thinking Treasury Management: This move highlights a shift in corporate treasury strategies, where companies are exploring diversification beyond traditional fiat and equities into high-growth, innovative digital assets. AI and Blockchain Convergence: Synaptogenix’s choice of TAO isn’t arbitrary. It’s an investment in the very infrastructure of decentralized AI, suggesting a belief in its long-term transformative power. What is Bittensor and Why is TAO Important? To fully grasp the significance of Synaptogenix’s investment, one must understand the innovative project behind the TAO token : Bittensor . At its core, Bittensor is a decentralized machine learning network. Think of it as a peer-to-peer marketplace for intelligence, where AI models and services can be shared, accessed, and monetized without central intermediaries. Here’s a breakdown of how Bittensor operates and the role of TAO: Aspect Description Decentralized AI Instead of centralized AI labs, Bittensor allows anyone to contribute computational power and machine learning models. Subnets Specialized networks within Bittensor focusing on specific AI tasks (e.g., text generation, image processing, data scraping). Incentive Mechanism Participants (miners, validators) are rewarded with TAO tokens for providing valuable intelligence and maintaining the network. TAO’s Utility TAO is used for network fees, staking to secure subnets, and as a medium of exchange for AI services within the ecosystem. It’s the lifeblood of the Bittensor economy. By investing in TAO, Synaptogenix isn’t just buying a digital asset; it’s buying into the future of open-source, collaborative, and censorship-resistant artificial intelligence development. This foresight could position the company at the forefront of technological innovation. Securing the Future: BitGo’s Role in Synaptogenix’s Blockchain Treasury A crucial aspect of Synaptogenix’s blockchain treasury strategy is the selection of a robust and reputable service provider for managing its digital assets. The company has chosen BitGo, a leading name in institutional digital asset custody, staking, and trading services. This decision underscores the seriousness and professionalism with which Synaptogenix is approaching its crypto ventures. Why is BitGo’s involvement so important? Institutional-Grade Security: BitGo offers cold storage solutions and multi-signature wallets, crucial for protecting significant corporate investments from hacks and theft. Compliance and Regulation: As a regulated custodian, BitGo helps Synaptogenix navigate the complex regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets, ensuring adherence to best practices. Staking Services: By utilizing BitGo for staking, Synaptogenix can potentially earn yield on its TAO holdings, adding another layer of value to its investment beyond simple price appreciation. This aligns perfectly with a long-term treasury strategy. Trading Capabilities: Integrated trading services simplify the process of acquiring and managing large quantities of tokens, providing efficiency and liquidity. The choice of BitGo signals that Synaptogenix is not dabbling but is establishing a secure, compliant, and professional framework for its foray into digital assets, setting a precedent for other public companies considering similar moves. The Broader Implications for Decentralized AI and Corporate Strategy Synaptogenix’s investment in the TAO token is more than just a single company’s financial decision; it’s a bellwether for the evolving relationship between traditional enterprises and the burgeoning world of decentralized AI . This move highlights several key trends: Growing Institutional Confidence: More and more, large, publicly traded companies are moving beyond mere exploration of crypto to active investment and integration into their financial strategies. AI’s Decentralized Future: The investment validates the idea that AI development doesn’t have to be monopolized by a few tech giants. Decentralized networks like Bittensor offer an alternative, more open, and potentially more resilient path. New Revenue Streams and Diversification: Companies are looking for innovative ways to diversify their balance sheets and potentially generate returns outside of their core business, leveraging the growth potential of emerging technologies.

This development could inspire other companies, especially those in tech-adjacent sectors, to seriously evaluate the inclusion of digital assets and decentralized technologies in their long-term strategic plans. The benefits could include access to cutting-edge infrastructure, new talent pools, and diversified asset exposure. Challenges and Considerations for Blockchain Treasury Strategies While the Synaptogenix news is overwhelmingly positive for the crypto and decentralized AI space, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and considerations inherent in a blockchain treasury strategy: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including TAO, are known for their price volatility. While offering high upside potential, they also carry significant risk of depreciation. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving globally. Companies engaging in such strategies must stay abreast of new laws and compliance requirements. Security Risks: Despite using institutional custodians like BitGo, the digital asset space is prone to security breaches. Robust internal protocols are equally important. Accounting and Reporting: Integrating digital assets into traditional financial reporting systems can be complex, requiring specialized expertise. Public Perception: For some traditional investors, crypto investments might still be viewed with skepticism, requiring clear communication from the company. Synaptogenix’s decision to use a reputable custodian like BitGo mitigates many of these risks, but a comprehensive understanding of the landscape is crucial for any company venturing into this domain. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Corporate Finance and AI Synaptogenix’s purchase of the TAO token and its commitment to a sophisticated blockchain treasury strategy marks a pivotal moment. It’s not just an investment in a digital asset; it’s a profound vote of confidence in the future of Bittensor and the broader vision of decentralized AI . This move by a Nasdaq-listed company signals a clear trend: the lines between traditional finance and the crypto economy are blurring, and innovative companies are actively positioning themselves to capitalize on the next wave of technological disruption. As we watch this space evolve, Synaptogenix’s pioneering step serves as a powerful example of how corporations are beginning to embrace the transformative potential of blockchain and artificial intelligence, not just as abstract concepts, but as integral components of their long-term financial and strategic growth. This could very well be the beginning of a new era for corporate asset management and technological integration.

The filing, dated Tuesday and filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is for listing the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, a fund that would invest 75% of its assets in Bitcoin and 25% in Ethereum. The ETF filing from Trump Media comes just eight days after the firm behind the SPAC filed its prospectus with the official CT attorney general, Yorkville America, representing a significant ramp of the company’s crypto strategy. Trump Media, which is majority-owned by President Donald Trump, has recently shifted into high gear in promoting financial products tied to blockchain technologies that can afford the public a taste of crypto via regulated investment vehicles. If approved, the filing would be the second related to a Truth Social-branded ETF in less than a month. The first, Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, submitted its filing in early June, and it was Bitcoin only. Both filings emphasize TMTG’s goal to establish itself as more than a social media and media streaming brand, betting instead that it can be taken seriously in the crypto finance space. Crypto.com to manage and secure ETF operations TMTG and Yorkville America have partnered with Crypto.com, a top-tier exchange, to manage the ETF’s deep-tech infrastructure. Crypto.com will provide digital asset custody , act as the execution agent for crypto transactions, and ensure liquidity for smooth fund operations. In the filing with the SEC, NYSE Arca explained that the proposed listing would attempt to comply with the relevant regulations. “The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in that the shares will be listed and traded on the exchange under the initial and continued listing criteria in NYSE,” the filing read. This proposal falls under the SEC’s 19b-4 rule change process, which exchanges use when they propose to offer new financial products. The filing is a key regulatory milestone, but does not guarantee approval. The SEC decides whether to allow or reject a listing, typically following public comment and internal review. Trump influence shifts SEC crypto stance The SEC’s position on digital currency seems to be changeable under the incumbent administration of President Donald Trump. The agency, which was once seen as cautious and sometimes skeptical of digital assets, has started to take that more positive view . That tone change comes after several senior SEC positions have been filled, with several appointees seen as sympathetic to the development of crypto markets and increased investor access more generally. Even President Trump has transformed his outlook dramatically. He criticized cryptocurrencies in his first term but has become one of their most outspoken political supporters. Indeed, during recent campaign speeches and public appearances, Trump referred to digital assets as instruments of “financial freedom” and has since integrated blockchain solutions into public policy projects. The increasing political support also gives momentum to Trump Media & Technology Group’s (TMTG) accelerating push into the crypto space. In collaboration with Yorkville America and Crypto.com, it announced the launch of a new suite of blockchain-based financial products under the ”America First.” Some offerings it is considering include the America First Bitcoin Fund, America First Blockchain Leaders Fund, and the America First Stablecoin Income Fund. But so far, just two products, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF and the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, have been formally filed with the SEC. The rest are conceptual and have not yet made any regulatory submissions.

However, a significant development in the US Stock Market Rally recently caught the attention of investors globally: the three major U.S. stock markets closed significantly higher. This isn’t just good news for Wall Street; it often signals broader economic trends that can subtly, yet powerfully, influence the cryptocurrency landscape. So, why should crypto enthusiasts pay attention to the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500? The Triumphant US Stock Market Rally: A Closer Look The recent closing bell brought cheers across trading floors as the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all posted impressive gains. This collective rise signals a robust investor appetite and renewed optimism in the economy. Let’s break down the numbers: Market Index Daily Performance S&P 500 +1.11% Nasdaq Composite +1.53% Dow Jones Industrial Average +1.19% These figures represent more than just percentages; they reflect a collective belief in the resilience and growth potential of American corporations. This positive momentum often creates a ripple effect, influencing various asset classes, including digital currencies, and strengthening the overall US Stock Market Rally . What Drove the Stellar Nasdaq Performance? The Nasdaq Composite, often seen as a bellwether for technology and growth stocks, led the charge with a remarkable 1.53% gain. What factors contributed to this impressive Nasdaq Performance ? Tech Sector Strength: Major technology companies, which dominate the Nasdaq, often drive its performance. Positive earnings reports or optimistic outlooks from these giants can significantly boost the index. Innovation and Growth: The Nasdaq is home to many innovative companies pushing boundaries in AI, biotechnology, and renewable energy. Investor confidence in these sectors fuels their growth. Interest Rate Expectations: Hopes for stable or even declining interest rates can make growth stocks more attractive, as lower borrowing costs improve future earnings prospects. Understanding the drivers behind Nasdaq’s strength can offer insights into broader market sentiment towards risk and innovation, which are also core tenets of the crypto space. A strong Nasdaq Performance often correlates with a healthy appetite for riskier, growth-oriented investments. Unpacking the S&P 500 Gains: A Broad Market Barometer The S&P 500, representing the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies, climbed 1.11%, showcasing widespread positive sentiment. These significant S&P 500 Gains are crucial because the index is often considered the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. What does its rise tell us? Broad-Based Optimism: A gain in the S&P 500 suggests that optimism isn’t confined to a few sectors but is spread across diverse industries, from finance to healthcare and consumer goods. Corporate Health: Strong S&P 500 performance often indicates healthy corporate earnings and robust economic activity, providing a solid foundation for overall market stability. Investor Confidence: When this broad index moves up, it generally signals that investors feel confident about the economic outlook, leading to increased investment across the board. This widespread confidence from the S&P 500 Gains can indirectly benefit the crypto market by fostering a general environment of risk-taking and investment, as capital seeks opportunities across various asset classes. The Steady Ascent: Why the Dow Jones Higher Trend Matters The Dow Jones Industrial Average, composed of 30 prominent U.S. companies, also joined the rally, closing 1.19% higher. The consistent trend of the Dow Jones Higher is often seen as a reflection of the health of established, blue-chip American companies. What’s the significance here? Stability and Trust: The Dow comprises companies with long histories and stable earnings, often seen as safer investments. Its upward movement suggests trust in the foundational elements of the U.S. economy. Industrial Strength: Many Dow components are industrial giants, financial institutions, and consumer staples companies. Their performance indicates strength in core economic sectors. Investor Behavior: When even the more conservative parts of the market are performing well, it can encourage a broader range of investors to deploy capital, not just into traditional assets but potentially into emerging ones like crypto. The Dow’s steady climb reinforces the narrative of a resilient economy, where the Dow Jones Higher trend suggests a stable bedrock for broader market confidence. The Crucial Crypto Market Connection: Bridging Traditional Finance and Digital Assets Now, let’s address the elephant in the room: how do these traditional market movements impact the crypto space? The Crypto Market Connection is more profound than many might realize. While cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, their price movements are not entirely decoupled from global macroeconomic trends and investor sentiment. Risk-On Sentiment: When traditional markets perform well, it often indicates a “risk-on” environment. Investors feel more confident taking on riskier assets, and this increased appetite for risk can flow into the crypto market. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” can also be seen as a risk asset in certain market conditions. Liquidity Inflow: A thriving stock market can generate wealth and profits for investors. A portion of these profits might then be re-allocated into other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, seeking higher returns or diversification. Institutional Interest: Major financial institutions that invest in stocks also increasingly hold positions in cryptocurrencies. A strong performance in their traditional portfolios might free up capital or encourage them to increase their exposure to digital assets. Economic Confidence: Overall economic optimism, reflected in rising stock markets, can lead to increased consumer spending and business investment, indirectly benefiting innovative technologies and new financial paradigms like blockchain and crypto. Conversely, a downturn in traditional markets can sometimes lead to a “risk-off” environment, where investors pull out of volatile assets, including crypto, to seek safety. Therefore, keeping an eye on these traditional market indicators is a smart move for any crypto investor, as it highlights the vital Crypto Market Connection . What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio? While past performance is not indicative of future results, the current upward trend in the U.S. stock markets suggests a positive backdrop for broader investment sentiment. This doesn’t guarantee a crypto bull run, but it certainly doesn’t hurt. Consider the following actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continue monitoring both traditional and crypto markets. Understanding their interplay provides a holistic view. Diversify Wisely: While crypto offers unique opportunities, a balanced portfolio often includes exposure to different asset classes. Assess Risk Appetite: A strong stock market might encourage you to take on slightly more risk, but always within your comfort zone and investment strategy. Conclusion: Riding the Wave of Market Optimism The impressive close of the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average marks a significant moment for the financial markets, signaling robust investor confidence and a healthy economic outlook. This positive momentum, while originating in traditional finance, creates a favorable environment that can influence the broader investment landscape, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. By understanding the intricate connections between these markets, crypto investors can gain a more nuanced perspective and make more informed decisions. As traditional markets continue their ascent, the ripple effect could very well bring exciting opportunities to the digital asset space, reinforcing the strength of the US Stock Market Rally and its potential implications for digital assets.

Some names are losing pace, while others are catching attention with fresh momentum. One of those getting noticed is Unstaked , a blockchain platform with plans for AI tools and on-chain use. It has now raised over $10.5 million, and at a price of $0.011739, it’s starting to move from under-the-radar to one to watch. On the other side, Dogecoin (DOGE) price updates are showing weakness. It has fallen below key support, causing many to sell. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid (HYPE) price today is climbing fast, setting a new high over $44 and becoming one of the market’s short-term standouts. Still, for those looking at the crypto coins to buy now, Unstaked stands out with a mix of future tools, early access, and strong upside potential. DOGE Drops Below $0.18 as Selling Pressure Grows Dogecoin (DOGE) price has taken a hit, slipping under the $0.18 support level. As of Monday, it trades near $0.176, down about 9% from its latest local high. The Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) metric has gone up, showing many holders are cashing out. That’s often a sign that more losses could come. DOGE also fell below its 50-day EMA of $0.195, and the RSI sits at 38, pointing to more bearish pressure. If it doesn’t bounce back over $0.181 soon, it could slide further to $0.157, which was the low back in April. “Age Consumed” data also shows older DOGE wallets are starting to move again, a sign that long-time holders may be exiting. Even though some hoped for a recovery, charts show weakness is still in control. This recent turn puts DOGE in a tough spot, especially as more users begin to shift toward coins offering clearer use and future plans. HYPE Climbs to New Highs, Eyes $50 and Beyond While DOGE struggles, Hyperliquid (HYPE) price today is moving fast. It just hit a new high of $44.76, jumping 25% this week. Open interest now stands at over $1.83 billion, showing strong market interest. Even though trading volume and transaction count dropped a bit, on-chain data suggests the market still leans bullish. The MACD remains positive, and HYPE stays above key Fibonacci support zones. Some believe the price could reach $50 soon, with more gains possible if volume picks up again. HYPE is now being seen as one of the fast movers in the market. Still, its high price, limited early access, and recent dip in activity are making some look for other options. That’s where lower-priced entries with more room to grow, like Unstaked, are getting attention. Unstaked Hits $10.5M with $0.011739 Price and Bold $1 Goal Unstaked, now in Stage 21 of its AI crypto presale, is quickly becoming one of the more talked-about early-stage projects. With its current price at $0.011739 and a projected launch value of $0.1819, it shows a possible 28x return. Over $10.5 million has already been raised, and more than 26.13 million units have been sold, suggesting growing confidence in the project. While many coins rise on short-term buzz, Unstaked is focused on building long-term value. Its platform will let users create AI-based agents to handle tasks like marketing, data work, and running online communities. These agents are planned to work under on-chain rules, giving users more direct control. One of the main features is the Proof of Intelligence system. This tool checks how well the agents perform and rewards useful behavior. The aim is to build a system where real performance supports actual value, creating a cycle that links actions to outcomes.

The latest technical analysis suggests a potential shift in momentum if the token can break through. All eyes are now on whether SHIB can confirm the breakout and trigger a short-term rally. Ethereum is taking a breather after last week’s strong move above $2,800. Despite the cooldown, the price remains well supported by record staking levels and consistent ETF inflows. Long-term sentiment around ETH continues to build as institutional interest holds steady. Meanwhile, Web3 ai ($WAI) is taking a more grounded approach. Rather than chasing headlines, it focuses on functionality. With $WAI powering tools, rewards, and governance, the platform is built to offer lasting value. The presale has already raised over $8.5 million, and early buyers are now tracking a 1,747% return potential. Shiba Inu Hovers Near Breakout Zone: Momentum Builds Shiba Inu is holding steady above the $0.00001100 support level, showing signs of resilience after several weeks of downward pressure. The token now sits just below a key resistance zone between $0.00001234 and $0.00001238, aligned with a descending trendline that has capped price action. A breakout above this range could open the door to a move toward $0.00001368 if volume holds. Short-term indicators are also leaning bullish. The 1-hour chart shows growing pressure near the 200-hour moving average, a level often watched by traders. With momentum staying above $0.00001170, the $0.00001200 pivot is now a critical price point to watch for confirmation. Ethereum Cools Off After Rally but Long-Term Signals Stay Strong Ethereum is trading around $2,511 after a notable pullback from last week’s high near $2,800. The nearly 9.4% drop has paused short-term momentum, but key on-chain metrics continue to strengthen. More than 35 million ETH is now staked, reducing the circulating supply and pointing to growing conviction. Long-term accumulation is also rising. Addresses holding ETH have reached a record high of 22.8 million. Traders are watching the 50-week exponential moving average closely, as it has previously triggered large moves. Meanwhile, spot Ether ETFs have recorded 19 straight days of inflows, adding $1.37 billion in total and reflecting continued institutional interest. $WAI Powers Real Utility as Web3 ai Targets 1,747% ROI at Launch While many crypto projects chase attention before building real use cases, Web3 ai is taking a different route. Its native token, $WAI, is directly tied to platform access, feature discounts, and governance participation. Users can vote on upgrades, unlock premium tools, and receive platform-wide benefits. As adoption grows, $WAI’s role becomes even more essential. The presale has already raised $8.5 million, with 23.3 billion tokens sold in Stage 9. The current price is $0.000443, while the launch value is locked at $0.005242. That gives early buyers from Stage 1 a shot at a 1,747% return. Each presale stage is transparently structured to fund development and reward early participation. Post-launch, Web3 ai will offer a suite of AI-powered tools built to simplify crypto. These include scam detection, DeFi strategy analysis, real-time risk modelling, and portfolio management. The platform is designed to reduce guesswork for everyday users while enhancing decision-making through intelligent insights. Available on web, mobile, and browser extension, Web3 ai supports major chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, and Polygon. Since $WAI is required to access these features, rising demand may tighten supply quickly. At its current price, $WAI still presents a significant value window for long-term users. Final Analysis Shiba Inu is holding support and testing resistance levels, setting the stage for a possible short-term recovery if momentum builds. Ethereum continues to draw steady interest, with strong staking numbers and long-term holders reinforcing confidence. Both show potential, but still rely heavily on broader market signals. Web3 ai is following a different path. With $WAI powering all platform features and adoption expected to grow post-launch, the current presale price offers serious upside. A 1,747% ROI is still on the table, and with $8.5 million already raised, the window is narrowing. In a market shifting toward real utility, $WAI is gaining ground fast.

As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,323, up by 4% in the last 24 hours. The price recovery arrives in broader investor sentiment shifts, both in on-chain behavior and exchange activity. A recent analysis from CryptoQuant’s analyst Darkfost sheds light on a multi-year transition among Bitcoin holders. The analyst observes that fewer Bitcoin addresses are depositing coins onto exchanges, a trend that has persisted since the end of the 2021 market cycle. This declining activity may not necessarily suggest fading interest in BTC, but rather a transformation in how investors interact with the asset, potentially hinting at longer-term strategies becoming the norm. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Drop Below $100k Sparks Bearish Chatter, But Data Says Something Else Decline in Exchange Deposits Suggests Structural Market Shift According to Darkfost, between 2015 and 2021, the number of Bitcoin addresses depositing funds to exchanges steadily increased, peaking at an annual average of around 180,000. However, this upward trend has reversed sharply in the years since. The 10-year moving average now hovers around 90,000, while the 30-day average has fallen to 48,000. Most recently, the daily figure dropped to just 37,000. Darkfost mentioned: This reflects a significant behavioral change among BTC investors, which can likely be attributed to several key factors : – One major factor is the arrival of ETFs, which allow exposure to Bitcoin’s price performance without the complexity or risk of directly managing the asset. Additionally, the current market cycle has seen relatively low retail participation, which historically contributed to exchange deposits. More notably, an increasing number of investors, ranging from individuals to institutions, are treating Bitcoin as a long-term store of value or treasury reserve asset rather than a short-term speculative vehicle. The CryptoQuant analyst added: These shifts, which have emerged gradually over time, are precisely what drive Bitcoin’s evolving identity in financial markets. It may well be this transformation that ultimately solidifies BTC’s role as a store of value. Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Patterns Emerge Amid Lower Volume In a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst, Mignolet, focused on activity by large holders on the Bybit exchange. He highlighted that as general market interest and trading volume diminish, the trading patterns of whales become more visible. Mignolet noted that previous periods of reduced sentiment and low volume often saw significant whale accumulation, which historically preceded upward price movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Repeats Its 2021 Pattern—Analyst Warns Final Crash Still Ahead This pattern, according to Mignolet, appears to be repeating. Since Bitcoin’s local bottom in April, consistent accumulation by large entities has been observed on Bybit. He suggested this could be a signal of underlying market confidence, particularly when retail activity is minimal. While not a guaranteed forecast, historical parallels imply that such behavior may again precede broader price strength, lending weight to ongoing consolidation as a potential setup for future momentum.

With more than $321 million raised and 23.2 billion BDAG coins already sold, it has drawn serious attention from those tracking early-stage performance. The project has also onboarded over 200,000 holders, all before a single exchange listing has gone live. This kind of traction is not common and rarely happens without strong fundamentals. BlockDAG is not relying on empty narratives or marketing alone. Its progress is tied to a real testnet, live mining infrastructure, and millions of active users through the X1 App. That is why analysts are starting to view BlockDAG as the next crypto to hit $1. The project is not just building hype; it is echoing the early moves seen in the rise of major Layer 1 networks. Why $1 Isn’t Just a Dream for BlockDAG The path to $1 is not about hype, it’s about foundation, and BlockDAG seems to have laid one that matters. With a presale offer still open at $0.0020 and a confirmed listing price of $0.05, the numbers already suggest a 2,400% return before broader price discovery begins. But what’s getting analysts even more optimistic is the real infrastructure powering it. BlockDAG combines the scale of DAG with the trust of proof-of-work and the programmability of Ethereum. Developers are already building on its active testnet, deploying apps using the live no-code builder. This is not a future roadmap, it’s a functioning system. And when momentum aligns with tech delivery, that $1 price point moves from speculation into real possibility. Whale Activity Highlights the $0.0020 Opportunity Smart money often moves before the crowd, and BlockDAG is showing clear signs of early whale accumulation. On-chain data reveals top-tier wallets are growing larger, particularly after the $0.0020 offer window was announced. These aren’t casual buyers. They’re strategic players locking in supply ahead of the scheduled price increase to $0.0030. This behaviour echoes the early moves seen in tokens like Chainlink and Avalanche, where aggressive early buying foreshadowed breakout moves. The math is compelling. A $0.0020 entry against a $0.05 listing valuation is already strong. But if BlockDAG reaches $1, these wallets will be holding positions with a 50x multiplier. That’s why the next crypto to hit $1 conversion keeps circling back to BDAG. $600M Presale Fuels Real Deployment, Not Speculation A big raise is one thing. Strategic deployment is another. BlockDAG’s $321 million milestone is part of a broader $600 million goal that directly funds infrastructure, not just marketing spin. The team is scaling the testnet, preparing the mainnet, and refining miner firmware. Exchange liquidity and community incentives are also in progress, all backed by clear allocation. There’s more. Developer grants are active, with new apps launching before trading even begins. A U.S.-focused sponsorship campaign is being finalised to push awareness as the listing nears. Compared to typical presales that promise later delivery, BlockDAG is doing the heavy lifting upfront. That approach is helping it stand out as the next crypto to hit $1. From a Coin to a Full Ecosystem in Motion What makes a Layer 1 succeed isn’t just the tech; it’s the traction. BlockDAG is positioning itself as a platform, not just a coin. Over 2 million users are already engaged through the X1 Miner App, earning BDAG daily through mobile activity. This proof-of-engagement model is onboarding users long before exchange listings begin. Meanwhile, hardware is backing the protocol. The team has already sold over 18,000 ASIC miners, with deliveries for the X30 and X100 beginning on July 7 and the X10 following on August 15. The combination of community mining and real hardware support gives BlockDAG an operational layer that most presale coins never achieve. That’s why BDAG continues to look like the next crypto to hit $1.

The firm revealed that the model can run tasks locally on robots without an internet connection. The new model, which builds on the company’s previous Gemini Robotics AI model that was released in March, can control a robot’s movements. Google also acknowledged that the vision-language-action model (VLA) is small and efficient enough to run directly on a robot. According to the company, developers can control and fine-tune the model to suit various needs using natural language prompts. Robotics On-Device outperforms Google’s other models We’re bringing powerful AI directly onto robots with Gemini Robotics On-Device. 🤖 It’s our first vision-language-action model to help make robots faster, highly efficient, and adaptable to new tasks and environments – without needing a constant internet connection. 🧵 pic.twitter.com/1Y21D3cF5t — Google DeepMind (@GoogleDeepMind) June 24, 2025 Head of robotics at Google DeepMind, Carolina Parada, maintained that the original Gemini Robotics model uses a hybrid approach, allowing it to operate on-device and on the cloud. She said that with the new device-only model, users can access offline features almost as well as the flagship’s. The tech company claims that the model performs at a level close to the cloud-based Gemini Robotics model in benchmarks. Google also said it outperforms others on-device modes in general benchmarks, though it didn’t name those models. “The Gemini Robotics hybrid model is still more powerful, but we’re actually quite surprised at how strong this on-device model is. I would think about it as a starter model or as a model for applications that just have poor connectivity.” -Carolina Parada, Head of Robotics at Google DeepMind. The firm illustrated in the demo robots running the local model, unzipping bags, and folding clothes. Google acknowledged that while the model was trained for ALOHA robots, it later adapted it to work on a bi-arm Franka FR3 robot and the Apollo humanoid robot by Apptronik. The tech company claims the bi-arm Franka FR3 was successful in tackling scenarios and objects it hadn’t seen before, like doing assembly on an industrial belt. The firm mentioned that developers can show robots 50 to 100 demonstrations of tasks to train them on new tasks using the models on the MuJoCo physics simulator. Google DeepMind also mentioned the release of a software development kit called the Gemini Robotics SDK. The company revealed that its Robotics SDK provides full lifecycle tooling necessary for using Gemini Robotics models, including accessing checkpoints, serving a model, evaluating the model on the robot and in the sim, uploading data, and fine-tuning it. The firm disclosed that its on-device Gemini Robotics model and its SDK will be available to a group of trusted testers while Google continues to work toward minimizing safety risks. Tech companies join the robotics race Other companies that use AI models are also showing interest in robotics. Nvidia is building a platform to create foundational models for humanoids. The firm’s CEO, Jensen Huang, noted that building foundation models for general humanoid robots is one of the most exciting problems to solve in AI today. Huang argued that the humanoid factor is one of the most contested topics in the world of robotics at the moment. He acknowledged that it’s raising venture capital by the boatload while generating massive skepticism along the way. Nvidia has also been championing robotic innovation through initiatives like Isaac and Jetson. Last year in March, at its annual GTC developer conference, the company joined the humanoid race with Project GROOT. Nvidia referred to the new platform as a general-purpose foundation model for humanoid robots. The firm said GROOT will support new hardware from Nvidia as well. Hugging Face is not only developing open models and data sets for robotics, but it is also working on robots. The firm revealed earlier this month an OpenAI model for robotics called SmolVLA. The company claims the model is trained on community-shared datasets and outperforms much larger models for robotics in both virtual and real-world environments. Hugging Face also revealed that SmolVLA aims to democratize access to vision-language-action (VLA) models and accelerate research toward generalist robotic agents. Last year, the firm launched LeRobot, a collection of robotics-focused models, datasets, and tools. More recently, Hugging Face acquired Pollen Robotics, a robotics startup based in France, and revealed several inexpensive robotics systems, including humanoids, for purchase.

Unforeseen collapses and murky legal frameworks have often left individuals in the lurch, with little recourse when things go wrong. This urgent need for clarity and security is precisely why U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman, Rostin Behnam, is championing a critical element for the forthcoming legislation: robust bankruptcy protection within the Crypto Market Structure Bill . But why is this specific safeguard so vital for your digital assets, and what does it mean for the future of crypto regulation ? Understanding the Proposed Crypto Market Structure Bill : Why is this Legislative Push So Vital? For years, the digital asset landscape has operated in a regulatory gray area. Is a cryptocurrency a commodity, a security, or something else entirely? This fundamental question has fueled jurisdictional battles among U.S. regulators, creating uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. The proposed Crypto Market Structure Bill aims to bring much-needed clarity by defining roles, responsibilities, and oversight for various digital assets and market participants. This bipartisan legislative effort seeks to establish a comprehensive framework that addresses several key areas: Clear Definitions: Distinguishing between digital commodities, digital securities, and other types of digital assets. Regulatory Oversight: Assigning clear jurisdiction to agencies like the CFTC and the SEC based on these definitions. Market Integrity: Implementing rules to prevent fraud, manipulation, and other illicit activities. Consumer Safeguards: Establishing protections for individuals engaging with crypto platforms and services. The goal is to foster innovation while simultaneously mitigating systemic risks and ensuring investor confidence. Without such a framework, the industry remains vulnerable to the kind of catastrophic failures we’ve witnessed in recent years. Why is Bankruptcy Protection the Core of Consumer Safety? The recent history of the crypto market is unfortunately littered with examples of platforms collapsing, leaving millions of users unable to access their funds. The most prominent case, FTX, vividly illustrated the devastating consequences of inadequate legal safeguards. When FTX filed for bankruptcy, customers discovered that their assets, which they believed were safely held, were commingled with corporate funds and used for speculative trading. This lack of segregation meant that customers were treated as unsecured creditors, at the back of a very long line, with little hope of recovering their full investments. This is precisely where bankruptcy protection comes into play. Chairman Behnam’s insistence on this element stems from a fundamental principle: when a crypto platform fails, users should have a clear and efficient path to reclaim their assets. In traditional finance, robust bankruptcy laws ensure that customer funds held by banks or brokerages are segregated and protected, allowing for their swift return even if the institution collapses. For digital assets, the challenge is complex due to the nature of blockchain technology and the various ways assets are held (e.g., custodial wallets vs. self-custody). A well-defined bankruptcy framework for crypto would aim to: Clarify Asset Ownership: Legally define whether customer digital assets held by a platform are truly customer property or part of the platform’s general estate. Ensure Segregation: Mandate that platforms keep customer funds separate from their operational capital. Provide a Recovery Path: Establish clear procedures for customers to reclaim their digital assets in the event of a platform’s insolvency. Reduce Delays and Costs: Streamline the bankruptcy process for crypto firms, minimizing the time and legal expenses involved in asset recovery. Without these explicit protections, investors remain exposed to significant risks, undermining trust and hindering the broader adoption of digital assets. The Pivotal Role of CFTC Behnam in Shaping Crypto Regulation Rostin Behnam has been a consistent and vocal advocate for clear and effective crypto regulation . As Chairman of the CFTC, an agency traditionally overseeing derivatives markets and commodities, Behnam has asserted the CFTC’s role in regulating certain digital assets, particularly those deemed commodities like Bitcoin and Ethereum. His approach emphasizes a ‘principles-based’ regulation that can adapt to the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, rather than a rigid, prescriptive one that might stifle innovation. Behnam’s focus on bankruptcy protection is a testament to his agency’s consumer-first approach. He has repeatedly highlighted the need for legislative action to grant regulators the necessary tools and authority to protect retail investors. His perspective is that while innovation is crucial, it must not come at the expense of fundamental investor safeguards. By advocating for bankruptcy clarity, Behnam aims to close a significant loophole that has repeatedly cost consumers dearly. The CFTC’s proactive stance, under Behnam’s leadership, signals a strong intent to bring the crypto derivatives market under a robust regulatory umbrella, ensuring fair trading practices and preventing market manipulation, all while prioritizing the safety of customer funds. Enhancing Consumer Protection in the Digital Asset Space: Are We Finally Moving Towards a Safer Crypto Landscape? While bankruptcy protection is paramount, it’s just one facet of comprehensive consumer protection in the digital asset space. A truly secure crypto environment requires a multi-pronged approach that addresses various risks. Beyond the immediate concern of insolvency, consumers need safeguards against: Fraud and Scams: Misleading projects, rug pulls, and phishing attacks. Market Manipulation: Pump-and-dump schemes and wash trading. Cybersecurity Risks: Hacking of exchanges and personal wallets. Lack of Transparency: Opaque business practices by platforms. Inadequate Disclosure: Insufficient information about risks associated with certain products or services. Effective crypto regulation should strive to create a level playing field where legitimate businesses can thrive, and bad actors are held accountable. This includes mandating robust cybersecurity measures, requiring clear risk disclosures, and empowering regulators to take swift enforcement action against illicit activities. The ultimate goal is to build trust, encouraging broader participation from both retail and institutional investors who currently shy away due to perceived risks. The push for the Crypto Market Structure Bill , with its emphasis on bankruptcy and broader consumer safeguards, represents a significant step towards maturing the digital asset industry. It acknowledges that for crypto to truly integrate into the global financial system, it must operate within a framework that mirrors the fundamental protections found in traditional markets. The Future of Crypto Regulation : Challenges and Opportunities The path to comprehensive crypto regulation is fraught with challenges. The rapid pace of technological innovation often outstrips the ability of lawmakers to draft relevant legislation. There’s also a delicate balance to strike between fostering innovation and implementing stringent controls that might stifle growth. Different jurisdictions also have varying approaches, leading to potential regulatory arbitrage. However, these challenges also present immense opportunities. A well-crafted regulatory framework, such as the one envisioned by the Crypto Market Structure Bill , can: Attract Institutional Investment: Provide the certainty and security that large financial institutions require. Boost Retail Confidence: Encourage more individuals to participate in the digital economy knowing their investments are protected. Foster Responsible Innovation: Guide developers and entrepreneurs towards building sustainable and compliant projects. Enhance Global Competitiveness: Position the U.S. as a leader in responsible digital asset development. Chairman Behnam’s advocacy for bankruptcy protection is a critical piece of this larger puzzle. It signals a pragmatic approach to regulation, addressing the most pressing pain points for consumers while laying the groundwork for a more stable and predictable crypto ecosystem. The ongoing dialogue between regulators, lawmakers, and industry participants is crucial to developing a framework that is both effective and future-proof. Conclusion: Securing the Digital Frontier The call from CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam for explicit bankruptcy protection within the Crypto Market Structure Bill is not just a technicality; it’s a profound statement about the future of digital assets. It underscores a fundamental shift towards prioritizing investor safety and market integrity in an industry that has long operated with minimal oversight. By embedding clear rules for asset recovery in the event of platform failure, the U.S. aims to fortify its position as a hub for responsible crypto innovation, ensuring that the promise of decentralized finance can be realized without sacrificing the essential safeguards that protect everyday people. This crucial step promises to bring a new era of trust and stability to the volatile yet transformative world of cryptocurrencies, benefiting everyone from individual investors to the broader financial system.

With its unique Move language, former Meta engineers leading the development, and scalability promises that rival Solana and Ethereum, Aptos continues to capture the imagination of blockchain developers. As market participants seek assets with long-term potential, many are now asking: can Aptos reach $10 by 2026? Meanwhile, attention is shifting toward newer players like Qubetics, whose presale success is stirring momentum across decentralized finance circles. Layer-1 Infrastructure and Market Position: Aptos Powers Up At its core, Aptos operates as a Layer-1 Proof-of-Stake blockchain designed to handle high throughput. Its architecture leverages a parallel execution engine and the Move programming language, both of which allow for faster processing and stronger safety guarantees. According to Aptos Labs documentation, this architecture aims for up to 150,000 transactions per second under ideal conditions, placing it in elite territory when compared to existing chains. Since its mainnet launch in October 2022, Aptos has onboarded hundreds of dApps and integrated with partners ranging from Google Cloud to NBCUniversal. It continues to attract developers thanks to its unique programming flexibility. The Aptos ecosystem is expanding beyond DeFi and NFTs into real-world integrations and institutional partnerships, making it a strong contender in the scalability race. Despite this, APT’s market journey has been volatile. From its all-time high of $19.92 in January 2023, the token has dropped over 75%, trading recently at approximately $3.97. Yet, this downside does not negate the fundamentals. With over $400 million in venture backing and a rapidly growing global presence, including a regional headquarters in Abu Dhabi—Aptos retains the infrastructure, capital, and technical merit to fuel a major resurgence. What Analysts Say: Forecasts and Future Potential Forecasts for Aptos vary across the board. CoinCodex offers a 2026 range between $3.50 and $12.18, with an average target of around $7.21. AInvest suggests that APT could gradually rise from $3.93 in early 2026 to nearly $9.94 by year-end, assuming market conditions remain moderately bullish. Meanwhile, Changelly expects Aptos to average around $7.79 in 2026, with fluctuations between $7.58 and $9.18. These numbers indicate a consensus trajectory that leans upward but with considerable caution. The range reflects current market realities: unpredictable regulation, token unlock schedules, and risk-off investor sentiment. However, if Aptos successfully leverages its institutional alliances and delivers on developer tooling, the upper bound of $10 is not out of reach. To further support this, on-chain data reveals that staking participation is rising, and community votes now shape network governance. A recent proposal to reduce staking rewards from 7% to 3.8% reflects a pivot toward capital efficiency. These decisions build trust among sophisticated participants looking for long-term alignment with tokenomics. Real-World Activity: Ecosystem Catalysts in Motion In June 2025, Aptos saw a modest 5% jump following a Congressional hearing that featured one of its core contributors. More notably, it partnered with Japanese Web3 companies after acquiring HashPalette and continues to expand its presence in Asia-Pacific markets. These moves indicate strategic positioning that could amplify user onboarding in regions with high digital penetration. Institutional-grade performance features like deterministic finality, improved transaction privacy, and hybrid execution models add technical weight. These elements not only appeal to developers but also attract capital allocators assessing utility-based projects for longer-term deployments. Why does this matter for 2026? Because Aptos is no longer purely a speculative asset. It is developing real-world use cases, engaging with regulators, and adapting to emerging DeFi protocols. If the macro environment supports digital asset adoption, Aptos could realistically challenge the $10 mark. Qubetics: Redefining Real-World Crypto Applications with Decentralized VPN Integration While Aptos builds the base layer of next-gen blockchain infrastructure, Qubetics is reimagining how people interact with the internet. At the heart of its ecosystem lies a decentralized VPN platform built not just for privacy enthusiasts but for enterprise-grade security needs. This decentralized VPN allows users to route their internet traffic through encrypted, community-powered nodes, cutting out centralized control and surveillance risks. Unlike traditional VPN services that operate under jurisdictional constraints and store user logs, Qubetics’ decentralized model ensures complete anonymity and censorship resistance. This is crucial in high-surveillance regions and for users seeking unrestricted access to information. Early adopters have cited use cases ranging from journalists bypassing state firewalls to developers deploying remote workloads securely. Beyond personal security, Qubetics’ VPN supports enterprises aiming to comply with international data sovereignty laws. By routing data across verified, distributed nodes, businesses can ensure compliance with evolving global standards while minimizing risk exposure. Qubetics Presale Performance: ROI Projections Fuel Excitement Qubetics is currently in Stage 37 of its crypto presale , priced at $0.3370 per $TICS token. It has raised over $18.1 million, sold more than 516 million tokens, and secured 28,200 token holders. The final stage is now active, with only 10 million tokens left before public trading begins at $0.40. The current listing price reflects a 20% return opportunity for immediate participants. However, the real excitement stems from tokenomics changes that have drastically tightened supply. After a strategic burn, the total supply has dropped by over 66%, capping it at 1.36 billion tokens. With nearly 39% of supply allocated to the public, Qubetics has effectively handed over project control to its community. This level of decentralization and scarcity has intensified buyer demand. Analysts note that a $1,000 entry at today’s price could yield $15,000 to $30,000 based on current projections. If $TICS were to hit $10 post-listing, a target echoed in bullish circles, a $10,000 position could grow to $300,000. These are based on existing uptake and refined economic models. Major Exchange Listing Confirmed: Market Surge Anticipated Adding to the excitement, Qubetics has officially confirmed that $TICS will be listed on one of the top 10 global crypto exchanges. This landmark development could be the turning point for the project, as early projections suggest a minimum 20% price surge upon listing. Industry analysts note that this type of listing isn’t just about accessibility, it’s often a defining event that pushes top infrastructure tokens into mainstream recognition. With a growing community and real-world use cases, Qubetics is now considered a 100x contender by insiders watching closely. Qubetics bridges real-world use with Web3 infrastructure, empowering individuals and enterprises alike. As its presale nears conclusion, early adopters are betting on its tech, scarcity, and decentralization as engines of long-term value. Final Thoughts Aptos and Qubetics represent different ends of the blockchain innovation spectrum. One offers foundational scalability for the next generation of dApps; the other delivers focused, high-impact utilities with a decentralized twist. Both are united by strong developer ecosystems, real-world adoption potential, and strategic financial frameworks. As the market matures, price predictions must be based on utility, governance, and transparent economic design. Aptos may well hit $10 by 2026 if its ecosystem maintains momentum and institutional support grows. Meanwhile, Qubetics stands poised as a breakout candidate not just for its presale metrics, but for its role in democratizing access to secure internet infrastructure. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics Summary: Aptos and Qubetics are shaping up to be two of the most promising blockchain projects heading into 2026. Aptos, a high-throughput Layer-1 platform powered by the Move language, is gaining institutional traction and expanding globally. Analysts forecast a price target of up to $10 by 2026, citing its developer-friendly architecture and real-world integrations. In parallel, Qubetics is making headlines with its decentralized VPN solution and surging crypto presale, now in Stage 37 with $18.1 million raised. With only 10 million tokens left at $0.3370 and a projected listing price of $0.40, Qubetics offers immediate ROI potential and long-term upside driven by utility, scarcity, and enterprise appeal.

XRP and Bitcoin Traders Eyeing Solana,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-magacoin-finance-set-to-become-the-next-ethereum-xrp-and-bitcoin-traders-eyeing-solana/,"With market cycles evolving, investors are watching closely for projects capable of matching Ethereum’s early success. MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast emerging as a prime candidate, catching the attention of seasoned XRP, Bitcoin, and Solana traders looking to enter a scalable, early-stage opportunity before the listing window closes. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Poised for Ethereum-Level Breakout MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum on the strength of fundamentals—scarcity, decentralization, and transparency. With a capped 170 billion token supply, full audit, and no VC control, the project appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Analysts highlight its breakout potential, estimating returns between 75x and 100x, projecting it as the best crypto since the early runs of XRP and Bitcoin (BTC). XRP and Bitcoin: Strategic Rotations in Play XRP remains a dominant force in payments, but as legal uncertainties stall price progress, many of its holders are seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly the destination for that capital. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price hovers above $105,000 with stability, but its slower upside has driven many early BTC adopters to rotate partial profits into promising low-cap assets—MAGACOIN FINANCE among the top of that list. Solana: Mature Growth, New Opportunity Needed Solana’s price strength and network improvements continue, but as momentum normalizes, many SOL traders are pivoting to smaller projects with asymmetric upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s surge in community interest and credibility has positioned it as a leading beneficiary. Conclusion From XRP to Solana holders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming the standout altcoin of 2025. As listing approaches, the time for early action is now. Momentum continues to build as analysts forecast exponential upside. Early buyers are positioning before the wider market catches on.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Traders Bet Big on Kaspa,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-magacoin-finance-outperform-xrp-bitcoin-and-ethereum-traders-bet-big-on-kaspa/,"In today’s competitive digital asset space, investors are always on the lookout for early-stage opportunities with high-return potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now emerging as one of the strongest contenders—often referred to as the best altcoin opportunity currently available. With growing buzz from XRP veterans and shifting capital from Bitcoin and Ethereum communities, attention is also building around Kaspa’s unique blockchain utility. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Contender for Explosive Gains MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition for its fundamentals: a permanently capped 170 billion token supply, a full HashEx audit, and a structure built entirely on community ownership. Over $10 million raised and consecutive pre-sale rounds selling out have positioned it as contender for the best crypto to buy in 2025 . Its transparent governance, inflation resistance, and aggressive marketing strategy have led many analysts to draw parallels to past altcoin giants. Many XRP holders are shifting capital here, confident in its asymmetric upside and fast-growing momentum. XRP: Legendary Past, Challenging Present XRP remains a household name due to its historic rallies, but present regulatory overhang and slowed price movement above $2.50 have pushed many long-term holders to explore new, dynamic assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a popular destination for those rebalancing for sharper upside. Bitcoin & Ethereum: Rotating Capital into Kaspa While Bitcoin trades above $105,000 and Ethereum maintains market dominance, seasoned investors are increasingly rotating into smaller-cap projects. Kaspa has emerged as a favorite due to its unique tech stack, GHOSTDAG protocol, and fast-growing user base. Kaspa: The Technological Standout Kaspa’s architecture enables high throughput, fast confirmations, and wide utility across applications. With rising trading volumes and developer interest, it’s quickly positioning itself as one of the most advanced blockchain platforms in the current cycle. Conclusion As crypto capital rotates and sentiment shifts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining a foothold among early movers. With strong fundamentals, rising interest, and favorable comparisons to past winners, it stands out as a compelling candidate to outperform XRP. Meanwhile, Kaspa’s technological strength makes it a serious contender for broader adoption.

This shift comes amid easing geopolitical tensions and declining inflation, fuelling speculation about a renewed rally. Bitcoin Likely To Rally As Global Tensions Simmer According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Bitcoin is likely to resume its upward trajectory, bolstered by a series of recent macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. The analyst highlighted multiple positive signals that could propel the top digital asset closer to its all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Yearly Trend Suggests Cycle Top Near $205,000 By Year-End, Analyst Says One of the key developments was an announcement by US President Donald Trump, who stated that a ceasefire agreement had been reached between Israel and Iran. This deal removes the immediate threat of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital chokepoint for global oil supply. The ceasefire had an immediate and positive effect on global equity markets, with the S&P 500 index surpassing 6,000 for the first time since February 2025. This recovery signals growing investor confidence as geopolitical risks subside. In addition, crude oil prices dropped by 14%, adding to the disinflationary narrative. Lower energy costs help reduce production and transportation expenses, thereby supporting a broader decline in inflationary pressures. Taha concluded: The convergence of significant crypto outflows from Binance, falling oil prices, a bullish breakout in US equities, and the reduction of Middle Eastern tensions presents a striking scenario. With the geopolitical overhang removed, inflation easing, and macro markets stabilizing, Bitcoin is now well-positioned to resume its upward trajectory. Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales – wallets holding large amounts of BTC – appear to be quietly accumulating in anticipation of a breakout. In another CryptoQuant post, contributor Mignolet noted that whale accumulation has been rising steadily since BTC bottomed in April. Mignolet pointed out that whale activity typically increases during periods of low market attention or heightened fear, often foreshadowing bullish reversals. Historical data supports this trend, showing that increased accumulation often precedes significant price surges. Bullish Quarter For BTC In an X post published today, seasoned crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that BTC is set to close a bullish monthly candle, reinforcing the long-term uptrend for the flagship cryptocurrency. Several other on-chain and technical indicators also suggest further upside potential. For example, Bitcoin Binary CDD shows that long-term holders are continuing to hold rather than sell, indicating strong conviction in BTC’s long-term value.

At the same time, the number of short positions is climbing as BTC consolidates between $100,000 and $110,000. This dynamic raises the probability of a short squeeze, potentially propelling Bitcoin to a new ATH. At press time, BTC trades at $105,408, up 5.2% in the past 24 hours.

BitGo’s vice president for its Asia-Pacific business, Abel Seow, said it had seen its assets under custody (AUC) rise from $60B to $100B in the first six months of the year. It represents a 66% increase , demonstrating the growing appetite among institutional and retail players to participate in the crypto-economy. Seow said that the rise was driven by “peak retail interest” in crypto, increasing asset adoption, and greater regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions. Crypto confidence is growing among investors, as is evident in the demand for secure and regulated custody services. One big driver of the increase in BitGo’s assets is “staking,” which involves crypto holders locking up their tokens to help validate blockchain transactions and, in exchange, earn passive income. Today, assets in BitGo Staking represent 50% of BitGo’s total holdings, where yield-based strategies are a core investment theme for modern digital asset holders. BitGo expands into global markets BitGo, which was established in 2013, initially offered secure wallets but has since developed into a one-stop shop crypto bank . In addition to custody, BitGo provides clients with the capabilities to trade, borrow, and lend digital assets. It has clients that include institutional investors and firms born on the blockchain. Over the past year, the company has been growing quickly internationally. BitGo Korea was released in September 2024 with Hana Financial Group and SK Telecom, two of South Korea’s largest financial and telecommunications companies. Seow said the joint venture is “progressing well” and has begun offering its services to high-net-worth clients and regional institutional participants. Also, in early 2025, BitGo officially seeded its Dubai operations, entering the region’s growing digital asset ecosystem. Crypto stronghold Dubai has established itself as a burgeoning hub in its own right on the backs of business-friendly regulation and investor appetite. BitGo’s growing reach reflects a larger trend in the industry; crypto firms no longer want to concentrate only on the US and Europe in traditional markets. Instead, they seek to go global to service local demand, particularly in areas where regulation is favorable and smartphone penetration rates are high. BitGo plans IPO as crypto market heats up Riding the wave, BitGo is getting ready for a potential public listing as soon as the second half of 2025, reports Bloomberg. The move would make the company part of an emerging wave of crypto-native firms seeking to tap into public markets, with renewed investor confidence and a more friendly regulatory environment pushing these firms into the spotlight. BitGo’s IPO strategy is part of a wider trend related to a change in the US approach under President Donald Trump’s administration, which has been particularly friendly to crypto since returning to office. BitGo was last valued in 2023 at $1.75 billion in connection with a $100 million capital raise. Returning to the underwriters, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., DRW Holdings, Redpoint Ventures, and Valor Equity Partners are all backers of the digital asset custody powerhouse, which means that it doesn’t exactly take a crystal ball to guess which four banks might be involved in the IPO. During his tenure, t here have been appointments of crypto-friendly regulators, an attempt to slide through stablecoin legislation, and even Trump’s projects into the digital asset arena. There has been so much change in political tone compared to past governments, which makes it easier and more predictable for crypto companies planning to grow and compete for institutional money. In its most recent round of financing, in 2023, Bitgo was said to have a value of $1.75 billion, according to reports, in connection with raising $100 million in capital. And back to the underwriters, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., DRW Holdings, Redpoint Ventures, and Valor Equity Partners are all backers of the digital asset custody powerhouse.

ETH is now showing positive signs and might aim for a move above the $2,550 zone. Ethereum started a fresh upward move above the $2,220 level. The price is trading above $2,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,390 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it settles above the $2,500 resistance zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,200 support level, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to clear the $2,220 and $2,250 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The bulls even pushed the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,568 swing high to the $2,115 low. However, they are now facing hurdles near the $2,480 and $2,500 levels. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The price is now just above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,568 swing high to the $2,115 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,500 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,565 level. A clear move above the $2,565 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance. An upside break above the $2,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,720 resistance zone or even $2,800 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,500 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,390 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $2,350 zone. A clear move below the $2,350 support might push the price toward the $2,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,250 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,150. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

Let’s clear things up. In a video from March, called Crypto in a Minute , Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, spoke about the case. He said, “I feel good,” as he reflected on the years of legal battles condensed into 60 seconds. Alderoty claimed that not only did the SEC drop its appeal against Ripple, but it also dropped all its enforcement actions against crypto companies in the U.S. He explained that the SEC finally admitted what Ripple and others had argued for years, that you can’t enforce laws without first clearly defining them. “We never had clear laws or regulations for crypto in this country,” Alderoty said. “Now, we’re going to clean up the mess, leave the courtrooms behind, and work with Congress to build smart rules that protect consumers and allow innovation to grow.” But Here’s What a Former SEC Lawyer Says However, former SEC attorney James Farrell s hared a different view on social media. He wrote, “The SEC still has not dropped its appeal. Both parties’ appeals are still alive (although stayed) today..” What’s Really Happening? To be clear, while the SEC’s appeal has been stayed (put on hold), it hasn’t been officially withdrawn. Both Ripple and the SEC still have active appeals in court. The case isn’t over yet, but there’s growing hope that clearer crypto rules will soon be created in the U.S. Ripple’s legal team is staying involved in those conversations, aiming to help shape fair regulations for the industry.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-25 03:14:10

The policy clarification removes a key barrier for traditional financial institutions. The statement confirms the Fed’s stance is to not inhibit crypto banking relationships. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered a message to two very different audiences on Tuesday, June 24. For the broader economy, he signaled the central bank’s tough fight against inflation is far from over. But for the crypto industry, he provided a quiet but clear green light for Wall Street to get more involved. During congressional testimony, Powell confirmed that U.S. banks are free to do business with the crypto sector, a major policy clarification.

MAGACOIN FINANCE and SEI are now attracting attention from Solana and Bitcoin investors, while Ethereum’s ecosystem keeps a close eye on their momentum. Analysts are flagging both as strategic accumulation zones in the months ahead. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Top Accumulation Zone of Q3 MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself as one of the most compelling early-stage projects in 2025. With a fully audited structure, capped supply, and no VC control, it combines transparency with disciplined execution. Its presale has generated considerable demand, setting a precedent for community-led, scarcity-driven tokens. Backed by strong staking utility and a committed user base, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to build momentum as a credible contender in the altcoin landscape. Solana: Institutional Strength and ETF Optimism Solana’s expanding ecosystem and potential ETF approval have amplified institutional interest. Despite its robust fundamentals, many early investors are diversifying into tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE to access untapped, pre-listing opportunities. This shift reflects a broader strategy of capturing asymmetric upside before large-scale adoption. Bitcoin: Market Anchor, Rotating for Upside Bitcoin remains the market’s foundation, but as its growth stabilizes, investors are reallocating toward early-stage opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a preferred target, combining structure and sentiment in a market eager for the next strong performer. SEI: Under-the-Radar with Strong Signals SEI is quietly evolving, with traction growing across tokenization and decentralized science sectors. While some uncertainties remain, its development pace and recent performance suggest it’s gaining recognition among forward-looking traders. Ethereum: Observing the Shift Ethereum’s community is closely tracking these developments. With smart contract compatibility and historical parallels to its early growth, Ethereum’s ecosystem views MAGACOIN FINANCE and SEI as aligned with the type of high-upside stories that defined its own rise. Conclusion As capital rotates and attention sharpens, MAGACOIN FINANCE and SEI are establishing themselves as key altcoin opportunities heading into Q3. With Solana and Bitcoin traders already engaged and Ethereum observers validating their potential, both assets are set to define the early-stage narrative of 2025.

Some analysts forecast further upside for the token if it reclaims a key price area. Related Reading: Cardano Headed For $0.32 If This Level Isn’t Reclaimed – Is ADA’s Rally Over? Injective Sees Strong Daily Move On Tuesday, Injective saw a massive recovery from its recent drop to the $9 mark, and it’s attempting to reclaim a crucial resistance level. The cryptocurrency has been in a downtrend this month, driven by the increasing global geopolitical tensions. Since hitting its December high of $35.26, INJ has retraced over 65%, dropping below the $10 support multiple times during the 2025 retraces. However, the April-May rally saw the cryptocurrency break out of its multi-month downtrend and climb to its $10-$15 local price range. Following Monday night’s news of a potential ceasefire between Israel and Iran, Injective, alongside the rest of the market, reclaimed some of its recently lost levels, surging to the $11 area on Tuesday morning and nearing a crucial resistance. Notably, INJ recorded a 26% rally intraday to hit the $12.02 mark, becoming one of the leading tokens during the crypto market’s rebound. Analyst Crypto Rand noted that the cryptocurrency is now pushing over the June downtrend resistance following its price recovery, suggesting an explosive surge. According to the post, a breakout above the $12 resistance range would “trigger the bull reversal,” which could propel Injective’s price toward the local range high resistance around the $15 mark. Meanwhile, Crypto Busy highlighted that the cryptocurrency “just delivered one of the strongest moves in today’s altcoin rally” in “just a few candles” after bouncing from the $9 support zone. The analyst added that INJ continues to be “one of the most responsive altcoins when Bitcoin bounces,” forecasting potentially more bullish price action driven by the Injective Summit 2025, scheduled for June 26. INJ Ready For Massive Rally? Market watcher Clinton highlighted that INJ just completed its retest of its multi-month descending broadening wedge. According to the post, Injective bounced from the pattern’s resistance level, confirming the May breakout in the daily timeframe. This could set the cryptocurrency’s price for a 100%-150% “massive bullish rally” toward the $23-$30 levels if price holds the $11.5-$11.6 support zone, which served as a key area over the past two months. Additionally, analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems affirmed that Injective is forming a “very clear” Power of Three (Po3) setup since the May Breakout. In this pattern, a cryptocurrency’s price cycle is divided into three phases: accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. The first phase sees a token’s price consolidate near the recent high after a strong performance. This is followed by the price falling below the accumulation phase support level, trading within a range below the recently lost zone.

Based on this, Injective has entered the distribution phase, which is expected to lead to a “nice expansion” toward the $16 local resistance, “as long as we don’t find acceptance back below support.” As of this writing, Injective is trading at $11.64, a 3% increase in the daily timeframe.

MAGACOIN FINANCE has now emerged as a serious contender during its final pre-sale phase. With Bitcoin and XRP holders shifting strategies and Arbitrum’s rebound catching interest, all eyes are on whether this altcoin becomes the next breakout rotation play . MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Focal Point for Strategic Capital MAGACOIN FINANCE has passed the $10 million fundraising milestone with each phase selling out at an accelerating pace. With a capped supply , a verified HashEx audit , and a community-first, VC-free model , the project is defining scarcity-backed momentum. Its appeal is driven by community support—most participants are accumulating and staking, indicating long-term confidence. Its listing prospects have drawn comparisons to early giants like Solana and Ethereum, positioning it as a rare opportunity before the broader market catches on. XRP: Rotating for Faster Upside XRP’s momentum has cooled slightly in recent weeks, prompting traders to look for newer, faster-moving vehicles. MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn strong interest from XRP holders searching for greater near-term ROI potential and clearer upside catalysts during this quarter. Bitcoin: Profits Fueling Rotational Plays As Bitcoin consolidates above $105,000 , high-cap traders are reallocating profits into pre-launch opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its tokenomics, grassroots appeal, and timing—making it an attractive target for rotation without departing from strong fundamentals. Arbitrum: Building Back for Long-Term Arbitrum (ARB) has begun to recover following a turbulent spring. While long-term forecasts are optimistic, many investors are looking elsewhere for faster price movement. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-launch format is proving to be a compelling hedge for those seeking action now rather than later. Conclusion With its final presale window open and momentum shifting, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a strategic choice for XRP and Bitcoin traders alike. As Arbitrum rebuilds and attention focuses on high-reward opportunities, this project is fast gaining reputation as a leading early-stage opportunity in 2025.

Binance Coin & Tron Hold Firm",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-2660-roi-and-100m-airdrop-draw-crypto-whales-attention-binance-coin-tron-hold-firm/,"Speed is often the key to success in crypto. Binance Coin (BNB) continues to maintain solid long-term confidence, and Tron (TRX) is staying within a tight technical range. Yet, both lag behind BlockDAG (BDAG) in terms of performance and attention. BlockDAG has advanced from $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0020 in batch 29, while aiming for a listing price of $0.05. This trajectory has allowed early backers to witness a 2,660% increase in their funds. The buzz around BlockDAG goes beyond numbers. With over $321 million raised so far, millions using its X1 app, and an ongoing 100 million coin airdrop, it’s quickly gaining traction. While BNB and TRX continue on their steady paths, BlockDAG appears to be setting a faster pace. BNB Holds Strong Potential, But Its Growth Is Still Assumed BNB, the core digital asset for the Binance network, remains firmly established. Telegaon’s forecast for Binance Coin (BNB) places its 2025 average around $875.24, with possibilities climbing to $3,175 by 2030. Some even predict a rise to $5,441 by 2035. This upward potential is backed by Binance’s dominant presence, increasing usage of the BNB Chain in DeFi apps, and a deflationary mechanism that burns coins periodically. Still, this entire outlook depends on smooth regulation and consistent platform progress. Those looking for immediate gains may find BNB to be a slow-moving asset rather than a rapid-growth option. Tron (TRX) Remains Resilient, But Strength Is Fading TRX has handled recent market dips better than several major altcoins, partly due to its weaker link to Bitcoin (just 0.32 correlation). When Bitcoin dropped 3.68%, Tron only slipped 2.87%, doing better than both Solana and Ethereum. Despite this, Tron’s pattern is showing signs of weakness. Over the last six weeks, TRX has hovered between $0.263 and $0.294. Analysts identify $0.261 as a key support, with a possible slide to $0.24 if that fails. The RSI falling below 50 reflects fading strength, and OBV indicates a lack of clear buying or selling pressure. Broader market uncertainty might worsen this. Although Tron has shown stability, without a clear upward push, it could remain stuck while new entries like BlockDAG gain speed and adoption. BlockDAG’s Global Expansion, X1 App, and 2,660% Return Are Setting New Standards Rather than waiting for attention, BlockDAG is taking direct action to boost its reach. Its standout move is the X1 app, which supports mobile-based mining for more than 2 million users across over 100 countries. This doesn’t rely on GPUs; instead, it uses a Proof-of-Engagement model where users earn BDAG by interacting daily. It’s easy to use, energy-friendly, and made to spread quickly. The ongoing 100 million BDAG airdrop is another key part of its strategy, rewarding those who joined the Testnet, referred friends, contributed socially, or joined the presale. This is more than a giveaway; it’s a powerful way to bring people into the BlockDAG ecosystem. In addition, the US-based sponsorship reveal has already taken place, with 20 exchange listings disclosed. This move shows clear efforts to align the project with broader audiences beyond crypto. On the funding side, BlockDAG has raised over $321 million to date, making it one of the most successful presales recently. The price in batch 29 is still at $0.0020, but this limited-time offer ends on June 24, when it will rise to $0.0030. With the projected launch price of $0.05, early participants have already seen their holdings grow by 2,660%. Its hybrid structure combining DAG and blockchain technology enables faster processing and practical scaling. With Ethereum-compatible support and a no-code smart contract tool, it’s also ideal for developers shifting from other platforms. While others talk about future possibilities, BlockDAG is actively delivering results. Final Thoughts! BNB and TRX both remain major forces among the most popular crypto coins. Binance Coin (BNB) shows a strong case for long-term progress, while Tron (TRX) is proving to be stable in the short run. However, neither project seems to be pushing forward with the intensity and growth that BlockDAG is showing right now. With a working mobile app (X1), over $321 million in funding, a broad-reaching US-based sponsorship, and a 100 million BDAG airdrop underway, BlockDAG is not just part of the 2025 crypto talk; it’s at the center of it. Those who joined early have already seen 2,660% growth, and for those still looking at their next step, BlockDAG might not just be one of the most popular crypto coins this year, it could be the most rewarding move they make.

The price is back above $2.10 and might struggle to continue higher above the $2.20 zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.120 zone. The price is now trading above $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $2.080 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it closes above the $2.20 resistance zone. XRP Price Faces Hurdles XRP price remained supported above the $2.00 zone and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price recovered above the $2.020 and $2.080 resistance levels. The pair even cleared the $2.150 resistance and spiked above the $2.20 barrier. However, the bears were active above the $2.20 zone. A high was formed at $2.215 and the price is now correcting some gains. There was a move below the $2.00 level, but the price is still above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.910 swing low to the $2.2150 high. The price is now trading above $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a bullish trend line forming with support at $2.080 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.20 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.220 level. The next resistance is $2.250. A clear move above the $2.250 resistance might send the price toward the $2.320 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance or even $2.420 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.50. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.20 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.150 level. The next major support is near the $2.080 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.080 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.020 support or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.910 swing low to the $2.2150 high. The next major support sits near the $1.950 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.150 and $2.080.

At the same time, Asian markets steadied and the dollar fell 0.1% to 144.70 against the Yen. Brent crude futures jumped by 1.3% to $67.99 per barrel by 03:41 GMT. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate climbed 1.4% to $65.24. Both contracts were trading not far above multi-week lows reached on Tuesday. Prices briefly spiked to five-month highs over the weekend after the U.S. launched airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, but have since eased as the ceasefire took effect. “Global energy prices are moderating following the Israel-Iran ceasefire. The base case for our oil strategists remains anchored by fundamentals, which indicate sufficient global oil supply,” noted JP Morgan analysts in a client briefing. A preliminary U.S. intelligence review found that American strikes did not fully destroy Iran’s nuclear capacity , only setting the program back by a few months. That assessment undercuts President Trump’s earlier claim that Iran’s nuclear efforts had been “obliterated.” On Tuesday, leaders in Tehran and Jerusalem separately signalled the end of direct hostilities after 12 days of escalating conflict. Both sides moved quickly to lift civilian restrictions, each declaring victory in a conflict that initially threatened to spill into global oil markets. “The Israel-Iran ceasefire is likely to prove fragile,” said David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics. “But so long as both parties show themselves unwilling to attack export-related energy infrastructure and/or disrupt shipping flows through the Strait of Hormuz, we expect bearish fundamentals in the oil market to continue from here.” The narrow Strait of Hormuz, lying between Oman and Iran, remains a focal point for traders. Between 18 million and 19 million barrels per day of crude and fuel pass through this path, nearly one-fifth of the world’s daily oil consumption. Asian markets stabilized while the dollar dipped Japan’s Nikkei and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 were flat, while Taiwan’s TAIEX climbed 1%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.6%, and China’s CSI 300 eased 0.1%. U.S. stock futures showed little movement. Currency and bond markets reflected the easing risk of an oil-driven inflation spike. The U.S. two-year Treasury yield slid to 3.787%, its lowest since May 8, while the dollar index dipped 0.1% to 97.854. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.1% to 144.70, and the euro gained 0.1% to $1.1625, approaching Tuesday’s peak of $1.1641—the highest level since October 2021. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned on Tuesday that rising tariffs could begin to push up inflation over the summer, remarks made during testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. Meanwhile, a separate report showed U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly declined in June, pointing to a cooling labour market. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets currently assign roughly an 18% probability of a Fed rate cut in July.

According to a company filing on Wednesday, the funding was secured through the issuance of 54m new shares after EVO Fund exercised a portion of its stock acquisition rights. Metaplanet aims to raise as much as $5.4b through its 555m Plan, with the goal of acquiring 210,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2027, roughly 1% of the total supply. Metaplanet Raises $517.8M in First Tranche of 555 Million Bitcoin Plan As part of this effort, shares were issued at ¥1,388 each, or about $9.59, generating around ¥74.9b, or $517.8m. The issuance accounts for about 10% of the total 555m shares the company plans to release. 10% of the 555 Million Plan executed on Day 1. ¥74.9B ($0.5B+) raised. https://t.co/53bjAT6Egm — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) June 25, 2025 This initial funding round follows Metaplanet’s recent board approval to commit up to $5b to its US subsidiary. The unit, Metaplanet Treasury Corp, is based in Florida. Going forward, the American arm will manage Bitcoin acquisition and treasury operations. It will also tap into deeper US capital markets and institutional infrastructure to support the company’s global strategy. If Fully Executed, Plan Would Place Metaplanet Among Largest Bitcoin-Holding Firms Metaplanet is following a strategy similar to that of US-based MicroStrategy , which has acquired over 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply through equity raises. Now, Metaplanet aims to replicate that approach from the Asia-Pacific region. It hopes to position itself as a digital asset leader within Japanese capital markets. According to the company, 96% of funds raised will go toward Bitcoin purchases. The remaining amount will be used for bond redemptions and yield-generating strategies. Following Monday’s issuance, Metaplanet’s total outstanding shares climbed to over 654m. If fully executed, the 555m Plan could make Metaplanet one of the world’s largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. This would give the firm significant influence in the fast-growing digital asset economy.

Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE , Ethereum , and Solana are emerging as key altcoin contenders of 2025 . Meanwhile, Polkadot is attracting attention as a quiet but formidable contender. Together, these assets represent a balance of scarcity, scalability, and next-gen utility that analysts say could define the year’s most impactful portfolios. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Scarcity-Driven Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE has raised over $10 million , with each pre-sale phase selling out swiftly. Built on a fixed 170 billion token supply , audited contracts, and 100% community ownership, it presents a structurally rare opportunity. Analysts are tracking whale accumulation, staking incentives, and token burn mechanisms as catalysts for breakout performance. Driven by scarcity, transparency, and community momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself for long-term impact with a growing base of institutional and retail interest. Ethereum: The DeFi Anchor Accelerating Ethereum remains a foundational force in the blockchain space. Its recent Pectra upgrade , increased ETF exposure, and consistent Layer-2 development are fueling momentum. With ETH hovering near $2,900 , projections now target $6,000 to $8,000 by year-end. Ethereum’s ecosystem expansion continues to integrate rising projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , creating synergistic value for long-term holders. Solana: Speed Meets Institutional Validation Solana is processing over 58 million daily transactions and controls 28% of DEX volume , backed by infrastructure upgrades like Alpenglow . With ETF discussions heating up and strong network stats, SOL’s price forecasts reach as high as $1,000 . Yet even Solana investors are rotating into early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE , seeking higher-multiple exposure alongside scalability. Polkadot: The Interoperability Dark Horse Polkadot is advancing with its 2.0 upgrades , including Agile Core Time and Snowbridge to Ethereum. With technical resistance around $14 , some forecasts stretch up to $19 by late 2025. Its 11.2% staking yield and cross-chain vision give it unique appeal as a complementary portfolio asset. Conclusion With proven strength from Ethereum and Solana , early-stage upside from MAGACOIN FINANCE , and innovative potential from Polkadot , these four assets represent a diverse blend of reliability and high-return potential. Analysts agree: this combination could lead 2025’s most dynamic investment outcomes.

The SOPR refers to an on-chain indicator that tells us about whether the TRX investors are moving or selling their coins at a profit or loss. The indicator works by going through the transfer history of each coin being moved to see what price it was last transacted at. Coins that have this cost basis above the current spot price are contributing to loss realization, while those with the opposite setup to profit realization. Related Reading: Crypto Bears Rekt: $359M Gone As Bitcoin, Ethereum Rebound The SOPR takes the ratio between the spent value and cost basis, and sums it up for all coins being sold on the blockchain to find a net situation for the market as a whole. When the value of the indicator is greater than 1, it means the investors are, on average, realizing a profit through their transactions. On the other hand, the metric being under this threshold suggests the dominance of loss realization in the market. Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the Tron SOPR over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Tron SOPR saw a huge spike above the 1 mark earlier in the month, implying investors took part in a significant amount of profit-taking. From the chart, it’s also visible that there were other profit realization spikes during the past year, but the current one stands out for its scale. The latest peak in the metric saw its value go to 4.74, corresponding to a profit margin of 374%. “With TRX priced at $0.268 at the time, the average acquisition price for those coins would have been around $0.0566,” explains Maartunn. Interestingly, Tron hasn’t seen extended periods around this price mark since late 2022, meaning that the tokens would have been held for a good while before being finally transacted this month. Usually, when dormant hands break their silence, it’s likely to be for selling-related purposes. That said, it’s not the only reason they may do so. “The activity could be tied to early investors realizing gains, internal transfers, or reallocation decisions,” notes the analyst.

While altcoins display stability after rebounding from weekend lows, Arbitrum protocol is in the spotlight after generating $1.42 million in revenue within the last seven days. EntropyAdvisor’s dune dashboard reveals these stats, showing a 23% surge from the previous week. Source: Entropyadvisors The impressive earnings place ARB’s blockchain among the economically viable and active Ethereum L2 ecosystems. This article evaluates how real-world asset (RAW) trends drive Arbitrum’s growth. RAW activity on Arbitrum hits ATHs The network has seen impressive performance over the past week, with its RWA sector hitting new all-time highs above $300 million. RWA protocols bridge decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradiFi). They allow individuals to access tokenized versions of real-world assets like bonds, invoices, and real estate on dApps. Economists believe the tokenization sector will be a $16 trillion market by 2030, while others expect tremendous growth to $30 trillion in the next five years. In that context, Arbitrum’s attracting $300 million into this industry demonstrates an increasing appetite among builders and investors to onboard real-world use cases into blockchain systems. Moreover, the milestone confirms Arbitrum’s capability to support low-fee, scalable RWA applications. Furthermore, the impressive RWA adoption reflects magnified investor trust in L2 platforms that offer regulated, yield-bearing, and scalable on-chain financial instruments. The soaring RWA activity possibly fueled on-chain volumes and transaction fees, boosting ARB’s protocol revenue. Ecosystem players propel Arbitrum’s boom Various protocols contributed to Arbitrum’s revenue spike in the past few sessions, highlighting the expanding Arbitrum DeFi landscape. GMX, Ostium Labs, and Gains Network led the charge, earning $550K, $225K, and $120K, respectively. Pendle and Uniswap followed with $85K and $82K. According to Web3 enthusiast Isaac Bassey: These numbers reflect not only strong user activity but also the increasing sophistication of Arbitrum’s ecosystem, which is rapidly evolving with innovative protocols and scaling solutions. The flourishing ecosystem protocols aren’t just facilitating on-chain transactions but also building a revolutionary financial infrastructure. ARB price outlook Arbitrum’s native token exhibited a bullish structure on its daily chart, driven by broad-based recoveries and optimistic ecosystem updates. ARB trades at $0.3149 after touching an intraday high of $0.3334. Chart by Coinmarketcap While bulls fight for short-term control, the alt gas struggled with bearishness lately, down 20% and 60% in the previous month and year. The downside is visible as Arbitrum investors have struggled with losses despite various developers’ efforts to rescue the project from deep slides. However, the prevailing trends suggest impending shifts. As retail and institutional investors join the RWA bandwagon, platforms like Arbitrum stand to enjoy massive benefits. Arbitrum’s status as a scalable Ethereum L2 makes it lucrative for supporting more complex fiscal products, including those linked to off-chain assets. Such a trajectory could make Arbitrum the go-to blockchain for DeFi integration with RWA.

This pivotal funding round, reported by Blockworks, comes from the renowned venture capital firm Multicoin Capital, signaling strong confidence in Yield.xyz’s vision and its potential to revolutionize how users interact with DeFi yields. This news is a powerful indicator of the continued growth and maturation within the DeFi sector, especially as platforms strive to make complex financial instruments more accessible and efficient for everyday users. What is Yield.xyz and Why is This Strategic Investment Crucial? Yield.xyz is not just another DeFi protocol; it’s a foundational builder aiming to streamline and simplify the often-complex world of decentralized finance. As a dedicated DeFi infrastructure company, its mission is to provide the underlying tools and frameworks that make yield generation and management seamless for users. The recent $5 million strategic investment from Multicoin Capital is more than just capital; it’s a vote of confidence from a major player in the crypto investment space, known for backing disruptive technologies. This funding is specifically earmarked to accelerate the integration of yields across various protocols, laying the groundwork for Yield.xyz’s ambitious future plans. The significance of this investment cannot be overstated. In a market often characterized by volatility and complexity, robust infrastructure is paramount for sustainable growth. Yield.xyz is stepping up to address critical pain points, aiming to abstract away the intricate details of yield farming and provide a more intuitive user experience. This strategic injection of capital will enable the team to expand its development efforts, onboard more talent, and accelerate the rollout of its innovative solutions, ultimately benefiting the entire DeFi ecosystem. Strengthening the Core: The Role of DeFi Infrastructure The backbone of any thriving digital economy is its infrastructure, and DeFi infrastructure is no exception. Just as roads and bridges are vital for traditional commerce, robust and efficient underlying systems are essential for the growth and stability of decentralized finance. Yield.xyz is building these crucial ‘roads’ and ‘bridges’ within DeFi. By focusing on the fundamental layers, Yield.xyz aims to: Enhance Interoperability: Connecting disparate yield-generating protocols and blockchains. Improve User Experience: Making it easier for both novice and experienced users to access and manage DeFi yields. Boost Security and Reliability: Developing resilient systems that minimize risks associated with complex interactions.

Yield.xyz’s work in this area directly addresses one of the biggest barriers to entry in decentralized finance: complexity. Unlocking Potential: The Promise of Yield Abstraction One of the most exciting aspects of Yield.xyz’s future roadmap is its plan to provide yield abstraction . But what exactly does this mean, and why is it a game-changer for DeFi users? Imagine you want to earn yield on your crypto assets. Currently, this often involves navigating multiple protocols, understanding different token standards, bridging assets across chains, and manually managing liquidity positions. It’s a daunting task for many. Yield abstraction simplifies this by: How Yield Abstraction Works: Simplifying Complexity: Users interact with a single interface, while the underlying system handles all the intricate steps of finding and deploying capital across various yield-generating opportunities (e.g., lending protocols, liquidity pools, staking). Automating Processes: The platform intelligently routes funds to the most optimal yield sources based on predefined criteria, eliminating the need for manual intervention. Reducing Gas Fees: By batching transactions or optimizing routing, yield abstraction can potentially reduce the cumulative transaction costs for users. Enhancing Accessibility: It lowers the technical barrier to entry, allowing a broader audience to participate in DeFi yield opportunities without needing deep technical knowledge. This approach moves DeFi closer to a ‘set it and forget it’ model for yield generation, making it comparable to traditional finance’s automated investment platforms but with the added benefits of decentralization and transparency. Navigating Returns: How Automated Yield Strategies Will Evolve Beyond simply abstracting away complexity, Yield.xyz also plans to offer automated yield strategies tailored to users’ risk appetites. This personalized approach is crucial in the diverse and sometimes volatile DeFi landscape. Rather than a one-size-fits-all solution, Yield.xyz aims to provide intelligent, adaptable strategies that align with individual user preferences. Key Aspects of Automated Yield Strategies: Feature Benefit for Users Risk Appetite Customization Users can select strategies based on their comfort level with risk, from conservative to aggressive, ensuring their investments align with their financial goals. Dynamic Rebalancing Strategies can automatically rebalance portfolios or shift assets between protocols to optimize returns or manage risk in changing market conditions. Performance Optimization Algorithms identify and utilize the highest-yielding opportunities across the DeFi landscape, constantly searching for optimal returns. Enhanced Security Measures While automating, the platform prioritizes secure interactions with underlying protocols, minimizing exposure to potential vulnerabilities. This evolution from manual, complex yield farming to automated, risk-adjusted strategies represents a significant leap forward in making DeFi truly accessible and user-friendly. It empowers users to participate in the lucrative world of decentralized finance without needing to become full-time market analysts or blockchain experts. The Bigger Picture: Impact and Future Outlook The $5 million strategic investment in Yield.xyz is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strong endorsement of the growing need for sophisticated yet user-friendly DeFi infrastructure . By focusing on yield abstraction and automated yield strategies , Yield.xyz is positioning itself at the forefront of the next wave of DeFi innovation.

While XRP currently at $2.13 continues to hold investor interest with long-term utility, the real excitement is building around a fast-rising newcomer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.03 in the fifth phase of its presale. Phase 5 buyers are set for a guaranteed profit of 100% ROI at launch. Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining momentum for its innovative DeFi infrastructure and sharply rising community engagement. As traders look for the best crypto to buy in 2025, this emerging altcoin is standing out, not just for its low entry point, but for its positioning in sectors expected to drive the next market cycle. XRP Current Outlook XRP is floating at the price of around $2.13 after the recent volatility that brought it to around $2.09 before recouping back to $2.18. The technical indicators indicate that it is traded break-even at the moment, with short-term resistance at the level of $2.20-$2.23 and support at the level of 2.10 at the moment. Analysts observe that XRP is trading in a relatively neutral state and could be headed to test resistance levels in case there is a change of market sentiment or decline towards the region of $2.02. There has been some support in the institutional interest associated with payment integrations by Ripple and the crypto-reserve addition by the U.S. However, catalysts continue to be minimal. In this regard, a significant number of traders are monitoring the event happening in the ecosystem with one eye, as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) seems to dominate the attention. Mutuum Finance Hits $11 Million Raised Mutuum Finance is running wild in popularity. With its trailblazing two-way lending model, this DeFi behemoth has already attracted more than 12,400 investors and raised $11.1 million, and it’s not slowing down. The Mutuum Finance token price will jump to $0.035 in Phase 6, a 16.67% increase, so investors who come aboard here are in for massive gains. Early bird investors are locking profits. Mutuum Finance Lending: Smarter, Simpler, Decentralized Mutuum Finance combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, offering users stable returns from USDT pools via the P2C framework and full ownership of direct crypto transfer via the P2P framework. Mutuum Finance’s USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance’s upcoming overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, launching on Ethereum, is designed to maintain price stability while avoiding flaws found in algorithmic stablecoins. While the project is already audited by CertiK, Mutuum Finance is laying the groundwork for massive adoption, and investors who pay attention at this point might benefit the most in the future. On top of that, the platform is running a massive $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will each receive $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens. XRP, which is trading at $2.13 still keeps the spotlight thanks to its role as the basis of cross-border payments, and Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming one of the leaders on the DeFi market. Most investors consider Mutuum Finance since it has raised over 11.1 million dollars, and 12,400+ investors already invested, Mutuum Finance is doing exactly that, delivering momentum. Investors in this stage are gaining returns as high as 100 % ROI at launch, and the price of the token will increase to 0.035 by the 6th phase. With time to presale closing soon, and the crypto community readying itself toward a possible recovery, this is the moment to step in. Become a part of the movement and invest in Mutuum Finance now and stand a chance of being in the frontline in the next DeFi revolution.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/5-5-billion-xrp-was-just-drained-from-upbit-heres-what-happened/,"A tweet from Abs, host of the Good Morning Crypto show, revealed that 5.5 billion XRP was suddenly withdrawn from the cryptocurrency exchange Upbit. The tweet featured an image from CryptoQuant, highlighting a sharp drop in Upbit’s XRP exchange reserves. This unexpected change in reserves led to widespread speculation within the cryptocurrency community. The graph showed a consistent XRP reserve balance of around 6 billion XRP on Upbit over several months, followed by a sudden and steep plunge to approximately 1 billion XRP. This dramatic change triggered questions about whether this was a sign of large-scale accumulation by institutional players or a technical issue.

Comment Below & Follow For More!! pic.twitter.com/ir0ZoY4bzs — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) June 24, 2025 Community Responses Raise Speculation and Skepticism The tweet drew immediate responses from various users on the X platform. Jason Thorpe questioned whether the massive withdrawal could be linked to banks and financial institutions accumulating XRP. His comment implied the possibility that large financial entities might be preparing for future use cases involving XRP. Another user, TxBorn83, pointed out that the beauty of blockchain technology allows anyone to verify such claims directly through wallet addresses. His response suggested that the crypto community should rely on transparent blockchain data to confirm or dismiss such events rather than depend solely on social media posts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, not everyone was convinced of the legitimacy of the reserve drain. DMichael_XRP responded by calling the event an “API glitch” and criticized the post, suggesting that it was misinformation driven by technical reporting errors rather than actual fund movement. Times Tabloid Launches Independent Verification In response to the attention generated by the tweet, Times Tabloid conducted an independent investigation into the Upbit XRP wallets. Data from XRP scan showed that several Upbit-linked wallets still held substantial amounts of XRP, including one wallet containing over 1 billion XRP and multiple others holding 500 million XRP each. This wallet data suggests that Upbit continues to maintain significant XRP reserves despite what the CryptoQuant chart displays. The evidence from Times Tabloid’s wallet tracking raises questions about the accuracy of the exchange reserve metric reported by CryptoQuant . It indicates that the sudden drop on the chart may not represent an actual movement of funds but could be due to a technical discrepancy in data reporting. Unresolved Questions Remain The sudden disappearance of 5.5 billion XRP from Upbit’s exchange reserves, as shown in the CryptoQuant chart, remains a mystery at the time of reporting. While some in the community speculate that this could be a sign of institutional accumulation, others firmly believe it is a simple reporting error or API malfunction. The Times Tabloid investigation into Upbit’s wallet balances provides evidence that the exchange still holds a huge amount of XRP across multiple wallets. This significantly challenges the narrative that the exchange was drained of billions of XRP. However, without an official statement from Upbit or CryptoQuant, it is unclear whether this anomaly was due to technical issues or an intentional, large-scale withdrawal.

The key to this partnership is Midnight, Cardano’s privacy-focused sidechain, which could soon serve as the DeFi engine for XRP. Unlocking DeFi Without Leaving XRPL Hoskinson explained during a recent AMA that Midnight is designed to let XRP users tap into DeFi features like staking, lending, and liquidity pools, without having to move their tokens off the XRP Ledger. Since XRP doesn’t support smart contracts , this sidechain integration could offer the ecosystem a new layer of utility while allowing users to keep their assets secure on-chain. Midnight uses zero-knowledge cryptography to allow confidential smart contracts. This means users can interact with DeFi apps while keeping their financial data private. It’s a powerful upgrade that could significantly enhance what XRP holders can do with their tokens. From Wallets to Stablecoins The collaboration doesn’t stop with Midnight. Hoskinson confirmed that Cardano’s Lace Wallet will soon support XRP, allowing holders to manage multiple assets under one interface. There are also ongoing discussions to integrate Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin into the Cardano ecosystem, providing a USD-pegged liquidity option for DeFi platforms operating on Midnight. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Midnight Airdrop Alert: Here’s How to Claim Your Free NIGHT Tokens , Hoskinson revealed that he has spoken with Ripple executives, including CTO David Schwartz and CEO Brad Garlinghouse, to ensure smooth integration between Midnight and the XRP Ledger. The goal is to integrate Cardano’s advanced smart contract capabilities with XRP’s robust liquidity and cross-border capabilities. Airdrop Campaign Targets XRP Community To spark interest and user activity, Cardano has launched two airdrop campaigns: the Midnight Drop and Glacier Drop. XRP holders with at least $100 worth of XRP as of June 11, 2025, are eligible to claim a portion of the 1.2 billion NIGHT tokens, the governance token for Midnight. Midnight is already live on testnet, and its mainnet launch is expected later this year. Once live, it will support interactions across multiple chains, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and now XRPL, strengthening Cardano’s multi-chain ambitions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

He noted investors who abandoned stocks on Nvidia, AMDs, Vertices, Microns, and Marvell Technologies are now back. DeepSeek released an AI model in January that seemed as advanced as competitors, requiring far less money and energy. Wall Street panicked at the news, fearing Big Tech had spent too much building data centers and AI models. It resulted in many companies in the industry experiencing a drop in their stocks. AI tech giants draw investor faith from DeepSeek The buzz over DeepSeek this week crystallized, for many people, a few important trends that have been happening in plain sight: (i) China is catching up to the U.S. in generative AI, with implications for the AI supply chain. (ii) Open weight models are commoditizing the… — Andrew Ng (@AndrewYNg) January 30, 2025 Jim Cramer told investors that Wall Street no longer seems concerned about the potential for Chinese startups to outpace tech giants in the AI industry. Investors had abandoned the tech giants after DeepSeek threatened the sector by revealing its cheap production compared to other companies. AI firm Nvidia , whose market cap has surged quickly over the past few years as the tech space clamored for its products, dropped 17% in one session. The semiconductor producer lost close to $600 billion, marking the largest single-day drop for a U.S. company. Cramer argued that the recovery of many AI stocks shows that fears about DeepSeek’s dominance are short-lived. He said the rally also refutes the idea that China had beaten the U.S. in the AI arms race. “Now, looking back, with so much of tech bordering on new highs, it’s clear that these stocks never should’ve been sold in the first place. Because DeepSeek simply wasn’t that meaningful.” – Jim Cramer , American Author and TV Personality. The American TV personality mentioned that Wall Street’s DeepSeek panic is a “microcosm” of the kind of situations that cause investors to make mistakes and unnecessarily write off certain stocks. Cramer believes many investors did not question DeepSeek’s assertions, even as some experts warned the data could be misleading. U.S. indexes jumped higher on Monday as Wall Street bet that the cease-fire in the Middle East would take effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.19%, the S&P 500 rose 1.11%, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.43%. Semiconductor stocks also saw an incline during the session, as Broadcom soared to new heights, up 3.94%, while Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices gained 2.59% and 6.83%, respectively. The Nasdaq 100 also hit a new all-time closing high, finishing up 1.53%. DeepSeek evades chip export controls An unnamed senior State Department official told Reuters in an interview that the Chinese AI startup sought to use Southeast Asian shell companies to obtain high-end Nvidia chips, including H100 chips, which cannot be shipped to China under U.S. rules. The U.S. official’s comment showed that DeepSeek’s fast-growing AI capabilities were exaggerated, as the company still relied heavily on U.S. technology. The official also warned that the Hangzhou-based AI firm had provided user information to the Chinese government but had declined to comment on whether the U.S. would implement further export controls or sanctions against the Chinese AI startup. An Nvidia spokesperson confirmed that the company’s review indicates that the Chinese AI startup used lawfully acquired H800 products, not H100. A study published by DeepSeek’s researchers revealed the firm used 2,048 Nvidia H800 chips to train its DeepSeek-V3 large language model (LLM). According to the report, DeepSeek-V3 required 2.788 million H800 GPU hours for its complete training, meaning the total training time was about 56.7 days. The Chinese AI company also claimed that the training cost for its AI model was only $58 million. Meta spent $500 million to train its Llama 3.1. A group of DeepSeek researchers revealed in a paper on January 22 that DeepSeek-R1’s training used the data from Alibaba’s Tongyi Qianwen (Qween) and Llama. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnich said the Chinese AI company could create “dirt cheap” AI models by purchasing many Nvidia chips and stealing data from Meta’s open platform. In October 2022, the Biden administration banned the export of Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips to China. In October 2023, it also banned the exports of the A800 and H800 chips to China.

According to Alphractal’s analysis, the stablecoin market has been experiencing significant growth in recent weeks. With a total market value approaching $250 billion, stablecoins currently account for around 7.5% of the global cryptocurrency market, with Tether (USDT) taking the largest share. USDT represents more than 66% of all stablecoins. On the other hand, the total market dominance of Bitcoin and stablecoins reached 73.5%. According to experts, this rate is historically considered as the forerunner of a strong accumulation and rise period for the altcoin market.

According to Wedson, while the majority of investors are still keeping their distance from the altcoin market, the large liquidity available could lead to a surprise rally by turning to these assets. Despite the cautious mood in the market, the Alphractal team believes that a parabolic rally in altcoins is possible starting in the summer of 2025. *This is not investment advice.

John Deaton, a key legal voice in the XRP community, suggested Ripple could reach a $100 billion valuation if it went public, drawing comparisons to Circle’s explosive post-IPO rally. At the same time, CME Group reported over $500 million in notional trading volume for its new XRP futures contracts. Ripple IPO Rumors Resurface as John Deaton Points to $100 Billion Valuation Potential Ripple Labs could be next in line for a major Wall Street debut—if market sentiment and valuation comps are any indication. That’s the message being broadcast by John Deaton, a prominent attorney and leading figure within the XRP community, who recently reignited speculation over Ripple’s IPO ambitions by suggesting that the company could achieve a market capitalization exceeding $100 billion if it decides to go public. The comments come in the wake of Circle’s meteoric rise on the New York Stock Exchange. Since its IPO earlier this month, Circle’s stock (CRCL) has surged more than 600%, pushing its market valuation to $66.2 billion. This figure now exceeds the total value of its flagship product, the USDC stablecoin, which is currently sitting at around $61.3 billion in circulating supply. CRCL share price (Source: Yahoo Finance ) Ripple, best known for its enterprise blockchain solutions and the XRP token, holds a substantial reserve of over 40 billion XRP, with 36.2 billion of that in escrow. At current prices—hovering around $2—that reserve alone would be valued north of $78.8 billion. Deaton argues that this alone puts Ripple in a prime position to enter public markets at a valuation that could easily breach the $100 billion mark. That estimate doesn’t even account for Ripple’s sprawling international partnerships, XRP Ledger development, or its efforts in modernizing cross-border financial infrastructure. As the legal pressure surrounding XRP has begun to ease and momentum builds toward potential ETF inclusion, Ripple’s overall narrative is being reshaped from regulatory uncertainty to institutional opportunity. Shifting Tone From Ripple Executives Despite the bullish projections, Ripple’s leadership has publicly maintained a more cautious tone. In April 2025, Ripple President Monica Long stated that the company had “no plans to go public this year” and emphasized Ripple’s strong cash position following a significant share buyback. CEO Brad Garlinghouse echoed that sentiment, calling an IPO “possible, but not a top priority.” However, Deaton suggests that those views may be subject to change in light of recent market conditions. Circle’s soaring valuation has triggered a ripple effect across the digital assets industry. As investors and analysts digest the fact that Circle’s market cap now exceeds that of its own stablecoin, many are reevaluating how crypto companies should be valued—not just based on product circulation, but on the ecosystem, infrastructure, and potential for growth. Circle’s listing also comes at a time when the macro environment is improving for public tech and crypto stocks, particularly with the recent wave of ETF approvals and the Federal Reserve's increasingly dovish posture. The rising tide, it seems, could lift Ripple with it—should the company choose to step aboard. XRP’s ETF Momentum Adds More Fuel Another wildcard in Ripple’s public market prospects is the growing speculation around an XRP-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). Bloomberg analysts have placed the odds of a spot XRP ETF launching in 2025 at 95%, following the success of CME XRP futures and the wave of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier this year. If XRP were to gain a spot ETF approval, it would almost certainly boost institutional confidence in both the token and Ripple’s broader ecosystem. Combined with a potential IPO, these events could mark a dual-track entry into mainstream finance for Ripple. CME’s XRP Futures Surge Past $500M in First Month, Fueling Spot ETF Optimism In related news, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a global leader in derivatives trading, has reported an impressive $542 million in notional volume for its newly launched XRP futures during their first full month of trading. The figures highlight the growing appetite for regulated crypto products among institutional and retail investors alike—and signal renewed momentum for the XRP ecosystem amid ongoing regulatory headwinds. CME launched the futures contracts on May 19, following months of speculation and industry anticipation. Offered in both standard and micro sizes to cater to different trading appetites, the XRP futures contracts quickly gained traction. Just three days after launch, the products had already surpassed $19 million in volume, signaling strong early demand. According to CME Group, nearly half of the trading volume originated from markets outside North America, a testament to XRP’s global reach and appeal. This international engagement reflects the broader narrative of XRP’s utility in cross-border payments—a key differentiator compared to other crypto assets that often lean heavily on speculative use cases. Market Response Reflects Renewed Institutional Confidence CME Group attributed the strong performance to “significant market interest” and robust engagement from institutional players. This is aligned with Ripple’s broader push toward institutional adoption, particularly after its acquisition of prime brokerage firm Hidden Road, a move that analysts say strengthens XRP’s bridge between traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure. Further catalyzing XRP’s bullish outlook is its deepening role in cross-border payment systems, especially in markets where legacy banking systems fall short. The token’s integration into stablecoin ecosystems is another driver of utility, CME noted, adding to its relevance in both financial infrastructure and digital asset innovation. The successful rollout of CME’s XRP futures could have broader implications beyond derivatives markets. Analysts view this as a critical stepping stone toward the eventual launch of a US-based spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). With Bloomberg analysts now placing the probability of a spot XRP ETF approval in 2025 at a striking 95%, the success of CME’s regulated futures product serves as a key precedent. Historically, futures-based trading activity on CME has served as a validator for the eventual approval of spot ETFs, as seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum. By offering institutional-grade infrastructure and regulatory compliance, CME’s involvement often lends legitimacy to digital assets in the eyes of US regulators. Global Appetite for Regulated Crypto Products The international nature of XRP futures volume shows another trend: the growing global demand for regulated crypto investment vehicles. While the US remains a crucial battleground for regulatory clarity, regions such as Europe, Asia, and Latin America have shown increasing openness to digital assets, especially those with clear use cases like XRP.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to prevent banks from debanking crypto firms, after accusations of politically motivated discrimination known as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” However, the Federal Reserve announced it will no longer consider “reputational risk” in bank oversight, which was a policy that was criticized for harming crypto companies. Low Turnout at Senate Hearing Raises Doubts A recent US Senate hearing that was intended to explore bipartisan legislative frameworks for digital asset market structure saw very low attendance, with only five of the 11 members of the Senate Banking Committee’s digital assets subcommittee present. The hearing was chaired by Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, and featured testimony from former regulators and industry leaders, including former CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam, Coinbase legal executive Ryan VanGrack, Multicoin Capital’s Greg Xethalis, and Wharton School’s Sarah Hammer. Lummis pointed to the scheduling of multiple competing committee meetings as a possible reason for the poor turnout but expressed concern about the lack of bipartisan engagement on digital asset legislation. (Source: US Senate Banking Committee ) The hearing focused on the development of a Senate bill, which goal is to establish a clear market structure for digital assets, building on the recent passage of the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan stablecoin bill. Despite the earlier cooperative momentum, Lummis raised questions about the growing partisanship surrounding crypto legislation. She hinted at potential political motivations, and suggested that concerns over certain administration members’ family ties to the crypto industry might be influencing Democratic resistance. Democratic Senator Angela Alsobrooks was the only member from her party present at the hearing, filling in for Ranking Member Ruben Gallego. Alsobrooks supported the GENIUS Act and played a role in advancing it. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Bernie Moreno echoed concerns about why crypto legislation has become such a partisan issue, although no direct references were made to President Donald Trump or specific people in the administration. The Senate’s proposed digital asset market structure legislation complements parallel efforts in the House, where the CLARITY Act was recently moved out of committee and is expected to be put to a floor vote. While several Democrats previously voted alongside Republicans to advance the GENIUS Act, the broader debate over crypto regulation in Congress is still very much colored by political suspicion and questions of transparency. Trump Eyes Action Against Crypto Debanking Despite the rising political tensions, the Trump administration is reportedly considering issuing an executive order to prevent banks from cutting off services to politically disfavored industries, including cryptocurrency firms. According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, the proposed move is in response to concerns that financial institutions have been selectively denying services to crypto and tech entrepreneurs in what critics have labeled “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” The alleged debanking campaign began under former President Joe Biden’s administration, with at least 30 technology and crypto founders reportedly affected. Major banks like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo recently met with state officials in Texas and Oklahoma to address allegations of discrimination against industries like firearms manufacturing and fossil fuels. Naturally, the issue attracted a lot of bipartisan attention. In February, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren urged the Trump administration to intervene after saying that no one should be denied banking access based on political views or industry affiliation. The topic gained renewed urgency after the collapse of three crypto-friendly banks—Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank, and Signature Bank—between March 10 and 12, 2023. These closures prompted venture capitalist Nic Carter to characterize the situation as a coordinated attempt to marginalize the crypto industry, dubbing it “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” Despite a seemingly more supportive stance from the Trump administration, there are still some concerns from within the crypto industry. Caitlin Long , CEO of Custodia Bank, explained that the debanking trend may persist until at least 2026. She pointed out that Trump will not be able to appoint a new Federal Reserve governor until January, which could potentially limit the administration’s influence. Long added that if agencies like the OCC and FDIC roll back their anti-crypto stances but the Fed does not, regulatory uncertainty could continue to hamper the industry. Long’s own bank, Custodia, suffered due to these banking restrictions by losing both time and money. Trump did, however, reaffirmed his plans to end the practice during his comments at the White House Crypto Summit on March 7. Federal Reserve Ends Support for Crypto Debanking Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve announced a major policy shift by directing its supervisors to stop considering “reputational risk” in the oversight of banks. This is a big win for the cryptocurrency industry, which has long argued that the ambiguous concept of reputational risk was used to justify the debanking of crypto firms under Operation Chokepoint 2.0. In its statement, the Federal Reserve Board said it started reviewing its supervisory materials to remove references to reputational risk and replace them with more specific discussions focused on financial risk. The central bank also plans to train its examiners accordingly and ensure the change is consistently applied across all banks it supervises. Additionally, the Fed is working with other federal banking regulators to promote uniform practices across the regulatory landscape. Despite this move, the Fed clarified that banks are still expected to maintain strong risk management systems and comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The change does not prevent banks from considering reputational risk in their internal risk frameworks; it simply removes the concept from supervisory guidance. The Federal Reserve defined reputational risk as the potential for damage due to negative publicity—accurate or not—that could lead to customer loss, litigation, or revenue decline. The move drew praise from both crypto advocates and banking industry leaders. Senator Cynthia Lummis described the previous reputation risk policy as one that “assassinated American Bitcoin and digital asset businesses,” and called the reversal a win, albeit one that requires more action. Rob Nichols, CEO of the American Bankers Association, also supported the change by saying it would make bank supervision more transparent and grounded in sound financial principles rather than regulatory subjectivity. However, not everyone welcomed the decision. Critics argued that removing reputational risk from oversight could downplay non-financial concerns that affect bank stability, weaken overall supervision, and open the door to potentially riskier practices. This policy shift happened as part of the broader rollback of crypto restrictions by US regulators. In May, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency confirmed that banks under its oversight are allowed to trade crypto and outsource related services. Similarly, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation clarified in March that banks can now engage in crypto-related activities without requiring prior approval.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-25 05:34:20

SharpLink said that all of its Ethereum holdings have been staked, generating 120 ETH rewards, or around $293,000, since it launched its ETH-focused treasury strategy on June 2. It added that since then, the firm has achieved ETH per share growth of 19%. SharpLink board chairman and CEO of ConsenSys, Joseph Lubin, said increasing Ethereum holdings underscores the firm’s “forward-thinking approach to creating long-term value.” “This move reflects our confidence in Ethereum’s utility and our commitment to exploring transformative technologies that can unlock new value for our business and stockholders alike.” The move follows a $450 million funding round earlier this month from a wide range of investors, including ConsenSys, Galaxy, and Pantera Capital. Institutional investors and funds remain keen on Ethereum even if retail is staying away. BlackRock’s ETHA fund bought $98 million worth of the asset on Tuesday. The nine spot Ether ETFs in the United States have seen more than $1 billion in inflows so far this month, with just two minor outflow days. This represents a quarter of the entire aggregate inflow for spot ETH funds since they launched in mid-2024 … in less than a month! ETH Prices Stagnant Ethereum has struggled over the past week, falling below $2,200 on Monday and only managing to recover marginally. The asset has failed to reclaim resistance at $2,500 and was wallowing around $2,440 at the time of writing, following a minor gain on the day. Aside from the dip earlier this week, Ethereum has been tightly range-bound for the past nine weeks and needs to see momentum above $2,800 for any serious moves higher to materialize. Analysts and holders remain quietly confident , though some have even called it a stablecoin for lack of movement over the past couple of months.

The collaboration involves participation from the Open Blockchain and DID Association, and the Financial Supervisory Service. Announced on Wednesday by the country’s financial sector, the joint venture marks the first time commercial banks have entered into the digital asset business in the form of a consortium. The group of eight banks includes KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Woori, Nonghyup, Industrial Bank of Korea, Suhyup, Citibank Korea, and SC First Bank. The announcement arrives in line with the central bank’s advocacy for a phased rollout of a won-backed stablecoin. The Bank of Korea’s (BOK) senior deputy governor Ryoo Sang-dai said Tuesday at a press conference that it was desirable to initially allow commercial banks to introduce won-denominated stablecoins at a gradual pace. Commercial banks’ involvement in stablecoin is a signal that the private sector is starting to respond to crypto in earnest. Particularly, when the US has established its first federal framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins – the GENIUS Act , several nations like South Korea and industry giants like Amazon are moving toward embracing this asset class. Banks Rollout Two Initial Won-Linked Stablecoin Models Per the local report, discussions on joint infrastructure between banks are currently in progress. Further, the establishment of the cooperation would come to light this year or early next year. The banks have rolled out an initial plan comprising two methods of issuing the won-backed stablecoin – trust-based and deposit-linked. In the trust model, coins are issued after separately entrusting customer funds, while in the deposit-linked model, coins are issued by linking 1:1 with bank deposits. “There is a shared sense of crisis that if things continue this way, foreign dollar coins could dominate the domestic market,” a banking official noted. “It is time to secure both the independence and competitiveness of the domestic financial system through a won-based digital currency.” Stablecoin Regulations and President’s Promises The current trend of banks’ involvement is in line with the Digital Asset Act that was recently proposed by South Korea’s National Assembly. The legislation explicitly notes the introduction of a stablecoin authorization system. However, the Bank of Korea is still skeptical of proposals to launch a won stablecoin. Meanwhile, the newly elected President Lee Jae-myung has pledged to launch a KRW-pegged coin for use in business and international trade. Presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung proposes a won-backed stablecoin to stop $40.8B in crypto capital flight. #Korea #Stablecoin #LeeJaemyung https://t.co/qR1jwd7tXB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 20, 2025 His administration is quickly moving to implement campaign pledges aimed at modernizing South Korea’s regulatory framework for digital assets. The joint venture of banks is a private sector-led model, differing from the CBDC being prepared by the Bank of Korea. Though further discussions on its technological linkages with the central bank are needed, there are talks in the market that it can be expanded into various applications such as cross-border remittance and domestic payments.

Notably, phishing attacks accounted for about $8.5 million of the total losses. CertiK alert has flagged a major exploit on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), where an attacker drained nearly $2 million by abusing a smart contract function called printMoney().

The individual repeatedly triggered the printMoney() function on their authorized attack contract. The unauthorized access stemmed from a compromised victim contract linked to the address 0xb5cb0, which had unknowingly approved the malicious contract about eight hours before the attack. CertiK believes the victim contract deployer’s private key may have been phished or otherwise compromised, leading to the unauthorized approval transaction. This gave the attacker full permission to transfer the victim’s tokens. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ZachXBT Accuses Garden Finance For Laundering Bybit Hack Funds , Attacker Converts Funds and Holds Nearly $2M 2/ The attacker quickly redeemed stolen derivative tokens for BNB and stables and is currently holding ~$1,962,330 in value at 0xd5c6f3B71bCcEb2eF8332bd8225f5F39E56A122c. pic.twitter.com/D7MSpbUagY — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) June 25, 2025 Once access was secured, the attacker swiftly converted the stolen derivative tokens into BNB and stablecoins . As of now, the exploiter is holding approximately $1.96 million worth of assets at their address. Community Urged to Stay Alert Big crypto hacks are piling up this year, with Coinbase losing $400 million , Cetus on the Sui network hit for $220 million , and others like Phemex and UPCX also suffering huge losses. These incidents show just how risky things can get in crypto if you’re not careful. According to CertiK, one of the biggest mistakes is trusting unverified smart contracts or having weak security for private keys. In a recent BSC hack, that’s exactly what went wrong. The attacker was able to steal millions because the victim’s contract wasn’t properly secured. CertiK is now tracking the hacker’s wallet and keeping an eye on suspicious activity. They’ve also reminded users and developers to always check contract approvals, use well-audited code, and avoid rushing into transactions. Meanwhile, CertiK’s advice is simple be careful, stay alert, and don’t rush into anything. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The HB 2324 reserve bill gives the state of Arizona the authority to set up a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund” using cryptocurrencies obtained through criminal forfeiture. Once signed into law, this bill would become the second state-level measure in Arizona to establish a crypto-based state reserve. 🇺🇸 JUST IN: Arizona passes 'Bitcoin Reserve' bill HB2324. The bill creates a reserve for assets obtained through criminal asset forfeiture. If signed by Governor Hobbs, it will be the state's second second reserve bill passed into law. pic.twitter.com/0OlT01LtZp — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 25, 2025 HB 2324 was initially voted down in the House during its third reading on May 7. However, the state Senate agreed on Thursday to revive the bill after Republican Senator Jane Shamp, who had voted against it, filed a motion to reconsider. The reconsideration vote in the Senate followed party lines almost entirely, with Republican Jake Hoffman as the lone GOP member opposing the bill. At that time, it passed the Senate in a 16-14 vote. Arizona could also claim abandoned digital assets Under the terms of HB 2324, the first $300,000 in digital assets seized during a criminal forfeiture would go to the Attorney General’s office. Any value beyond that threshold would be divided so that 50 percent continues to the Attorney General, 25 percent moves into the state general fund, and the remaining 25 percent is deposited into the new reserve fund. The bill, sponsored by Republican Senator Jeff Weninger, also broadens Arizona’s forfeiture statutes to cover digital assets. It lays out rules for seizing, storing, and allocating these assets. The state of Arizona could claim digital assets from individuals who are deceased, deported, have fled, have gained immunity, or have abandoned it. Of course, officials will have to prove that there is no known owner, that they made diligent efforts to find one, and that no one else has stepped forward to claim it. Earlier this month, on May 7, Governor Hobbs also signed HB 2749 into law. That measure similarly permits Arizona to retain unclaimed cryptocurrency and form a Bitcoin reserve fund without tapping taxpayer dollars or state funds.

Key Takeaways: ProCap BTC purchased 3,724 BTC for $386 million ahead of its planned IPO via SPAC merger. The firm’s Bitcoin holdings are now worth nearly $400 million as BTC prices rise. ProCap aims to accumulate up to $1 billion in BTC, joining a wave of corporate treasury buyers. His firm, ProCap BTC, announced Tuesday that it had acquired 3,724 BTC for $386 million, just days after revealing plans to go public later this year. The purchase was made at a time-weighted average price of $103,785 per Bitcoin. Bitcoin Gains Lift Pompliano’s Investment to Nearly $400M With Bitcoin prices climbing since the buy, Pompliano’s investment now sits just below $400 million in value. The acquisition follows Monday’s announcement that ProCap intends to go public through a merger with Columbus Circle Capital, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), forming a new entity named ProCap Financial. “We believe Bitcoin is the new hurdle rate. If you can’t beat it, you have to buy it,” Pompliano wrote on X, underscoring the firm’s conviction in the asset. We have purchased 3,724 Bitcoin. This purchase happened within one day after announcing a $1 BILLION merger and over $750 million fundraise. The average price was ~ $103,785 per bitcoin. We believe bitcoin is the new hurdle rate.

Backers of the upcoming SPAC deal have already raised over $750 million, $516 million in equity commitments and $235 million via convertible notes. Should ProCap go public today, its BTC position would rank 14th among all publicly listed companies, according to BiTBO data. It would sit just behind Semler Scientific, a medical technology firm that recently entered the Bitcoin treasury space. ProCap joins a growing number of firms moving aggressively into Bitcoin. MicroStrategy extended its lead this week with holdings now totaling 592,345 BTC. Japan’s Metaplanet increased its exposure to 11,111 BTC . Grant Cardone’s real estate group disclosed its first buy, 1,000 BTC, while mineral exploration company Panther Metals laid out a $5.4 million crypto strategy combining traditional mining with digital assets. Also this week, Norway’s Green Minerals AS revealed plans to allocate $1.2 billion toward Bitcoin purchases. VanEck Warns BTC Treasury Strategy May Backfire Just recently, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, raised concerns about the Bitcoin treasury strategies used by certain public companies, suggesting that continued accumulation of BTC could soon harm shareholders more than help. He specifically criticized the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, warning that they can become dilutive when stock prices approach the company’s Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Sigel proposed several measures to prevent value erosion, including pausing ATM programs if a company’s stock trades below 0.95x NAV for over 10 days. He drew comparisons to past failures in the crypto mining sector, where excessive dilution and executive pay led to major shareholder losses. As an example, he cited Semler Scientific, a medical tech firm that entered the BTC space in 2024. Despite acquiring 3,808 BTC, its stock has fallen over 45%, and its mNAV has dropped to 0.82x.

According to a June 25 Bloomberg interview with BitGo’s Asia-Pacific managing director Abel Seow, the company’s assets under custody jumped from $60 billion to $100 billion in the first half of the year. Seow attributed the 67% increase to a mix of rising global crypto adoption and improving regulatory clarity. Half of BitGo’s current holdings are in staking , a yield-generating process where users pledge tokens to aid in the validation of blockchain transactions. Founded in 2013, the company currently oversees custody as well as trading, lending, and borrowing for institutional clients. Its 2023 Series C fundraising raised $100 million at a $1.75 billion valuation with the help of investors such as Valor Equity Partners, DRW Holdings, Redpoint Ventures, and Goldman Sachs.

In a recent post on X, he shared an $11 target and linked to a YouTube video outlining a strategy that anticipates one final leg down before a significant reversal. He placed strong emphasis on structure, liquidity zones, and volume behavior, suggesting that this could be the final opportunity to accumulate before a sharp rally. XRP traded just over $2 at the time of his analysis, after recovering from a dip below $2 , and he noted the absence of a decisive bottoming structure. According to the analyst, XRP is close to completing a right shoulder in a potential reversal pattern , estimating the ideal level around $1.89. A crash toward $1.85 is possible, with further downside to $1.73 or even as low as $1.55 not entirely ruled out. However, these lower targets are not his base case. Bitcoin and ETH Analysis Support Outlook The broader market context supports this cautious stance. Bitcoin, for instance, bounced from $98,200, but Cryptoinsightuk suggested further downside is likely before a true bottom forms. He expects a price range between $92,000 and $95,000 to act as a more probable reversal zone, citing past RSI behavior and a similarity to previous patterns. As for Ethereum, he sees potential for a dip to around $1,996 before it moves higher. Liquidity is thinning below current levels, which he interpreted as waning long interest, which often precedes a final shakeout before reversal riwa$4,200. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Final Flush or Start of Expansion? The central thesis hinges on what he described as a typical structure: a flush of liquidity, followed by bullish divergence and then aggressive expansion toward $11 . He acknowledged the more conservative calls for $8 but stated he sees an extension beyond that figure, estimating $11 to $12 as the upper limit for this rally phase. He confirmed that he’s been actively accumulating during the drawdown. He reaffirmed his long-term view that this pullback was expected and necessary before the next major move. The projection relies on XRP first completing a final move down by 5% to 10% before surging in what he believes will be the next phase of the cycle. Notably, another analyst recently set an $8 to $13 target for XRP, adding credence to Cryptoinsightuk’s prediction. Cryptoinsightuk highlighted spot buying during XRP’s flush and rising open interest, suggesting one more dip before recovery. He expects alt season to begin if Bitcoin dominance falls and sees XRP pushing toward $11 soon. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

But the real twist is coming next. The House might combine it with the powerful CLARITY Act, a bill that could redefine how every crypto asset is treated in the U.S. Together, these two bills could bring long-needed rules and clarity to the crypto space in America. Let’s see how this will impact crypto? Two Bills, One Goal: Crypto Regulation The GENIUS Act made history on June 17 when the Senate passed it with a 51–23 vote. It’s the first big crypto bill to pass the chamber and is now in the hands of the House. If approved without changes, it will be sent directly to the president’s desk for final approval. But that’s where things get complicated. Tom Emmer, a key House leader, has suggested the bill’s success in the House may depend on its alignment with the CLARITY Act. The CLARITY Act, officially known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, has already passed the House Financial Services Committee and is awaiting a full House vote. Why This Bill Matters Tom Emmer says both bills should move together. He believes combining the two will give a full and clear structure for crypto in the country. This bill gives full guidelines on how all kinds of crypto and digital assets should be used, bought, or traded in the US. Trump’s Push vs Political Concerns However, President Donald Trump wants the House to pass the GENIUS Act quickly, without any additions. But not everyone agrees. Some lawmakers are concerned about Trump’s crypto ties, especially with World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin project. To limit the involvement of political leaders in the crypto space, Senator Adam Schiff introduced the COIN Act on June 23. This bill aims to stop presidents and their families from making money through crypto while holding office. What Most People Don’t Know If these laws pass, the U.S. could finally fix the messy patchwork of rules that make it hard for new crypto companies to start. Right now, a company has to follow different rules in every state, which is expensive and slow. With one national rule, it could be much easier for new ideas to grow—and for you to use digital money safely.",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-25 06:01:07

According to a June 24 blog post , the exchange supported the multi-agency investigation by analyzing onchain fund flows and helping identify scam victims for restitution. As previously reported by crypto.news, the Department of Justice filed an enforcement action to seize the funds on June 18, following a month-long investigation into fraud networks operating across Southeast Asia. The funds were originally frozen in late 2023 by stablecoin issuer Tether, which blocked 39 wallet addresses holding the stolen USDT. Many of the wallets were traced to 140 accounts on OKX, linked to individuals allegedly trafficked into scam compounds and forced to operate fraudulent investment platforms. These schemes typically involve building fake romantic or business relationships with victims before manipulating them into sending crypto. Coinbase said it joined an “investigative sprint” with the Secret Service between February 26 and 29, 2024, working alongside agents to trace millions in crypto transactions from illicit wallets back to wallets on its own platform.

This process allowed the Secret Service to identify over 130 Coinbase users who had unknowingly sent crypto to scam addresses, accounting for at least $2.3 million in losses. The exchange added that its subpoena record production and blockchain analysis were instrumental in flagging eligible victims. It has since published guidance to help customers access and submit their transaction records to law enforcement. The USDT originally frozen by Tether was later burned and reissued, with the new tokens transferred to a wallet under Secret Service control. Alongside Coinbase and OKX, other unnamed exchanges also contributed to the investigation. The operation marks one of the largest crypto-related fraud recoveries on record and is one of the latest instances where digital asset firms have helped trace and recover illicit funds. As previously reported by crypto.news, in March, Cryptocurrency exchange MEXC froze over 1,500 accounts linked to a market manipulation scheme spanning Vietnam and CIS countries. Earlier this year, the T3 Financial Crime Unit, a collaboration between Tether, blockchain network TRON, and analytics firm TRM Labs, reported freezing over $100 million in criminal assets tied to illicit USDT activity.

On the geopolitical front, US President Donald Trump accused both Israel and Iran of violating a newly declared ceasefire, expressing particular frustration with Israel for launching major strikes on Iran. Earlier that day, Iran fired a barrage of missiles, resulting in four fatalities. Gold prices edged higher to around $3,330 per ounce on Wednesday, slightly recovering from a two-week low. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.29% to above 38,800 on Wednesday, while the broader Topix Index slipped 0.2% to 2,776. The Japanese yen held steady around 144.8 per dollar on Wednesday, near a one-week-high, as markets digested the Bank of Japan’s latest Summary of Opinions. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) reiterated that it will only consider future rate hikes if its economic and price forecasts are met, according to the summary from its June Monetary Policy Meeting . Japan’s leading economic index — which reflects the outlook for the coming months based on indicators such as job offers and consumer sentiment — was revised up to 104.2 in April 2025 from a preliminary estimate of 103.4. Japan’s index of coincident economic indicators—which reflects trends in factory output, employment, and retail sales—rose to 116.0 in April 2025. On the trade front, Japanese negotiator Ryosei Akazawa is reportedly preparing for his seventh trip to the US as early as June 26 to press for the removal of US tariffs. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.62% to around 3,422 on Wednesday, while the Shenzhen Component added 0.2% to 10,240, marking a third straight session of gains, and the offshore yuan weakened toward 7.17 per dollar on Wednesday, breaking a four-session winning streak. People's Bank of China injected CNY 300 billion into banks on June 25 via a one-year lending facility to maintain liquidity. Furthermore, Beijing unveiled fresh guidelines aimed at boosting domestic consumption through financial tools, with the goal of supporting employment, increasing household incomes, and stimulating broader economic growth. Investors are now turning their attention to the upcoming July Politburo meeting for potential indications of further economic stimulus. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.91% to 24,385 in early trade on Wednesday, marking gains for the fourth session and maintaining their highest level in two weeks. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.66% to 82,611 in early deals on Wednesday, rising for the second straight session, mainly driven by gains in the tech and auto sectors. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.11% at around 8,555 on Wednesday, pausing after a strong 1% rally in the previous session. The Australian dollar strengthened to around $0.650 on Wednesday, marking its third consecutive session of gains despite softer-than-expected inflation figures. Australia’s consumer prices rose by 2.1% year-on-year in May, coming in below market forecasts of a 2.3% increase and easing from a 2.4% growth in April. Core inflation also slowed to 2.4% from 2.8%, the lowest since November 2021. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended higher buoyed by cooling geopolitical tensions and a continued slide in oil prices. U.S. stock futures were flat on Wednesday following a strong session for equities, as easing geopolitical tensions and falling oil prices lifted investor sentiment: Dow +0.08% ; S&P 500 +0.06% ; Nasdaq +0.08% .

Along with the ceasefire, a few other big changes took place in global markets, creating a bullish mood for cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins. The recent price drop could have been a bottom for altcoins, and the sharp recovery since then supports this view. Indicators also hint that altcoins could soon outperform Bitcoin. Ethereum and the altcoin market are showing signs of something big brewing. After the recent sharp drop in prices, which felt like a final shakeout for many traders, market charts are starting to look very bullish. Interestingly, just like how oil prices hinted at a ceasefire before it was officially announced, crypto charts too have a habit of predicting major moves before they happen. Ethereum and Golden Cross On Crypto Banter’s Ran Show, the analyst said that Ethereum is about to form a golden cross, a technical signal where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. In the past, this pattern has led to huge price jumps for ETH, including rallies of 107%, 25%, and even an incredible 2,500%. What makes it even more exciting is that the entire altcoin market, excluding Bitcoin, is also just days away from forming its own golden cross. Historically, these moments have triggered powerful rallies in the market. With interest rates falling, market sentiment shifting, and technical signals lining up, it looks like Ethereum and altcoins might be getting ready for a strong move upward in the weeks ahead. Ethereum Short-Term Price Targets: Ethereum has seen a short rally in the past 12 hours, but it’s too early to confirm a strong recovery. Important support lies around $2,380, this level must hold to keep hopes alive for a bigger breakout. If Ethereum can push a little higher to around $2,477, it would strengthen the bullish case.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-25 06:11:38

Mnuchin said he expects the Fed to cut interest rates by a total of 75 to 100 basis points over the next 12 months. Stating that FED Chairman Jerome Powell is taking a “wait-and-see” approach, Mnuchin said that the market has already priced in this reduction and expects the decrease in interest rates to be gradual. “I think we will see a decrease in interest rates of about 100 basis points, unless there are any surprise developments,” said Mnuchin, adding that Powell's cautious approach stems from the permanent effects of inflation, which has been described as “temporary” in the past. Mnuchin said he expects Trump to announce several trade deals soon and that if progress is made in the talks, some of the tariff decisions in July could be postponed. “The tariffs that have been implemented so far have not increased inflation. This supports the market’s expectation of low interest rates,” Mnuchin said, adding that negotiations with countries such as China, India and Japan are ongoing. Related News: Company That Announced It Would Accumulate Hundreds of Millions of Dollars Worth of Solana (SOL) Suddenly Partners with a Surprise Altcoin Mnuchin, who also touched on TikTok in his speech, said that he expected the President to reach an agreement regarding the platform, and that instead of a direct sale, a solution that would involve new investors becoming partners in the company and continuing relations with ByteDance was more likely. He said that his own investment interests were currently inactive. Stating that long-term interest rates are also pricing in future FED cuts, Mnuchin said that 10-year bond yields could fall to the 4% – 4.25% range, but it is unlikely to fall below 4%. The former minister said he did not expect a serious slowdown in the economy, noting that the market was acting with this outlook. Mnuchin emphasized the importance of the “big tax package” expected to pass the Senate, arguing that extending the Trump-era tax cuts was critical for the market. Mnuchin, who acknowledged that long-term debt and deficits were a serious issue, said that deficits could be brought under control if economic growth remained around 3%, otherwise cuts in public spending would be inevitable. *This is not investment advice.

The special-purpose acquisition company merger route comes as more crypto-native companies explore public listings amid increasing regulatory clarity in the U.S. ProCap’s planned listing joins several digital asset firms seeking market legitimacy through public offerings. As part of the process, Columbus Circle and ProCap will submit a registration statement to the SEC, including a joint prospectus and proxy materials. Investors and stakeholders are encouraged to review those filings once available. Pompliano, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, has positioned ProCap as a pure-play on BTC’s future as institutional demand grows. With significant capital raised and a clear focus on Bitcoin-native financial services, the firm is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched crypto listings of 2025.

As it typically happens when the hype goes crazy, so does the underlying asset’s price, which is the only double-digit gainer from the top 100 alts. Ever since it officially saw the light of day in February this year, the PI token has been the subject of enhanced attention due to the controversy linked to the project behind it. Although the first few weeks were quite spectacular in terms of adoption, as many exchanges rushed to list it, and price-wise, the following months have been quite disappointing. The adoption curve has flattened, and there’s no actual big news coming from a large exchange that wants to list it despite community votes and blatant hints . There was another disappointment last month when the Core Team teased a major announcement, and the community thought it would be a green light from Binance. However, it turned out to be a $100 million fund dedicated to investing in projects within the Pi Network ecosystem. Six weeks later, the rumors are back on. One of the most popular Pi Network-focused channels on X has cited another post questioning whether a listing on a tier 1 crypto exchange is coming. Top exchanges coming soon? pic.twitter.com/8xKVPrDLSn — Pi News (@PiNewsMedia) June 24, 2025 Binance is at the forefront as the company has engaged on a couple of times in the past with the PI community, as mentioned above. It held a community vote to determine how many of its users want to see the token on the platform, but failed to follow through even though the results were overwhelmingly in favor . The other options listed in the post are HTX, Kraken, OKX, and Coinbase. Bybit is expectedly missing since its CEO previously called the Pi Network project a “scam.” Although these rumors are just that for the time being, the native token has experienced a massive resurgance in the past 24 hours. PI has soared by over 12% and sits at a multi-week peak of over $0.6 now. PI Token Price.

While Cardano (ADA) continues to hold its ground, it’s this new DeFi coin that’s turning heads with rapid ecosystem growth and an accelerating community behind it. Presale of Mutuum Finance is in 40% sold out in Phase 5 with MUTM available for a mere $0.03. Mutuum Finance presale has attracted over 12,400 investors. More than $11.1 million has been raised. For those searching for the best crypto to buy in 2025, early signs suggest Mutuum Finance could be a breakout waiting to happen. The token’s recent surge and increasing on-chain activity have led some analysts to speculate a potential 10x move may not be far off, especially as broader crypto sentiment improves heading into Q3. Cardano (ADA) Short-Term Outlook Today, Cardano is trading at $0.58 after pulling back and forth at levels of $0.56 and $0.61 in-between market moves. The technical analysis shows a neutral to a bearish structure, as the 50 and 200-day moving averages are pointed down that means that ADA may continue to trade within the range below the major resistance around the price of $0.66. Although, there are certain estimates that a minor recovery could propel ADA to levels of $0.66 and even $0.70 over the next month, a further rise will only be possible once new drivers, namely, positive sentiment or ecosystem developments occur. At least, by the moment, ADA seems to be readied to be consolidated and wait until it can be pushed to go further, as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is starting to attract close attention on the part of traders. Revolutionizing DeFi with a Proven Dual-Lending Formula In comparison with ordinary DeFi protocols, Mutuum Finance will be the first to try to build a hybrid lending system that will have opportunities to meet the requirements of users with passive and sophisticated users. In Peer-to-Contract (P2C), clients meet the requirements of any investor who wishes to own passive income by depositing his USDT into the smart contract pools which provide stable passive income on the basis of an interest rate which it estimates up and down as the market demands. In Peer-to-Peer (P2P), experienced users can take advantage of this model where both borrowers and lenders are in complete control of establishing the terms, which is ideal to handle volatile assets. The two-model design provides the maximum flexibility, control, and risk management so that a given DeFi framework can be provided compared to original traditional lending protocols. Mutuum Finance Presale Booms with 12,400+ Investors and $11.1M Raised Mutuum Finance is a DeFi protocol that is making waves in the market since it has raised more than $11.1 million and had more than 12,400 investors supporting it so far. Such a momentum is a testimony of this growing trust in the long-term project vision and the role that it would take in revolutionizing the decentralized finance market. MUTM tokens are priced at $0.03 and are currently in phase 5. As the price will be raised to $0.035 in Phase 6, current buyers will be able to make 100% of profit upon launch when the token will begin to trade for $0.06. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly outshining other altcoins under $1, including Cardano (ADA), as a top pick for 10x potential in the next 100 days. With $11.1 million raised and 12,400+ investors, the presale is gaining serious momentum. Priced at $0.03 in Phase 5, early buyers are set for 100% ROI at launch. Don’t wait, this opportunity is moving fast.

LINK under $20 seen as undervalued before next breakout. Cardano stabilizing near $0.50 with $2 target ahead. The altcoin market is showing early signs of strength, with Chainlink and Cardano emerging as key projects to watch. While not final bull market targets, both assets are flashing bullish signals as market conditions improve. According to analyst Dan, this is the ideal time for investors to prepare, with technical charts, risk models, and market sentiment beginning to align in favor of a breakout for these two altcoins. Chainlink: Pre-Bull Market Stage? In one of the latest developments, Chainlink’s new deal with Mastercard will allow over 3 billion Mastercard users to buy cryptocurrencies directly on-chain. This is a huge step toward mainstream adoption and could boost Chainlink’s long-term value. Despite this big news, Chainlink’s price remains under $20, far below its all-time high of $55 reached in 2021. The analyst said that this makes LINK one of the most undervalued cryptocurrencies in the market today.

Projects like XRP, Solana and Angry Pepe Fork are looking extremely bullish going into Q3, while meme coins like Little Pepe, Shiba Inu and Pepe are rebuilding momentum after a bearish June performance. Investors looking for the best altcoins of 2025 need to keep a sharp eye on Solana, XRP, Angry Pepe Fork and Little Pepe, with each offering unique applications and strong potential returns. That said, Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin could still recover, offering steady returns for investors who remain bullish despite their recent declines. Angry Pepe Fork is Disrupting The Meme Coin Market As classic meme coins like Pepe Coin and Shiba Inu continue to lose momentum, Angry Pepe Fork is taking the spotlight. Angry Pepe Fork is rebranding the meme coin term, combining fantastic utility with a meme coin’s ability to go viral. This combination has made Angry Pepe Fork a standout project that’s quickly building a loyal fan base. One of Angry Pepe Fork’s most appealing features is its income-generating opportunities. Throughout the project’s presale, investors can optimize their returns by staking tokens, earning investor rewards and taking part in the project’s CommunityFi system. This system rewards investors who help to promote Angry Pepe Fork. The more attention they create, the more rewards they can generate. This focus on revenue opportunities is set to be expanded post-launch with Angry Pepe Fork’s GambleFi platform. The platform will be the first linked to a meme coin and will host a wide selection of on-chain mini-games where players can wager $APORK and win prizes. Post-presale, the Angry Pepe Fork developers will also focus on cross-chain expansion. The project will look to expand to the Binance and Ethereum blockchains, reducing fees, bringing deeper liquidity and growing community reach in the process. This focus on long-term development is further exacerbated by Angry Pepe Fork’s deflationary tokenomics. The project has a fixed $APORK supply of 1.9 billion tokens, some of which will be burned during transactions. This will decrease the supply while increasing demand, driving up the price in the process. $APORK tokens are currently experiencing huge demand, with tokens selling for just $0.0269. With a myriad of opportunities for investors, a long-term roadmap and community-focused approach, Angry Pepe Fork is on track to become a standout altcoin in the second half of 2025. Can Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Cause as Much Disruption As Pepe? Although the hype around meme coins like Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin faded during the recent market crash, Little Pepe is bringing the hype back to the market. Built on its own Layer 2 blockchain, Little Pepe is quickly becoming a standout project offering greater security and stability than classic meme coins. The first stage of the Little Pepe presale was an astounding success, with $300,000 being raised in the first 48 hours at just $0.001 per token. Little Pepe has since increased to $0.0011 during stage two of its presale, with rumours suggesting that prices could reach as high as $0.003 once Little Pepe is listed on major exchanges. This would equal a 172% return for investors who get involved today, making Little Pepe a highly lucrative opportunity. In addition to its potential returns, the Little Pepe developers have announced a $777,000 giveaway, with ten lucky winners walking away with $77,000 worth of Little Pepe tokens. While Little Pepe offers outstanding meme coin potential, some investors argue that it lacks the utility of altcoins like Solana and XRP, and could fall behind utility-backed meme coins like Angry Pepe Fork. Nonetheless, Little Pepe could offer strong returns in Q3 as its presale momentum snowballs. Shiba Inu Sees A 5% Rally Shiba Inu has gained overnight momentum, increasing by 5.11% in the last 24 hours. This bullish momentum has been fueled by several updates including an innovative new Shibarium update. The upgrade will bolster the Shiba Inu ecosystem by improving privacy, decreasing the risk of censorship and enhancing resiliency. At the time of writing Shiba Inu was trading at $0.00001080 with daily trading volume down 13%. This suggests that fewer Shiba Inu investors are selling tokens which could trigger additional bullish momentum going into July. Pepe Crashes 36% In June Pepe Coin was one of the worst-performing meme coins in June, crashing a staggering 36% in 30 days. This led to thousands of investors selling their Pepe Coins, with many diversifying their portfolios to mitigate losses. Pepe is now trading at $0.000008897 following a recent increase in momentum after Elon Musk posted a Pepe meme on X . While this is yet to result in any positive price action, it brought much-needed attention back to Pepe Coin, which could result in additional rallies over the next month. Nonetheless, meme coins like Shiba Inu and Angry Pepe Fork remain higher-potential alternatives. Could Solana’s New Partnership Trigger A Price Rally? As Pepe Coin struggles to build momentum, Solana has announced another development: a partnership with Kazakhstan to build Central Asia’s first Blockchain Economic Zone. This partnership would begin with a Solana Economic Zone, making Kazakhstan a regional blockchain hub designed to promote Solana, Web3 technology and global talent in the Web3 space. The announcement, made on Solana’s official X account , emphasized that this new partnership is Solana’s first in Central Asia. The deal is similar to the Crypto Centre model within the Dubai Multi Commodity Centre (DMCC) and could have a significant impact on Solana and Kazakhstan’s future economy. While the announcement could have huge implications for Solana’s future, Solana’s price has remained steady at $134.10 following a 3.8% daily increase . XRP ETF Approval Chances Reach 95% XRP continues to be one of the market’s most talked-about altcoins. Its price has seen huge fluctuations in 2025, with XRP currently trading at $2.00 . Recent data from Bloomberg analysts suggests that the likelihood of XRP ETF approval could now be as high as 95%. This bullish prediction comes following the formal acknowledgement of 19b-4 filings, direct commentary between the SEC and ETF sponsors, and increasing alignment with crypto laws following XRP’s legal victory in 2023. An XRP ETF could pave the way for other altcoins such as Solana and Cardano, potentially triggering huge price rallies for altcoins and meme coins such as Shiba Inu and Angry Pepe Fork in Q3.

On one hand, the government imposes a steep 30% tax on crypto gains, prohibits offsetting losses, and enforces a 1% TDS on every crypto transaction. On the other hand, it hasn’t outright banned digital assets, leaving the sector stuck between regulation and uncertainty. Mixed Signals From India’s Crypto Policy India’s crypto industry is divided. While Raj Kapoor , CEO of the India Blockchain Alliance, believes strict rules are better than ambiguity, many crypto players argue for reform. Local exchanges are pushing for: Reducing TDS from 1% to 0.01% Allowing losses to be offset against gains However, with rising concerns about tax evasion and cybercrime, authorities are hesitant to embrace liberal crypto policies just yet. Indian Tax Authorities Are Watching Crypto Traders Closely The Indian Income Tax Department has issued notices to thousands of individuals who traded digital assets but failed to report them in the FY 2022–23 and 2023–24 tax filings. Authorities suspect that some traders used crypto as a tool for tax evasion, exploiting the lack of detailed reporting standards during the early days of regulation. Crypto traders must now correct their filings using the updated return option. CoinDCX Co-founder Sumit Gupta has advised all users to report crypto income, including earnings from airdrops or global exchanges, and emphasized the need to stay compliant. India’s Crypto Tax Rules: A Barrier to Growth? India’s current crypto tax policy includes: 30% capital gains tax on digital assets No loss offset allowed 1% TDS on transactions exceeding Rs. 10,000 Due to these tough regulations, top global exchanges like OKX have exited the Indian market. Even homegrown platforms feel the pressure, urging policymakers to reconsider the TDS rate and revise the tax structure to promote growth and investment. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Income Tax Department Takes Strict Action Against Undisclosed Crypto Income , Crypto Crime Rising in India: A Key Concern India’s reluctance to ease crypto regulations stems in part from the rise in crypto-linked cybercrimes. Recently, the CBI arrested Rahul Arora , seizing over $327,000 in crypto tied to scams in the U.S. and Canada . In February , the GainBitcoin scam led to raids on 60 locations and the seizure of $2.9 million in digital assets — a case involving over $800 million in fraud. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has now built in-house systems to track and seize crypto, signaling the government’s focus on creating a safer crypto environment before relaxing policies. Final Take: India Isn’t Crypto-Unfriendly, But It’s Cautious India isn’t against crypto, but it’s not fully embracing it either. With tax notices being sent, foreign platforms exiting, and cybercrimes increasing, the focus remains on compliance and safety rather than rapid liberalization. Until India establishes a robust regulatory framework, a truly crypto-friendly economy might remain out of reach. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Meanwhile, a bevy of tech stocks like Palantir, Nvidia, and Oracle are flying high. Is the BTC bull market over? Or can BTC still hit the $150K – $200K price predictions for 2025, recently made by popular crypto investing commentators? Crypto exchanges are dynamic, fast-moving, open, global markets for these high tech Internet currencies. So no one knows for sure what Bitcoin’s price will do next until markets have moved. But there are some clues and historical patterns that savvy currency traders and investors use to decide what and when to buy, sell, and hold. The daily movements in June’s Bitcoin prices have confounded the bullish 12-month and 24-month trend. Here’s a quick rundown of Bitcoin vs. selected tech stocks in June. Bitcoin Severely Lags Tech Stocks in June 2025 For the 30 days ending Tuesday, Jun. 24, Bitcoin fell more than 2%. But global trade policy and military instability aren’t weighing on several important US tech stocks. Santa Clara, California-based computer chipmaker Nvidia, for example, the second highest-weighted US stock by market size, gained over 9.15% in share prices. Meanwhile, Denver, Colorado-based US data company Palantir, gained over 19.84%. Oracle, another high-tech data company, based in Nashville, Tennessee, and ranked #17 among all US companies by size, surged 32.5% for the 30-day window by market close on Tuesday. All three companies are ultra-high market cap with many useful points of comparison to Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency. They’ve been rallying, while BTC retraces its April and May gains. So is the crypto rally fizzling out? Bitcoin Price Rainbow Chart Recommends ‘BUY!’ Many experts don’t think so. A bear market in Bitcoin any time soon also does not align with the historical trend. Source: Bitbo.io According to the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart, a popular trading recommendation tool based on Bitcoin’s historical price trend, the price appears far from its multi-year cycle peak. In fact, it is comparable on the rainbow chart to previous markets like Nov. 2020 and May 2017. The May 2017 market valued BTC at $1,434 per token on May 1. By Dec. 17, 2017, the price had skyrocketed to just above $20,000, for a 1,400% ROI in under 9 months. The Nov. 2020 market appraised Bitcoin at $13,862 on Nov. 1. By Apr. 15, 2021, the price rallied to $62,208, for a 450% ROI in under 6 months. Legendary veteran stock market chart trader Peter Brandt expects Bitcoin to move as high as $150,00 by August or September. In an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box in May, Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz said he expects the price to top out above $150,000 before this cycle is over.

The proposed Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF plans to allocate 75% to Bitcoin and 25% to Ethereum , offering investors exposure to both cryptocurrencies through a single product. Crypto.com has been appointed as the ETF's exclusive custodian, prime execution agent, and provider of staking and liquidity services . The ETF's launch is contingent upon the SEC's approval of both the registration statement and a rule change application. If approved, the ETF will be listed on the NYSE Arca exchange. This initiative is part of Trump Media's broader strategy to integrate cryptocurrency into its business model. In May, the company announced plans to raise $2.5 billion to establish a Bitcoin treasury, reflecting its commitment to digital assets. However, the move has sparked controversy due to potential conflicts of interest, as President Trump actively promotes cryptocurrency while his company engages in related financial ventures. Critics argue that this intertwining of political influence and personal business interests could undermine regulatory integrity. The SEC's decision on the ETF is pending, and its outcome could significantly impact the intersection of politics and cryptocurrency investment in the United States.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-06-25 07:26:38

In a recent video, analyst Edward Farina made a comparison, claiming that buying XRP at this level is like buying Bitcoin when it was under $100. Farina warns that many traders are trying to time the market by selling now and hoping to buy back at lower prices, a strategy he thinks will backfire for 95% of them. “The breakout doesn’t wait for your plan,” he warned. Buying $XRP at $2 is the equivalent of buying BTC below $100. And most people are trying to sell now to ""buy back lower."" That’s exactly how 95% will be priced out. The breakout doesn’t wait for your plan. pic.twitter.com/I0FQFdbDhb — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 25, 2025 Drawing from his own experience in 2019-2020, Farina admitted he repeatedly lost out while attempting to outsmart the market. He sees the same pattern unfolding today, with many XRP holders recently selling below $2, convinced a deeper crash was coming. Some even placed buy orders anticipating a 30–70% drop, only to watch the market sharply reverse and turn green, leaving them on the sidelines. With influential figures like Arthur Britto resurfacing and several bullish catalysts emerging around XRP, it could be on the verge of a major breakout. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For June 25 , The Cold Wallet Strategy Farina advised keeping 90% of XRP in a cold wallet to avoid emotional selling and said to use only 10% for trading. His number one rule is to “ Never sell your core XRP bag .” According to him, XRP is the only asset that could “ skyrocket overnight .” A single catalyst, like an official Swift partnership or a major central bank announcement, could send the price soaring. In such a scenario, those who sold XRP to save 20 or 30 cents might find themselves permanently priced out of the market. XRP Under $2 Is a “Gift” Analyst DustyBC says that XRP under $2 is a rare opportunity, predicting the market will look back by December 2025 and recognize its value. Crypto Bitlord agrees, calling XRP under $2 a gift, and has set a $7 target. He believes XRP may never dip below $2 again . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This major update brings a powerful lineup of new features and critical bug fixes that significantly enhance the Ledger’s functionality, scalability, and regulatory readiness. Mayukha Vadari, a respected XRPL contributor, hailed the release as “possibly the best single lineup of amendments we’ve ever had in one release,” underscoring the depth and importance of the changes introduced. Escrow Support for IOUs and Issued Tokens One of the standout features in XRPL v2.5.0 is Token Escrow, a new amendment that extends XRPL’s native escrow capabilities beyond XRP to include IOUs and MPTs (Multi-Purpose Tokens). Written and designed by Denis Angell, this feature enables issuers to lock non-XRP assets into smart escrow contracts, allowing for time-based or conditional transfers of a wide range of tokens. This enhancement significantly enhances the tokenization capabilities of XRPL, offering. new possibilities for DeFi and real-world asset management on the ledger. Possibly the best single lineup of amendments we've ever had in one release. Features: – Token Escrow adds support for IOUs and MPTs to the native Escrow primitive (written and designed by @angell_denis ) – Batch adds the ability to group multiple transactions and execute them… https://t.co/9aF3Wa0Qug — Mayukha Vadari (@msvadari) June 25, 2025 Transaction Batching for Atomic Execution Another significant addition is Batch, a feature that allows developers to group multiple transactions and execute them atomically, meaning either all succeed or none do. This is a vital tool for ensuring transactional consistency, particularly in complex operations such as automated trading, bridging, or multi-step contract execution. The feature provides developers with greater flexibility and reliability in decentralized application design. Permissioned DEX: Compliance-Ready Trading The update also introduces Permissioned DEX, an innovative amendment that enables the creation of decentralized exchanges with built-in access controls. This means issuers can restrict who can trade certain assets, an essential capability for institutions or projects operating in regulated environments. By combining decentralization with compliance, this feature positions XRPL as a serious contender in the institutional DeFi space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Advanced Account Management with Permission Delegation Permission Delegation is another key feature in version 2.5.0, enabling account holders to delegate specific permissions to other accounts. This functionality supports more secure and flexible account management. It is particularly useful for enterprise use cases, allowing for multi-user access models, automated operations, and improved wallet security through role separation. Bug Fixes Strengthen Protocol Integrity Alongside the major features, the update resolves several critical issues. The AMMv1_3 fix, developed by Gcam Sid, enhances the automated market maker functionality with additional invariant checks to prevent transaction anomalies. EnforceNFTokenTrustlineV2, contributed by Vlad, ensures NFTs cannot bypass trustline authorization, tightening asset security. Lastly, PayChanCancelAfter, another fix by Denis Angell, corrects a flaw allowing payment channels to be created with expired time conditions. A Major Step Forward for XRPL With version 2.5.0, the XRP Ledger takes a bold step forward in advancing decentralization , regulatory compatibility, and real-world usability. The collaborative effort behind this release, with contributions from some of the most active developers in the ecosystem, reflects a maturing and forward-looking community. As highlighted by Mayukha Vadari, this release is more than just a version bump; it’s a landmark moment in XRPL’s evolution, laying the foundation for a more dynamic, secure, and inclusive blockchain future.

While Cardano (ADA) holds steady as a long-term Layer 1 play, a lesser-known altcoin is sparking serious FOMO, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at $0.03, some analysts are already whispering top token of the summer. The project is in phase 5 of its presale which has already sold out over 40%. Mutuum Finance has raised more than $11.1 million and attracted over 12,400 holders. More than just hype, the project is backed by a strong DeFi narrative, early adoption metrics, and a rapidly growing community. If you’re wondering what’s the best crypto to buy in 2025 while still early, Mutuum Finance might just be the one you’re regretting not grabbing now. Cardano Eyes Stabilization Amid Leios Upgrade Momentum Cardano is trading at around $0.56 and is in a tight range around the support. The latest technical engagement reveals that ADA has fallen by circa 4 percent on reasonably high turnover and is now trading marginally past the $0.56-$0.58 area as the markets seek to absorb any anxiety concerning macro and crypto sentiments across the globe. The next Leios protocol upgrade, which is due to improve the scalability and throughput, is closely monitored by the investor, which could become one of the catalysts in case the contemporary consolidation persists. The short-term momentum is kept at bay, and the main resistance is ahead in the $0.65-$0.70 region; Cardano is in a critical situation in which maintaining the current support has all the potential to lead to a significant uptrend, and any loss of ground might be met with other significant lows. Meanwhile, new altcoins such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) keep rising on the sidelines. Mutuum Finance Presale Enters Phase 5 As Investor Interest Skyrockets Mutuum Finance is gaining strong momentum in Phase 5 of its presale. Growing into a contender in DeFi the project stands out from its competitors by offering a scalable inflation-proof system of finance with real-world practical application. Investor interest is picking up speed with the project already having garnered more than $11.1 million and counting more than 12,400 token holders. A New DeFi Lending Model with Full Asset Ownership Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial liquidity protocol with users retaining their full ownership of assets while they participate in decentralized lending. The project uses a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending for enhanced flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system makes use of smart contracts to offer automated lending without any human intervention and in its place the smart contracts respond to the market by offering dynamic interest rates. Through this auto mechanism, lenders’ and borrowers’ world becomes stabilized and predictable. Peer-to-Peer model on the other hand employs no intermediaries and thus offers a direct link among lenders and borrowers. This method is very dear to participants in dealing with volatile assets, where personalized conditions and flexibility are required. Such lending protocols provide start-to-end seamless DeFi experience that is perfectly tailored to the needs of the user and which is safer, transparent, and more customizable than other centralized lending products. Fully Collateralized Stablecoin and CertiK-Verified Security In addition to its lending innovation, Mutuum Finance is also developing the fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Mutuum Finance is based on trust and security. The project smart contracts are rigorously audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security companies. In addition to ensuring the integrity and transparency of the code base this audit also proves that the team is dedicated to building a secure DeFi protocol. Mutuum Finance is gaining serious traction, raising $11.1M+ with over 12,400 holders and 40% of its presale already sold in Phase 5. Alongside Cardano’s steady momentum ahead of its Leios upgrade, both ADA and MUTM offer high-upside potential. Act now to join early.

The requirements would serve as the entry threshold According to a report by news outlet Hexun, Hong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive, Eddie Yue, mentioned a number of requirements that applicants will need to fulfill if they wish to register for an stablecoin issuer license. He also made it clear that participation in the government’s “sandbox program” is not a pre-requisite, nor is it a guarantee that firms taking part in it will receive licenses. Yue revealed that the first batch of stablecoins will focus on cross-border trade and web3 applications. “In the face of the current environment, we need to remain resilient. Hong Kong has strong foreign exchange reserves and high liquidity as a buffer,” said Yue. So far, there are more than 40 applications taking part in the region’s stablecoin sandbox program, which include major players including JD CoinChain Technology, Yuanbi Innovation Technology, and a consortium consisting of Ant Group , Standard Chartered and Hong Kong Telecom through Animoca Brands . The institutions in the sandbox program have tested their respective stablecoin issuance processes and business models in a controlled environment. You might also like: Hong Kong to start issuing stablecoin licenses, with Ant Group and JD.com already in line According to Yue, only a handful of licenses will be granted during the initial phase. He said that license applicants will need to propose specific business plans that can be realistically implementable. Not only that, they also need to demonstrate practical scenarios where it can be applied. Applicants will also need focus on their reserve management capabilities. According to the report, the license holder must have a capital reserve of at least $25 million HKD and must prove its ability to continue operating. “It is worth mentioning that if the applicant is an “authorized institution” such as a bank, the $25 million HKD capital requirement can be exempted,” said Yue. They will also need to prioritize and showcase compliance systems such as anti-money laundering systems as well as other security measures. Previously, the Hong Kong Financial Secretary announced that regulators will start to issue the first batch of stablecoin issuer licenses within the next few months. The new Stablecoins Ordinance, which comes into effect on August 1, mandates that entities must obtain an issuer license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

According to the exchange, it assisted the federal agency in tracing the millions in crypto transactions from the illicit wallets . Last week, US Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Shawn Bradstreet even confirmed that seizure of $225.3 million in funds marked the largest cryptocurrency seizure in US Secret Service history. The US Secret Service investigated the scam case with the Federal Bureau of Investigation In December 2023, Tether froze roughly $225 million worth of USDT in self-custodial wallets , believing the assets were tied to a human trafficking organization behind the “pig butchering” romance scam. Typically, “Pig butchering” involved fraudsters posing as successful crypto investors on social media to lure victims into opening accounts and making fake investment deposits with promises of high returns. The US Secret Service took on the case, working alongside the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the US Attorney’s Office, and uncovered dozens of victims in the US and more than 400 victims worldwide. The federal agents reportedly used blockchain analysis and other investigative techniques to determine whether the crypto funds were connected to theft and money laundering. Moreover, per their investigations, hundreds of thousands of blockchain transactions were made to obscure the origin of the stolen crypto. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges, said it played a role in tracing the stolen crypto assets and helped pinpoint victims entitled to restitution. It commented, “Coinbase team members conducted a multi-day effort to trace millions in cryptocurrency transactions back from illicit wallets to the sends from our platform and analyze account activity to flag victims.” Coinbase also asked that anyone who believed they were duped into investing in the scam file a claim with the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center. Pig butchering and address poisoning scams increased significantly in 2024 According to a Chainalysis report, scam cases involving pig butchering, address poisoning , crypto drainers, livestream, and blackmail scams grew astoundingly in 2024. Pig butchering revenue increased 40% and deposits to pig butchering scams surged nearly 210% from 2023. However, the average deposit amount to pig butchering scams dropped 55% year-over-year, hinting at a play change. Scammers might prioritize volume, accepting smaller payouts in exchange for scamming more people. In 2024, crypto drainers also saw close to a 170% revenue growth, about a 55% rise in deposit size, and a 75% growth in the number of deposits from 2023. One of the key draining cases last year involved one scammer taking on the name of the US Securities and Exchange Commission to dupe unsuspecting investors into claiming fake tokens through an airdrop. Additionally, address poisoning scams drew in more crypto, more than a 15000% rise since 2023, most of it coming from a single attack in May. An unknown whale nearly lost $68 million in wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on the Ethereum blockchain on May 3rd. Luckily, the attacker returned the funds to the victim. The report also showed that address poisoning scammers targeted users with higher-than-average wallet balances. Meanwhile, Tether clarified that it had frozen over $2.7 billion in USDT tied to illegal activity since its launch, hinting at crypto attackers’ preference to convert stolen crypto to stablecoins.

According to a June 25 report from local media Economic Review, eight of South Korea ’s top banks are working with the Open Blockchain and DID Association and the Financial Settlement Institute to build a stablecoin venture. Participating banks include KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Woori, Nonghyup, Industrial Bank of Korea, Suhyup, Citibank Korea, and SC First Bank. The project aims to issue a stablecoin backed by the Korean won and reduce the dominance of dollar-based digital assets.

It also noted that the initiative is in response to growing concerns within the banking sector about losing ground to foreign-issued stablecoins in the domestic market. “There is a shared sense of crisis that if things continue this way, foreign dollar coins could dominate the domestic market,” a bank official reportedly said. “It is time to secure both the independence and competitiveness of the domestic financial system through a won-based digital currency.” KB Kookmin, South Korea’s largest bank and a member of the new consortium, has also filed trademarks related to stablecoin symbols as part of the joint initiative, according to the Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Service. While the exact method of issuance has yet to be finalized, the banks are said to be reviewing two stablecoin models including a trust-based structure and a deposit-linked approach, both designed to ensure full 1:1 backing with the Korean won. The launch is expected by late 2025 or early 2026, pending regulatory approval. Meanwhile, South Korean Democrats are also pushing for a faster rollout of government-issued won-pegged stablecoins, with a similar goal of strengthening the national fiat and boosting global demand for won-backed assets.

FalconX, a leading institutional crypto trading and prime brokerage platform, has joined Lynq , a real-time interest-bearing settlement network, as a launch partner and is already integrating with Lynq via API in preparation for the launch. “FalconX will be a driving force to help unlock liquidity for the network,” said Jerald David, CEO of Lynq. “We have already started working with their team and will be offering our mutual clients a compliant solution that meets the need of institutional market participants.” For FalconX, the move follows other major developments, including a partnership with global banking group Standard Chartered and the acquisition of a majority stake in the parent company of Monarq Asset Management. For Lynq, the addition of FalconX follows key integrations by industry leaders like Crypto.com— the first exchange to integrate with the platform— and Fireblocks, which now provides access to Lynq for over 2,000 institutional clients through its interface.

The recent uptick appears supported by improving network fundamentals and a shift in sentiment. According to DeFiLlama data , the network’s on-chain growth has been accelerating. Monthly decentralized exchange volume on Aptos ( APT ) has climbed steadily, from $690 million in January to $2.9 billion in May. It has already surpassed $3.46 billion with 6 days remaining in June. At the same time, the total stablecoin market cap on the network has more than doubled, rising from about $650 million at the start of the year to over $1.4 billion. While total value locked has dipped slightly from May’s high of $1.28 billion, it remains solid at around $1 billion. Activity on the network is also picking up. Weekly active addresses in June are averaging close to 1 million, rebounding sharply from April’s low of 644,000. This expansion suggests that more users and developers are engaging with the network.

Although momentum indicators are still mixed, positive signs are emerging. APT price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The relative strength index is at a neutral 52.78, and the MACD has flipped into a buy signal. Bulls are also benefiting from shorter-term moving averages, as the price is currently above the 10-, 20-, and 30-day averages. The longer-term and 50-day averages continue to act as resistance.

This outlook is based on a combination of historical chart patterns, specific technical triggers, and a market structure that appears to be mirroring previous explosive cycles. What Historical Pattern Is Fueling the Bullish Outlook? Prominent analyst Ash Crypto has fueled the discussion by sharing a chart that highlights a repeating market pattern. According to his analysis, powerful altcoin rallies have historically been preceded by a significant drop in altcoin market dominance, followed by a sharp and sustained recovery. Ash Crypto’s analysis suggests that the current market structure is eerily similar to past cycles where altcoin season kicked off after an extended consolidation.

The recovery rally has pushed BTC into a critical supply zone around $106,500–$107,000, a level that previously triggered multiple rejections. While intraday momentum remains positive, indicators now suggest a potential cooldown phase unless bulls reclaim control with stronger volume. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC/USD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Bitcoin price action has entered a narrow consolidation range after reclaiming the $106K level. The current structure on the 4-hour chart shows BTC retesting the upper Bollinger Band, with price hovering near $106,300 and capped by the upper limit at $107,966. The price remains well above the 20/50/100/200 EMA cluster, with the 20 EMA at $104,342 now acting as dynamic support.

On June 24, NEWT was officially listed on Binance, marking the token’s Token Generation Event. It was quickly followed by spot listings on Coinbase , Bybit, Upbit, MEXC, Gate.io, KuCoin, Bithumb, and Bitget. The TGE established a fixed total supply of 1 billion NEWT tokens. Of this, 100 million NEWT was allocated to early users of the Kaito/NEWT ecosystem, including snapshot participants and active users on partner platforms. This airdrop, managed by the Magic Newton Foundation, was fully unlocked and claimable starting June 24. In addition, 12.5 million NEWT or 1.25% of the total supply was distributed to Binance users who held BNB in Simple Earn, Locked Earn, or the BNB Vault between June 14 and 17, 2025. These tokens were also fully unlocked at TGE and credited directly to eligible users’ spot wallets. Following the TGE, the token initially rallied, surging by 67% from its launch price of $0.49 to $0.82 within hours. However, the trend quickly reversed with NEWT falling 44% to $0.46, likely due to immediate profit-taking from airdrop recipients. Such post-airdrop sell-offs are common in early-stage token markets and often result in short-term volatility.

According to the project’s official disclosures, 60% of the total NEWT supply has been earmarked for community-focused initiatives, including ecosystem development, user incentives, and growth programs. The Magic Newton Foundation is responsible for governing these allocations and issuing quarterly transparency reports. All team and contributor allocations are subject to a 12-month lock-up, followed by 36 months of linear vesting, ensuring that internal stakeholders cannot immediately sell their holdings. What is Newton Protocol? Newton Protocol is a ZK-powered on-chain automation infrastructure developed by Magic Labs, a Web3 infrastructure company known for pioneering embedded wallet technology and serving as the founding development team behind Newton. Magic Labs plays a critical role in developing the protocol’s verifiable automation framework, contributing the core open-source codebase and leading ecosystem design through its affiliated entity, the Magic Newton Foundation. The protocol enables secure task delegation to AI agents using verifiable automation, combining Trusted Execution Environments and zero-knowledge proofs to ensure every action is cryptographically proven to follow user instructions. “Our number one priority is making verifiable automation accessible via a system built on fairness that users can count on,” Mohammad Akhavannik, Managing Director at Magic Newton Foundation, told crypto.news. NEWT serves as the utility and governance token within the Newton ecosystem, powering validator staking, automation fee payments, access control updates, and governance participation. Earlier this year, Newton raised roughly $90 million from notable backers including PayPal Ventures, Polygon, and Magic Eden to build out its infrastructure and accelerate ecosystem adoption.

It issued 54 million new shares on Wednesday following the exercise of 540,000 stock acquisition rights, representing 29% of the total rights issued. The issue is the first major capital injection under the plan and represents 10% of the full target. Metaplanet stock slumped as much as 15% before rallying strongly to close up 4%. CEO Simon Gerovich emphasized the strategic milestone with a post on X, highlighting the strong start to the program.

According to a June 24 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the ETF, proposed under the ticker symbol B.T., would hold 75% of its assets in Bitcoin and 25% in Ethereum. The product is structured as a commodity-based trust, with Yorkville America Digital named as sponsor and Crypto.com’s affiliated trust entity, Foris DAX Trust Company, acting as custodian for both crypto assets. The ETF aims to provide a simplified, single-ticker exposure to the two largest digital assets by market capitalization. If approved, it would trade on NYSE Arca and offer retail and institutional investors access to spot Bitcoin and Ethereum markets through traditional brokerage platforms. The latest Form 19b-4 submission follows Trump Media’s June 16 announcement that it had filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC. While the S-1 covers disclosure and structural details required for a public offering, the 19b-4 is a separate procedural step seeking regulatory approval for the product to be listed and traded on a national securities exchange. Both forms are necessary before the ETF can launch. The Form 19b-4 reiterates key elements first outlined in the S-1, including the fund’s passive investment strategy and the use of CME CF benchmark reference rates to calculate net asset value. You might also like: Trump Media files Form S-3 with U.S. SEC over $2.3B raise for Bitcoin treasury According to the filing, the fund’s Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings will be custodied in cold storage by Foris DAX Trust Company, a Crypto.com affiliate. In addition to custody, Crypto.com will also serve as the execution agent and provide staking and liquidity services to support the fund’s operations. With the 19b-4 now submitted, the SEC will begin its formal review process. The Commission has up to 240 days to make a final decision, though an initial response is typically issued within 45 days. With crypto ETFs seeing heavy demand in the U.S., Trump Media has now put forward its second offering. The earlier proposal , filed June 3 via NYSE Arca, seeks to list the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, a spot product focused solely on Bitcoin, using the same sponsor and custodian as the dual-asset fund. As of now, it remains under SEC review, with the agency’s final decision expected by Jan. 29, 2026, if all extensions are used.

Key Takeaways: Polymarket is nearing a $200M raise at a $1B valuation led by Founders Fund. Despite bans and an FBI raid, the platform continues to grow and attract major backing. With over 21,000 open markets, Polymarket has become a global hub for political and economic betting. The raise is being led by Founders Fund, the venture capital firm co-founded by billionaire investor Peter Thiel. The deal would give Polymarket “unicorn” status, a notable milestone for a company that remains inaccessible to U.S. users. Banned and Raided, Polymarket Still Draws Big Money Despite being banned domestically and targeted by federal authorities, including a November FBI search that resulted in the seizure of electronics from founder Shayne Coplan, Polymarket has continued to attract both capital and attention. The new investment follows over $100 million in prior funding, including an undisclosed $50 million round earlier in 2025. It also comes shortly after Polymarket announced a partnership with Elon Musk’s X , aimed at integrating its betting markets with commentary from Grok, X’s AI chatbot. This might be the most unexpected partnership of the year: X just teamed up with Polymarket. The platform that predicted Trump’s win while every poll showed 50–50. But this isn’t just a partnership… It's the death of traditional media. Here’s why it changes EVERYTHING: pic.twitter.com/gh2y2Ho601 — Ricardo (@Ric_RTP) June 7, 2025 Polymarket has made headlines for its rapid growth, especially during the 2024 U.S. presidential election. At its peak in November, trading volume reached $2.5 billion, fueled by speculation on political and geopolitical events. The platform allows users to bet on topics ranging from global conflicts and economic trends to legislation and local politics. Recent markets include predictions on a potential U.S. recession, the odds of Israel striking Iran again, and the likelihood of the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act becoming law , currently sitting at 87% according to the site. According to its analytics dashboard , Polymarket hosts more than 21,000 open markets, with 1.2 million traders, 20 million open positions, and $700 million in active trading volume. Data from Dune Analytics shows May’s monthly trading volume at $1.1 billion, down from the November peak but still substantial. While its growth has been remarkable, Polymarket also faces regulatory pressure beyond the U.S., with bans or restrictions in France, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Poland, and Belgium. It has also drawn scrutiny over alleged manipulation of outcomes. The firm competes with other prediction platforms such as Kalshi, which is backed by Sequoia Capital and Y Combinator. CFTC Probes Super Bowl Contracts by Crypto.com and Kalshi In March, the CFTC announced that it is reviewing Super Bowl-related prediction contracts offered by Crypto.com and Kalshi Inc. to determine if they comply with federal derivatives laws. Crypto.com introduced its sports event trading product last year, enabling users to make predictions on high-profile events like the Super Bowl. Despite that, the CFTC has expressed concern over whether such contracts qualify as legal derivatives. In January, the agency’s five commissioners voted to initiate a 90-day review of the Super Bowl futures products, effectively extending the probe past the game’s February 9 kickoff.

Calls for the next Bitcoin bear market continue to ring loud as analysts predict lower prices. One crypto analyst, known on X as Astronomer, has taken to the platform to give investors a possible roadmap of where the cryptocurrency is headed next and where to start buying for maximum gains. Next Course Of Action After Crash Following the Bitcoin price crash, Astronomer pointed out that the price had fallen below the expected close. However, it seems that the decline was not completely over, as there could be another final drop. This could come after the market reversal that has taken hold over the last few days, presenting another buy opportunity. Related Reading: XRP Price At Risk Of 20% Crash To $1.55 If This Level Fails To Hold From here, the crypto analyst explains that there could be a reversal toward the $95,000 level, and also a possibility of a bounce toward $110,000. As a result of this, the next area of action that investors could start buying from is placed at the $97,000 level, but the price could go lower. Astronomer explains that weekend lows are usually taken out, and with this weekend low still above $97,000, the price could revisit this territory. Nevertheless, the analyst explains that those who have been sidelined throughout the rally, or those who want to begin getting into the market, the Bitcoin price at around $97,000 is a good place to start. In addition to the current market factors, the analyst also points to sentiment and geopolitics as supporting the analysis. “It’s a shame we have to take advantage of blood being shed, from what’s happening in the world, but also from the bears soon at the end of this dip,” the analyst said. Where Is The Bitcoin Price Headed? With the announcement from US President Donald Trump that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, the market has already seen a recovery, with the Bitcoin price rallying to $106,000 initially. This has already triggered a turn in the sentiment from Fear back to Greed as investors begin piling in again. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Hits New Cycle High Above 66% – How This 4-Year ATH Affects Altcoin Season In a subsequent post, Astronomer explains that missing out on the buy below $97,000 is no cause for alarm. But cautions against buying now due to fear. The analyst explains that such a move is not advisable as it could lead to losses, as buying during high euphoric times is not advisable. Given this, it is likely better to wait for a correction before going into the market. “Buying higher now during high euphoric times (especially locally), is a worse idea,” Astronomer warned. “Create good habits, create a solid plan, and stick to both.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-06-25 08:00:14

This collaboration represents a significant step toward mainstream adoption of digital assets, offering a simple, non-custodial way for users to convert fiat currency into crypto. This integration is powered by a consortium of Web3 infrastructure players. Swapper Finance serves as the platform where the service is accessible, while ZeroHash supplies the backend liquidity and onchain crypto service. Other key contributors include Shift4 Payments and XSwap. The application on Swapper is designed to be non-custodial and leverages account abstraction to enhance usability, ensuring that even those unfamiliar with blockchain can easily navigate the interface. “It was important that this solution was built for everyone, not just for crypto-natives or enthusiasts,” a Chainlink Labs spokesperson said. The user-focused design may help reduce the barriers that have traditionally hindered newcomers from participating in the crypto ecosystem. Mastercard Aims Mass Adoption Mastercard’s move fits into its broader strategy of embracing blockchain technology in a practical and accessible manner. In early 2025, the company partnered with Kraken to issue crypto debit cards across Europe and the UK. It also joined hands with MetaMask to introduce a self-custody crypto card, expanding access for users who prefer to hold their own digital assets. Earlier, in February, Mastercard reported that it had tokenized 30% of all transactions made during 2024—a sign of its increasing reliance on blockchain solutions. The collaboration with Chainlink is particularly significant because it targets everyday users, not just crypto enthusiasts. By simplifying the experience and partnering with trusted intermediaries, Mastercard aims to make crypto purchases feel as seamless as traditional online payments. Crypto Competition Heats Up Mastercard’s primary rival, Visa, has also intensified its crypto involvement. In late 2024, it teamed up with Coinbase to enable instant crypto deposits and withdrawals and launched a Web3-focused digital asset platform. It also invested in BVNK, a stablecoin payment service. Despite the growing competition, the company’s collaboration with Chainlink may prove to be a pivotal move. “There’s no doubt about it—people want to be able to easily connect to the digital assets ecosystem, and vice versa,” said Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard’s EVP of blockchain and digital assets. As access grows easier, so too may adoption.

Some lawmakers are pushing to tie its passage to the crypto market structure bill, making the pairing a potential condition for approval. The bill, officially known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, passed the Senate las t we ek with a bipar tisa n vote of 68–30. The bill is centered on creating a national regulatory framework for stablecoins to promote financial innovation while safeguarding consumer protection and financial stability. This is among the federal government’s most significant efforts to regulate stablecoins. The bill was considered by many to be a milestone in efforts to bring more clarity and legitimacy to the expanding market for digital assets. After normal legislative mechanics, the bill heads to the House, where it is expected to be taken up for debate and vote on the Senate bill. And should it pass as written, the GENIUS Act would go straight to the President for his signature. House lawmakers push to merge the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts The debate centers on the CLARITY Act . The bill creates an overarching structure for developing a cryptocurrency market, dictating how digital assets should be treated (e.g., as securities, commodities, or something else) and which federal agencies should oversee them. Whereas the GENIUS Act targets stablecoins, the CLARITY Act is meant to fill a regulatory gap for the entire crypto market, covering trading platforms, tokens, and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Republican Majority Whip Tom Emmer supports merging the two bills, arguing that stablecoin rules should be part of a broader market structure reform. The CLARITY Act has already been passed by committee markup in the House of Representatives, so it has been debated and worked on in depth. But it has not yet reached the House floor for a full vote, and the Senate has not tackled it. Combining the two bills would slow the ultimate passage of GENIUS and send it back to the Senate, perhaps to negotiate again. Yet some lawmakers maintain that a joint package would provide the US with an all-inclusive legal system for digital assets, helping to clarify regulatory uncertainty and bolster investor protections. Trump urges swift passage without changes Following the Senate’s passage of the GENIUS Act, US President Trump urged the House to pass the stablecoin bill without modification. Trump wants a clean passage of the GENIUS Act by the House of Representatives, pushing for the bill to reach his desk “ASAP.” Trump characterized the legislation as “incredible” and “pure GENIUS,” asserting confidently that this was American brilliance at its best, and they would show the world how to win with digital assets like never before. He described stablecoins as a key innovation in modern finance and signaled strong support for their regulation.

A joint statement released by the U.S. Treasury on June 24 highlighted the outcomes of their latest Financial Regulatory Working Group meeting held in London earlier this month. Digital Assets and Stablecoins in the Spotlight During the meeting, Digital finance was the major focus, with U.S. and U.K. officials sharing updates on how they’re working to regulate digital assets and stablecoins. The U.K. talked about its new Digital Securities Sandbox, a testing ground for financial innovation. Both sides looked at where their stablecoin rules stand and how they can align them. While the US has already taken a step ahead by passing the U.S. GENIUS Act , the UK is yet to decide on stablecoin rules. Moving on, they also discussed ways to improve how payments work between countries and make international financial systems more connected. By working together through global groups like the G20, they hope to create clearer rules for crypto businesses around the world. AI and Innovation Under the Lens Artificial intelligence was another key topic, with regulators on both sides recognizing its growing role in financial services. They agreed on the importance of creating flexible rules that can keep up with AI’s fast development, especially in areas like trading, lending, and customer support, while also protecting users from potential risks. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Tax Rules in India Trigger Mass Notices to Traders , Meanwhile, the U.K. outlined plans to shift to a faster T+1 trade settlement system by 2027 and update its listing rules, following the U.S.’s similar move earlier this year.

As finance becomes more digital and global, this U.S.-U.K. partnership may help shape a more stable and aligned regulatory future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Vice President JD Vance has publicly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to lower interest rates, even though inflation has started to ease. Vance pointed out the timing of previous rate cuts, suggesting there may be political inconsistency at play. So, is the Fed playing it safe or playing politics? JD Vance Demand Rate Cut In a recent tweet post, Vice President JD Vance questioned why Jerome Powell had slashed rates ahead of the 2024 election, but now, with inflation clearly lower, is unwilling to act. “I’d love to hear an argument for why Powell cut rates 50 points right before an election but can’t do it now with inflation lower.” I’d love to hear an argument for why Powell cut rates 50 points right before an election but can’t do it now with inflation lower. — JD Vance (@JDVance) June 24, 2025 Vance’s criticism comes after the latest government report showed inflation rose just 0.2% in May , a number lower than what many experts expected. Despite this, Powell and the Fed have kept rates steady. Vance thinks this is unfair. He says that when interest rates are high, it costs more for people to borrow money for things like houses, cars, and starting businesses. Vance believes that cutting rates now would help families and businesses save money. Trump vs Powell feud: “Fire Him!” Donald Trump has been even more outspoken. Despite appointing Powell as Fed Chair, Trump has repeatedly criticized him for not lowering rates fast enough. Over the past year, Trump has called Powell everything from “hardheaded” to “a major loser,” and at one point even suggested firing him . Powell Says There’s ‘No Rush’ Jerome Powell, meanwhile, defended the Fed’s cautious approach during a testimony before Congress on June 24. According to Powell, the central bank is waiting for more data, especially on how President Trump’s new tariffs are impacting the economy, before deciding to cut rates. He explained that although inflation has cooled, there’s still too much uncertainty to act quickly. Interest rate cuts in September 2025 While the Fed held rates steady last week at 4.25%–4.5%, analysts believe a cut could happen as early as September. According to prediction platform Polymarket, there’s a 51% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in September, and only a 5% chance of a bigger cut. On the other hand, there’s a 47% chance that no rate cut will happen at all. Whether rate cuts come soon or not, one thing is clear: the tension between politics and policy is heating up.",News,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-25 08:12:49

Powell, who made his first presentation yesterday, made important statements on many topics from interest rate cuts to cryptocurrencies. Accordingly, the FED Chairman stated that inflation would increase in the coming months due to tariffs, but added that he supports interest rate cuts later this year. Related News: FED Chairman Jerome Powell's Speech Text Released! What Did He Say About Interest Rate Cuts? - Donald Trump Had Harsh Words for Powell! At this point, Powell stated that tariffs will have an impact on inflation in the summer months, and that this impact could be short-lived or long-lived. “The FOMC's obligation is to keep long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at 2% and to prevent a one-time increase in the price level from becoming a continuing inflation problem,” Powell said. Powell said the economy has plenty of room to cut interest rates if needed. Powell said current interest rates are high enough to warrant rate cuts, but he said they are prepared to take action if the impact of income and tariffs is short-lived as data suggests. “We think we will start to see the impact of tariffs on inflation in the summer months, in the June and July data. We may see that inflation is not as strong as we expected and that tariffs do not affect inflation much. If this happens, we can start reducing interest rates earlier. On the other hand, if we see inflation coming in higher or the labor market remains strong, then we will probably act later. However, the majority of Fed members think that interest rate cuts should be made towards the end of the year.” FED Has No Authority Over Cryptocurrency! FED Chairman Jerome Powell also spoke about Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies. At this point, Powell stated that the FED cannot and will not request authorization to purchase crypto. Powell added that the Fed cannot legally purchase cryptocurrencies and is not considering seeking such authority. However, he stated that banks can offer cryptocurrency services as long as security is ensured and are free to operate in this field. In addition to his crypto statements, Powell stated that the dollar will continue to be the reserve currency for a long time. *This is not investment advice.

Table of Contents 2025’s bull cycle could crown a new Pepe leader How Neo Pepe Coin differs from classic PEPE NEOP builds momentum as rivalry with classic PEPE intensifies Why investors might want to get Neo Pepe As the 2025 crypto bull cycle gathers steam, memecoins have again hopped to the forefront, but this time, nostalgia alone isn’t enough. The iconic classic PEPE faces fierce competition from Neo Pepe, a fresh contender already raising eyebrows and funds in its presale stage. Currently priced at $0.08 and now progressing swiftly through Stage 4, Neo Pepe has surged past $2 million raised, earning its place among this year’s leading crypto presales. Neo Pepe embraces true decentralization through a fully community-driven DAO, devoid of developer wallets or centralized control. It’s structured for longevity and continuous evolution, a strategy distinctively different from the classic PEPE’s initial viral wave. 2025’s bull cycle could crown a new Pepe leader The upcoming bull market is positioning itself as a decisive showdown between two frog-themed heavyweights. Classic PEPE enjoyed massive virality during its heyday in 2023, but Neo Pepe brings new strategic dimensions: robust community engagement, layered utility, and a revolutionary commitment to decentralization and transparency. Analysts suggest this cycle could reward innovation and structural integrity, potentially making Neo Pepe the best Pepe coin and redefining memecoin standards for years to come. How Neo Pepe Coin differs from classic PEPE Classic PEPE thrived primarily on nostalgia and spontaneous hype, lacking strategic community involvement or robust governance. Neo Pepe, however, introduces an entirely new approach: DAO-powered governance: All decisions from treasury management to protocol upgrades are made via on-chain votes. No centralized control or developer wallets ensure a genuinely democratic system. Transparent treasury management: Funds are safeguarded through a multisig Timelock contract, adding layers of transparency and security. Community proposals directly influence token burns, liquidity pools, and marketing efforts. Gamified presale structure: Neo Pepe’s presale features a real-time leaderboard, driving competitive engagement and organic excitement among early adopters. Tiered pricing rewards proactive participants, fueling early momentum.

46745234,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=754947,1750842950,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46745234.jpeg,Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. won’t add new sanctions on Russia,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/marco-rubio-us-no-sanctions-russia/,"Marco Rubio, speaking from the NATO summit in The Hague on Tuesday, told European leaders straight up that the United States is not going to throw new sanctions at Russia just because Europe wants it. In an interview with Politico’s Dasha Burns, Marco said President Donald Trump still wants to leave space for talks with Vladimir Putin, and punishing Moscow right now would destroy any shot at a negotiated peace deal with Ukraine. “If we did what everybody here wants us to do, and that is come in and crush them with more sanctions, we probably lose our ability to talk to them about the ceasefire, and then who’s talking to them?” Marco said. That answer came hours before Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, and several European heads of state were expected to personally urge Trump to ramp up economic pressure on Russia. But Trump clearly has no intention of letting Europe dictate U.S. foreign policy, especially when it has to do with his favorite man on the continent, Mr. Vlad Putin. His team is instead focused on keeping lines to the Kremlin open, even though Russia’s military is still pushing deep into Ukraine. Marco said Trump is working with Congress to make sure he’s got enough flexibility to act, but added that once new sanctions are triggered, the talks are done. “If he does it, you’re almost admitting that this is not going to be negotiated anytime soon,” Marco told Dasha. Rubio says battlefield goals are replacing diplomacy As peace talks stall, Marco believes Russia is aiming to win by force what it couldn’t secure in negotiations. “Our sense of it is that the Russians are going to try to achieve in the battlefield what they’ve demanded at the negotiating table, which is certain territories [maintain] their administrative lines and the like,” Marco said. He insisted Washington disagrees with that assessment but acknowledged that Russia isn’t acting like it wants peace. Still, Marco insisted, “We’re going to continue to engage. In the sense that if there’s an opportunity for us to make a difference and get them to the table, we’re going to take it.” But while the U.S. wants to keep trying, Russia just kicked off a new summer offensive in Ukraine, ignoring every call from Kyiv and its Western allies to pause attacks and agree to a full ceasefire. Europe is demanding sanctions, but the White House is holding off. Trump wants a deal. Europe wants consequences. That’s the current split. Trump told reporters that Putin recently called him and offered help, but not the kind Trump was looking for. “You know, Vladimir called me up. He said, can I help you with Iran? I said, ‘no, I don’t need help with Iran. I need help with you.’ And I hope we’re going to be getting a deal done with Russia, which is a shame. Six thousand soldiers died last week,” Trump said before heading into meetings. He didn’t give any other info about what kind of deal he’s chasing, but he made it clear that he’s still trying to keep diplomacy alive. Trump is also expected to meet Zelenskyy at the summit. Russia-Iran ties grow as Israel conflict escalates While the world focuses on Ukraine, Russia, and Iran have deepened military and nuclear ties. The two have become close since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Iran has sent Moscow thousands of Shahed drones, now used regularly in bombing runs on Ukrainian cities. That alliance goes beyond drones. Despite being under international sanctions, both countries continue to push their nuclear programs. Russia even gave Iran the Middle East’s first nuclear power plant, brushing off objections from the West. Meanwhile, things are also boiling over between Iran and Israel. On June 13, Iran launched missile attacks on Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities. The strikes killed civilians, including five Ukrainians, and came in response to earlier military actions by Israel. After days of rising tensions, Trump announced a ceasefire between the two, but it fell apart within hours. There was no real enforcement behind it, and Iran kept firing.

What began as cautious accumulation is now unfolding into real structural interest from both corporations and public entities. But the real scope of its growth lies not just in trading or payments, but in how crypto gets woven into the financial ecosystem. And when that happens, the demand for digital assets doesn’t just rise, it accelerates exponentially. That kind of acceleration may now be closer than anticipated. In a recent and quietly monumental move, the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) confirmed that it is actively exploring the possibility of counting crypto holdings as part of mortgage qualification criteria. If successful, this development could place Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies right alongside stocks, bonds, and savings as proof of financial capability for borrowers looking to secure home loans. Bitcoin as a Mortgage Asset? U.S. Housing Authority Opens Strategic Review The body responsible for regulating America’s housing finance ecosystem, the FHFA, has just added crypto to its radar in a serious way. According to Director Bill Pulte, the agency is reviewing whether digital asset holdings, specifically Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies, can be considered legitimate assets when evaluating mortgage applicants. Currently, agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac use strict formulas to assess borrower wealth and creditworthiness. Assets must be liquid, traceable, and held in regulated institutions. Cryptocurrency, while growing in popularity, has not traditionally qualified under these terms. That may now be changing. We will study the usage pf cryptocurrency holdings as it relates to qualifying for mortgages. — Pulte (@pulte) June 24, 2025 Pulte stated that the FHFA is working on a strategic plan to examine how these assets could be folded into the broader underwriting process. This would involve studying crypto balances as a component of wealth verification, particularly for loan programs backed by the 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks, as well as Fannie and Freddie. In practice, this could look very similar to how stock portfolios or mutual fund holdings are currently handled. For example, if a borrower shows $200,000 in a traditional investment account, that’s typically enough to boost confidence in their ability to repay. Now, imagine the same being said of a wallet holding an equivalent amount in Bitcoin or Solana, especially when these holdings are parked with regulated custodians. The principle remains the same: asset strength supports borrowing power. Should this review lead to formal recognition of digital holdings, it would mark a first for a government mortgage institution and signal that crypto has earned a seat at the table in one of the largest asset-backed markets in the world, worth over $18 trillion. Best Crypto to Buy Now SUBBD SUBBD is a decentralized protocol built by those who truly understand the creator economy, for creators. What sets it apart is its refusal to treat content as disposable or creators as interchangeable. Instead, SUBBD offers a structure where creators not only own their output but actively shape the economics that drive its value. It boasts a model that allows creators to issue personalized channels tied to tokenized support. Fans can subscribe to these channels using SUBBD tokens, granting them access to gated content, early drops, private discussions, and even voting power over what gets produced next. The result is a kind of monetized intimacy where engagement carries real economic weight. What makes SUBBD increasingly relevant is the shift happening across digital culture. Audiences are moving away from ad-saturated platforms and toward ecosystems where their interaction is meaningful. SUBBD lets creators build those ecosystems with financial and social mechanics that function outside of traditional Web2 algorithms. The project was already picked up and endorsed by popular crypto YouTubers like ClayBro and many others, adding to the trust factor. As crypto begins touching sectors like housing and institutional finance, creator-focused tokens may seem like outliers. But in truth, platforms like SUBBD answer the deeper question of utility. They prove that tokens can underpin genuine economic ecosystems built around influence, creativity, and trust. And that is exactly the kind of usage that gives tokens staying power in a world moving toward real-world integration. Best Wallet Token The Best Wallet token is not built for speculation. It is built to empower the most essential part of any crypto journey, which is the wallet. As the native token of the Best Wallet ecosystem, it acts as the connective tissue between storage, action, and rewards, giving users a reason to stay within one trusted interface for everything they need. Unlike wallets that function as static safes, Best Wallet was designed to be dynamic. With the Best Wallet token at its core, users can earn cashback on swaps, reduce fees on cross-chain transfers, and unlock access to ecosystem-specific staking pools. In many ways, the token upgrades the wallet from a passive storage layer into a personalized control panel. Its strength lies in integration. The token is tied to wallet features like in-app bridging, one-tap staking, NFT portfolio management, and curated dApp discovery. These tools are designed to work together, and owning the token ensures users get priority, discounts, or added functionality across each layer. This deep, native utility ensures that the token is not just a payment tool, but an access key. With conversations now surfacing about crypto’s role in more traditional sectors like mortgage qualification, wallet ecosystems will face new expectations. They will need to demonstrate stability, traceability, and consistent use. The Best Wallet token stands out as one that can meet those benchmarks without diluting the freedom that brought users into crypto in the first place. Snorter Snorter has been smartly created to chase what goes viral. While most meme coins rely on hype and holder memes to survive, Snorter took a more technical route. It is a Solana-based sentiment robot trained to detect early-stage meme momentum across social media and trading platforms, then act on it autonomously. The project is essentially a real-time strategy bot layered with meme-trading logic. It listens to pulse shifts from places like Telegram, Twitter, and niche DEX data, scanning for coin names, volume spikes, and behavioral patterns that typically precede a meme pump. When a pattern emerges, Snorter’s contracts respond with allocation and rotation, taking positions in tokens before their visibility hits the average trader’s feed. The beauty of Snorter lies in its autonomous volatility surfacing. It captures the kind of microtrends that never show up in charts until it’s too late. That functionality makes it more than a joke, especially as investors begin to treat crypto portfolios with a blend of serious and speculative exposure. Currently in its presale stage, the project could well be on its way to a launch in the next few weeks, which could be when the price soars to achieve 20x gains or more, as its community speculates. In a world where digital assets might soon be evaluated for things like mortgage qualification, there will still be demand for tools that trade the irrational side of the market. Snorter understands the joke, profits from it, and builds a real-time engine around a genre that refuses to follow rules. As meme volatility becomes its own niche, Snorter may be one of the first protocols to tame it without killing its charm. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is doing what every Bitcoin L2 before it only promised. It is not trying to replace Bitcoin or alter its consensus, but it is building around it and making BTC actually usable in modern on-chain environments. At the heart of Bitcoin Hyper is its trustless bridge system. BTC is sent from the main chain, validated through header and proof verification, and then minted as wrapped BTC on the Hyper chain. This Hyper chain is built on Solana’s virtual machine, giving it near-instant finality, a massive transaction ceiling, and costs so low they may as well not exist. What this unlocks is real. Users can now trade, swap, mint tokens, and interact with DeFi protocols using Bitcoin-backed assets, while still having settlement security grounded in proof-of-work. It is the kind of dual benefit that makes Hyper not just a Layer 2, but a Layer 2 that finally feels native. That shift is timely. If Bitcoin is going to be seen as a real qualifying asset in formal systems like housing finance, it cannot just sit idle in a wallet. It needs function. With Hyper, Bitcoin holders are not just storing value: they are putting it to work, staking it, leveraging it, and building on it. Bitcoin Hyper does not try to compete with Ethereum or Solana. It simply gives Bitcoin the tools those chains already have without changing its DNA. That balance of preservation and expansion is what makes it a quiet, serious contender for the future of Bitcoin itself. Conclusion With the U.S. housing finance authority actively reviewing how digital assets like Bitcoin could qualify as part of a mortgage application, the conversation is no longer about potential. It is about readiness. For crypto to play a role in the real economy, it needs more than price charts and hype cycles. It needs infrastructure, purpose, and integration. What once seemed like a walled-off ecosystem is now being looked at by regulators, financial bodies, and real-world institutions as something worth incorporating. That alone should change how we think about where value will flow next, and which protocols are likely to benefit when it does.

One such advancement, an innovative AI dictation app , Wispr Flow, has just secured a significant $30 million in Series A funding, signaling a powerful surge in AI’s role in personal and professional productivity. This substantial investment highlights the growing confidence in AI-powered solutions that streamline our interaction with technology, a trend keenly observed by those invested in the future of digital ecosystems. Wispr Flow: A New Era for AI Dictation App Innovation The landscape of voice AI technology is currently experiencing a boom, with model builders and application developers alike attracting considerable investor attention. Following in the footsteps of successful ventures like ElevenLabs and Granola, Wispr Flow has announced a landmark $30 million in Series A funding. This round was spearheaded by Menlo Ventures, with additional participation from prominent investors including NEA, 8VC, Opal CEO Kenneth Schlenker, Pinterest Founder Evan Sharp, Carta CEO Henry Ward, and Lindy CEO Flo Crivelli. Menlo’s Matt Kraning, who previously invested as an angel, will also join the company’s board. This latest infusion brings Wispr Flow’s total funding to $56 million, underscoring the market’s belief in the transformative potential of this advanced AI dictation app . The Evolution of Voice AI Technology: From Concept to Consumer Tanay Kothari, the founder and CEO of Wispr Flow, initially embarked on a mission to create a device that would allow users to type simply by silently mouthing words. While this early vision secured prior funding, the company strategically pivoted last year to focus on Wispr Flow, the software interface designed for such innovative hardware. This shift proved prescient, leading to the rapid deployment of a Mac app in October 2024, followed by a Windows app in March 2025, and an iOS app earlier this month. Kothari noted that venture capitalists in Silicon Valley quickly adopted the product, becoming avid users for emails, memos, and documents. This organic adoption among influential tech leaders served as a powerful testament to the effectiveness and utility of Wispr Flow’s core voice AI technology , generating significant inbound investor interest. Why Menlo Ventures Sees a Clear Vision for the Future Matt Kraning of Menlo Ventures , an early supporter and now board member, articulated his investment thesis by observing a common frustration with current input methods: the lag between thought and digital expression. “We are waiting for our thumbs to catch up with our thoughts,” Kraning explained. He believes Wispr Flow offers an efficient solution to translate digital thoughts and intent seamlessly. The team’s approach to developing their models is particularly noteworthy; they focused on how people naturally speak rather than solely on metrics like word error rates. This nuanced understanding of human communication is a key differentiator that impressed Menlo Ventures and positions Wispr Flow as a leader in intuitive AI interaction. Unlocking Productivity: Wispr Flow’s Global Impact and User Growth Wispr Flow is not just gaining investor confidence; it is also experiencing rapid user adoption. The startup reports a remarkable 50% month-over-month growth in its user base. Geographically, its reach is broad: 40% of users are in the U.S., 30% in Europe, and the remaining 30% are spread across other parts of the world. Notably, over 30% of the app’s users come from non-technical backgrounds, highlighting its accessibility. Kothari emphasized the company’s commitment to building for all types of users, moving beyond the common ChatGPT-style interfaces that often require complex system prompts. With support for 104 languages, Wispr Flow demonstrates its global appeal; while 40% of dictations are in English, a significant 60% are in other languages, with Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Hindi, and Mandarin leading the charge. This widespread adoption solidifies its role in enhancing AI productivity for a diverse global audience. Strategic Growth and Future Horizons for Wispr Flow Despite being on the path to profitability, Tanay Kothari initially considered not raising additional funds. However, the potential risk posed by large tech players with vast distribution networks prompted a strategic decision to accelerate growth. The $30 million investment will be pivotal in multiplying the company’s revenue and reach. Wispr Flow plans to expand its 18-person team, focusing on engineering and go-to-market roles. The roadmap includes the release of an Android app and a dedicated focus on enterprise users, offering company-wide phrase context and specialized support teams. Looking ahead, Wispr Flow aims to evolve into an powerful AI-powered assistant that understands personal context, assisting with everyday tasks such as sending messages, taking notes, and setting reminders. The company also hinted at collaborations with unnamed AI hardware partners to further enhance the interaction layer, promising an even more integrated and intuitive user experience. Wispr Flow’s successful Series A funding round is a clear indicator of the robust growth in the AI-powered dictation market. By focusing on intuitive design, broad language support, and a commitment to accessibility for all users, Wispr Flow is poised to redefine how individuals and enterprises interact with AI for enhanced productivity. Its journey from a hardware concept to a rapidly adopted software solution, backed by prominent investors like Menlo Ventures, showcases a compelling vision for the future of human-AI collaboration.

46745067,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/block3-announces-ai-engine-to-end-game-studios-as-we-know-them,1750843245,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/46745067.jpeg,Block3 Announces AI Engine To End Game Studios As We Know Them,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/block3-announces-ai-engine-to-end-game-studios-as-we-know-them,"The $500 billion gaming industry is growing stale, with layoffs and declining sales making it ripe for disruption: exactly the kind of change that new entrant, Block3 , promises to deliver. Block3 brings the power of AI into the gaming industry, allowing users to create entire open-world video games with a simple text prompt: no code, design, or game development experience needed whatsoever. Block3’s BL3 token could be one of the most unusual investment opportunities of this year. Aiming to completely overhaul the gaming industry, BL3 straddles both the $20 billion AI crypto sector and the $18 billion web3 gaming sector , with the potential to reach a towering market cap if it can challenge the broader gaming industry. The BL3 token, which underpins the entire ecosystem, is available in a limited time presale from 1st July, with a starting price of just $0.01 offering a heavily discounted entry into what could be one of the most important AI cryptos to date. Block3: How it works Everyone has tried ChatGPT’s image generation feature at this point: type in what you want to see, and watch it come to life in seconds. This is essentially how Block3’s Trinity model works, but on a completely unprecedented scale. Users will enter a text prompt, just as they would with ChatGPT, but instead of getting a static image back, they’ll get an entire video game—complete with detailed environments, nuanced NPCs, and literally any feature they can imagine. This could be a genuine threat to game studios—the days of needing a team of devs and millions of dollars are ending. As with any AI model, the quality of outputs depends on the volume of inputs, and this is where Block3’s ingenious use of the blockchain comes in. Using its BL3 token to create an incentive system, Block3 recruits the gaming world as its training layer, enabling anyone to submit data—think 3D models, gameplay footage, maps, and more—and get paid for it. The blockchain also enables Block3’s Create2Earn system, whereby the top creators get paid in crypto as their games get played. This further incentivizes usage, driving in more players and helping the LWM improve as it collects more and more data. BL3: Early access to tech’s next unicorn The value proposition of Block3 is obvious—the entertainment industry will never be the same again—and the BL3 token offers a rare opportunity to secure an early entry in what could be one of the market’s most disruptive forces in years. The rise of AI—evidenced mostly recently by Google’s Veo 3 video model, which has already put the movie industry on thin ice—is shifting every landscape imaginable, and markets are responding in kind. Demand for AI has sent stocks like NVIDIA skyrocketing by 10x in just two years, but Block3’s innovation is on a whole different scale. Starting at a price of just $0.01 in its presale, BL3 is a truly interesting opportunity, potentially with a high ceiling. Despite the gaming industry’s struggles, it’s worth $522 billion, and is projected to reach $733 billion by 2030. The result of this is clear: if Block3 can aid the struggling industry and capture even 1-2% of the market, investors could be seriously up. With studios in decline consecutive years of layoffs , this could be what the gaming industry needs. The overhaul puts the player first once again, aligning with the ethos of the blockchain, and the BL3 token, offering early access to a whole new gaming industry, is the dark horse opportunity this cycle. BL3: Everything you need to know BL3, the token that keeps the Block3 ecosystem in motion, debuts on 1st July in a limited time ICO that allows early adopters to own a stake in the future of both AI and gaming. As the backbone of the future AI gaming economy, BL3 offers an opportunity to secure an early entry into a truly disruptive player in a $500B industry—and, in AI gaming, a slice of a sector that doesn’t even exist yet. It’s almost like investing in OpenAI in 2018.The presale runs for 3 months, with prices increasing every 3 days, meaning that earlybirds get by far the most bang for their buck, locking in gains of over 300% by the time BL3 lists on exchanges in Q4.

According to a June 25 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor İbrahim COŞAR, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has successfully moved back above its 50-day exponential moving average, a trend line often used to identify major shifts in market momentum. In the past, Bitcoin’s price often increased by 10% to 20% when it dropped below the 50-day EMA during a correction and then swiftly rose above it again. It appears that the pattern is reoccurring. Bitcoin has now closed three days in a row above the 50-day EMA after momentarily falling below it, indicating that bulls may be regaining control. COŞAR believes this could pave the way for a move toward $120,000 in the short term, though he warns that geopolitical events involving the United States, Israel, and Iran, could bring about unexpected volatility. You might also like: BTC crash was no accident: Bitcoin’s price chart warned of potential weakness At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,720, up 1.4% in the past 24 hours. This represents a 7.8% recovery from its June 22 low of $98,974 when the market sold off in response to escalating Middle East tensions. Some analysts believe that geopolitical unrest may strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term appeal as a hedge. War and inflation risks often lead to increased government spending and easing of monetary policy, conditions that tend to favor Bitcoin. Despite the conflict, investor interest in Bitcoin has remained strong. For the eleventh day in a row, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have seen consistent inflows. According to SoSoValue data , total net inflows in the past week have reached $938 million, showing continued interest from investors. On the technical side, Bitcoin is approaching the upper band around $110,100 after breaking above the 50-day EMA. If Bitcoin is able to consolidate above the $105,700–$106,000 range, this setup would point to growing bullish momentum. Bitcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news At 54.69, the relative strength index is just above neutral and indicates improving momentum without yet being overbought. Shorter-term moving averages also flash “buy,” and the moving average convergence divergence has entered a bullish signal zone. Bulls must push Bitcoin above the $108,000–$110,000 resistance level for upside momentum to continue. A daily close above $110,000 could open the door to the $114,000–$120,000 range. If momentum fades, support lies at $105,000 and stronger buying could return near $102,000 or $98,900.

This outlook follows a resurgence in bullish momentum as geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran appear to have eased. Earlier, Bitcoin faced the threat of dropping further below $100,000 after the United States launched an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The cooling of hostilities has since helped stabilize investor sentiment. Bitcoin price prediction for July 1 The Rainbow Chart, which is based on a logarithmic regression model, visually maps Bitcoin’s price into color-coded bands. These bands represent different phases of market sentiment, ranging from extreme fear to speculative euphoria. As of today, Bitcoin is trading at around $106,000, placing it just above the “BUY!” zone and slightly below the “Accumulate” band. This suggests that, in the context of historical trends, the asset is still undervalued and remains in a favorable zone for long-term investors looking to build or expand their positions. Bitcoin Rainbow Chart price prediction for July 1. Source: Coinglass According to the chart’s forecast, Bitcoin would fall into “Fire sale!” territory if it dropped below $69,763 on July 1. Prices between that level and $94,821 are labeled “BUY!,” indicating historically undervalued conditions. The range from $94,821 to $130,171 marks the “Accumulate” zone, where investors are encouraged to build positions. Above this lies a progression of bands, from “Still cheap” and “HOLD,” to more speculative territory like “Is this a bubble?”, “FOMO intensifies,” “Sell. Seriously, sell!” and finally, “Maximum bubble territory,” which begins at $602,453 and stretches to $819,513. Given current levels and assuming relative price stability or a slight upside, Bitcoin appears poised to remain within the “BUY!” and “Accumulate” ranges heading into July. Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $106,461, having gained over 1% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly chart, it has posted modest gains of 0.4%.

While Solana, trading at $143, continues to lead among high-performance blockchains, it’s the under-the-radar Mutuum Finance (MUTM), that’s stirring the most buzz. Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.03 in the fifth phase of its presale. Phase 5 buyers are set for a guaranteed profit of 100% ROI at launch. With DeFi heating up again and investor sentiment shifting, many now see Mutuum Finance as the best crypto to buy in 2025 before mainstream exposure drives up demand. Solana Holds Near Key Support as Technical Outlook Stabilizes After recovering intraday lows, Solana (SOL) is consolidating around the mark of $143 and still has a stronghold at a significant support of $140.40. Technical analysis points to a falling channel which is forming a possible bull reversal, should Sol breach this figure and test higher, analysts think the second rally to its resistance may commence. All in all, despite the caution of traction, the consolidation at the current values hints at creation of a base over which a more healthy uptrend can form. In this temperate tone of dedicated Layer 1s, such as Solana, there is also a lot of interest in speculative altcoins such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Hits $11 Million Raised Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running wild in popularity. With its trailblazing two-way lending model, this DeFi behemoth has already attracted more than 12,400 investors and raised $11.1 million, and it’s not slowing down.

Such lending protocols provide start-to-end seamless DeFi experience that is perfectly tailored to the needs of the user and which is safer, transparent, and more customizable than other centralized lending products. Mutuum Finance’s USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance’s upcoming overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, launching on Ethereum, is designed to maintain price stability while avoiding flaws found in algorithmic stablecoins. While the project is already audited by CertiK, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is laying the groundwork for massive adoption, and investors who pay attention at this point might benefit the most in the future. On top of that, the platform is running a massive $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will each receive $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens.

This shift is most visible in small parcels and electronics. Analysts believe the change could impact UK inflation and pressure local manufacturers, while British and European authorities watch for dumping risks. Chinese exporters send more goods to the UK as US tariffs rise President Trump’s administration more than doubled the import duties on Chinese products to 55% before he returned to office in January 2025. That made it much more costly for Chinese companies to sell into the US market. Chinese firms are switching their shipments to European markets, where trade restrictions are eased and demand is constant. Data shows that China’s small parcel exports to the UK surged by 66% in May compared to last year, and the total value of these small parcels rose to nearly $2 billion in the first five months of 2025. Chinese exporters have proven their responsiveness to global policy changes and can adjust to keep goods moving. Chinese smartphone shipments to the UK rose by 26% between January and May 2025, while computer shipments climbed by 11% over the same period. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturers are finding new and favorable paths to get their products into consumers’ hands as smartphone imports from China to the US fell by 18% and computers dropped by 25%. The latest numbers suggest Chinese exporters followed their promise to look for other markets if the US raised tariffs again. This new pattern could have long-term effects on global trade, with countries like the UK facing benefits and challenges. While British consumers will enjoy affordable prices for imported goods if companies offer discounts to clear excess inventory once meant for the US, it raises concerns about the local industry and job security because manufacturers may struggle to compete with cheap imports. UK checks for problems as more Chinese goods enter the market The UK’s Office for National Statistics reported that the country imported goods worth £6 billion ($8.2 billion) from China in April alone (the highest monthly total in over two years). Meanwhile, trade data from Beijing shows that exports to the UK are running above normal seasonal levels. The UK’s inflation is still above 3% so policymakers at the Bank of England are watching closely to see whether the increased supply of low-cost Chinese imports like clothing, electronics, and home essentials could bring prices down faster than expected. However, UK officials are also weighing the downsides of this trade shift to domestic manufacturers and producers. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government is closely monitoring signs of “trade diversion,” where goods originally intended for another country are redirected to the UK in large volumes. Local industries will struggle to compete if Chinese exporters sell these products at very low prices and sometimes below their production costs, which also qualifies as “dumping,”. Reynolds said his department is ready to use trade remedies or safeguards to protect vulnerable sectors such as steel, textiles, or consumer electronics. External policymaker Catherine Mann argues that the public may not see much benefit in lower prices, even though the volume of cheap imports increases. This is because many retailers might use the savings from low-cost imports to restore their profit margins. Rising wages, rent, and energy bills have squeezed these margins over the past two years. Associate Professor at the London School of Economics, Thomas Sampson, cautioned against making big predictions based on short-term data, despite acknowledging the early signs of trade diversion from the US to the UK. He said it will take several more months of consistent trends before policymakers conclude that Chinese exporters have made the UK a long-term substitute for the US market. UK officials know that the long-term impact will depend on how global trade flows evolve in the coming months, but they remain vigilant and ready to act if needed.

Speaking on the partnership with Moonveil, Sebastian Pfeiffer, Managing Director at Impossible Cloud Network, stated: “There’s no true Web3 without decentralized infrastructure. This partnership proves that even the complex setups gaming requires can be fully self-sovereign.” On the flip side, Moonveil offers a full-stack Web 3 gaming ecosystem built for players and powered by its native token, $MORE. The protocol is built on zkEVM Polygon technology and backed by a slew of high-profile VCs, including Gumi Cryptos Capital, Spartan Group and Animoca Ventures. The platform has rapidly accelerated Web 3 gaming, leveraging its multi-layered ecosystem. The platform introduces on-chain identity and asset interoperability on its high-performance Layer-2 network. Since launch, the platform has grown its gamer community to over 1 million+ users, 871K+ wallets engaged in its AstrArk marching test, and over 1.3M unique wallets interacting with its testnet. “Moonveil was built to redefine how games and infrastructure come together, and with ICN we’re able to deliver an experience that doesn’t just look like Web3 – it runs on Web3, from infrastructure to gameplay,” said MJ, Founder of Moonveil, during the unveiling of the partnership. The partnership with ICN proves the steps Moonveil is taking to bring full decentralization to Web 3 gaming. In addition, it proves both product-market fit and technical scalability across key global markets. Its node sales have also surpassed $11 million. The milestone comes at a time when both projects are entering their next chapter. ICN is currently preparing for its mainnet and $ICNT token launch, while Moonveil is also set to launch its $MORE token on June 27.

Bessent’s declaration that the United States is poised to finalize significant Trade Deals immediately following the passage of a critical Tax Bill after July 4th marks a potentially transformative moment for the nation’s economic future. This pivotal timeline suggests a carefully orchestrated plan to leverage domestic fiscal reforms into a stronger global trade position, potentially sending ripples across various sectors, including the ever-evolving Financial Markets . What’s Driving the US Treasury Secretary’s Optimism? Scott Bessent’s comments underscore a strategic alignment between fiscal policy and international trade ambitions. The idea that major trade negotiations hinge on the successful enactment of a new tax bill before a specific date, July 4th, is more than just a procedural detail; it’s a testament to the administration’s integrated approach to Economic Policy . Historically, tax reforms have been utilized to stimulate domestic growth, encourage investment, and enhance a nation’s competitive edge on the global stage. By linking the finalization of trade deals to the tax bill’s passage, the administration appears to be signaling that a stable and favorable domestic tax environment is a prerequisite for robust international commerce. This approach aims to provide greater certainty for businesses operating within the U.S. and those looking to invest. A predictable tax structure can lower operational costs, encourage repatriation of profits, and make U.S. goods and services more attractive globally. This foundation, the thinking goes, empowers U.S. negotiators with stronger leverage in discussions with international partners, making the prospect of favorable Trade Deals more achievable. Decoding the Significance of Upcoming Trade Deals The phrase ‘ Trade Deals ‘ often conjures images of complex negotiations and dense legal texts, but their impact on everyday life is profound. These agreements dictate the terms under which goods and services cross international borders, influencing everything from the price of consumer goods to the competitiveness of domestic industries. For the U.S., new trade agreements could mean: Expanded Market Access: Opening new avenues for American products and services in foreign markets, potentially boosting exports and creating jobs. Reduced Tariffs and Barriers: Lowering costs for both importers and exporters, which can translate to more affordable goods for consumers and increased profitability for businesses. Enhanced Economic Growth: Facilitating smoother international commerce can stimulate overall economic activity, contributing to GDP growth. Strengthened Geopolitical Alliances: Trade agreements often go hand-in-hand with diplomatic relations, solidifying partnerships and promoting stability. The specific nature of these deals remains to be seen, but the emphasis from the US Treasury Secretary suggests a focus on agreements that align with the nation’s strategic economic interests, aiming to foster fair and reciprocal trade relationships. Why is the Tax Bill Passage So Crucial for Trade? The upcoming Tax Bill , slated for passage around July 4th, is not merely a domestic fiscal adjustment; it is positioned as a cornerstone for future international economic engagement. A significant tax overhaul can: Boost Domestic Investment: By offering incentives or reducing corporate tax burdens, the bill could encourage companies to invest more within the U.S., leading to job creation and innovation. Improve Competitiveness: A favorable tax regime can make the U.S. a more attractive location for businesses, drawing in foreign direct investment and making American companies more competitive globally. Provide Negotiating Leverage: A strong domestic economy, bolstered by a supportive tax structure, gives the US Treasury Secretary and other negotiators a stronger hand at the bargaining table for Trade Deals . It signals economic stability and a clear direction for growth. The exact provisions of this tax bill will be critical in determining its impact, but the administration’s messaging clearly links its passage to the subsequent acceleration of trade deal finalization. This strategic timing highlights the interconnectedness of internal fiscal health and external trade prowess within comprehensive Economic Policy . Navigating the Complexities of US Economic Policy The orchestration of a major Tax Bill and subsequent Trade Deals is a testament to the intricate nature of modern Economic Policy . The US Treasury Secretary plays a central role in this grand economic strategy, advising the President on economic and financial issues, implementing tax policy, and participating in international financial diplomacy. Crafting policies that simultaneously stimulate domestic growth, manage inflation, and foster beneficial international relationships is a delicate balancing act. Consider the potential challenges: Aspect Potential Benefit Potential Challenge Tax Bill Passage Increased investment, job creation, improved competitiveness. Public opposition, budget deficits, unequal distribution of benefits. Trade Deal Finalization Domestic industry displacement, geopolitical tensions, complex enforcement. Expanded markets, lower costs, stronger alliances. Overall Economic Stability Predictable growth, investor confidence. Unforeseen global events, inflationary pressures, market volatility. The success of these initiatives will depend not only on their design but also on effective communication and adaptability in response to dynamic global conditions. The synergy between fiscal and trade strategies is key to unlocking the intended economic benefits. What Could This Mean for Financial Markets? The announcement from the US Treasury Secretary about impending Trade Deals and the foundational Tax Bill is already being scrutinized by participants in Financial Markets . Markets thrive on certainty and growth prospects, and this dual-pronged approach could signal a period of significant activity. Here’s how different segments might react: Equity Markets: Companies poised to benefit from expanded trade access or reduced tax burdens could see their valuations rise. Sectors like manufacturing, agriculture, and technology, often heavily involved in international trade, might experience particular uplift. Bond Markets: The implications for government bonds will depend on how the tax bill affects national debt and inflation expectations. If the policies lead to stronger economic growth, it could influence interest rate forecasts. Currency Markets: A more competitive U.S. economy and increased trade could strengthen the U.S. dollar, impacting global exchange rates. Cryptocurrency Markets: While often seen as an alternative asset class, cryptocurrencies are not entirely decoupled from traditional financial systems. Increased stability and growth in the broader economy, driven by effective Economic Policy , could foster greater institutional adoption and regulatory clarity, potentially leading to increased capital inflows into digital assets. Conversely, a strong dollar might make dollar-denominated crypto investments less attractive to international investors in the short term. Investors will be closely watching for the specifics of the tax bill and the details of the trade deals to make informed decisions. The period immediately following July 4th could be characterized by heightened volatility as markets digest these significant policy shifts. Benefits and Challenges on the Horizon for US Trade and Economy As the U.S. prepares for these significant shifts in its Economic Policy , it’s essential to weigh both the potential upsides and the inherent challenges. The vision articulated by the US Treasury Secretary is one of renewed economic vigor and global leadership, yet the path forward is rarely without obstacles. Potential Benefits: Economic Revitalization: A combination of tax incentives and new market access can inject fresh capital into the economy, spurring innovation and expansion across various industries. Job Growth: Expanded trade opportunities often translate into increased demand for labor in sectors involved in exports and international commerce. Increased Competitiveness: Streamlined trade processes and a favorable tax environment can make American businesses more competitive globally, attracting talent and investment. Consumer Savings: Reduced tariffs and more efficient supply chains can lead to lower prices for imported goods, benefiting consumers. Inherent Challenges: Negotiation Hurdles: Finalizing complex Trade Deals with multiple partners can be protracted and fraught with disagreements over specific terms and conditions. Domestic Impact: While beneficial overall, certain domestic industries might face increased competition from imports, requiring adaptation or support. Global Economic Volatility: Unforeseen global events, such as geopolitical conflicts or supply chain disruptions, could impact the effectiveness of these policies. Political Opposition: Both the Tax Bill and new trade agreements could face significant political resistance, potentially delaying or altering their implementation. Successfully navigating these challenges will require adept leadership from the US Treasury Secretary and a collaborative approach across government branches and international partners. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Post-July 4 Landscape For businesses, investors, and individuals, understanding the implications of these forthcoming changes is paramount. The period after July 4th is set to be dynamic, with potential shifts in regulations, market conditions, and international relations. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed on Policy Details: Closely monitor the specifics of the passing Tax Bill and the emerging details of the new Trade Deals . The fine print will determine the precise impact on various sectors. Assess Sector-Specific Impacts: Evaluate how your industry or investments might be uniquely affected. Are you in an export-heavy sector? Do you rely on imported components? Understanding these nuances is key. Diversify and Adapt: In times of policy shifts, diversification can mitigate risk. For businesses, this might mean exploring new markets or supply chain strategies. For investors, it means maintaining a balanced portfolio that accounts for potential market volatility. Engage with Policy Discussions: Businesses and industry groups should consider engaging with policymakers to voice concerns or offer insights as these policies are finalized and implemented. Monitor Financial Markets Closely: Pay attention to how traditional assets and cryptocurrencies react to the news. Market sentiment can be a leading indicator of perceived economic health. The proactive approach outlined by the US Treasury Secretary demands an equally proactive response from all stakeholders to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks. A New Chapter for US Economic Policy The statements from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent regarding the finalization of Trade Deals post-July 4th, contingent on the passage of a critical Tax Bill , signal a decisive new chapter in U.S. Economic Policy . This integrated strategy aims to bolster domestic strength through fiscal reform, thereby empowering the nation to forge more advantageous international agreements. The anticipated impact on Financial Markets , from traditional equities to the burgeoning cryptocurrency space, underscores the far-reaching implications of these policy decisions. While challenges undoubtedly lie ahead, the strategic timing and explicit linkage of these initiatives suggest a clear vision for enhancing America’s economic competitiveness and global standing. The coming months will reveal the full scope of these transformative efforts, shaping the economic narrative for years to come.

46746014,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72488,1750844430,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Attorney John Deaton Predicts Ripple IPO Market Cap With 40 Billion XRP In Escrow,https://timestabloid.com/john-deaton-predicts-ripple-ipo-market-cap-with-40-billion-xrp-in-escrow/,"Prominent attorney and long-time XRP advocate John Deaton has provided new commentary on the prospects of Ripple going public, suggesting that timing could play a crucial role in the company’s decision-making process. In a tweet posted on X, Deaton referenced earlier remarks from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who has previously indicated that Ripple is not in a rush to pursue an initial public offering. Deaton affirmed that Ripple does not have a pressing need to raise capital through public markets, which is a conventional reason for companies to pursue an IPO. However, he emphasized that market timing remains a key strategic consideration. He drew comparisons between Ripple and Circle, the issuer of USDC. He cited the potential market cap range of $62 billion to $75 billion for Circle and implied that Ripple, holding nearly 40 billion XRP, could achieve a market capitalization of $100 billion. Deaton’s estimate was based on the current value of XRP at approximately $2 per token, translating to $80 billion in assets if Ripple’s XRP holdings are considered. His tweet conveyed that Ripple’s scale and positioning could support a valuation in that range under favorable market conditions. I know @bgarlinghouse said @Ripple is NOT in a rush to go public. They certainly don’t need to raise capital, which is often, a primary reason to go public. But TIMING an IPO is also a big consideration. If @circle can hit a 62B-75B market cap then @Ripple , with nearly 40B XRP,… https://t.co/MSFNMy6i8E — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 23, 2025 Community Responds With Varying Perspectives Several X users replied to Deaton’s post with their interpretations of Ripple’s IPO pathway. One user, Stratlonesoldier, noted that once Ripple’s legal matters with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are resolved, the company might consider going public not only for capital but also for reputation, governance, and strategic clarity, especially given its large XRP holdings. Another user, Hillary’s Snuke, offered a more critical viewpoint, suggesting that Ripple’s capital position may be attributed to selling XRP rather than operational revenues. This post implied skepticism regarding Ripple’s motivation to avoid raising capital, instead pointing to token sales as a source of funding. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Concerns About Governance and Institutional Influence User DannyXRP responded with concerns about the potential consequences of Ripple becoming a publicly traded company. He warned that going public could invite increased influence from institutional investors, including traditional banking entities. He argued that such developments could compromise the company’s independence and criticized the hypothetical involvement of banks in Ripple’s governance. Instead, he proposed that Ripple remain a private entity and even evolve into a bank itself, thereby avoiding external pressures and preserving its direction and autonomy. IPO as a Strategic Lever Amid Legal Backdrop The overall context of Deaton’s comments centers around Ripple’s ongoing legal entanglements with the SEC, which many observers view as a limiting factor in its public market ambitions. Deaton did not speculate on a specific timeline for an IPO, nor did he claim such a move was imminent. Rather, he highlighted the strategic considerations at play, particularly regarding market conditions, competitive comparisons, and the substantial value Ripple holds in XRP reserves. While Garlinghouse has stated that Ripple is not actively pursuing an IPO at this time, Deaton’s remarks suggest that the company’s leadership may still be evaluating the timing and benefits of such a move.

In collaboration with Avalanche and OpenSea, the game also released exclusive digital collectibles. BloodLoop said the game is developed for players hungry for fast-paced action, tactical depth, and true ownership of in-game content. The firm also added that the game includes a blend of intense team-based combat, sci-fi narrative immersion, and player-to-player economy. BloodLoop comes with three game modes and Web3 integration BloodLoop launches today on Epic Games. Built on Avalanche and powered by $BLS , @BloodLoopGAME is one of the most action-packed, competitive, and just plain fun games to come out of web3. Just 3 hours ahead of launch, they’ve already smashed through 200,000 mints for the Artist… pic.twitter.com/INJAfIWBq6 — Avalanche🔺 (@avax) June 23, 2025 The competitive hero game developed by Swiss studio Ragnarok Games hurls players into a futuristic landscape, where three distinct factions have traded planetary war for virtual combat in the BloodLoop arena. The game revealed that the heroes from the factions, each forged by the mysterious BloodLoop process, merge human blood with exotic matter to unlock extraordinary powers. The game will have three modes: Energy War, Team Deathmatch, and Free-for-All, a solo mode where only the strongest survive. According to BloodLoop, Energy War demands tight coordination to seize and defend power nodes, while Team Deathmatch features a 10-player format focused on direct combat. “I think we are coming to the market with something that’s different from what people have played so far. We are breaking into a genre that is kind of cursed; hero shooters have come and gone a lot in recent times. We’re trying to bring some innovation, all the way from gameplay to the way items work.” -Pasquale Finiello, Co-founder of Ragnarok Games. The company said its blockchain integration is optional, keeping the gameplay separate while offering true digital ownership to Web3 enthusiasts. The team-based combat game disclosed that its blockchain integrations allow users to own cosmetics and mint Avalanche-backed collectibles like the Artist Print skin. The firm also stated that its blockchain titles will help users participate in a secure trading environment, without sacrificing polish, balance, or competitive integrity. BloodLoop also revealed its roadmap through 2025, including new heroes, maps, ranked mode, and controller support. The game came with five playable characters, four maps, and complete in-game loops with skins, crafting, and an in-game economy during launch. In July, the Avalanche-based game plans to release a new character called Titus and a new Skyve City map. BloodLoop will also release a Quest system, a Season Pass, and Daily Streaks for gamers. In September, BloodLoop promised to release a new character named Shaman and a new map called Seraphic Tower. The game will also unlock Auction House, Mastery, and Ranked during the same period. The game will release new maps in December, including the Bahmin Ruin and the 8th Map. According to BloodLoop, there will also be controller support add-ons. The free-to-play hero shooter game has been in development since 2021 and comes with a blockchain component that allows players to claim true ownership of select in-game items. The game secured $4 million worth of seed funding in March 2024. It also previously became one of the top 30 most whitelisted games on Epic Games ‘ digital storefront. Ragnarok Games launches play-to-airdrop tournament The company revealed that the game’s first season will last one month and focus on competition, fairness, and steady progression. The free-to-play hero shooter game’s early access launch also came with a $15,000 play-to-airdrop tournament to reward early players. Ragnarok Games said it included the Seasonal Leaderboard Tournament during the launch to encourage competitive play from the start. The firm revealed that players can join by purchasing a $99.99 pass using the game’s native token, BLS. According to the gaming company, 75% of the revenue from the passes will be directed into the prize pool. While the starting pool is $15,000, Ragnarok Games mentioned it could expand to $130,000 if enough players participate. The Swiss game studio said player rankings are based on matchmaking ratings (MMR), and the top fifth of participants will earn rewards. The company also acknowledged that the tournament format encourages skill-based progression while giving even mid-tier players a chance to win.

Price prediction for 2025 targets $1.74, with potential highs of $2.0 and $3.0. The Pi Network is making waves once again , as its price sees a sudden and powerful breakout backed by real-world developments and renewed investor confidence. With increased activity on major exchanges, rumors of Pi Coin Binance listing , and global adoption efforts, Pi is becoming one of the most-watched tokens in the Crypto market. Global interest in Pi Coin price is surging, especially in regions like India and Pakistan, where users are actively searching for “1 Pi to PKR in 2025” and “Pi Network price in India in the future.” Table of contents Overview Pi Network Price Prediction 2025 Pi Coin Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Pi Crypto Price Forecast 2026 Pi Coin Price Prediction 2027 Pi Token Price Projection 2028 Pi Network Price Analysis 2029 Pi Network Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis Coinpedia’s PI Coin Price Prediction Conclusion FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Token PI Price $ 0.60377537 13.39% Market cap $ 4,550,494,305.1074 Circulating Supply 7,536,733,880.3547 Trading Volume $ 191,709,328.3677 All-time high $2.98 on 26th February 2025 All-time low $0.6152 on 20th February 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction 2025 In mid-May, the weighted sentiment reached “+2.86” from Q2’s low of “-1.76”, where positive sentiment was 3 times higher than negative sentiment. The rumours led to huge price rises, with sentiment accelerating. The strong bullish momentum continued to the $1.70 level, which acted much like a price magnet, drawing PI toward it. However, this was also a known supply zone, meaning strong buying pressure will be required to break and to hold above it a daily close is also needed. But, at this level, it failed and was repelled back by achieving a high of $1.65 and giving a daily close at around $1.20, which led to a near 30% drawdown in gains the same day. This happened due to a strong wave of profit booking, which continued into the last week of May. As a result, its weighted sentiment also dipped from positive to negative. In total gains shedded from May’s peak to mid-June were over 75%, where the PI price dipped as low as $0.40, as the Israel and Iran conflict became intense. However, it quickly rebounded 40% and gave a daily close at $0.57 on the same day, near the support zone it formed in Q2. Despite the quick rise, the fall is still around a 65% loss since $1.65, and now it is consolidating in hopes of getting hold above the $0.60 level. But, if it slips more than it could collapse back to $0.400 again, and this time if the fall extends, then a new low is possible. However, in the past three days, bullish sentiment surged in June’s fourth week, and its weighted sentiment also saw a slight uptick. This happened as the war saw a ceasefire that fueled short-term bullish conviction, immediately pushing the PI price above the Q2 key support zone. It has pierced the 20-day EMA band in the short term, but the 50-day EMA resistance still looms at $0.66. But, if more thrust is added and PI manages to clear the 50-day EMA band, then it would be a Change of Character (ChoCh) of the current bearish trend. Also, after ChoCh, it might advance higher to retest the fibo 0.5 level around $1.65-$1.70 in June or Q3. Also, under extremely bullish conditions, if it knocks down this 0.5 fibo level that closely aligns with the previous high volume profile level, higher targets like $2.00 and $3.00 could come into play later in 2025. On the contrary, if it slips more, it could collapse back to $0.400 again; this time, if the fall extends, a new low is possible.

Yet, a recent Senate crypto hearing on bipartisan market structure legislation left many in the crypto community wondering about the commitment of lawmakers, as attendance proved surprisingly low. This pivotal moment could significantly shape the future of digital assets, making the sparse turnout a point of serious discussion. A Troubling Turnout at the Senate Crypto Hearing: What Happened? When the U.S. Senate Banking Committee’s digital assets subcommittee convened for a crucial hearing on bipartisan crypto market structure legislation, the expectation was for robust participation. Instead, only five of the eleven senators on the subcommittee were present. Chair Cynthia Lummis, a vocal advocate for responsible crypto legislation, acknowledged the low attendance, attributing it to scheduling conflicts. However, the optics of such a vital discussion being sparsely attended raised eyebrows across the industry. This particular Senate crypto hearing was not just another routine meeting. It was designed to gather testimony from both regulators and industry leaders, providing a comprehensive view on how to best frame future legislation for digital assets. The absence of more than half the subcommittee members highlights a potential disconnect or perhaps an underestimation of the urgency surrounding crypto policy in the nation’s capital. For an industry clamoring for regulatory clarity, such a sight can be disheartening. Why is Bipartisan Crypto Legislation So Crucial? The path to effective US crypto regulation is fraught with challenges, not least of which is the need for consensus across political divides. Senator Lummis herself stressed the imperative for bipartisan input, recognizing that durable and effective legislation cannot be forged by one party alone. Bipartisan crypto legislation is essential for several reasons: Stability and Longevity: Laws crafted with support from both sides of the aisle are less likely to be overturned or significantly altered with changes in political power, providing much-needed stability for businesses and investors. Comprehensive Solutions: Different political perspectives often bring unique insights, leading to more comprehensive and balanced regulatory frameworks that address a wider range of concerns, from innovation to consumer protection. Global Competitiveness: A unified approach signals to the international community that the U.S. is serious about fostering a responsible digital asset ecosystem, enhancing its position as a leader in financial innovation. The hearing followed the Senate’s passage of the GENIUS Act, a separate piece of legislation focused on blockchain technology’s potential, underscoring the ongoing, albeit slow, legislative activity around digital assets. Navigating the Complexities of US Crypto Regulation The current landscape of US crypto regulation is often described as a patchwork, with various agencies asserting jurisdiction over different aspects of digital assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are key players, often with differing views on how cryptocurrencies should be classified and regulated. This creates uncertainty, hindering innovation and making compliance a nightmare for businesses. A comprehensive crypto market structure bill aims to bring clarity by defining roles, establishing clear rules for exchanges, stablecoins, and other digital asset activities. Such legislation could: Protect Consumers: By setting standards for transparency, disclosure, and market integrity, safeguarding investors from fraud and manipulation. Foster Innovation: Providing clear guardrails allows innovators to build and experiment without constant fear of regulatory crackdowns or ambiguity. Promote Market Integrity: Ensuring fair and orderly markets by preventing illicit activities and establishing robust oversight mechanisms. The testimony heard at the hearing, according to Cointelegraph, included perspectives from these very regulators and industry leaders, highlighting the diverse viewpoints that must be reconciled for effective policy. Shaping the Future: Understanding Crypto Market Structure At its core, regulating crypto market structure involves establishing the rules and frameworks that govern how digital assets are traded, custodied, and managed. This includes everything from how exchanges operate to the oversight of stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. A well-defined market structure is vital for the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, as it builds trust and reduces systemic risks. The discussions at the hearing, even with limited attendance, underscored the urgent need to address critical questions: Who regulates spot markets for cryptocurrencies? What are the appropriate rules for stablecoin issuers? How should decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and DeFi protocols be integrated into existing financial regulations? The answers to these questions will profoundly impact the trajectory of the crypto industry, determining whether it can flourish within a regulated environment or remain in a state of uncertainty. Digital Assets Subcommittee: The Path Forward? Despite the low turnout, the digital assets subcommittee remains a critical forum for advancing crypto legislation. The commitment of Chair Lummis and other engaged senators signals that the effort to create a robust regulatory framework for digital assets is far from over. However, the incident serves as a stark reminder that sustained engagement and broader political will are essential for meaningful progress. For the crypto community, this means continuing to advocate for clear, balanced regulation and encouraging greater lawmaker participation. The future of bipartisan crypto legislation hinges on the ability of senators to overcome scheduling conflicts and political differences to prioritize an industry that is rapidly reshaping the global financial landscape. Conclusion: The Imperative for Engagement The recent Senate crypto hearing , while yielding valuable testimony, also exposed a concerning lack of engagement from a majority of the digital assets subcommittee members. This highlights the ongoing challenge of translating the urgency of crypto innovation into political action. For the digital asset industry to truly thrive and for the U.S. to maintain its competitive edge, clear and comprehensive US crypto regulation is paramount. This requires sustained, bipartisan effort to establish a robust crypto market structure that protects consumers, fosters innovation, and ensures market integrity. The path forward demands not just discussion, but decisive legislative action and unwavering commitment from all stakeholders.

In a transparency report , the attacker abused insider information, malware, and advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics to bypass sensitive internal systems and information. Malware and Social Engineering Facilitated Attack Fuzzland reported that the hacker employed social engineering, supply chain compromise, and malware to infiltrate its systems. The UniBTC vulnerability was first identified internally during an emergency call and then exploited. The attacker had installed backdoors on engineering workstations that granted long-term undiscovered access. It enabled them to access a vulnerability first unveiled in a report from security firm Dedaub. Even though the flaw was detected before, Fuzzland admitted that it was receiving lesser priority since it was producing so many false positive alerts. Compensation and Ongoing Investigations Fuzzland guaranteed that it had completely compensated Bedrock for losing $2 million and is working together with ZeroShadow in pursuing the breach. Reports have also been lodged with the FBI and Chinese government. In response to the exploit, Fuzzland teamed up with cybersecurity firms Seal 911 and SlowMist to heighten security levels across the DeFi ecosystem. The company emphasized that no customer or client data was hacked and that the attack was isolated in an alternate internal environment. Bedrock Recovers Despite the Attack Bedrock, a liquid restaking protocol that offers synthetic assets like UniBTC, UniETH, and UniIOTX, confirmed the exploit on Sept. 27, 2024. Despite losing $2 million on its decentralized exchange pools, the protocol’s total value locked (TVL) went up from $240 million in September 2024 to $535 million as of June 2025, according to DefiLlama. Rising Social Engineering Attacks Fuzzland’s reveal follows wider trends within the crypto security sector. Blockchain security company CertiK said that $2.1 billion has so far been lost to crypto attacks in 2025, with an increasing proportion attributed to phishing and wallet exploits. CertiK co-founder Ronghui Gu said that attackers are increasingly moving away from smart contract bugs towards human-focused attacks, including social engineering and insider manipulation.",Blockchain|Sticky|Bitcoin|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|APT,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-06-25 09:52:32

The 2025 HYPE price suggests it could enter the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap with continued growth. Forecasts suggest that HYPE could reach a potential average price by 2030 of around $125, with highs up to $185. The crypto market is buzzing with excitement over Hyperliquid and its native token, HYPE. As a decentralized, paperless alternative to platforms like Binance and Coinbase, Hyperliquid is quickly gaining traction, prompting investors to look closely at the HYPE price prediction for 2025 and beyond . With its unique “HyperBFT” consensus mechanism, lightning-fast transactions, and zero KYC hurdles, Hyperliquid is rewriting the rules of perpetual trading. But does its innovative model signal long-term growth for HYPE Token Price? In this article, we dive deep into market sentiment and Hyperliquid price projections from 2025 to 2030. Table of Contents Overview Hyperliquid Price Prediction 2025 Hyperliquid Coin Price Targets 2026 – 2030 HYPE Price Projection 2026 Hyperliquid Coin Price Prediction 2027 HYPE Crypto Price Action 2028 Hyperliquid Price Analysis 2029 HYPE Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s HYPE Price Projection FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Hyperliquid Token HYPE Price $ 37.89326762 3.36% Market cap $ 12,653,629,891.3436 Circulating Supply 333,928,180.00 Trading Volume $ 293,166,630.3376 All-time high $35.02 on 21st December 2024 All-time low $3.20 on 29th November 2024 Hyperliquid Price Prediction 2025 Hyperliquid (HYPE) has quietly become one of the largest known names in decentralized perpetuals, as its market cap rank increased to 11th, and with recent BTC’s rise, HYPE reached an ATH of $45.77. As per DUNE charts, it is seen that in trading volume, it sat just behind DyDx in trading volume, but in July and August 2024, the tide started to turn in HYPE’s favor. The derivatives volume crossed $197 billion in January 2025, and like dYdX and others, lost its spot, and even by April, the volume hovered near the same benchmark it set in January. However, the performance in May exceeded that of January as derivatives volume shot up by over $248 billion derivative volume. This shows that people are using the Hyperliquid a lot, and its adoption is increasing strongly. Moreover, compared to Binance, Hyperliquid highlights’s steady growth. The chart clearly shows that in 2025, in comparison to Binance losing spot trading volume, the Hyperliquid’s perpetual trading volume is continuously rising, as if people are exiting Binance and taking a ride on Hyperliquid’s platform. Apart from on-chain, the HYPE price on the daily chart appears super optimistic because of its impressive Q2 rally witnessed on its price chart. In June, a breakout from a symmetrical triangle was pumped but met a weak high that pushed it down over 30% at the $31 mark; back to the support in early June, a breakout was triggered. This was caused by lower trading activity as the US threatened Iran on June 17th. The traders on HYPE declined, which caused the fall. However, a quick turnaround was seen on June 21 and 22. The BTC fell to $98K on the same days, where traders on the HYPE platform bought the dip of BTC aggressively, and huge trading sessions pushed the HYPE price from the FVG. With rising trading activity on the HYPE platform, it managed a 22% surge and is now inching toward the ATH retest. If ATH is flipped this time, it will soon be testing the $50 psychological mark in June or Q3. Meanwhile, for the year-end 2025, the target is much higher and goes beyond $80. If the momentum continues, the price of HYPE will give maximum return, unlike any other altcoin. If it clears $50 in Q3 2025 with a significant move, then its price clearing $80 in upcoming Q3 and Q4 wouldn’t be much of a surprise, and it could become the top 10 crypto by market cap. However, if Declines, then $32 support is crucial. Below this, the next support would be $24.

However, CZ echoed the denial in a post on X while Binance co-founder Yi He also dismissed online rumors. This comes after CZ recently confirmed that his legal team formally applied for a pardon from Trump, and the application was submitted in April. However, the former Binance CEO has publicly disputed aspects of those reports and denied any active business negotiations involving Binance US or Trump’s inner circle. No Trump pardon for Binance’s CZ yet Indicating towards the reports suggesting a pardon from Trump , CZ stated in an X post that fake news is spreading around, and most likely, the reports are seeded by a Chinese competitor. He added that the original news articles have been deleted after CZ and the team informed them. He asked outlets to verify with official sources before believing in any fake news, while marking it as FUD 4. Former Binance CEO also shared Trump’s post, in which the president addressed some hoaxes. Trump wrote, “fake news CNN, together with the failing New York Times, have teamed up in an attempt to demean one of the most successful military strikes in history.” Fake news everywhere… 😂🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/N72vdBcxmD — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) June 25, 2025 The speculation originated from a Chinese crypto media outlet, reportedly BlockBeats, which published and later deleted an article suggesting CZ had been pardoned. Yi He addressed the issue directly in a message to Chinese blockchain news platform Odaily Planet Daily, clarifying that no such pardon had been granted. Meanwhile, the US Department of Justice’s official pardon database shows no indication that Zhao has received a pardon to date. CZ has publicly confirmed that he applied for a presidential pardon Zhao was sentenced in April 2024 to four months in US federal prison after pleading guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program at Binance. He was released in September and has since kept a low public profile. The case also led to one of the largest corporate settlements in US history, where Binance paid $4.3 billion in penalties. Zhao personally paid a $50 million fine. The Binance founder has confirmed, speaking on a podcast, that he applied for a presidential pardon from Donald Trump. CZ said his lawyers filed the request following Bloomberg and WSJ reports linking him to the Trump camp. Trump has previously issued pardons to prominent crypto figures, including Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht and the three BitMEX co-founders, including Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed. The pardons were part of a broader push by Trump-era allies to cultivate a more crypto-friendly stance in Washington. In the wake of the false report, Binance’s native token BNB price surged higher but quickly flattened. BNB went on to hit $650 mark before dropping back to $644 level. BNB is trading at an average price of $644.2 at the press time. On the other hand, the OFFICIAL TRUMP price has taken a 2% hit over the last 24 hours. The price is on a decline, having dropped by 30% in the past 30 days, yet it is up by 655% year to date. TRUMP is trading at an average price of $9.12. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Capital is flowing into BTC as investors react to rising uncertainty, but whales are now rotating part of that capital into DeFi platforms offering consistent income. With volatility likely to persist, smart money is favoring early-stage opportunities that combine passive yield with real protocol utility. One of the most talked-about targets is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in its presale phase at $0.03. Unlike meme-driven speculation, this project is building a revenue-based DeFi protocol with lending infrastructure set to go live at token launch. For large holders seeking non-correlated income, Mutuum’s structure offers a real alternative to volatile price swings. High-Yield Pools and mtToken Compounding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is focused on maximizing real-time interest earnings through its peer-to-contract (P2C) lending model. Users will deposit assets into pooled vaults, where those funds are made available to borrowers in exchange for variable returns. These interest rates will adjust automatically based on utilization, incentivizing new deposits as pool activity increases. Lenders will receive mtTokens, which grow in value over time and reflect both the original deposit and accumulated yield. mtTokens offer a unique benefit — they are not only yield-bearing but also usable within the ecosystem. Users will be able to stake their mtTokens and earn MUTM rewards from the protocol’s revenue. This staking mechanism will deepen liquidity, boost token demand, and provide an additional layer of returns to long-term participants. It is this structure — organic, on-chain income backed by lending activity — that is attracting whale interest. The protocol also introduces peer-to-peer (P2P) lending where borrowers and lenders agree on custom loan terms, including interest rate, collateral type, and duration. This flexibility is rare in existing DeFi protocols and gives users more control. Meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) or Pepe (PEPE) will be accepted as collateral, enabling communities to earn without selling their assets. That expands Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal beyond just institutional users to a broader retail base with capital ready to deploy. Protocol Growth and Future Utility Drivers To ensure platform integrity and long-term functionality, the Mutuum team has already initiated an external audit of the MUTM smart contract. As development progresses through Phases 2 and 3 of the roadmap, the focus will shift to finalizing backend infrastructure, launching a beta version on testnet, and conducting additional external security reviews. The team also plans to expand to Layer-2 networks for better speed and cost efficiency, making the platform more scalable for high-volume users. A major future driver for the ecosystem will be Mutuum’s overcollateralized stablecoin. This asset will be minted only when users borrow against collateral and burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Its $1 peg will be maintained through governance-controlled interest rates, along with arbitrage and liquidation mechanisms. Since the stablecoin supply will reflect real borrowing activity, it will be tightly integrated into the platform’s economy—reinforcing both value integrity and long-term protocol sustainability. The MUTM token will capture protocol value through fee collection and reward distribution. As lending grows, part of the revenue will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them to stakers in the designated contracts. This process will increase staking participation, increase token demand, and drive price appreciation. With the token set to list at $0.06, current buyers at $0.03 stand to gain 100% by launch — with further upside tied to platform growth. Bitcoin (BTC) may remain the centerpiece of crypto macro strategies, but platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer practical, yield-generating alternatives that thrive independently of market cycles. As passive income becomes a priority for whales and early-stage access narrows, the window for high-upside DeFi exposure is closing quickly.

Max Keiser Predicts Major Price Surge,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-supply-shock-ahead-max-keiser-predicts-major-price-surge/,"The post Bitcoin Supply Shock Ahead? Max Keiser Predicts Major Price Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is back in the headlines as Max Keiser, a longtime supporter of the cryptocurrency and advisor to El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, predicts an imminent supply shock that could push prices sharply higher. Keiser joins fellow Bitcoin maximalist and JAN3 CEO, Samson Mow, in warning the market of a looming supply crunch. As demand continues to surge, both believe Bitcoin is nearing a tipping point. Why a Supply Shock Could Be Coming Keiser recently tweeted , “I’ve done the math. A Bitcoin supply shock is imminent,” adding a rocket emoji to suggest prices could skyrocket. A supply shock happens when there’s not enough of something, like Bitcoin, to meet demand, pushing prices up. I’ve done the math. A Bitcoin supply shock is imminent. — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) June 25, 2025 This warning is based on Bitcoin’s fixed supply limit of 21 million coins, with nearly 20 million already mined. Every four years, a pre-programmed event called a halving reduces the number of new Bitcoins generated. The most recent halving in April 2024 slashed the block reward to 3.125 BTC, cutting the rate at which new coins enter circulation. The next halving in 2028 will tighten supply even further – a major factor in Keiser’s prediction. Demand Is Heating Up Fast Samson Mow, who has long maintained that Bitcoin could eventually reach $1 million, first predicted this supply shock earlier in January 2024, right after U.S. regulators approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. He also warned about a potential demand shock. With institutions and investors rapidly buying up Bitcoin, demand could soon outpace supply. This dual shock – limited new coins and rising demand – could send prices soaring. Big Corporations Are Buying Bitcoin Fast Institutional adoption isn’t slowing down. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has raised funds through convertible debt and now holds 592,345 BTC , making it the second-largest holder after BlackRock. Other firms are joining the trend. Metaplanet, based in Japan, and the newly launched ProCap BTC, founded by crypto investor Anthony Pompliano , have also started accumulating Bitcoin for their treasuries. Bitcoin advocate Adam Livingston recently commented that supply is shrinking as major companies and ETFs buy in quickly, while everyday holders are selling. That kind of imbalance could trigger a major shift in the market. BTC treasury companies are buying up too much of the float and retail is selling to the institutions this year… at a crazy pace. The changing of the hands is here. Strategy is gobbling up weeks of the miner supply at a time some weeks. Supply shock is inevitable. — Adam Livingston (@AdamBLiv) June 25, 2025 Where Is Bitcoin Headed Next? With new supply slowing and large-scale buyers continuing to accumulate, Keiser and Mow believe a breakout could be near. The combination of a fixed supply, growing institutional interest, and global adoption by countries like El Salvador makes for a powerful setup. While the future remains uncertain, the fundamentals are aligning in a way that suggests Bitcoin’s next move could be significant. For investors, this moment may present one of the biggest opportunities yet.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-25 10:00:48

Since ChatGPT’s release in late 2022, the conversational AI market has surged, projected to reach nearly $50 billion globally by 2031. In this rapidly expanding sector, one company, Synthflow AI , is distinguishing itself not just by participating, but by setting a new standard for enterprise-grade voice AI. For those who appreciate the efficiency and innovation seen in the cryptocurrency space, Synthflow AI’s approach to automating customer interactions represents a similar leap forward in business operations. The Rise of Conversational AI: Why Synthflow AI Stands Out The explosion of interest in AI has created a crowded field, especially within the conversational AI segment. Many companies are vying for attention, but Synthflow AI has managed to cut through the noise with a clear focus: delivering robust, enterprise-ready voice solutions that are also remarkably easy to implement. Launched in 2023, this Berlin-based company offers a no-code platform that allows businesses to build and deploy customized, white-labeled voice AI customer service agents. This accessibility, combined with its powerful capabilities, has enabled Synthflow AI to amass over 1,000 customers and handle more than 45 million calls in a short period. Pioneering Enterprise AI Solutions: A Deep Dive into Synthflow’s Technology Developing truly effective voice AI for businesses presents unique challenges, particularly in real-time interactions. As Hakob Astabatsyan, co-founder and CEO of Synthflow, explained, achieving seamless, human-like conversations with minimal latency and interruption handling is a complex task. Synthflow AI has embraced this challenge, dedicating its efforts to perfecting these intricate aspects of Voice AI . Their agents boast a mere 400-millisecond latency and are designed to manage interruptions, making interactions feel natural and efficient. For enterprises, compliance and integration are paramount. Synthflow AI addresses these critical needs directly: Compliance: Their voice agents are both HIPAA and GDPR compliant, ensuring data privacy and regulatory adherence. Integrations: The platform offers over 200 integrations with leading enterprise systems, including Salesforce, Twilio, and HubSpot, allowing businesses to seamlessly plug AI agents into existing workflows. This focus on robust integration and compliance positions Synthflow AI as a leading provider of comprehensive AI Solutions for complex business environments. From Vision to Voice: The Genesis of Synthflow AI The journey of Synthflow AI began in early 2023 when co-founders Hakob Astabatsyan, Albert Astabatsyan (CPO), and Sassun Mirzakhan-Saky (CTO) started experimenting with OpenAI’s ChatGPT API. Their initial goal was to explore no-code business applications. They first built a text-to-text AI bot, but it was their venture into voice bots that truly captured their attention. The complexity of real-time voice interaction, with its demands for low latency and interruption management, became a compelling problem to solve. This realization led them to focus exclusively on voice bots, leading to the formation of Synthflow. The team dedicated the rest of 2023 to building their product, launching the first version in early 2024, followed by an enterprise-grade version later that year. This rapid development cycle underscores their commitment to solving a significant market need. Unlocking Growth: Synthflow’s Trajectory in Voice AI Synthflow AI’s dedication to quality and enterprise needs has translated into remarkable growth. The company experienced a 15x increase in size last year and boasts over 90% retention among its enterprise customers. Hakob Astabatsyan highlighted their operational scale, stating, “We process 5 million calls monthly.” This impressive volume and consistent growth have allowed Synthflow to refine its technology and services, continuously improving its voice AI capabilities. To fuel further expansion, Synthflow recently secured a significant $20 million Series A funding round. This round was led by Accel, with participation from existing investors Atlantic Labs and Singular. The capital is earmarked for expanding the team, boosting research and development efforts, and establishing Synthflow’s first U.S. office. Luca Bocchio, a partner at Accel, noted that the founding team’s drive and their early emphasis on enterprise-friendly integrations were key factors in Accel’s decision to invest, recognizing their potential in the competitive Voice AI market. Navigating the Competitive Landscape: What Makes Synthflow’s AI Solutions Resilient? Despite its impressive traction, the Conversational AI category remains highly competitive. Well-funded players like Bret Taylor’s Sierra ($285 million in VC funding) and Bland AI (over $50 million in venture funding) are also active in this space. However, Synthflow AI maintains a clear vision for its future. As Astabatsyan articulated, the company is “in a post-product-market-fit era,” indicating a deep understanding of its customer base and a well-defined product roadmap for the next three to five years. This clarity, combined with their focus on deep technology and extensive integrations for enterprise compliance, differentiates Synthflow AI. Their ability to deliver tangible AI Solutions that meet stringent business requirements, rather than just general-purpose AI, is their core strength. This strategic positioning allows them to thrive even amidst intense competition, proving their resilience and long-term viability in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Synthflow AI is not just another participant in the booming conversational AI market; it is a pioneer demonstrating how specialized, enterprise-focused innovation can lead to substantial success. By tackling the complex challenges of real-time voice interaction with a commitment to compliance, integration, and ease of use, Synthflow AI has carved out a unique and valuable niche. Their impressive growth, strong customer retention, and recent funding underscore their position as a transformative force in automated customer service, poised to redefine how businesses interact with their clients globally.

In his June 24 video analysis, crypto strategist Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) outlined why Dogecoin’s recent bounce from the $0.14 region may mark the beginning of a new uptrend—or the last gasp before breakdown. Dogecoin Hits Critical Zone “We’re hitting a very, very key level, folks,” Kevin stressed. “That being the weekly 200 SMA, the weekly 200 EMA, and again that macro 0.382 Fib.” The confluence of these levels between $0.143 and $0.127 marks what he calls a “make-or-break zone,” and Dogecoin is currently sitting right in the middle of it. The analyst previously entered a swing long position at $0.141, highlighting the area as a strong risk-reward trade zone. “Worst comes to worst, you could throw your stop loss below that level… but the upside is great,” he said. Since then, DOGE has bounced about 6–7%, but the real test lies ahead. Kevin noted that this level has acted as structural support since the end of the 2022–2023 bear market. The macro 0.382 Fibonacci retracement, drawn from Dogecoin’s full bull run top to its bear market bottom, aligns with long-standing trendlines and a weekly demand candle. “This is your zone,” he emphasized. “Mark this off on your charts.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Crash Far From Over? Analyst Reveals The Target Yet despite the recent bounce, Dogecoin remains beneath all its major daily and 4-hour moving averages. The next critical resistance stands at $0.19. “If you can reclaim $0.19 on Dogecoin, you then break back into this range—the $0.19 to $0.26 range,” Kevin explained, calling it the key to any continuation higher. Until then, he cautions against assuming a full reversal is underway: “Let’s not get too crazy here… still a lot of work to do.” The RSI also tells a story. Kevin pointed out that Dogecoin’s weekly RSI has repeatedly bounced off the 38 level throughout the current bull cycle. The coin now hovers just above that zone once again. “Anything below 38 on this weekly RSI is going to be a breakdown of that $0.143 to $0.127 range, which would be very, very sketchy at that point,” he warned. Momentum indicators on multiple time frames are sending mixed signals. The daily chart is flashing oversold conditions, and Kevin’s custom indicator lit up with a buy signal. On the 3-day timeframe, market cipher’s momentum wave is “kind of trying to clip” upward, while money flow is beginning to tick slightly higher. “That three-day candle was very nice,” he added. “That’s the kind you want to see—strong demand candles at major support.” Related Reading: Dogecoin About To Explode? ‘Don’t Send It Too Hard,’ Analyst Warns Still, Kevin urged caution. “If that doesn’t work out and we start to head lower, the daily time frame doesn’t produce the buy signal, doesn’t produce much upside, we start to roll over—then you know your Dogecoin support.” DOGE/BTC Remains The Focus On the DOGE/BTC pair, Kevin noted that Dogecoin has returned to an “orange zone” he previously highlighted as critical support. The strength of that zone may determine whether DOGE can hold relative strength against Bitcoin—or continue to bleed lower as BTC dominance increases. “Doge will follow Bitcoin at the end of the day,” he reiterated. “Anyone not doing their Dogecoin analysis in tandem with Bitcoin and USDT dominance—be suspect of that analysis.” Kevin concluded with a warning rooted in experience. “I’ve been in this game a long time. The first move out of these patterns… sometimes it’s the wrong move. It traps people.” While a reversal may be underway, confirmation is everything—and the climb above $0.19 remains the gatekeeper. For now, Dogecoin teeters on the edge. The signals are there—but so is the risk. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.166.

Key Takeaways: Strategy’s S&P 500 inclusion hinges on Bitcoin staying above $95,240 through June 30. New accounting rules allow BTC gains to count toward earnings, making its price critical for Q2 results. Analyst Jeff Walton gives a 91% chance of inclusion, based on Bitcoin’s historical stability over short timeframes. Financial analyst Jeff Walton said in a video published Tuesday that Strategy has a 91% chance of qualifying for inclusion in the S&P 500, provided Bitcoin’s price does not fall more than 10% before June 30. At the time of his analysis, BTC was trading around $106,044. MicroStrategy’s S&P 500 Bid Hinges on Bitcoin Holding $95K Line Walton pinpointed $95,240 as the critical level; if Bitcoin closes below that threshold, MicroStrategy may fail to meet earnings eligibility criteria. “To be considered for the S&P 500, a company must report cumulative positive earnings across the past four quarters,” Walton explained. Strategy has posted losses in the last three quarters, and with its massive Bitcoin holdings, currently 592,345 BTC, its earnings for Q2 heavily depend on the crypto asset’s fair market value. The stakes are heightened by recent volatility. Over the weekend, Bitcoin dipped below $100,000 amid renewed geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, briefly jeopardizing Strategy’s position. However, prices have since rebounded, with BTC trading near $106,200 as of Wednesday. 91% chance of $MSTR qualifying for S&P in 6 days https://t.co/uGkzAuTQ2Y — Jeff Walton (@PunterJeff) June 24, 2025 Strategy adopted new accounting standards (ASU 2023-08) at the start of 2024, allowing unrealized gains and losses on its Bitcoin stash to be reflected in net income. The change significantly impacts its financial statements and S&P 500 eligibility. Walton’s forecast is based on historical BTC price behavior. Since September 2014, in over 3,900 six-day periods, Bitcoin fell more than 10% just 343 times — or roughly 8.7% of the time. “The longer we go without a drop, the lower the odds get,” Walton noted. For instance, the odds of a 10% fall shrink to 4.2% if only two days remain in the quarter. If successful, Strategy would become the second crypto-related company to join the S&P 500 in 2025, following Coinbase’s inclusion in May. In December 2024, Strategy was added to the Nasdaq-100, joining the ranks of tech giants. Strategy Could Become Top Publicly Traded Company in World In May, Walton said Strategy may one day rise to become the top publicly traded company in the world. Walton believes the company’s unprecedented exposure to Bitcoin gives it a unique edge. “Strategy holds more of the best asset and most pristine collateral on the planet than any other company, by multiples,” he said. As reported, Strategy plans to raise as much as $2.1 billion through the sale of its 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock. The capital raise follows a similar structure to Strategy’s previous fundraising rounds, many of which directly funded large-scale Bitcoin purchases.

It’s a forecast that could have wide-reaching effects, not just on traditional markets, but also on crypto. If history is any guide, a shift like this could mark a major turning point for Bitcoin and other digital assets. Let’s explore why. Rate Cuts Delayed, Not Cancelled Initially, some expected the Fed to begin lowering rates as early as this summer. But that timeline has now shifted. According to Morgan Stanley, the first cut is likely to happen in March 2026. The reason is not hard to guess. Inflation! Specifically, inflation linked to the latest tariff announcements. Michael Gapen, U.S. Chief Economist at Morgan Stanley, explained the shift clearly: “The recent tariff announcement boosts the risk of rising inflation, particularly over the next three to six months… Tariff-induced inflation will keep the Fed on the sidelines.” So, instead of a slow and early easing, Morgan Stanley now expects a more concentrated series of cuts starting next year. What It Means for Crypto and Risk Assets When interest rates fall, borrowing gets cheaper. Liquidity improves. And investors tend to move away from low-yield assets in search of higher returns. That’s where crypto usually enters the picture. This kind of environment has historically fueled growth in riskier markets. After the 2008 financial crisis, low interest rates played a key role in pushing investment into new asset classes – including Bitcoin, which emerged during that very cycle. If Morgan Stanley’s forecast holds, it could pave the way for a similar setup. A low-rate world tends to encourage risk-on behavior, and crypto has long been a top candidate when investors go looking for growth. Bitcoin’s Position Right Now As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $106,476, with a market cap of $2.12 trillion and a 24-hour gain of 0.70%. It currently dominates 64.57% of the entire crypto market. The price action seems normal now, but sentiment is gradually building. With rate cuts on the horizon and Bitcoin ETFs continuing to attract attention, many see this as a key setup for the next phase of adoption. Markets Are Listening, Even If the Fed Isn’t Talking Yet So far, there’s been no official word from the Federal Reserve on this forecast. But that doesn’t mean it’s not being taken seriously. In fact, Morgan Stanley’s call is already sparking conversations across both Wall Street and crypto circles. This could change how portfolios are built and how capital flows into assets like digital currencies. Could This Spark the Next Big Crypto Run? It’s still early, but if the Fed follows the path Morgan Stanley has laid out, it could reignite momentum in crypto markets. Not just for Bitcoin, but for Ethereum, ETFs, and even newer altcoins gaining traction in global hubs like the Cayman Islands. Seven rate cuts over two years is a big move. And in crypto, big moves tend to bring big reactions. For now, it’s a waiting game. But smart investors know the pivot could be coming and they’re already preparing for what happens next.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-25 10:06:46

The tweet consisted solely of a silent emoji, yet it drew significant engagement and attention, amassing over 3 million views within hours. Britto, known for his elusive presence and historical importance to XRP’s origins, had not made public posts in years, making this post stand out immediately. Alongside Britto’s post, crypto commentator NotFinancialAdvice published a tweet that emphasized the specific timing of Britto’s return to public view. NotFinancialAdvice wrote, “Today, 6/23/2025 — THE DAY ARTHUR BRITTO BROKE HIS SILENCE — marks exactly 5,890 days since May 8, 2009, the exact date highlighted in my recent 589 video.” The tweet included a screenshot from a date calculator confirming that the number of days between May 8, 2009, and June 23, 2025, is indeed 5,890. Today, 6/23/2025 — THE DAY ARTHUR BRITTO BROKE HIS SILENCE — marks exactly 5,890 days since May 8 2009, the exact date highlighted in my recent 589 video. https://t.co/aJVrWAJqgV pic.twitter.com/K3mjIJHZTV — NotFinancialAdvice.Crypto (@NFAdotcrypto) June 24, 2025 The Significance of May 8, 2009 The date May 8, 2009, has long held significance within a subset of the XRP community. It is frequently mentioned in speculative theories surrounding the project’s inception, potential price targets, and hidden timelines. In his recent coverage by Times Tabloid , NotFinancialAdvice linked the number “589” to coded messages and potential price targets, referencing data patterns tied to both Bitcoin and XRP. The video explored a theory that 589 is more than a symbolic number and might represent a calculated roadmap or marker within crypto development cycles. The timing of Britto’s tweet, which coincides precisely with the 5,890th day since May 8, 2009, has been presented by NotFinancialAdvice as a potential confirmation or alignment with this long-standing numeric theme. Referencing the 589 XRP Code Theory NotFinancialAdvice’s video in a previous tweet delved into how the number 589 has appeared repeatedly in crypto-related predictions. According to the Times Tabloid article about the video, the commentator suggested that this number might not be coincidental but instead could be linked to a structured timeline involving market movements or insider actions, with May 8, 2009, being a key starting point. This date also precedes the development of many foundational aspects of the XRP Ledger. By drawing a connection between this exact day count and Arthur Britto’s sudden reappearance, NotFinancialAdvice reinforced the notion that the 589 narrative could hold more concrete meaning than previously thought.

At this point, the latest reserve news came from a company listed on Nasdaq called Aurora Mobile. Accordingly, the Chinese company Aurora Mobile has chosen four cryptocurrencies as part of its reserve strategy: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and SUI. Aurora Mobile has approved the investment of up to 20% of the company’s and its consolidated assets’ cash and equivalents in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and SUI. “Aurora Mobile will invest up to 20% of the Company's and its consolidated entities' cash and cash equivalents in cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. These investments may include, but are not limited to, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, SUI and other tokens. This decision reflects the Company's commitment to innovative treasury practices and focus on creating long-term value for shareholders.” Aurora Mobile Chairman Mr. Weidong Luo said: “By investing in digital assets, we increase our portfolio diversification by gaining exposure to cryptocurrencies, an asset class with low correlation to traditional markets. We are also providing a foothold in forward-thinking innovation by keeping up with technological advances that are reshaping global finance.” Yesterday, another Chinese company, Nano Labs, announced that it included BNB as part of its treasury strategy.

If you’ve been following the cryptocurrency space, you know that stablecoins – those digital currencies pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar – have been a hot topic for regulators. Well, get ready for a significant development: the U.S. House of Representatives has officially received the Senate-approved GENIUS Act. This isn’t just another piece of paper; it’s a pivotal moment for stablecoin regulation and could fundamentally reshape how these crucial digital assets operate within the American financial system. What is the GENIUS Act and Why Does it Matter for Stablecoin Regulation? On the afternoon of June 23, the U.S. House of Representatives officially received the GENIUS Act from the Senate, a move widely reported by industry insiders like Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett. This proposed legislation, formally known as the “Generating Innovative and New Information for U.S. Stablecoins” Act, aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework specifically for stablecoin issuers. Its arrival in the House signals a serious commitment from lawmakers to bring clarity and oversight to a rapidly expanding sector of the digital economy. But why is this so important? For years, stablecoins have operated in a regulatory gray area, leading to concerns about consumer protection, financial stability, and potential illicit use. The GENIUS Act seeks to address these concerns head-on by: Requiring Licenses: Stablecoin issuers would need to obtain specific licenses to operate, ensuring they meet certain operational and financial standards. Mandating 100% Reserves: A core tenet of the bill is the requirement for issuers to maintain 100% reserves backing their stablecoins. This means for every digital dollar issued, there must be a corresponding real dollar (or equivalent safe asset) held in reserve. This is crucial for maintaining the peg and preventing bank-run scenarios. Annual Audits: For stablecoin issuers with a market capitalization exceeding $50 billion, annual audits would become mandatory. This provides an additional layer of transparency and accountability, assuring users that reserves are indeed held as claimed. Addressing Foreign Issuers: The bill also outlines specific compliance requirements for foreign stablecoin issuers that wish to operate or serve U.S. customers, ensuring a level playing field and consistent oversight regardless of the issuer’s origin. This comprehensive approach to stablecoin regulation is designed to foster trust and stability, paving the way for broader adoption of these digital assets while mitigating systemic risks. Navigating the New Landscape: Key Requirements for US Stablecoin Issuers For existing and aspiring US stablecoin issuers, the GENIUS Act represents a significant shift. No longer will they be able to operate without clear guidelines. The emphasis on 100% reserves and regular audits aims to prevent situations where stablecoins lose their peg due to insufficient backing, as seen in past market events. This level of scrutiny, while potentially challenging for some, is ultimately intended to benefit the entire ecosystem by building confidence among users and institutions. Consider the implications for compliance teams. They will need to: Requirement Impact on Issuers Benefit to Ecosystem Licensing Formal application processes, stricter operational standards. Ensures only credible entities operate, enhances trust. 100% Reserves Requires robust asset management and segregation. Guarantees stablecoin peg, prevents systemic risk. Annual Audits (for >$50B MC) Increased transparency, external verification of assets. Builds investor confidence, deters fraudulent practices. Foreign Issuer Compliance Extends U.S. regulatory reach, prevents arbitrage. Protects U.S. consumers from unregulated foreign entities. This structured approach ensures that any US stablecoin operating within or serving the U.S. market adheres to a high standard of financial integrity and transparency. It’s a clear signal that lawmakers are serious about integrating digital assets into the traditional financial system responsibly. The Road Ahead: Impact on Crypto Legislation and Digital Asset Policy The passage of the GENIUS Act through the Senate and its reception by the House marks a significant milestone in the broader landscape of crypto legislation . It demonstrates a growing consensus among lawmakers that comprehensive regulation is necessary for the long-term health and growth of the digital asset industry. While this bill specifically targets stablecoins, its principles and the legislative momentum it carries could influence future bills concerning other types of cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and decentralized finance (DeFi). This movement towards formalizing digital asset policy is not isolated. Globally, nations are grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies effectively. The U.S. has often been seen as lagging in this area compared to some European or Asian counterparts. The GENIUS Act, however, could position the U.S. as a leader in establishing clear, robust frameworks for stablecoins, potentially setting a precedent for other jurisdictions. What does this mean for the future of digital assets? We can expect: Increased Institutional Adoption: Regulatory clarity often paves the way for greater participation from traditional financial institutions, who require legal certainty to engage with crypto. Enhanced Consumer Protection: With clearer rules and oversight, consumers are better protected from fraud and mismanagement. Innovation with Guardrails: While regulation can sometimes be seen as stifling, a well-designed framework can actually encourage innovation by providing a stable and predictable environment for businesses to build within. The journey for the GENIUS Act isn’t over yet. It still needs to pass the House and be signed into law by the President. However, its progress so far indicates a strong likelihood of it becoming law, fundamentally altering the operating environment for stablecoins. Challenges and Opportunities: What’s Next for Stablecoins? While the GENIUS Act brings much-needed clarity, it also presents challenges. Issuers may face increased compliance costs and operational hurdles. Smaller issuers might find it difficult to meet the stringent reserve and audit requirements, potentially leading to market consolidation. However, these challenges are often two sides of the same coin when it comes to opportunities. For those who can adapt, the opportunities are immense: Market Credibility: Compliant stablecoins will gain significant credibility, making them more attractive for payments, remittances, and as a safe haven asset within the crypto ecosystem. Broader Integration: With regulatory blessings, stablecoins could see deeper integration into mainstream financial applications, from e-commerce to cross-border payments. Reduced Uncertainty: A clear regulatory path removes much of the guesswork and legal risk that has historically plagued the crypto industry, allowing businesses to plan and invest with greater confidence. The legislative process is often slow, but the reception of the GENIUS Act by the House is a powerful signal. It tells us that lawmakers are actively working to create a more secure and predictable environment for digital assets. For anyone involved in or interested in the crypto space, staying informed about these developments is not just recommended, it’s essential. The U.S. House’s reception of the Senate-approved GENIUS Act marks a significant and potentially historic step towards comprehensive stablecoin regulation in the United States. With its focus on licensing, 100% reserves, and rigorous audits, the bill aims to instill greater trust and stability in the burgeoning stablecoin market. This pivotal piece of crypto legislation will undoubtedly shape the future of US stablecoin operations and set a precedent for broader digital asset policy . While challenges in compliance may arise for issuers, the long-term benefits of clarity, enhanced consumer protection, and increased institutional adoption promise a more robust and secure digital financial landscape. The journey of the GENIUS Act is a testament to the evolving relationship between innovation and regulation, signaling a maturing phase for the cryptocurrency industry.

The landmark operation , which began with Tether freezing 39 suspicious wallet addresses in late 2023, culminated in a multi-day “investigative sprint” where Coinbase analysts worked alongside Secret Service agents to trace millions in crypto transactions back to illicit wallets and identify over 130 defrauded customers. Coinbase helped drive a major law enforcement win: the U.S. Secret Service has seized $225M in stolen crypto tied to pig butchering scams—and is returning funds to victims.

Romance to Robbery: Inside the $225M Pig Butchering Network These “ pig butchering ” schemes typically begin with fake romantic or business relationships cultivated over months before manipulating victims into transferring life savings to crypto wallets controlled by criminal syndicates. These operations typically originate from retrofitted casinos and hotels in Southeast Asia, particularly in areas controlled by groups like the recently sanctioned Karen National Army (KNA) , which the U.S. Treasury designated as a transnational criminal organization for facilitating vast criminal ecosystems. @USTreasury sanctions Karen National Army and leaders for orchestrating billion-dollar crypto scams and human trafficking networks, targeting transnational cybercrime and protecting victims worldwide. #Cybercrime #CryptoScams https://t.co/zTL5IVgalX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 5, 2025 The KNA’s territory in Burma’s Karen State serves as a hub where trafficked individuals are forced to work in scam compounds, creating fake online identities and posing as romantic interests or financial advisors to lure American victims into crypto investment schemes. Victims are gradually introduced to fake trading platforms displaying fabricated profits designed to encourage larger investments. Scammers often provide small initial returns to build credibility before requesting substantial transfers that disappear once the emotional and financial hooks are deeply set. The global scale of these operations becomes evident through statistics showing pig butchering losses escalated from $2 billion in 2022 to $3.5 billion in 2023, with 2024 marking another record year at $3.6 billion, according to Web3 security firm Cyvers .

Blockchain Forensics Revolution Brings Justice Through Transparency Coinbase’s forensic capabilities enabled investigators to trace the complex transactions connecting stolen funds through multiple exchanges and wallet addresses. The technical process of fund recovery also involved direct cooperation between Tether and law enforcement. The stablecoin issuer burned the original $225 million in frozen USDT and reissued equivalent tokens to a Secret Service-controlled wallet for victim distribution. This “burn and reissue” mechanism provided real-time transparency visible on-chain.

The affected individuals can submit claims using reference code “BT06182025” and transaction history proving they sent funds to scam-related addresses. While law enforcement successes demonstrate significant progress in combating crypto crime, investors must recognize that personal vigilance and security best practices remain the most effective defense.

Investors should implement hardware security keys instead of SMS-based two-factor authentication, establish separate devices and email addresses for financial operations, and practice deliberate verification of urgent or exclusive investment opportunities. Most importantly, the speed of crypto transactions means there’s rarely time for second chances.

Bitcoin dropped below $100K, and several altcoins, including Ethereum, Hyperliquid, Cardano, and Virtuals, plunged 20–30%. But on the contrary, whales and institutions are buying aggressively. Altcoin Buzz discussed this behavior in a recent video, highlighting how smart money is taking advantage of the dip while retail sentiment turns negative. Whales Are Buying the Dip Bitcoin, in particular, is showing strong signs of accumulation. Wallets holding 10 BTC or more are increasing while smaller wallets are shrinking. When large wallets are buying and retail investors are losing confidence, it is the perfect setup for bullish momentum to return to the crypto market.

MicroStrategy also added another $26 million worth of Bitcoin recently. Bitcoin ETFs have almost bought $1 billion BTC in the past 2 days. On June 24, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $589 million in net inflows, marking the 11th straight day of gains. Bitcoin ETFs are buying 3x more than the weekly mined supply, a clear sign that a supply shock may be coming soon. LINK and ADA See Heavy Accumulation Chainlink is also catching the attention of big investors. While most projects drop in price after a token unlock, LINK often sees a price rise. Whales are buying even at higher prices. Data from Santiment shows that LINK jumped 11% today as the number of holders hit a new all-time high at 769,380. Additionally, active wallets over the past year are down 17.3% which shows that long-term holders see this as a prime buying opportunity.

Whales and institutions are aggressively buying dips, seeing current volatility as a prime accumulation opportunity. They are positioning for future bullish momentum while retail sentiment turns negative. What does the increasing accumulation by large wallets mean for Bitcoin? The increase in wallets holding 10 BTC or more, combined with shrinking smaller wallets, suggests a redistribution of Bitcoin to strong hands, often a precursor to bullish market momentum. How does corporate Bitcoin buying influence its price? Corporate Bitcoin purchases, especially via ETFs, significantly influence price by increasing demand and reducing liquid supply. Companies like MicroStrategy building large reserves demonstrate strong conviction, though direct treasury purchases can have a nuanced impact compared to ETF inflows.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|LINK|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-25 11:38:40

Imagine a future where AI models are not just powerful but also fair, censorship-resistant, and community-owned. This is precisely the vision driving Sahara AI , a groundbreaking decentralized AI and blockchain platform that’s setting the stage for a new paradigm in AI development and deployment. If you’ve been following the convergence of these two transformative technologies, then the recent unveiling of the SAHARA tokenomics is a development you won’t want to miss. It’s not just about a new token; it’s about the fundamental mechanics that will power a truly decentralized AI ecosystem, complete with significant allocations for community growth and engagement. Understanding Sahara AI: Pioneering Decentralized AI What exactly is Sahara AI , and why is its approach to artificial intelligence so significant? At its core, Sahara AI is building a robust infrastructure that leverages the inherent strengths of blockchain to address some of the most pressing challenges in traditional AI. Think about the current landscape: AI development often relies on centralized data silos, opaque algorithms, and controlled computational resources. This can lead to issues of bias, lack of transparency, and limited access for independent developers and smaller entities. Sahara AI aims to dismantle these barriers by creating a decentralized network where data, computational power, and AI models can be accessed and utilized in a permissionless, secure, and verifiable manner. This isn’t just a theoretical concept; it’s about practical applications that democratize AI. By building on a blockchain platform , Sahara AI ensures that every interaction, every data license, and every model inference is recorded immutably, fostering trust and accountability that is often absent in centralized systems. The platform envisions a future where anyone, anywhere, can contribute to or benefit from AI innovation without needing to rely on large tech conglomerates. Whether you’re an AI researcher seeking diverse datasets, a developer looking for specific computational power, or a business wanting to integrate cutting-edge AI services, Sahara AI strives to be your go-to decentralized hub. This fundamental shift towards a community-driven and transparent AI ecosystem is what makes Sahara AI a project to watch closely. Deep Dive into SAHARA Tokenomics: A Blueprint for Growth The lifeblood of any decentralized ecosystem is its native token, and for Sahara AI, that’s the SAHARA token. The recently unveiled SAHARA tokenomics provide a clear roadmap for how this token will fuel the platform’s growth, incentivize participation, and ensure long-term sustainability. With a total supply capped at 10 billion tokens, the allocation strategy is designed to balance development, community engagement, and investor interests. Let’s break down the distribution in detail: Allocation Category Percentage Purpose and Significance Ecosystem Development 33.93% This substantial portion is dedicated to fostering the growth of the Sahara AI ecosystem. It will fund grants for developers building dApps and tools, support research and development, facilitate strategic partnerships, and invest in infrastructure improvements. This ensures the platform continuously evolves and attracts top talent. Community Incentives 20.75% A significant allocation to reward active community members. This includes incentives for content creation, participation in forums, bug bounties, educational programs, and other initiatives that drive engagement and adoption. A strong, vibrant community is crucial for a decentralized project’s success. Early Investors 19.75% Acknowledges the crucial role of early backers who provided initial capital and belief in the project’s vision. Their support enabled the foundational development of Sahara AI. Core Contributors 15% Allocated to the founding team and key developers. This portion often comes with vesting schedules, ensuring long-term commitment and alignment of interests between the team and the community. Airdrops 8.15% A dedicated portion for distributing tokens directly to a broader audience, serving as a powerful tool for initial distribution, increasing awareness, and decentralizing token ownership. We’ll delve deeper into the significance of this in the next section. Buidlpad Community Distribution 1.42% A specific allocation for the Buidlpad community, indicating a strategic partnership or launchpad initiative aimed at expanding reach and initial adoption within a focused group. Liquidity and Market Stability 1% Essential for ensuring healthy trading on decentralized and centralized exchanges. This allocation helps provide sufficient liquidity, reducing price volatility and enabling smooth transactions for users. This balanced distribution reflects a thoughtful approach to building a sustainable and thriving ecosystem. The emphasis on ecosystem development and community incentives underscores Sahara AI’s commitment to a truly decentralized, community-driven future. Why Decentralized AI Matters: Empowering Innovation The concept of decentralized AI is more than just a buzzword; it’s a paradigm shift that promises to democratize access to AI and foster unprecedented innovation. In a world increasingly reliant on AI, moving beyond centralized control is vital. Here’s why Sahara AI’s focus on decentralized AI is so impactful: Transparency and Auditability: On a blockchain, every transaction and data interaction is recorded. This means you can verify the provenance of data used for AI training, audit how models were developed, and even track their usage. This transparency builds trust and helps combat bias in AI. Permissionless Access: Traditional AI resources are often gated. Sahara AI aims to provide open access to computational power, datasets, and pre-trained models. This levels the playing field, allowing small teams and individual developers to compete with larger corporations. Censorship Resistance: By distributing resources across a decentralized network, Sahara AI mitigates single points of failure and censorship. No single entity can shut down access to an AI model or dataset. Fair Compensation: Through token-based incentives, contributors (data providers, model developers, compute providers) can be fairly compensated for their contributions, fostering a robust marketplace of AI resources. The SAHARA token is the linchpin for this decentralized vision, facilitating a wide array of core utilities: Accessing or licensing data for AI model training: Imagine a marketplace where data owners can securely license their datasets for AI training, ensuring fair compensation and data integrity. Obtaining usage rights for pre-trained AI models: Developers can easily find and license existing AI models, accelerating their development process without starting from scratch. Securing computational resources for model development, deployment, and inference: Need powerful GPUs for training a complex AI model? SAHARA tokens can be used to access decentralized computing power, democratizing access to high-performance computing. Making per-inference payments, enabling granular and usage-based pricing for AI services: This is a game-changer for AI services. Instead of large subscriptions, users pay only for what they use, making AI services more accessible and efficient. Paying gas fees on the Sahara blockchain: Like any blockchain, SAHARA tokens are used to cover transaction costs, ensuring the network operates smoothly and securely. Staking tokens to help secure the network: Holders can stake their SAHARA tokens to participate in the network’s consensus mechanism, earning rewards while contributing to its security and stability. Participating in governance by voting on proposals to shape the ecosystem’s future: SAHARA token holders have a say in the platform’s evolution, voting on key decisions, upgrades, and future developments, embodying true decentralization. These utilities collectively paint a picture of a self-sustaining ecosystem where every participant contributes to and benefits from the growth of decentralized AI. Unlock Opportunities: The SAHARA Token Airdrops and Community Incentives One of the most exciting aspects of the SAHARA tokenomics for the wider crypto community is the substantial 8.15% allocation for AI airdrops . Why are airdrops such a powerful tool, and what does this mean for potential participants? Airdrops serve multiple strategic purposes for a new project: Broad Distribution: They help distribute tokens to a wide range of users, fostering decentralization from day one and preventing token concentration in a few hands. Awareness and Adoption: Airdrops generate significant buzz and introduce the project to a larger audience, attracting new users who might not have otherwise discovered Sahara AI. Rewarding Early Adopters: Often, airdrops target early supporters, community members, or users of related ecosystems, rewarding their initial belief and participation. Community Building: By giving tokens directly to potential users, projects can create a strong, engaged community that has a vested interest in the platform’s success. The 8.15% allocation signifies Sahara AI’s commitment to building a robust and engaged community from the ground up. Coupled with the 20.75% earmarked for community incentives, it’s clear that Sahara AI values its users and contributors as foundational to its success. These incentives will likely include rewards for active participation, content creation, bug bounties, and other initiatives that encourage genuine engagement with the platform. For those looking to get involved with cutting-edge AI and blockchain projects, keeping an eye on Sahara AI’s airdrop announcements and community programs will be paramount. This isn’t just free tokens; it’s an invitation to become an integral part of a revolutionary movement in decentralized AI. The Future of AI on a Blockchain Platform: Sahara AI’s Vision As we look ahead, the trajectory of Sahara AI appears poised for significant impact. The detailed SAHARA tokenomics , with their strategic allocations, lay a solid foundation for sustainable growth and a truly decentralized future for artificial intelligence. The vision extends beyond just building a platform; it’s about cultivating an ecosystem where innovation thrives, data is secure, and AI is accessible to all. Imagine a future where AI research isn’t bottlenecked by centralized computing power or proprietary datasets, but rather flourishes on an open, permissionless network powered by the SAHARA token. The emphasis on governance, where token holders can vote on proposals, ensures that the platform evolves in a direction that benefits its community. This decentralized governance model is crucial for long-term resilience and adaptability in the rapidly changing landscapes of both AI and blockchain. Furthermore, the ability to stake SAHARA tokens not only secures the network but also provides a mechanism for participants to earn passive income, aligning economic incentives with network health and security. This symbiotic relationship between users, developers, and the core platform is what will drive Sahara AI’s continued success and adoption. Sahara AI isn’t just creating a new token; it’s architecting the very infrastructure upon which the next generation of AI applications will be built. By solving critical issues like data access, computational resource allocation, and fair compensation through a decentralized model, Sahara AI is positioning itself as a leader in the inevitable convergence of AI and blockchain. For anyone invested in the future of technology, understanding how projects like Sahara AI are shaping this landscape is not just insightful, but essential. In conclusion, Sahara AI’s comprehensive tokenomics reveal a meticulously planned strategy to power a truly decentralized AI and blockchain ecosystem. With a robust allocation for ecosystem development, generous community incentives, and a significant commitment to AI airdrops , the SAHARA token is designed to be the backbone of a new era of transparent, accessible, and community-driven artificial intelligence. As the platform continues to develop, its potential to revolutionize how we interact with and build AI will undoubtedly be a fascinating story to watch unfold.

The short-term momentum has turned bullish, but SOL is approaching a crucial resistance zone between $146.75 and $151. With volatility compressing and major EMAs aligning overhead, traders are closely watching for a breakout confirmation. What’s Happening With Solana’s Price? SOLUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The Solana price bounced aggressively from the $126.50 lower Bollinger Band support on June 22, forming a V-shaped recovery into the $146 zone. On the 4-hour chart, SOL is now pressing against a confluence of resistance, including the 100 EMA ($146.75), 200 EMA ($151.30), and the upper Bollinger Band ($151.71). SOLUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The Supertrend flipped bullish at $136.95, and price has since maintained its position above that level.

While the claims garnered significant attention, legal expert Bill Morgan quickly stepped in to correct the record. Reacting to Karla’s post, Morgan clarified: “The settlement was not just proposed. A settlement agreement was signed by Ripple in April and approved by the SEC in early May. ” His statement made it clear that the agreement was already finalized weeks ago, and the only remaining step is judicial approval by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres. The settlement was not just proposed. A settlement agreement was signed by Ripple in April and approved by the SEC in early May. https://t.co/P7iiXHLjmW — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 25, 2025 The True Settlement Breakdown The $50 million figure circulating in posts and headlines refers to Ripple’s finalized civil penalty as part of a larger escrow structure. In August 2024, Judge Torres ordered Ripple to place $125 million in escrow following her ruling that institutional sales of XRP constituted unregistered securities offerings. By April 2025, after lengthy negotiations, Ripple proposed a significantly lower fine of $10 million. However, both parties ultimately agreed to a $50 million penalty, which Ripple will pay out of the escrowed funds. The remaining $75 million will be returned to Ripple. This resolution does not involve any new or additional payment by Ripple; it is a reallocation of the existing escrow. The settlement also includes a request to lift the injunction that currently restricts Ripple from conducting institutional sales of XRP. If approved by the court, this would allow Ripple to resume those activities under clearly defined legal parameters. Clarity on the SEC’s Appeal In addition to the financial terms, another key aspect of the legal narrative revolves around the SEC’s previous attempt to challenge Judge Torres’s July 2023 ruling. That ruling declared that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP, that is, those conducted via public exchanges to retail investors, did not constitute securities transactions. The court only found violations in institutional sales, which involved direct sales to sophisticated investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In October 2024, the SEC filed a notice of appeal, aiming to overturn portions of the ruling, including the programmatic sales judgment. However, in a significant reversal, the agency withdrew its appeal in March 2025, effectively conceding that programmatic XRP sales fall outside the scope of securities regulation. Ripple, in turn, dropped its cross-appeal. Legal Closure on the Horizon Now, all eyes are on Judge Torres, who must decide whether to approve the terms of the settlement. A favorable ruling could mark the end of a legal battle that began in December 2020 and has since shaped the broader regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. Bill Morgan’s timely correction underscores the importance of legal accuracy and informed analysis, particularly in high-profile crypto litigation. With the SEC no longer contesting Ripple’s retail XRP sales and the $50 million institutional penalty heading toward final approval, Ripple appears poised to close one of the most consequential chapters in its corporate history.

However, a recent Bybit report reveals a shift in sentiment, with XRP standing out as a strong altcoin contender. From November to May, XRP holdings on the platform more than doubled, and its price surged by 338%, from $0.50 to $2.19. This rise came as legal pressures between Ripple vs SEC eased , boosting confidence among retail and institutional investors. Despite the broader market favoring Bitcoin, XRP is now gaining momentum as traders begin shifting focus to its growing potential. XRP ETF Approval Hopes Fuel NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 Another boost came from speculation over an XRP spot ETF . According to prediction platform Polymarket, there’s an 85% chance of approval this year. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart is even more optimistic, placing the odds at 95%. Although President Trump’s comments about XRP becoming part of a U.S. crypto reserve didn’t pan out, they still helped fuel interest. Bybit noted that XRP’s holding percentage jumped from 1.29% to 2.42% in just six months. Bitcoin Remains King Despite XRP’s impressive gains , Bitcoin remains the clear market leader. Bybit’s data shows that 30.95% of assets held by users are in BTC. For every $1 of ETH held, there’s $4 in BTC. Bitcoin dominance has risen from 53.2% to 64% over the past year, while Ether’s share dropped from 18% to 9%. The concentration of BTC and ETH fell to 48.2% in early 2025 but bounced back to 58.8% by May, showing strong investor confidence. Institutions Still Opting for BTC and ETH The report reveals a clear divide between institutional and retail investor strategies. As of May 2025, retail traders held just 11.64% in BTC and 6.8% in ETH, nearly half the institutional holdings. This gap points to the cautious approach institutions take, favoring regulated large caps, while retail players remain more experimental. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Two ‘Whale Approved’ Altcoins To Buy Now , Altseason Delayed? Altcoins have struggled recently, with the Altcoin Season Index dropping to 12 after stabilising at 17, its lowest in two years. Interest in smaller cryptocurrencies dropped sharply, from 35.2% in November to 23.5% in May. Meme coins and DeFi tokens held up relatively well, but AI tokens, GameFi, and NFTs saw declines. Despite Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high in May, altcoins failed to rally, suggesting that the traditional “altseason” is either delayed or canceled for now. This signals a strong Bitcoin season, where BTC outperforms top 50 altcoins. Institutions are favoring major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, pouring capital into ETFs and related investment products instead of rotating into smaller altcoins. Hopes for an altcoin rally have faded for now, as big players stick to the more established names. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The majority of the top 100 coins have dropped over the past 24 hours. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has fallen by 1.6% in that period to $3.4 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $99.8 billion. TLDR: The crypto market makes a turn back into red; Most top 100 coins saw price drops: BTC and ETH appreciated less than 1% each, trading at $106,413 and $2,443, respectively; Markets reacted to de-escalation in the Middle East, with higher-risk assets benefiting; ’Some are focused on short-term corrections, but Bitcoin is ultimately on the rise’; The market remains cautious; Geopolitical risks persists, as does the risk of investors turning away from risk assets. Crypto Winners & Losers Six of the top 10 coins per market cap are up, but with low increases of less than 1% per coin. Bitcoin (BTC) appreciated by 0.7%, now trading at $106,413. This is up from $101,924 seen two days ago. Furthermore, Ethereum (ETH) appreciated by 0.8%, changing hands at $2,443. It’s one of the category’s best performers again today. Lido Staked Ether (STETH) and Tron (TRX) also recorded a 0.8% rise each. XRP (XRP) recorded the highest decrease in this category of 0.7% to the price of $2.18. Moreover, the majority of the top 100 coins saw their prices drop over the past day. The highest decrease among these is Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL)’s 8.5% to $1.56. On the other hand, Pi Network (PI) appreciated the most today: 13.4% to $0.5998. This is the only double-digit change in this category. Aptos (APT) follows with a 9% rise to $4.83. Notably, the market has cooled off following several positive news seen yesterday. The prices saw a swift uptick yesterday after Japan’s Financial Services Agency proposed to reclassify digital assets under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, which could cut crypto taxes from 55% to 20% and increase chances for spot ETFs.

The fragile agreement seems to be holding for now, though the information coming from Israel, the US, and Iran is not exactly clear. At the same time, Israel has continued the genocide in Gaza.

That said, the dip is “not a long-term concern and is merely a distraction from Bitcoin’s true trajectory,” Harz says. “While some are fixated on short-term corrections, it is undeniable that Bitcoin, and particularly Bitcoin DeFi, is ultimately on the rise.” It’s certain that Bitcoin is actively maturing and entering a phase defined by institutional adoption, clearer regulation, and rapid technological progress, he says. This is because Bitcoin’s utility, says Harz. Institutions don’t just want to hold Bitcoin, but put it to work too. Moreover, Gadi Chait, Head of Investment at Xapo Bank , argued that Bitcoin’s safe-haven asset status is still taking shape. However, “recent signals suggest it’s edging closer.” “Traditionally seen as volatile, Bitcoin’s response to recent macro shocks, like the events in the Middle East, has been notably restrained, neither tracking gold perfectly nor mirroring equity sell-offs,” says Chait. Geopolitical shocks often trigger an initial flight to cash, but Chait says that “the combination of institutional rallies and macro-driven bids now means that dips are shallower and recoveries faster than in previous cycles.” “In recent market downturns, Bitcoin’s relatively shallow pullbacks, which have been paired with consistent institutional inflows, point to a shift in perception. Its increasing correlation with gold suggests it’s being viewed as a store of value, while on the other hand, its rapid rebounds reflect its growing integration into mainstream finance,” Chait concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $106,413. Over the last day, the price gradually increased from the daily low of $104,854 to the intraday high of $106,691. The coin has surpassed the $106,000 level. Investors now wait to see if it will break the $107,500 level next, or possibly drop below $104,000. These moves would open doors for further price rises or drops. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,443.

This marks a major step for XRPL, which is working to compete more directly with blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Updates and Bug Fixes One of the release’s most notable features is support for batch transactions. This allows multiple requests to be grouped and processed together as a single unit, improving efficiency and enabling complex multistep operations. Another key update adds escrow support for RLUSD and other crypto assets on XRPL. Escrows can now interact with trustline-based tokens as well as multi-purpose ones. This enables automated and secure payouts, which can be useful for setting up vesting schedules and managing deposits within applications. Version 2.5.0 also introduces permissioned decentralized exchange (DEX) controls and permission delegation. The former gives developers control over who can participate in exchanges, helping projects meet regulatory requirements. The latter allows users to provide specific access rights to another wallet, offering more account management and automation flexibility. Furthermore, the update brings several bug fixes affecting RPC responses for tem codes and NFT interactions with trustlines. Vet, a popular XRPL validator, said these changes will make its software run faster, more efficiently, and more stably. New Features and Improvements The XRPL software update has also brought new features and enhancements to improve performance, reliability, and developer experience. The network can now handle more transactions simultaneously, and the relay logic has improved. XRPL Commons has also been added as a trusted bootstrap cluster, which supports better network connectivity. In addition, the upgrade fixes an issue related to conflicting signing methods by improving how the system handles transactions from accounts using multiple signers. Other changes include better memory usage, reduced duplicate network traffic, faster build times, clearer documentation, and updated developer tools. Build instructions have also been improved for systems using Ubuntu 22.04 and above. Leading up to the update, daily XRPL addresses soared seven times, jumping from around 40,000 to nearly 295,000. Meanwhile, whale wallets also set a new record by hitting an all-time high of 2,708, the largest number in the network’s 12-year history. This growth comes as other blockchains like Solana face declining metrics, including a $2.5 billion capital outflow and a 90% drop in DEX volume since its January peak of $36 billion. The platform is also facing reduced meme coin activity due to competitors like BNB Chain. Ethereum has also been affected by scalability issues, leading to congestion and high gas fees during peak periods. Following the upgrade, XRP has gained nearly 6% and is trading at $2.20.

Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 532,100 followers on the social media platform X that after a correction into the $90,000 range, Bitcoin may soon increase more than 60% from its current value. “$95,000 would make sense structurally. Then $170,000 is closer than you think.” TechDev’s bullish case is based on several indicators. He believes Bitcoin’s cycles have been correlated to the performance of the overall macroeconomy. Based on his chart and historical patterns, the analyst suggests the business cycle is bottoming and may start to increase, which has coincided with massive Bitcoin rallies in 2013, 2017 and 2021, when the flagship crypto asset hit the cycle peaks. “Re-evaluate your top calls.” Source: TechDev/X TechDev also uses the copper-to-gold ratio as a reliable signal pointing to a likely massive Bitcoin surge. The copper/gold ratio, often viewed as a proxy for economic risk appetite, has formed a bottom similar to 2020 and 2016, which preceded BTC bull runs, the analyst says. “The steep part lies ahead.” Source: TechDev/X The analyst previously said the M2 money supply’s year-over-year change is pointing to a brewing Bitcoin surge. The global M2 money supply – a key indicator of liquidity in the world’s financial system – has shifted from negative to positive annual growth. According to the analyst, this shift has historically preceded each of Bitcoin’s parabolic rallies by six to ten months, indicating a strong likelihood that a new upward cycle is approaching.

On Tuesday, Vance took to X to ask the Fed chair about pausing rate cuts, writing, “I’d love to hear an argument for why Powell cut rates 50 points right before an election but can’t do it now with inflation lower.” I’d love to hear an argument for why Powell cut rates 50 points right before an election but can’t do it now with inflation lower. — JD Vance (@JDVance) June 24, 2025 Powell is facing immense pressure from President Donald Trump, Republican lawmakers, and now the vice president himself. In a May interview with Fox News, Vance said he respected Powell individually, but argued that the Fed Chair has “been wrong about almost everything.” He accused Powell of acting too slowly during the Biden administration’s inflation surge and now, in his view, of failing to act decisively enough in supporting the Trump administration’s economic plans. Powell defends wait-and-see approach In his appearance before the House Financial Services Committee, Powell told policymakers that inflation may have eased, but “uncertain” economic conditions justify holding off on rate cuts. “ For the time being, we are well-positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance ,” Powell said during his testimony. Yet, the Fed chair admitted that it was unclear if the effects would be temporary or longer-lasting. “ The (Fed’s) obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, ” Powell stated, “ and to prevent a one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem .” Republican lawmakers are frustrated with the central bank’s reluctance to act. Representative Bill Huizenga of Michigan pressed Powell to explain why the Fed has not joined other global central banks in cutting rates. “Why aren’t you doing what the rest of the world is doing?” Huizenga asked. Powell responded that, going by the current data, a case could be made for rate cuts. “ If you just look in the rear-view mirror, you could make a good argument ,” he reckoned. “ The reason we’re not is that forecasters do expect a meaningful increase in inflation (from tariffs) in the course of the year. ” Trump administration continues personal attacks on Federal Reserve hierarchy Conservatives, including Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, believe the inflation risks Powell has cited are largely hypothetical. Lawler argued that any price spike from tariffs or oil should be short-lived. “What is the reason not to cut rates?” he pressed. “It’s the uncertainty about the size and potential persistence of those price increases,” the central bank chair responded. President Trump, who appointed Powell during his first term, has made it clear on several occasions that he does not approve of the decisions the Fed Chair has been making. “ Well, the Bank of England cut, China cut, everybody’s cutting but him ,” Trump said in a press briefing back in May. “We’ll see what happens. It’s a shame. I call him ‘Too Late.’” The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation currently sits at 2.3%, only slightly above its 2% target. Powell noted that while the job growth rate is cooling, unemployment is at a low of 4.2%, adding that the overall economy is in “a solid position.” Wall Street is betting that rate cuts are only a matter of time. Morgan Stanley forecasts as many as seven rate reductions by 2026, bringing the benchmark rate down to a range of 2.5% to 2.75%. Prediction markets are also leaning toward cuts in the near term. According to Polymarket, there is an 84% probability that at least one rate cut will occur in 2025. The most likely scenario, with a 31% chance, is two cuts totaling 50 basis points.

Just as crypto assets react to macro events, so do fiat currencies. Recently, the Asia FX Trends have shown a cautious tone, mirroring the broader market’s apprehension. The stability of the US Dollar Outlook , coupled with escalating Middle East Tensions and surprising economic data like the Australian Consumer Price Index (CPI), paints a complex picture for global investors. This article delves into these key drivers, offering insights into how they are shaping currency movements and what it means for market participants. What’s Driving Cautious Asia FX Trends ? Asian currencies have largely remained rangebound, reflecting a wait-and-see approach among investors. This cautious sentiment stems from a confluence of factors, primarily the elevated geopolitical risks and the anticipation surrounding major central bank decisions. Unlike the often dramatic swings seen in crypto, forex movements in Asia are currently more subtle but deeply significant. Yen’s Vulnerability: The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to grapple with its long-standing weakness, primarily due to the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) dovish monetary policy stance, which contrasts sharply with higher interest rates globally. While there’s been speculation about intervention, the BOJ remains hesitant to tighten aggressively. Yuan’s Stability Bid: China’s Yuan (CNY) has seen efforts from authorities to maintain stability, often through daily fixing rates and state-bank intervention. Economic data from China, while showing some signs of recovery, still warrants cautious optimism, influencing regional currencies. Southeast Asian Resilience: Currencies like the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) and Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) have shown varying degrees of resilience, often buoyed by commodity prices or domestic economic reforms. However, their sensitivity to global risk sentiment remains high. Korean Won’s Tech Link: The Korean Won (KRW) often tracks global tech sentiment and export performance. Recent data suggests a mixed bag, keeping the Won in a tight range. The collective performance of Asia FX Trends suggests a market grappling with external pressures while navigating domestic economic realities. Traders are closely monitoring inflation figures and trade balances across the region for clearer direction. Decoding the US Dollar Outlook : Why Rangebound? The US Dollar (USD), the world’s primary reserve currency, has largely traded sideways despite significant global events. Its current rangebound movement is a testament to conflicting forces at play. On one hand, its safe-haven appeal during times of geopolitical uncertainty provides underlying support. On the other, expectations around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy keep its upward momentum capped. Several factors contribute to the current US Dollar Outlook : Federal Reserve’s Stance: Market participants are keenly focused on the Federal Reserve’s future interest rate decisions. While inflation has shown signs of cooling, the Fed has maintained a hawkish bias, signaling that rates might stay higher for longer. This provides a floor for the dollar. Safe-Haven Demand: In times of global instability, such as heightened Middle East Tensions , investors flock to the perceived safety of the US Dollar. This flight to quality acts as a significant demand driver, preventing sharp declines. Economic Data: Recent US economic indicators, including employment figures and manufacturing data, have presented a mixed picture. Strong labor markets provide support, but any signs of economic slowdown could temper rate hike expectations, weighing on the dollar. Yield Differentials: The interest rate differential between US treasuries and those of other major economies continues to favor the dollar, attracting capital flows. Understanding the nuances of the US Dollar Outlook is critical, as its movements ripple across all asset classes, including commodities and emerging market currencies. Its current stability, rather than volatility, is a key characteristic of the present forex environment. How Do Middle East Tensions Impact Global Currencies? Geopolitical events, particularly those involving major oil-producing regions, inevitably cast a long shadow over financial markets. The recent escalation of Middle East Tensions between Israel and Iran has injected a significant dose of caution into the global financial system, directly influencing currency valuations. The primary mechanisms through which these tensions affect currencies include: Risk Aversion: Heightened geopolitical risk typically triggers a flight to safety. This means investors move capital out of perceived riskier assets and into traditional safe havens like the US Dollar, Japanese Yen, and Swiss Franc. This dynamic strengthens these safe-haven currencies while weakening others, especially those of emerging markets or commodity-dependent nations. Oil Price Volatility: The Middle East is a critical region for global oil supply. Any disruption or perceived threat to supply can send oil prices soaring. Higher oil prices can be a boon for oil-exporting nations’ currencies (like the Canadian Dollar or Norwegian Krone) but can act as an inflationary pressure and a drag on growth for oil-importing economies, potentially weakening their currencies. Supply Chain Disruptions: Broader regional instability can impact shipping routes and global supply chains, leading to increased costs and reduced trade volumes. This can dampen economic activity and weigh on currencies reliant on international trade. While direct military conflict might be contained, the mere threat and the ongoing uncertainty are enough to keep markets on edge. This cautious stance directly impacts trading volumes and investor sentiment across the Global Forex Market , making participants wary of taking aggressive positions. The Stalling Australian Dollar : A Deep Dive into Soft CPI The Australian Dollar (AUD) experienced a significant stall recently, primarily due to softer-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. This economic indicator, which measures inflation, is a crucial determinant of a central bank’s monetary policy stance. For the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), a lower CPI print suggests less pressure to raise interest rates, or even opens the door for future cuts. Let’s break down the impact on the Australian Dollar : Unexpected Softness: The latest CPI data came in below market expectations, indicating that inflationary pressures in Australia might be easing more rapidly than anticipated. This surprised many analysts who had priced in a more persistent inflation trajectory. RBA Policy Implications: A softer CPI reduces the likelihood of the RBA needing to hike interest rates further. In fact, it shifts market focus towards when the RBA might consider cutting rates. Lower interest rates generally make a country’s currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher yields, leading to depreciation. Yield Differential Impact: As the RBA’s policy outlook diverges from central banks that might maintain higher rates for longer (like the Fed), the interest rate differential between Australia and other major economies narrows or even reverses, reducing the appeal of holding AUD. Commodity Link: While the AUD is also influenced by commodity prices (given Australia’s significant exports), the CPI data provided a more direct and immediate negative catalyst, overriding some of the commodity price support. The stalling of the Australian Dollar serves as a potent reminder of how domestic economic data, particularly inflation figures, can swiftly alter a currency’s trajectory, even amidst broader geopolitical narratives. Navigating the Broader Global Forex Market Dynamics The interplay of regional economic data, central bank policies, and geopolitical events creates a complex tapestry within the Global Forex Market . While individual currency pairs react to specific catalysts, there are overarching themes that influence the entire ecosystem. Key dynamics shaping the current Global Forex Market include: Divergent Monetary Policies: Central banks globally are at different stages of their monetary policy cycles. Some, like the RBA, are seeing inflation cool, prompting discussions of rate cuts. Others, like the Fed or ECB, might maintain a tighter stance. These divergences create opportunities and risks for currency traders. Inflation vs. Growth Trade-off: Policymakers are constantly balancing the need to control inflation with the imperative to support economic growth. This delicate balance significantly impacts currency valuations as markets react to every data point and central bank commentary. Geopolitical Risk Premium: As seen with the Middle East Tensions , geopolitical instability introduces a risk premium into currency valuations. Currencies of nations perceived as more stable or offering safe-haven qualities tend to strengthen, while those exposed to greater risk may weaken. Commodity Price Influence: Currencies of major commodity exporters (e.g., CAD, AUD, NZD) are highly sensitive to fluctuations in global commodity prices, especially oil and industrial metals. Capital Flows: Global capital flows, driven by investor sentiment, interest rate differentials, and risk appetite, constantly shift, influencing demand and supply for various currencies. For investors, understanding these interconnected dynamics is paramount. The Global Forex Market is not just a sum of its parts; it’s a living, breathing entity where every piece of news can trigger a chain reaction. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead? The current forex landscape presents both challenges and potential opportunities. The primary challenge is the heightened uncertainty stemming from geopolitical events and the unpredictable nature of inflation and growth data. This can lead to sudden shifts in market sentiment and increased volatility, making it difficult for traders to establish long-term positions. However, opportunities also arise: Volatility as Opportunity: While uncertainty can be daunting, increased volatility can create short-term trading opportunities for those adept at technical analysis and risk management. Divergence Plays: The divergence in central bank policies offers opportunities to trade on interest rate differentials. For example, if one central bank signals cuts while another holds firm, the resulting currency pair movement can be significant. Safe-Haven Flows: During periods of heightened risk, understanding which currencies act as safe havens can inform defensive portfolio positioning. Actionable insights for market participants include: staying updated on geopolitical developments, closely monitoring inflation and employment data from major economies, and paying attention to central bank communications. Diversification, as always, remains a key strategy to mitigate risks in such an environment. A Compelling Conclusion: Navigating the Forex Labyrinth The forex market, a cornerstone of global finance, continues to be shaped by a complex interplay of economic fundamentals, monetary policy decisions, and geopolitical undercurrents. From the cautious Asia FX Trends and the rangebound US Dollar Outlook to the impactful Middle East Tensions and the surprising softness of the Australian Dollar due to CPI data, each element contributes to the broader narrative of the Global Forex Market . Investors and traders must remain vigilant, adapting their strategies to navigate this intricate labyrinth. While uncertainty persists, a thorough understanding of these drivers can illuminate pathways to informed decision-making, ensuring resilience in a constantly evolving financial landscape.

After dipping to a 12-day low, HBAR began a gradual climb from Monday onwards. With bullish indicators flashing across both spot and derivatives markets, HBAR now trades at $0.1528. Source: CoinMarketCap The token is attempting to break above a crucial resistance near its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), with upside potential of nearly 8% if momentum holds. Key indicators show growing HBAR demand HBAR is currently hovering around its 20-day EMA, a critical technical marker often used to determine near-term momentum. A confirmed breakout above this moving average could mark a short-term trend reversal, opening the door for a rally toward $0.164. On the flip side, if bulls fail to maintain pressure, the token risks slipping below $0.147, with extended downside likely to test the $0.133 support level. Supporting the bullish case is the Elder-Ray Index, which measures the strength of buyers versus sellers. As of the latest data, this indicator is printing positive values at 0.0052, signalling that bullish forces are gaining traction. The index’s histogram also shows green bars, reinforcing the strength of current buying pressure. Futures market signals bullish bets HBAR’s derivatives market data reflects optimism among futures traders. The token’s funding rate remains positive at 0.0057%, suggesting that long-position holders are paying shorts to keep their positions open. This behaviour is typically interpreted as a sign of market confidence, as traders anticipate upward price movement. Funding rates in perpetual futures markets reflect the cost of holding positions. When rates are positive, it generally means more traders are betting on prices going up, and those shorting the asset are being compensated to maintain bearish positions. HBAR’s sustained positive rate during its recent price dip indicates that traders continued to position for a rebound, despite momentary weakness in the spot market. Ceasefire sparks broader risk appetite The broader crypto market’s improved sentiment follows the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This geopolitical development has contributed to a risk-on mood among investors, with digital assets responding positively across the board. HBAR’s recent recovery coincided almost immediately with the ceasefire update, suggesting a link between the easing of regional tensions and renewed market confidence. Although Hedera is not directly tied to Middle Eastern developments, market-wide sentiment often affects altcoins as capital rotates back into riskier assets. Price levels to watch for HBAR HBAR is trading at a make-or-break level. At $0.152, it sits close to its 20-day EMA, and a decisive move above could trigger a breakout toward the $0.164 resistance. This would represent a 7.9% upside from current levels. However, failure to sustain bullish momentum could see the token dip to $0.147. Should this support zone fail, further selling pressure could push HBAR to $0.133. For now, technical and derivative signals appear to favour bulls, but market participants will be closely watching upcoming sessions for confirmation of direction. If HBAR manages a clean break above its short-term resistance, the ongoing recovery could gain pace as traders seek to ride the positive sentiment wave triggered by easing geopolitical tensions.

But according to popular crypto analyst Crypto Rover, this could be just the beginning. He believes Bitcoin is preparing for its next major breakout, and this one might send prices soaring to $140,000. Bitcoin Price Eying $140k In a recent tweet post, crypto analyst Crypto Rove r believes Bitcoin is currently forming a bullish pattern known as a “bull flag,” which often leads to explosive upward moves in past Bitcoin cycles. He notes that Bitcoin has now spent nearly 200 days in sideways consolidation, a phase very similar to ones seen before earlier bull runs. In his view, once Bitcoin breaks past the $110,000 resistance, the path to $130K–$140K could open up rapidly. “This could be the final run-up,” Rover said, calling it “the most hated rally” as many remain skeptical during the consolidation phase. On-Chain Data Supports the Breakout Adding to Rover’s bullish thesis, data from CryptoQuant reveals that only 40,000 BTC per day is currently being sent to exchanges, the lowest level seen in over a decade. Historically, such low flows have coincided with market bottoms and the start of major rallies, including in 2016, 2019, and most recently in 2023. At the same time, Bitcoin spot ETFs are showing strong institutional demand. According to Fairside data , there have now been two consecutive weeks of inflows, with $588.55 million added on June 24 alone. Ethereum Eyeing $4000 Mark While the spotlight is on Bitcoin, Crypto Rover also has high hopes for Ethereum (ETH). Backed by a $4.4 million long position, he expects ETH to rise significantly, especially with signs of heavy accumulation from institutions like BlackRock. He has predicted that the ETH price could range between $2,600 and $4,000 , depending on how the breakout unfolds. He further added that current funding rates on both BTC and ETH are near zero or even negative, another classic sign of a bullish bottom forming. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

For normal people who use crypto related offerings such as bitcoin online casinos , they can only probably dream of the kind of returns that the Commander in Chief has received alongside the relevant involved members of his family.It is already known that the 47th President and his family may have potentially gained to the tune of $57 million from their involvement in the company based on the filings from last year, but it has obviously led to plenty of commentary surrounding the ethics and fairness of the President backing a bill that would regulate one of his own companies. Self regulation around the world has rarely ever ended up with not creating great consequences, but given that Stablecoin at face value will now be under stricter regulation and a more stable footing, the bill also has its supporters.Those objecting stepped up their own complaints when President Trump appeared to give no wriggle room to the fact that the House of Representatives should automatically stamp the Senate's stablecoin bill through with approval, but the detractors are far from swayed and they more than made their points known during Monday's session, suggesting that the details still needed to be properly worked through and that this would definitely take some additional time.French Hill, the representative chairman of the House Financial Services Committee that has been at the primary stage of all stablecoin debate for the past few years in Congress, would not commit to honouring the President's request that lawmakers in the House summarily passed the bill through, and instead was quite determined that talks with the leadership were already underway because there were a number of issues that were required to be ironed out between the Senate's approved text, and the version that the House already had in progress.It seems that there will be no 'LIGHTNING FAST' approval of the so called 'GENIUS Act' that number 47 requested was got to his 'desk, ASAP - NO DELAYS, NO ADD ONS' in a previous visit to his own social media site.The Trump family dropping to 40% will quieten questions, but they will certainly not end them.

46752109,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/hype-sits-at-37-while-merk-powers-a-new-cycle-through-telegram-native-utility,1750852722,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/46752109.jpeg,$HYPE Sits at $37 While $MERK Powers a New Cycle Through Telegram-Native Utility,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/hype-sits-at-37-while-merk-powers-a-new-cycle-through-telegram-native-utility,"$HYPE may be trading at $37, but its momentum has cooled. Once the talk of the town, it now faces the same challenge that hits every hype-driven token eventually, what comes after the noise? While $HYPE consolidates, $MERK is accelerating. Not with empty promises or speculative pumps, but through real-time engagement inside Telegram, the epicenter of crypto culture. With a playable miniapp, live staking, and an expanding mission-based ecosystem, $MERK isn’t waiting for a cycle to catch it, it’s building the next one. Market Snapshot: Hyperliquid at $37 $HYPE is currently trading around $37, maintaining its position as a key token in the perpetual DEX narrative. The rise of Hyperliquid earlier this year generated significant buzz, supported by growing user metrics and strong liquidity flows. It’s a solid project with a future, but price momentum has cooled. The market is stable, but the hype that once pushed $HYPE to new highs has started to fade. Recent Performance and Momentum Over the last month, $HYPE has shown minimal volatility. Price action remains mostly sideways, indicating a consolidation phase. Daily volumes are consistent, and the core community is still active. But in a fast-moving market, stability can often mean stagnation. And when the next big opportunity appears, capital tends to move fast. What’s Fueling the Current Valuation? The $37 price point is supported by strong fundamentals, early mover advantage in the DEX space, and high-profile backing. It’s a bet on infrastructure and long-term adoption. However, $HYPE is primarily a hold-and-wait asset. There’s limited utility in the short term, and no direct user interaction model outside of speculation and governance. That leaves room for a different kind of asset to capture attention. Meerkat ($MERK): Undervalued or Under the Radar? $MERK is priced around $0.0005, and unlike most early-stage tokens, it already does something. While $HYPE sits on infrastructure expectations, $MERK delivers live action right now. Gamified missions, live staking, community ranking and onchain rewards, all directly inside Telegram. No friction. No delays. The difference? $MERK doesn’t just talk utility. It’s built on it. Current Presale Price (~$0.0005) At under a fifth of a cent, $MERK’s presale valuation presents a rare low-entry point in a market full of overvalued promises. With a capped supply, fair launch model and no insider allocations, early participants are stepping in before CEX listings go live. Analysts are watching closely. Retail is waking up. But the real advantage belongs to those who move now. Discover staking, missions and real-time yield at meerkat.wtf Active Utility Before Listing $MERK isn't waiting for exchanges or partnerships to be useful. It’s already live inside Telegram with a growing base of active users completing missions and earning rewards in real time. This isn’t a token with potential. It’s a token with presence. And as listings approach, what’s now under the radar won’t stay there for long. Comparative Momentum: $HYPE vs $MERK $HYPE has built momentum through solid tech and market positioning in the perpetual DEX sector. It’s a serious asset with traction among pro traders. But when it comes to raw speed and viral momentum, $MERK is moving faster. In just weeks, it has launched a miniapp, activated staking, and built a rapidly growing user base inside Telegram. While $HYPE consolidates, $MERK is onboarding users daily, not just buyers, but players, stakers and community contributors. Market Cap and Trading Volume $HYPE enjoys a strong market cap in the hundreds of millions, with daily volumes in the millions as well. It’s deep in the game, but already priced as a major player. $MERK, by contrast, is still in presale at a sub-million valuation. This is where the asymmetric opportunity lies. Even a modest post-listing move would mean 10x–50x returns from the current price. One is established. The other is explosive. Community Engagement Metrics $HYPE has a respectable community, but its engagement is primarily based on speculation, chart analysis, and trading sentiment. $MERK lives inside Telegram, the heart of crypto culture, where users don’t just talk, they act. They complete missions, earn rewards, climb rankings and interact directly with the project daily. This isn’t passive hype. It’s active participation, and that translates to stronger long-term retention. Ecosystem Maturity vs Viral Growth $HYPE is part of the mature infrastructure movement in DeFi. It’s reliable, but slower-moving. $MERK is built for viral growth, designed with memes, missions, and miniapps that spread naturally through social channels. The growth model is closer to a game than a protocol, and that’s why it’s scaling fast. In a market that now rewards culture and immediacy over pure tech, $MERK fits the moment perfectly. Price Potential and Asymmetry At $37, $HYPE would need to double to reach $76, a strong move, but not life-changing for most retail buyers. $MERK at $0.0005? A 25x move only puts it around 4.5 cents. A 50x? Just under 9 cents. These numbers are not just possible, they’re historically common in early-stage momentum tokens with working products. Asymmetry favors $MERK, the upside is wide open. Analyst Views on $MERK 25x–50x Scenario Several early-stage analysts see $MERK as one of the few meme-based tokens with real mechanics, not just narrative. The combination of live staking, instant usability, and Telegram-native reach creates a setup they compare to early $DOGE or $PEPE, but with actual utility. 25x–50x is not hopium. It’s structure.The right mix of timing, product, and community is already in motion. And the market is watching. Access crypto without wallets or friction at t.me/meerkatwtf/1 $HYPE Room for Expansion from $37? Yes, but it’s slower. $HYPE could double or triple if the DEX space continues growing and institutional interest rises. However, the room for exponential growth is limited by its current valuation and market maturity. It’s a bet on sustained infrastructure adoption, not viral acceleration. If you’re looking for steady, $HYPE has merit.If you’re looking for movement, energy and breakout potential, $MERK is where that curve begins. What Matters Now: Timing, Traction, and Tactics In crypto, the real winners don’t chase headlines, they act before the spotlight hits. Timing is critical. $MERK is still in presale, giving early participants a window of opportunity before major exposure.Traction is already happening. With a live Telegram miniapp, staking activated, and real-time user rewards, it’s not just potential, it’s operational.Tactics are what set $MERK apart. No VC rounds, no team tokens, 50% of supply locked, and audited contracts in place. The foundation is not just solid, it’s investor-first. While $HYPE sits at $37, mature and stable, $MERK is accelerating from $0.0005, powered by action, not speculation.This is not another memecoin story. This is the blueprint for the next wave. Certified Security and Cultural Infrastructure Backing this investor-first model is a robust technical layer. $MERK completed a full audit with CertiK, one of the most respected cybersecurity firms in Web3, achieving a 7/10 score, ranking in the top 15% of pre-launch projects.The audit covered smart contracts, permission controls, and overall architecture, validating the project’s commitment to long-term reliability from day one. But security is just the start. $MERK has launched its own zk-rollup Layer 2, fully EVM-compatible and optimized for low-fee, high-speed cultural engagement. This infrastructure doesn’t just process transactions, it powers an entirely new creative economy. At its core sits The Burrow: a live, generative suite where users can create tokenized memes using AI, auto-generated narratives, and a modular minting pipeline. ERC-20 and SPL compatible, fully on-chain, and ready to scale. While other projects tokenize finance, $MERK tokenizes culture, turning collective creativity into digital value.

46752477,https://coinpaper.com/9700/clean-spark-and-green-minerals-expand-bitcoin-strategies-amid-market-shifts,1750852800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,CleanSpark and Green Minerals Expand Bitcoin Strategies Amid Market Shifts,https://coinpaper.com/9700/clean-spark-and-green-minerals-expand-bitcoin-strategies-amid-market-shifts,"Two publicly traded companies—CleanSpark in the United States and Green Minerals in Norway—have announced major steps forward in their respective Bitcoin strategies, signaling continued momentum in institutional adoption of the asset. While CleanSpark achieved a milestone of 50 exahashes per second (EH/s) in mining capacity with plans to reach 60 EH/s, Green Minerals is initiating a Bitcoin treasury program worth up to $1.2 billion as part of a broader blockchain integration effort. Despite differing operational focuses, both companies aim to position Bitcoin as a key part of their financial and strategic planning. CleanSpark Hits 50 EH/s Milestone, Cementing Status as One of the World's Largest Bitcoin Mining Firms US-based Bitcoin mining powerhouse CleanSpark Inc. (NASDAQ: CLSK) announced on Tuesday that it has surpassed 50 exahashes per second (EH/s) in operational hashrate, placing it firmly among the world’s top mining entities. The milestone represents a new era of scale and efficiency for the company, which now operates over 30 mining facilities across Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Wyoming. The achievement is part of CleanSpark’s aggressive expansion strategy and signals a growing consolidation of hashrate among US public miners as the Bitcoin network becomes increasingly competitive post-halving. Powering the Future with 50 EH/s Hashrate is a critical metric in the Bitcoin ecosystem, indicating how much computational power is being deployed to secure the network and validate transactions. A higher hashrate directly increases the likelihood of earning Bitcoin mining rewards. Reaching 50 EH/s is not only a testament to CleanSpark’s operational prowess but also a strategic defense against volatility and halving-induced revenue compression. CleanSpark’s vertically integrated infrastructure has proven instrumental in reaching this milestone. By directly managing its energy procurement and operational footprint, the company is able to minimize downtime and optimize margins — a critical advantage in an industry where power costs can make or break profitability. The company’s mining fleet is powered by a diverse mix of energy sources across its facilities, many of which leverage favorable power agreements and renewable energy options. This strategic flexibility allows CleanSpark to withstand fluctuations in electricity markets while maintaining efficient and reliable mining operations. Eyes Set on 60 EH/s The firm isn’t stopping at 50 EH/s. CEO Zach Bradford confirmed that CleanSpark is on track to reach 60 EH/s in the near term, which would further solidify its ranking among the global mining elite. The planned scale-up comes at a pivotal time, as many smaller and less efficient mining firms have struggled to remain profitable in the wake of the April 2024 halving, which cut Bitcoin block rewards in half from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. The move also reflects broader institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition — a belief increasingly shared by public miners who are choosing to hold their mined BTC rather than sell at market lows. In addition to mining at scale, CleanSpark’s Digital Asset Management division has begun actively managing its 12,500+ self-mined BTC — a significant treasury now being deployed to generate passive returns. Bradford emphasized that the firm’s approach allows it to finance growth without diluting shareholder equity. Rather than sell Bitcoin on the spot market, CleanSpark is reportedly exploring strategies like Bitcoin-backed lending, liquidity provision, and strategic DeFi deployments. This treasury-first strategy mirrors moves made by other institutional players, such as MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital, who are treating Bitcoin not just as a mined asset but as an active balance sheet tool. CleanSpark's Institutional Ascent CleanSpark's rise has come at a time of renewed attention on institutional Bitcoin adoption and US mining dominance. Following the halving, the barriers to entry in Bitcoin mining have risen considerably, pushing smaller miners out and giving large-scale, energy-efficient operations a commanding advantage. The firm's ability to scale efficiently and capitalize on treasury management has made it a darling of institutional investors, many of whom view Bitcoin mining equities as high-beta plays on the underlying asset. With CleanSpark's next goal of 60 EH/s on the horizon and a growing portfolio of managed BTC assets, the company appears well-positioned to capitalize on the next Bitcoin bull cycle — especially as demand surges from spot ETFs, sovereign wealth funds, and corporate treasuries. As Bitcoin's supply issuance slows and network difficulty increases, the firms that can mine most efficiently and deploy their capital with strategic foresight are likely to define the next decade of crypto infrastructure. CleanSpark is making a strong case that it intends to be one of them. Green Minerals Unveils $1.2 Billion Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Amid Deep Sea Mining Uncertainty Meanwhile, Norwegian deep sea mining firm Green Minerals ASA made waves in the financial and cryptocurrency sectors on Tuesday after announcing that it would invest up to $1.2 billion—in collaboration with its partners—to build a Bitcoin treasury, marking one of the boldest moves yet by a publicly traded European company to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The Euronext Growth Oslo-listed company said in a statement that it plans to acquire its first Bitcoin “in the next few days,” framing the move as a long-term strategy to integrate blockchain technologies and hedge against fiat currency risks. Executive Chairman Ståle Rodahl emphasized that the initiative would help “safeguard long-term value” while reinforcing the company’s mission of financial innovation and sustainable development. “Bitcoin’s decentralized, non-inflationary properties make it an attractive alternative to traditional fiat,” Rodahl said. “By integrating a Bitcoin treasury strategy, we are not only mitigating fiat risks but also reaffirming our commitment to financial innovation and the sustainable creation of long-term value.” Strategic Pivot Amid Regulatory Hurdles Green Minerals’ announcement comes at a precarious time. The company’s core business—mining deep sea minerals such as cobalt and rare earth elements—has come under increasing pressure from both environmental advocates and regulators. In 2024, Norway’s government ordered a moratorium on deep sea mining, freezing plans to issue permits originally slated for 2025. That decision was followed last week by another policy shift: the Norwegian Labor government proposed a temporary ban on new power-intensive crypto mining operations, citing better use cases for the country’s energy grid, such as community data centers. Despite these hurdles, Green Minerals appears to be embracing a parallel pivot into blockchain and crypto assets—a move increasingly common among public companies seeking alternatives to volatile fiat and legacy banking systems. Rodahl said the Bitcoin treasury would not replace the company’s existing operations but would serve as a financial foundation to support upcoming capital expenditures tied to its mining ambitions. “The program offers a robust hedge against currency debasement, particularly valuable for a company with a long project horizon,” he stated. Beyond Bitcoin accumulation, Green Minerals signaled its broader intent to integrate blockchain solutions into its mining operations. The company cited supply chain transparency, mineral origin certification, and operational efficiency as key blockchain-enabled improvements, suggesting a hybrid approach that aligns Web3 technology with industrial resource development. This mirrors growing interest in blockchain-based supply chain solutions among mining and logistics firms worldwide, where immutability and decentralization can ensure authenticity and sustainability—a key selling point in the increasingly ESG-conscious investment world. Following Strategy’s Playbook Green Minerals’ Bitcoin pivot follows a growing trend led by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and its chairman Michael Saylor, who has famously turned his enterprise software company into a Bitcoin powerhouse with more than 592,300 BTC—worth over $62 billion—held on its balance sheet. According to bitcointreasuries.com, more than 245 public companies now hold Bitcoin, a number that has grown by 13% in the past month alone, with cumulative holdings exceeding $88 billion. Other companies like Upexi, Wellgistics Health, and DeFi Development Corp. have taken a similar path, albeit expanding their crypto exposure to include assets like XRP and Solana. Bitcoin treasury data (Source: Bitcointreasuries ) While Green Minerals did not specify how many BTC it intends to accumulate initially, the $1.2 billion ceiling implies a substantial potential purchase that would instantly rank the firm among the top institutional holders of Bitcoin globally. Despite the bold announcement, investors responded with concern. Shares of Green Minerals plunged nearly 35% on Tuesday following the news, as markets weighed the ambitious Bitcoin strategy against regulatory uncertainty and ongoing setbacks in its core mining business. Critics argue that the company may be diverting focus from its already embattled seabed mining initiatives at a time when public sentiment and government policy are increasingly aligned against extractive oceanic practices. Additionally, Norway’s energy politics present a complicating factor. The government’s call for a reassessment of power-intensive industries—including crypto mining—could ultimately restrict Green Minerals’ ability to scale any digital asset-related ventures domestically, especially if future infrastructure needs intersect with regulatory bottlenecks. A Long-Term Bet on Bitcoin Regardless of short-term turbulence, Green Minerals is positioning itself as an early European adopter of Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset—a bold bet that aligns it with a growing cohort of global firms seeking refuge from inflationary fiat regimes and volatile commodity cycles. The company’s move also brings attention to a broader shift: as environmental regulations tighten and capital becomes harder to secure in traditional markets, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as an investment, but as a core financial infrastructure—especially by firms with long timelines and high exposure to macroeconomic risk. Whether Green Minerals can execute this vision successfully—and appease skeptical investors—remains to be seen. But in committing up to $1.2 billion to Bitcoin, the company has made clear that it sees the world’s leading digital asset not just as a hedge, but as a cornerstone for future value creation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-25 12:00:00

That’s the eye-watering sum recently cashed out by the team behind the Melania meme token , sending ripples across the crypto community and sparking fresh debates about the inherent risks of meme coin investments. This significant move, reported by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, highlights the immense profitability – and potential pitfalls – within the highly speculative meme coin sector. Unpacking the Staggering MELANIA Token Sales: What Happened? The core of this story revolves around a series of strategic liquidations by the Melania meme token team. Over the past four months, using a network of 44 distinct wallets, the team sold a colossal 82.18 million MELANIA tokens. To put that into perspective, this amount represents 8.22% of the token’s total supply. The proceeds from these extensive MELANIA token sales amounted to 244,934 SOL, which at the time of the report, translated to approximately $35.76 million. Most of these tokens were offloaded through a common method in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space: liquidity additions and subsequent removals. This process allows large holders to sell significant amounts of tokens without causing immediate, drastic price crashes, although the long-term impact can still be substantial. Following these revelations, CoinMarketCap data showed MELANIA trading at $0.2110, marking a 3.2% decline in 24 hours, a direct reflection of market sentiment reacting to such large-scale selling pressure. The Volatile Landscape: What Does This Mean for the Meme Coin Market? This incident with the Melania meme token is a stark reminder of the highly speculative and often unpredictable nature of the meme coin market . Meme coins, characterized by their community-driven nature, viral marketing, and often lack of fundamental utility, have become a dominant force in crypto, promising astronomical gains but also carrying significant risks. For every success story, there are countless projects that fail, leaving investors with substantial losses. Key characteristics of the meme coin market include: Extreme Volatility: Prices can surge or plummet by hundreds or even thousands of percent in a short period. Community Hype: Success often hinges on social media trends and celebrity endorsements rather than technological innovation. Lack of Utility: Many meme coins offer no real-world application, making their value purely speculative. Concentrated Ownership: A significant portion of tokens can often be held by a small number of wallets, including the development team, creating potential for large-scale dumps. The Melania team’s cash-out exemplifies the ‘exit liquidity’ phenomenon, where early investors or developers capitalize on the hype generated by retail investors, selling their holdings for substantial profits. This can severely erode trust and confidence within the broader meme coin market . Why Solana? The Blockchain Powering Meme Coin Mania The fact that MELANIA is built on the Solana blockchain is no coincidence. Solana has rapidly emerged as a preferred network for launching meme coins due to its high transaction throughput, low fees, and fast block finality. These attributes make it ideal for the rapid-fire trading and speculative activity that defines the meme coin ecosystem. Solana’s advantages include: Speed: Capable of processing thousands of transactions per second. Low Costs: Transaction fees are typically a fraction of a cent, making frequent trading affordable. Developer-Friendly: A growing ecosystem and robust tools attract new projects. While Solana provides the infrastructure for innovation and accessibility, it also inadvertently facilitates the rapid creation and, sometimes, rapid demise of speculative assets like meme coins. Incidents like the massive MELANIA token sales highlight the dual nature of an open, permissionless blockchain – it empowers both legitimate innovation and high-risk speculation. For the Solana blockchain , managing its reputation amidst the ebb and flow of meme coin projects remains a continuous challenge. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends: What Lessons Can We Learn? This event serves as a critical case study for anyone participating in the current crypto market trends . The allure of quick riches in meme coins is powerful, but understanding the underlying mechanisms and risks is paramount. The Melania team’s actions are a classic example of insider selling, a practice that, while not illegal in decentralized crypto markets in the same way it is in traditional finance, certainly raises ethical questions and can severely damage a project’s long-term viability and community trust. For investors, it underscores the importance of: Due Diligence: Researching the project’s team, tokenomics, and community before investing. Understanding Liquidity: Knowing how tokens are distributed and the potential for large holders to exit. Risk Management: Never investing more than you can afford to lose, especially in high-risk assets like meme coins. Monitoring On-Chain Data: Tools like Lookonchain provide invaluable insights into large wallet movements and potential selling pressure. The broader crypto market trends continue to evolve, with institutional adoption growing alongside retail speculation. However, events like the Melania cash-out remind us that the wild west aspects of crypto, particularly in niche sectors like meme coins, are still very much alive. A Compelling Summary: The Price of Speculation The Melania meme token team’s substantial cash-out of $35.76 million is a powerful illustration of the high stakes and rapid wealth generation possible within the crypto sphere, particularly in the meme coin segment. While it represents a significant profit for the team, it also serves as a cautionary tale for investors. The incident highlights the inherent volatility of the meme coin market , the critical role of the Solana blockchain in facilitating such ventures, and the need for extreme caution when engaging with speculative assets. As the crypto market matures, distinguishing between projects with genuine utility and those driven purely by hype becomes increasingly vital. The Melania episode is a stark reminder that in the fast-paced world of digital assets, knowledge, vigilance, and a robust risk management strategy are your most valuable tools.

With all 15 presale stages completed and the Bonus Round currently live, Lightchain AI isn’t just a trending name—it’s a project backed by serious infrastructure. Its AI-native architecture, featuring a dedicated virtual machine and a computation-based consensus model, is attracting a growing crowd of developers and forward-thinking investors. As the July 2025 mainnet launch nears, Lightchain AI is proving that momentum doesn’t have to be meme-driven to become impossible to ignore. Dogecoin’s Popularity Slows Amid Shifting Market Conversations Dogecoin’s popularity is experiencing a slowdown amid shifting market conversations. While DOGE has shown resilience, trading between $0.21 and $0.26 in May 2025, its momentum is challenged by the rise of utility-driven cryptocurrencies like Lightchain AI . Despite a 44% increase from last month and bullish patterns suggesting potential growth, the broader market’s focus is moving towards projects with tangible applications. This shift indicates that Dogecoin’s meme-driven appeal may be waning as investors seek more substantive value in their crypto assets. Lightchain AI Leads Weekly Mention Growth Across Crypto Communities The total number of weekly mentions about Lightchain AI is growing as well as they are being more and more mentioned in the forums, social media and investors networks. This increase in activity is in line with the projects Bonus Round, with a fixed LCAI price of $0.007 after Stage 15. The project has raised 19 million euros from Coinshares, Fabric Ventures, Alameda Research, as well on the help from dozens of thought leading and market making entities and has been bootstrapped to-date, fueled organically by word of mouth, investor demand, developer interest and a unique Layer 1 utility rather than blasted to masses via walls of paid media advertisements. Unlike the coins which are pumped by hype counting as pounds, Lightchain AI is rising by its actual use through its AI on-chain, AIVM, and through real nodes of contributors. The 5% of Team Allocation that has been reallocated to developer grants has simply accelerated momentum, with a horizon that looks far forward and a commitment to builders first. With daily mentions on the the rise, organically, Lightchain AI isn’t just on a mission for tech, but also for bringing back the real buzz to the decentralized crypto communities. Traders, Don’t Miss This—Lightchain AI is New Crypto Favorite! The buzz is real— Lightchain AI is quickly becoming a standout in the crypto world. With its Bonus Round in full swing and a token price locked at just $0.007, excitement is soaring.

Accordingly, the Arizona Assembly passed the Bitcoin reserve bill HB2324. The Arizona House of Representatives passed the Bitcoin reserve bill HB2324, creating a reserve fund for assets seized through criminal forfeiture to be included in the reserves. The bill, which is now before Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs for a final signature, will be the state's second reserve bill to be enacted if signed by Hobbs. As you may recall, Governor Katie Hobbs has previously approved or vetoed some bills. Accordingly, Hobbs vetoed two Bitcoin Reserve bills that would allow state investment (SB1373 and SB1025). She had previously signed the reserve bill HB 2749 and paved the way for the creation of a reserve fund for unclaimed assets. HB 2324 clearly outlines how funds from sales of seized cryptocurrencies will be allocated. The first $300,000 raised will be directed to the Anti-Racketeering Revolving Fund. Any amount above that will continue to support the same fund at 50%, 25% will go to the state’s General Fund, and the remaining 25% will be allocated to the newly created Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund.

With bullish technical patterns forming and on-chain data aligning, BTC’s price structure paints a promising picture, but not without a few caveats. A recent report showed Bitcoin long-term holders are not distributing, which suggests the token is in a quiet accumulation phase. The lack of spikes in Dormancy flow reduces sell pressure from old coins, which could be a bullish signal for the token. The data from Glassnode, the BTC long-term holder (LTH) spending binary indicator, shows minimal spending for the first time since June 10. With LTH supply near all-time highs at around 14.7 million BTC which signals conviction where the seasoned investors remain reluctant to distribute despite recent market volatility. Previously, the minimal long-term holder selling occurred post-March 2020 which set the stage for explosive rallies. Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025: Will BTC Price Reach $110K? Bitcoin volatility has dropped below Gold for the first time ever, which signifies a historic shift in finance. This suggests that the star token is maturing and the market is recognizing it. Hence, as adoption grows and institutional confidence deepens, BTC could start to behave less like a wild rollercoaster and more like a stable store of value. As BTC price reclaimed $105K, and funding rates turned negative, there has been a classic set up of a short squeeze. With shorts piling in, history suggests an upward move could be imminent for Bitcoin & altcoins. In the long term, the BTC price has approached a crucial resistance zone, which suggests a major breakout is underway. Previously, when the price reached the final resistance zone between $69,400 and $72,150. On the other hand, the weekly CMF dropped below the average and triggered a rebound, similar to what happened before the Q4 2024 rally. On the other hand, the weekly MACD which was on the verge of undergoing a bearish crossover, has displayed a bullish divergence. Therefore, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is expected to accumulate along the resistance zone for a couple of weeks until the buying volume intensifies, followed by a breakout to a new ATH.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-25 12:08:23

In a dramatic move, Tether , the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, has frozen 112 crypto addresses across the Tron and Ethereum blockchains. This action, reportedly taken in the wake of the recent Israel-Iran clash, has sent ripples through the crypto community, raising critical questions about the nature of stablecoins and the future of digital asset security. What Led to Tether’s Swift Action? The decision by Tether to freeze a significant number of crypto addresses comes amidst escalating geopolitical tensions. According to crypto researcher @Cryptadamist on X, these frozen wallets collectively held an astonishing 700 million USDT before being blacklisted. While Tether has not yet issued an official statement detailing the specific reasons behind this particular freeze, such actions are typically undertaken in response to law enforcement requests, compliance with sanctions, or to combat illicit financial activities. The timing is particularly noteworthy, following closely on the heels of Israel’s attack on Iran. This geopolitical backdrop suggests that the freeze might be linked to efforts to prevent the use of stablecoins for purposes deemed illegal or to circumvent international sanctions. It also follows reports of a substantial $90 million hack targeting Nobitex, Iran’s largest crypto exchange, which could be a related factor, prompting heightened scrutiny from stablecoin issuers like Tether. Unpacking the Freezing of Crypto Addresses : What Does it Mean? For many, the concept of a centralized entity like Tether being able to freeze crypto addresses seems to contradict the very ethos of decentralization that blockchain technology champions. However, as a centralized stablecoin issuer, Tether maintains the ability to blacklist addresses, rendering the USDT held within them unusable. This power is a double-edged sword: Enhanced Security: It allows Tether to respond to threats, prevent illicit financing, and comply with regulatory mandates, theoretically making the stablecoin safer for legitimate users and the broader financial system. Centralization Concerns: It also highlights the inherent vulnerability of centralized stablecoins to censorship and external control, a point of contention for many crypto enthusiasts who prioritize financial autonomy. The researcher @Cryptadamist also highlighted that most Iranian crypto platforms heavily rely on USDT transactions conducted via the Tron blockchain. This reliance makes the freezing of Tron-based addresses particularly impactful for users and exchanges within that region, potentially disrupting their operations and access to liquidity. The Ethereum addresses, while also significant, may represent a broader range of international entities or individuals. The Broader Implications for USDT and Stablecoins As the dominant stablecoin, USDT plays a pivotal role in the global cryptocurrency market, serving as a primary trading pair and a safe haven asset during market volatility. Tether’s ability to freeze such a large sum of USDT underscores a fundamental tension within the crypto space: the desire for decentralized, censorship-resistant money versus the need for regulatory compliance and stability within the traditional financial system. This event reignites the ongoing debate about the nature of stablecoins: Feature Centralized Stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDC) Decentralized Stablecoins (e.g., DAI, sUSD) Issuing Authority Company (e.g., Tether, Circle) Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Censorship Resistance Lower (can freeze addresses) Higher (governed by code, less susceptible to external pressure) Regulatory Compliance High (often required by law) Varies, generally lower direct compliance Peg Stability Backed by reserves, often audited Algorithmically or collateral-backed This incident serves as a stark reminder that while stablecoins offer price stability, their underlying mechanisms and the entities that issue them can still be subject to traditional financial and geopolitical pressures. Users and businesses relying heavily on USDT, particularly in regions prone to sanctions or political instability, may need to re-evaluate their risk exposure. Navigating Blockchain Security in a Geopolitical Landscape The freezing of these addresses highlights a critical aspect of blockchain security that extends beyond technical vulnerabilities: the human and political element. For individuals and businesses operating in the crypto space, especially those in jurisdictions under international scrutiny, understanding the implications of centralized stablecoin control is paramount. What can users do to navigate this complex landscape? Diversify Stablecoin Holdings: Consider holding a mix of stablecoins, including decentralized options like DAI, to mitigate risks associated with single points of failure or censorship. Understand Stablecoin Mechanisms: Research how your chosen stablecoin operates, its backing, and its issuer’s policies regarding freezing addresses or complying with external requests. Self-Custody: While holding funds on exchanges offers convenience, keeping your assets in non-custodial wallets gives you greater control, though it doesn’t protect you if the underlying asset itself (like USDT) is blacklisted at the protocol level. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of geopolitical developments and regulatory changes that could impact your crypto holdings. This event underscores that true financial sovereignty in the crypto world often comes with the responsibility of understanding the trade-offs between convenience, liquidity, and censorship resistance. The Future of Tether and Centralized Stablecoins This latest action by Tether will undoubtedly fuel further discussions about the role of centralized entities in a decentralized ecosystem. While Tether’s proactive stance in freezing addresses might be seen as a necessary measure for compliance and preventing illicit finance, it also raises legitimate concerns about the potential for overreach or politically motivated actions. In the long run, such incidents could: Increase Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments and financial regulators worldwide may use this as further evidence to push for stricter oversight and regulation of stablecoin issuers. Boost Decentralized Alternatives: A renewed interest in truly decentralized stablecoins and censorship-resistant protocols might emerge, as users seek alternatives less susceptible to external control. Impact Market Perception: While USDT’s dominance is unlikely to be immediately challenged, repeated incidents of freezing funds could chip away at trust, particularly among users who prioritize the original ethos of crypto. Tether’s actions, while perhaps legally justifiable from a compliance perspective, serve as a potent reminder that even in the world of blockchain, traditional power structures and geopolitical realities can exert significant influence. The balance between maintaining stability, ensuring security, and preserving the principles of decentralization remains one of the crypto industry’s greatest challenges. In conclusion, Tether’s freezing of 112 crypto addresses following the Israel-Iran clash is a significant event that transcends mere technical details. It is a powerful illustration of the ongoing tension between centralized control and decentralized ideals in the cryptocurrency space. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the lines between digital assets, national security, and global politics will only become more blurred. For users, understanding these dynamics and making informed choices about their stablecoin holdings is more critical than ever.

Amid these conditions, these projects have displayed their momentum both in terms of price growth and community growth. One of the most standout projects of June 2025 is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which has signaled that it could be the top crypto to add to your portfolio based on current statistics. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project has so far broken through multiple milestones in its ongoing presale, and even doubters are now jumping in to take advantage of the huge price discount. Let us take a deep dive into the three projects of June 2025 that you should buy, and why each one of them deserves your attention. DOGE DOGE is a well-known crypto project that is known for massive price fluctuations. While the earliest investors experienced some respectable gains, it has been a bloodbath since then. The price has been known to fluctuate by double digits in just a few days, making it nearly impossible to plot an entry or exit point. As such, while DOGE will continue to attract new buyers through hype for the coming years, it will likely remain a challenge to predict the price growth of DOGE. For more reliable, sustainable, and predictable price performance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a great option. TON TON is the native coin on the Toncoin blockchain project, which is currently engaged in a massive integration with Telegram. The blockchain aims to be a competitor of Ethereum (ETH). However, while it could achieve some respectable gains, it is unlikely to dethrone Ethereum (ETH. When TON is a good coin, most of the initial gains have been mopped up by the community, which means the potential for future growth is limited. For more massive growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a great option. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Designed For Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project in the presale phase. It is designed as a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol, where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they can deposit assets into the communal pools to earn passive income. Interest rates in the communal pools are based on the pool utilization rate. To determine the pool utilization rate, the protocol measures the value of assets being actively borrowed versus the total value of assets in the pools. As the utilization rate rises, the interest rate rises, which pushes borrowers to repay their loans to avoid the rising rates. At the same time, it attracts more lenders looking to benefit from the rising yields in the pools. In some cases, the Mutuum Finance team can adjust the optimal utilization target for individual assets, as well as the interest slopes. These actions are taken to defend liquidity on the protocol. This is often done in cases where the rates on external protocols become more attractive compared to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). When that happens, arbitrageurs could raid the platform to siphon liquidity from the pools. Adjusting those parameters ensures that they mitigate that issue by keeping borrowing costs at the same level as the rest of the market. Another step that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) takes to defend liquidity on the protocol is liquidity mining. In a liquidity mining program, the platform offers incentives in the form of MUTM tokens to those who supply liquidity to the protocol. The liquidity mining program will be focused on high-value assets, ensuring that the protocol’s liquidity is preserved even during high market volatility. The team will implement a tiered system to determine how to distribute the mining rewards. For instance, the team will focus on tokens that promote protocol stability and discourage token inflation. Their focus will be on tokens like widely-adopted stablecoins due to their important role in lending and use as collateral. However, small, volatile assets that can destabilize the ecosystem will not be added. MUTM Token Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in phase 5. So far, over $11 million has been raised in the ongoing presale from around 12,400 unique buyers. In the current phase of the presale, tokens are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. The token price is set to go up by 16.67% in phase 6 to $0.035. That will also reduce the guaranteed ROI from the current level of 100% to just 71.43%. With analysts predicting that MUTM tokens could outperform DOGE and TON, this presale presents your best opportunities to snap up a valuable growth opportunity in the crypto market. So far, the MUTM presale has been a massive success when it comes to participation numbers. For instance, 47% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, barely two weeks after it began. This fast pace shows that investors want to take full advantage of the 50% discount off the planned MUTM token listing price of $0.06. You, too, can act and be part of this massive opportunity for massive growth.

The intervention, described as a first in the country, is part of ongoing investigations into what has been regarded as the biggest heist in crypto history, linked to the notorious Lazarus Group hacking syndicate. Greek officials block illicit crypto assets on a local exchange The Hellenic Anti-Money Laundering Authority (HAMLA) has joined the complex investigation into this year’s massive theft from one of the largest digital currency exchanges. The government body recently froze assets traced back to the heist. HAMLA President Charalambos Vourliotis made the announcement at a briefing, during which he informed Greece’s Minister of Economy and Finance, Kyriakos Pierrakakis, about his agency’s work in the crypto space. Acting on received intelligence in May, the authority identified a user registered on a Greek trading platform who received a “significant amount” of ether (ETH) in their account. Using specialized software to analyze the suspicious transaction, HAMLA analysts were able to establish that the coins were part of those stolen from Bybit earlier this year. The wallet was immediately frozen, carrying out a prosecutor’s order, the Greek newspapers Proto Thema and Kathimerini reported on their websites on Tuesday. The anti-money laundering agency also issued a seizure order for the crypto holdings and submitted a report to the Prosecutor’s Office of Greece for further legal action. The authorities are yet to provide details about the seized holdings and the recipient of the digital transfer. But the local press already described the move as a first, both in terms of Greece freezing illicit crypto funds and finding Greek fingerprints in a digital financial crime of this caliber, noting: “The case has drawn international attention, with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issuing a public alert confirming the freezing of suspicious digital assets.” Cryptocurrency seized in Greece linked to the Bybit breach The Dubai -based Bybit, a leading crypto exchange in terms of daily trading volume, announced it had been hacked on February 21, 2025, reporting the theft of $1.5 billion in ETH, deemed the largest cryptocurrency theft to date. Blockchain analysis has since linked the attack to the Lazarus Group, uniting hackers allegedly controlled by the regime ruling North Korea , which reportedly exploited security weaknesses and transferred the digital coins to multiple addresses. HAMLA began to unravel the Greek connection last month when it was notified of a suspicious movement of funds, more specifically, the crediting of a “large sum of Ethereum” to a wallet hosted by an unnamed provider of crypto exchange services in Greece. Using blockchain forensics tools at their disposal, the agency’s analysts conducted a series of checks to “untangle the thread,” the weekly Proto Thema detailed in a follow-up article on Wednesday. The trained specialists found that the funds had not come from a regular commercial transaction such as a cryptocurrency purchase but followed a specific transaction trail already flagged by the FBI. It took them to one of the ETH wallets involved in the laundering of the Bybit funds, which had been split and moved through multiple wallets before some of it ended up in Greece. Investigators haven’t been able to prove yet that the Greek owner of the frozen wallet actually knew the true origin of the funds received, the report noted. However, law enforcement officials in Greece are still considering all scenarios, including the possibility that the person acted as an intermediary link in a global digital money laundering scheme.

If approved, this dual-asset ETF would hold 75% Bitcoin and 25% Ethereum, making it one of the most politically branded cryptocurrency products to date. NYSE Pushes for Truth Social ETF The proposed ETF listing falls under the SEC’s 19b-4 rule, a common path for ETF approval. While it signals regulatory progress, it does not guarantee final approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a statement, the SEC responded : “The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in that the shares will be listed and traded on the exchange pursuant to the initial and continued listing criteria in NYSE.” Trump’s Bold Crypto Vision Trump Media is ramping up efforts to establish a stronghold in the crypto space. In May, it announced a $2.5 billion raise to build its own Bitcoin Treasury. Key projects include: Truth Social Bitcoin ETF Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF America First Bitcoin Fund America First Blockchain Leaders Fund America First Stablecoin Income Fund The funds aim to merge crypto investing with political branding, targeting supporters of the “America First” agenda. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction: Top Analyst Eyeing $140K , Crypto.com to Serve as ETF Custodian To manage the ETF’s infrastructure, Trump Media has partnered with Crypto.com , which will serve as the custodian, liquidity provider, and execution agent.

46753802,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=172084,1750854021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46753802.jpeg,US Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Remarkable $588.6M Inflow Ignites Market Optimism,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-spot-bitcoin-etfs-inflow/,"BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Remarkable $588.6M Inflow Ignites Market Optimism Are you keeping an eye on the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? If so, you’ve likely noticed a groundbreaking trend that continues to shape the landscape of digital asset investment. On June 24, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded an astonishing combined net inflow of $588.6 million, extending their impressive streak to 11 consecutive trading days of positive flows. This surge signals robust institutional and retail interest, painting a bright picture for the future of Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance. What Are US Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Why Do They Matter? For those new to the space, a US Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. Unlike futures ETFs, which track Bitcoin futures contracts, spot ETFs provide direct exposure to the price movements of the underlying asset itself. This distinction is crucial for investors who seek a more direct and less complex way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of buying and storing the cryptocurrency directly. The approval and subsequent launch of these ETFs earlier this year marked a monumental shift. They offer several compelling advantages: Accessibility: Traditional investors can now easily invest in Bitcoin through their brokerage accounts, just like they would with stocks or other ETFs. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of buying and selling. Regulatory Oversight: Being regulated products, they offer a layer of investor protection that direct cryptocurrency purchases might not always provide. Diversification: They allow for easier portfolio diversification by adding exposure to digital assets within a traditional investment framework. The sustained crypto inflows into these products underscore their growing acceptance and utility as a bridge between the burgeoning digital asset world and conventional financial markets. Unpacking the Recent Crypto Inflows: A Closer Look at the Numbers The $588.6 million net inflow on June 24 is not just a number; it’s a testament to sustained investor confidence. According to data from Farside Investors, this marks the eleventh consecutive day of net inflows, indicating a persistent buying trend rather than a one-off event. Let’s break down which funds are leading the charge: BlackRock’s IBIT: Leading the pack by a significant margin, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a massive $436.3 million in net inflows. This performance solidifies IBIT’s position as a dominant force in the Bitcoin ETF arena. Fidelity’s FBTC: Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) followed with a strong $85.2 million in net inflows, demonstrating its continued popularity among investors. ARK Invest’s ARKB: The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) secured $43.8 million in net inflows, maintaining its steady appeal. Bitwise’s BITB: The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) contributed $9.8 million to the total, showcasing consistent interest. Grayscale’s BTC: Notably, even Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has historically seen outflows due to its conversion from a trust to an ETF, recorded a net inflow of $7.5 million. This is a significant shift and suggests that the selling pressure from GBTC might be subsiding, or even reversing. VanEck’s HODL: VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) also witnessed a respectable $6 million in net inflows. The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, highlighting the concentrated interest in these top performers. This distribution of inflows points to a clear preference for established and well-marketed funds, though the positive shift in Grayscale GBTC is particularly noteworthy. BlackRock IBIT Leads the Charge: What Makes it So Attractive? When we talk about the success of Bitcoin ETFs , it’s impossible to ignore the colossal impact of BlackRock IBIT . Its staggering $436.3 million inflow on June 24 alone accounts for the vast majority of the day’s total. BlackRock, as the world’s largest asset manager, brings unparalleled credibility, distribution networks, and marketing prowess to the table. Their reputation attracts a broad spectrum of investors, from large institutions to individual retail clients, who might feel more comfortable investing in Bitcoin through a familiar and trusted financial giant. The rapid accumulation of Bitcoin by IBIT since its launch has been a key driver of overall market sentiment. Its consistent positive flows suggest that a significant portion of new institutional capital is finding its way into the Bitcoin ecosystem through this specific vehicle. This isn’t just about BlackRock; it’s about the validation of Bitcoin as an investable asset class by a mainstream financial powerhouse. Grayscale GBTC’s Evolving Role in the Bitcoin ETF Landscape The journey of Grayscale GBTC has been unique among the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Prior to its conversion, GBTC operated as a trust, often trading at a significant discount or premium to its net asset value (NAV). Upon conversion to an ETF, many investors who had been locked into the trust, or who sought to arbitrage the discount, began to redeem their shares, leading to substantial outflows in the initial weeks. However, the recent $7.5 million net inflow for GBTC is a positive indicator. This shift could signify several things: Exhaustion of Selling Pressure: The initial wave of redemptions might be largely complete, with most of the profit-takers or discount-arbitragers having exited. New Inflows: New investors might be starting to see GBTC as a viable option, perhaps due to its slightly lower fee structure compared to its pre-ETF days, or simply as another entry point into the market. Market Maturation: As the overall Bitcoin ETF market matures, investors may become more comfortable diversifying their ETF holdings across different providers, including GBTC. The performance of GBTC will continue to be a key metric to watch, as its stabilization and potential for sustained inflows could further bolster overall confidence in the Bitcoin ETFs market. Benefits and Opportunities for Investors The sustained crypto inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs highlight several key benefits for investors: Ease of Access: No need for crypto exchanges, wallets, or complex security measures. Investors can buy and sell through their existing brokerage accounts. Institutional Participation: The ETF structure has opened the floodgates for large institutions, pension funds, and wealth managers to allocate capital to Bitcoin, which was previously challenging due to compliance and custody issues. This institutional backing adds legitimacy and stability to the market. Price Discovery: Increased liquidity and trading volume in regulated products can lead to more efficient price discovery for Bitcoin. Mainstream Adoption: The success of these ETFs accelerates Bitcoin’s journey into the mainstream, making it a more accepted and understood asset class. For investors looking to gain exposure to the digital asset space, these ETFs offer a compelling blend of innovation and traditional financial comfort. Navigating the Challenges and Risks of Bitcoin ETFs While the recent inflows are certainly cause for optimism, it’s crucial for investors to understand that investing in Bitcoin ETFs is not without its challenges and risks. Bitcoin, by its very nature, is a volatile asset. Its price can experience significant swings in short periods due to: Market Sentiment: News events, regulatory changes, and even social media trends can heavily influence Bitcoin’s price. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, inflation data, and interest rate decisions can impact investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory Uncertainty: While the US has approved spot ETFs, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies globally is still evolving and can change, potentially impacting the market. Custody Risks: Although the ETF structure aims to mitigate this, the underlying Bitcoin still needs to be securely stored by custodians, introducing a layer of operational risk. Fees: Investors should be mindful of the expense ratios charged by ETFs, as these can eat into returns over time. Therefore, while the accessibility is a huge plus, investors should conduct thorough due diligence and consider their risk tolerance before allocating capital to these products. The Road Ahead: Future Outlook for Bitcoin ETFs and the Crypto Market The consistent crypto inflows into Bitcoin ETFs suggest a growing appetite for digital assets within regulated frameworks. This trend is likely to continue, with potential implications for the broader crypto market: Increased Institutional Adoption: The success of Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for other single-asset crypto ETFs (like Ethereum ETFs, which are already seeing progress) and potentially multi-asset crypto ETFs. Bitcoin Price Impact: Sustained demand from ETFs, which are continuously accumulating Bitcoin, could put upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, assuming supply remains constrained (e.g., post-halving effects). Market Maturation: The presence of regulated investment products fosters greater trust and understanding, contributing to the overall maturation of the cryptocurrency market. Innovation: As more traditional financial players enter the crypto space via ETFs, it could spur further innovation in financial products and services built around digital assets. The future looks promising for the integration of digital assets into global financial systems, with Bitcoin ETFs playing a pivotal role. Actionable Insights for Potential Investors If you’re considering investing in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs , here are some actionable insights: Research Thoroughly: Understand the specific ETF you’re investing in, including its expense ratio, custodian, and historical performance. Understand Volatility: Be prepared for price fluctuations. Bitcoin is known for its volatility, and its ETFs will reflect that. Diversify: While Bitcoin ETFs offer exposure to a new asset class, they should ideally be part of a diversified portfolio, not your sole investment. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and macro-economic factors that could influence Bitcoin’s price. Long-Term Perspective: Many view Bitcoin as a long-term investment. Consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate the impact of volatility. In conclusion, the consistent and significant inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs , particularly led by powerhouses like BlackRock IBIT and the surprising positive turn for Grayscale GBTC , underscore a powerful narrative: Bitcoin is increasingly being embraced by mainstream finance. This trend not only validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class but also opens new avenues for investors to participate in the digital economy with greater ease and confidence.

Helios data center transition offers stable, high-margin recurring revenue, reducing reliance on volatile crypto markets and boosting long-term sustainability. Valuation is reasonable at current levels, with potential for 36–37% upside if crypto market sentiment improves. Key risks remain: heavy crypto dependence, Helios execution uncertainty, and potential dilution. I recommend buying at $18.3, not higher. Introduction I have covered Galaxy Digital Inc. ( GLXY ) twice before, once under the ticker symbol GLXY on the TSE calling it a buy and recently as GLXY on the Nasdaq issuing a hold rating . The performances since then are depicted below. GLXY Performance after Buy rating GLXY Performance after Hold rating I did rate them a hold on May 19 but did not sell any shares as I believe the stock has more upside potential this year. After the recent pullback, I do see a more favorable risk-reward ratio in buying GLXY. Therefore, I am upgrading my rating to a buy again. Why I Am Long Again Recent momentum for Galaxy Digital has been halted by the combination of a crypto price correction and the pricing of a new share offering totaling around $500M. Proceeds of the set offering will be used to build out their Helios data center Infrastructure. What I did not cover so far due to length constraints is the Data Center opportunities GLXY has. Therefore, this will be the focus of this article. It is, however, quite significant to the company, as shown in their division of business fields into Digital Assets , which includes Global Markets, Asset Management, and Investment Banking, and Data Centers , which covers their Helios Data Center in Dickens County, TX, initially intended to be used for Bitcoin mining but now being repurposed to host AI HPC services. Demand for data centers is set to grow at almost 300% throughout 2030. Similarly, data center IT CapEx is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 23%, reaching $800B in 2028, per McKinsey. Even if these optimistic assumptions are halved, this would be a very attractive market for Galaxy Digital to enter. GLXY IR Their 15-year agreement with CoreWeave marks a shift in their revenue model. At an estimated $900M annual recurring revenue projected to fully materialize into 2027, they are now less susceptible to crypto price volatility. These revenues are both stable and of a high-margin nature, as GLXY projects 90%+ EBITDA margins for them due to their triple lease agreement structure. Conservatively estimated, this could net GLXY an additional $500M of net income per year. More capacity should be gradually unlocked and a full capacity of 2,500 MW could be reached in 2035, which at a 90% utilization rate and $150 per kW/month could earn them a total of $2.4B in ARR. This could in turn translate to $800-900M of net income from data centers annually, assuming higher depreciation costs causing EBITDA margins to decrease a little bit. This seems to be a much better field of business to operate in rather than Bitcoin mining, and I'm glad they're transitioning. Bitcoin mining is incredibly dependent on Bitcoin prices and, excluding mining efficiency increases, needs Bitcoin prices to double every four years just to earn the same revenues and profits. Still, one cannot deny the fact that Galaxy's stock price continues to be very dependent on Bitcoin prices, which drives the broader cryptocurrency market. In my latest BTC analysis, I shared the following: In the short term, though, I'm expecting a slight pullback to $97.5k or, in the worst case, to $93.5k We have now seen Bitcoin retrace to $98k. The worst might be behind us, but I continue to see a case for $93.5k as the worst-case current scenario. Either way, Bitcoin was super quick to regain the psychologically important $100k mark, despite economic and geopolitical uncertainties. In my view, this is clear evidence that the momentum is strong enough to reach further ATHs this year. Bitcoin's monthly RSI still has room for one further euphoric leap this year, as in all post-halving years, it has reached levels north of 90, whereas we have just seen 75 in 2024, a halving year. TradingView When it comes to valuation, traditional measures only get us so far. But looking at the P/B value, it has come down a little bit over the past few weeks. In my last coverage, it was at 2.7X and is now at 2.2X, which, in my view, is more reasonable and contains a little more room to run to the upside in case of continued crypto market euphoria. Specifically, I could see this value reach levels of 3X during peak investor sentiment, sometime around late Q3 or Q4 this year. This implies a short-term upside potential of 36%. Data by YCharts Since estimates are hard to find, I will do my own scenario analysis, based on FY 2025 and 2026. As long as a big portion of GLXY's profits stems from cyclical unrealized digital asset gains, they deserve to trade at high-single-digit P/E ratios, considering the unpredictability and the fact that profits vary greatly from true cashflows. As I assume rising digital asset prices in 2025, GLXY's net income would be boosted significantly by holdings gains as well as higher AUM, trading and lending usage, and advisory. I can imagine these developments to drive net income to around $700M in 2025, giving GLXY a forward P/E of 9.9X, which seems like the stock is neither over- nor undervalued for its 2025 upcoming performance. A continued crypto bull market is therefore already priced in. For 2026, gains or losses from the crypto markets are hard to forecast since it is supposed to be a crypto winter year. That could compromise net income drastically. They could, however, achieve revenues of $1B ($300M from financial services, $700M from Helios), which would put them at a forward P/S ratio of just below 7X, which is also reasonable considering their revenue will become much more predictable and be of high-margin nature. Checking technicals again, I realize that GLXY is trading at a crucial support of CAD25. The 200-day MA is also inching closer and could offer support. If these levels are lost, however, I could see the price moving down toward CAD20 (-20%). GLXY's recent drop of 30% also falls within its usual range of corrections since 2022. Weekly RSI down to 54 and daily RSI at 45 make me more confident at the start of a new uptrend. From then, it is important that they reclaim the descending trend line starting from their 2021 highs as support. Price has been rejected here three times on the daily chart in the last few weeks. Overcoming this resistance would give them a good foundation for trying to break through the key resistance zone at CAD34-36, which is my new preliminary price target, offering approximately 37% upside. TradingView Risks As mentioned in my prior coverage, GLXY's core risk remains its heavy dependence on crypto markets. A prolonged pullback in Bitcoin could lead to declining trading activity, lower AUMs, and negative net income. I particularly expect a lot of volatility going into 2026 where Galaxy will have to prove whether they can perform while reporting potentially large unrealized losses on their digital asset holdings. Additionally, Q1 2025's large loss as well as the Nasdaq listing increase the risk of shareholder dilution. Galaxy truly needs predictable revenues in order to safely be able to fund its costs and future expansions, so taking on debt and issuing a lot of shares is no longer necessary. Proceeds from share offerings are needed to restructure Helios and build it out in order to achieve maximum capacity. While likely, Helios has not proven to be economically viable and has not turned over a dime. This is set to change in the first half of next year but does remain an operational risk, as it is very hard to calculate ROI when investors don't precisely know about the amount of investment needed and whether projected capacity, revenues, and profits will truly materialize. Conclusion I am upgrading Galaxy Digital back to a Buy, though with less conviction than during the April lows. The recent pullback did improve the risk-reward ratio, but it is not as favorable as it was when prices hit $8-$12. Still, Galaxy Digital Inc. offers exposure to growing AI adoption, cryptocurrency financial services, and digital asset holdings growth. At today's prices, investors get the above-named sections for a fair valuation and decent technicals. Helios has the potential to make GLXY's financial profile more sustainable and less volatile over the coming years. This remains a 2025-focused investment, but I will continue to monitor both the Helios rollout and broader crypto dynamics closely. Depending on how these develop, Galaxy Digital could transition into a longer-term position for me, heading into 2026 and 2027.

Analyst Gautam Chhugani, who’s been covering the crypto market closely for a decade, maintained an “outperform” rating on the company and said that Wall Street is still misreading the full scale of what Coinbase actually is. With the stock ending Tuesday’s trading session at $344.82, his new target implies a 48% upside. In the note, Gautam called Coinbase “the most misunderstood company in our Crypto coverage universe,” arguing that the broader market remains negative despite the company sitting at the center of every major revenue vertical in the industry. He pointed out that Coinbase is the only crypto company in the S&P 500, dominates U.S. crypto trading, leads institutional participation, and operates the largest stablecoin business among exchanges. Gautam also reminded investors that Coinbase recently bought the largest crypto options exchange globally, and that it now powers the fastest and largest Ethereum-based chain used for tokenization. Bernstein says Coinbase has more room to grow Gautam pushed back against bearish takes that claim new competition will eat into Coinbase’s user base. He said Coinbase’s market share is still intact, and that incoming platforms from traditional brokerages won’t offer full product suites—something Coinbase already has. That, he said, keeps them “less competitive.” He also flagged two U.S. bills in progress that could give Coinbase a leg up: the GENIUS Act , which would impose rules on stablecoins, and the CLARITY Act, designed to provide regulatory structure for crypto. Beyond that, Gautam said the company’s move into crypto futures trading is a major opportunity. Coinbase already has Bitcoin and Ethereum futures available and is now preparing to launch perpetual futures, a product that sees heavy interest globally but has limited support in the U.S. market. He said this market has “massive headroom” and could bring in serious volumes once Coinbase gets fully up and running. His updated price target is based on an internal estimate that Coinbase could generate around $9.5 billion in total revenue in 2025. That estimate factors in the broader spot and derivatives businesses, institutional activity, and potential upside from legislation. After the report hit, Coinbase shares climbed 3.1% in premarket trading.

For enthusiasts and investors keenly watching the Layer-1 landscape, a recent proposal from NEAR Protocol has sparked considerable interest. The network has put forth a groundbreaking plan to halve its inflation rate from 5% to a lean 2.5%. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a strategic pivot designed to bolster long-term blockchain sustainability , enhance NEAR token value, and meticulously align ecosystem incentives. But what does this mean for the NEAR community, and why is this decision so pivotal? Understanding NEAR Protocol Inflation: What’s Changing? Inflation in a cryptocurrency context refers to the rate at which new tokens are introduced into circulation. While often necessary to reward validators and secure the network, unchecked inflation can dilute token value over time. Historically, NEAR Protocol has operated with an approximate 5% inflation rate. This rate ensures that validators, who play a critical role in processing transactions and maintaining network security, are adequately compensated for their efforts through newly minted NEAR tokens. The proposed change aims to cut this rate in half, bringing it down to 2.5%. This move reflects a maturing ecosystem and a commitment to a more deflationary or disinflationary model. The core reasons behind this bold proposal are: Improving Long-Term Sustainability: By reducing the rate at which new tokens enter the market, NEAR aims to create a more stable and predictable economic environment for its users, developers, and investors. Supporting Token Value: Economic principles suggest that a reduced supply increase, relative to demand, can lead to increased scarcity and, potentially, higher token value. This benefits all NEAR holders. Aligning Ecosystem Incentives: The adjustment seeks to ensure that the rewards for participating in the network (e.g., staking) remain attractive, while simultaneously making the token more appealing as a long-term asset. Why is Blockchain Sustainability Crucial for NEAR Protocol? For any Layer-1 blockchain aiming for widespread adoption and longevity, sustainability is paramount. It encompasses not just environmental impact, but also the economic viability and robustness of the network’s tokenomics. A sustainable blockchain can fund its operations, incentivize participation, and attract continuous development without relying on an ever-increasing supply of tokens that could depress value. The NEAR Protocol team’s focus on blockchain sustainability through this inflation cut signals a mature approach to managing its economic model. It demonstrates a commitment to: Long-term Viability: Ensuring the network can operate efficiently and securely for decades to come, independent of speculative market cycles. Developer Confidence: A stable economic environment encourages more developers to build on NEAR, knowing their dApps will operate within a predictable financial framework. Investor Trust: A clear strategy for managing token supply instills greater confidence in institutional and retail investors looking for assets with strong fundamentals. This proposal is a proactive step to future-proof the network, ensuring that the incentives for validators and the overall economic health of the ecosystem remain robust even as the network scales. Boosting the NEAR Token Value: An Economic Perspective One of the most anticipated outcomes of this proposal, if passed, is its potential impact on the NEAR token value. Basic supply and demand economics dictate that if the rate of new supply entering the market decreases while demand remains constant or grows, the value of the existing supply tends to increase. Consider the following: Reduced Sell Pressure: Less new NEAR entering circulation means less potential sell pressure from validators or other entities receiving newly minted tokens. Increased Scarcity: Over time, a lower inflation rate leads to greater scarcity of the token, making it potentially more valuable as a store of value. Investor Attraction: Projects with well-managed tokenomics and a clear path to disinflation or deflation often attract long-term investors seeking assets with appreciation potential. This strategic decision by NEAR Protocol aligns with a broader trend in the crypto space where projects are increasingly looking for ways to create more sustainable and value-accreting token models. It’s a clear signal to the market that NEAR is serious about its long-term economic health. The Power of Community: Validator Voting on NEAR Crucially, this significant change is not being imposed from the top down. Instead, it’s subject to a decentralized governance process through validator voting . This democratic approach is a cornerstone of blockchain technology, ensuring that major protocol changes reflect the collective will of the network’s key stakeholders. The voting period for this proposal is extensive, running through the end of July 2025. This extended timeframe allows ample opportunity for: Thorough Discussion: Validators and the broader community can engage in in-depth discussions, analyze the proposal’s implications, and weigh its pros and cons. Informed Decision-Making: It gives validators sufficient time to understand the nuances of the proposal and make an informed decision based on what they believe is best for the network’s future. Consensus Building: A long voting window facilitates the building of consensus, which is vital for the smooth implementation of such a fundamental change. If the proposal secures the required majority from validators, the new inflation model will be implemented in the next protocol upgrade. This demonstrates the robust governance framework of NEAR Protocol , where community participation directly shapes the network’s evolution. Decoding NEAR Protocol’s Tokenomics: What Does This Mean for You? For anyone involved with NEAR – whether as a holder, a developer, or a validator – understanding the implications of these changes to tokenomics is key. This proposed inflation cut is a direct response to the need for a more mature and resilient economic framework. Here’s a simplified look at the before and after: Aspect Current Model Proposed Model (If Passed) Inflation Rate ~5% annually ~2.5% annually Impact on Token Supply Growth Higher rate of new token issuance Reduced rate of new token issuance Potential for Token Scarcity Moderate Increased Long-Term Economic Health Good, but with room for optimization Enhanced for greater sustainability This shift reflects a careful calibration of incentives. While a lower inflation rate might, on the surface, seem to reduce validator rewards in absolute terms, the potential for increased token value could offset this, leading to greater long-term gains. It’s about optimizing the balance between securing the network and preserving the value of the underlying asset. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for NEAR Protocol The proposal to cut NEAR Protocol ‘s inflation rate to 2.5% is more than just a technical adjustment; it’s a strategic declaration of intent. It underscores the network’s unwavering commitment to long-term blockchain sustainability , a stronger NEAR token value proposition, and a more aligned ecosystem for all participants. The ongoing validator voting process through July 2025 is a testament to NEAR’s decentralized governance model, empowering its community to shape its future. If approved, this change could mark a significant milestone in NEAR’s journey, potentially setting a new standard for responsible tokenomics in the Layer-1 space and reinforcing its position as a leading blockchain.

Shiba Inu price, with a potential surge, could go as high as $0.000321 by 2030. With increasing volatility in the crypto market, marketers are keen on stacking some meme coins. And Shiba Inu, being the second biggest memecoin by market cap, is on the bucket list of investors and traders. What has intrigued investors is the constant rise in the burn rate of SHIB. In a recent move, the burn rate rose by 3,484% in 24 hours, eliminating 537 million tokens from circulation. That’s not all, a massive 111.8 billion SHIB outflow from exchanges has led to the burning questions on every SHIB enthusiast’s mind: “Will Shiba Inu (SHIB) reach 1 cent ?” or “Will Shiba Inu go up?” or “Is Shiba Inu a good investment?” Furthermore, we’ve crafted a comprehensive Shiba Inu price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030 to address these pressing queries.

Plus, the developer’s visionary developments coming to fruition and Shiba Inu becoming a major player in the metaverse could play a pivotal role in SHIB’s future price. That being said, with an altcoin season, the price of SHIB could reach an annual high of $0.00006392. However, if the community drives the price with typical buying and selling pressures, SHIB could settle at an annual price of $0.0000191. On the other hand, if investors fail to keep up with the liquidity of the digital asset on exchanges, FUD and negative sentiments could lower the price to $0.0000201.

The rise in Bitcoin was accompanied by altcoins, with Ethereum (ETH) rising above $2,400, while altcoins such as Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP experienced small increases. While there is curiosity about whether the rise will continue, Bitget Research chief analyst Ryan Lee announced his predictions. Bitcoin, which fell to $98,000 due to the Israel-Iran tension, later recovered. However, Ryan Lee pointed out that BTC did not immediately stabilize after its initial drop below $99,000, and said that although strong ETF inflows provided structural support for BTC, the risk continued and signaled the need to be cautious. “Bitcoin still has the potential to be a safe haven, but risk appetite is under control in BTC. This delays BTC's recovery.” Stating that the risk in Bitcoin continues, the analyst thinks that the rise will continue in the long term. At this point, Ryan Lee predicted that Bitcoin would reach $110,000-115,000 in Q3 and potentially $130,000-160,000 by the end of the year. Lee also added that he expects Ethereum to rise to between $2,600-$2,800 in the near-term and up to $5,500 in the long-term. *This is not investment advice.

BitGo, one of the largest crypto custodians, has seen its assets under custody balloon to $100B in 2025. Polymarket – a decentralized prediction market – is set to raise $200M at a $1B valuation, riding the wave of surging interest in crypto-native applications. The stories showcase how demand for both regulated, institutional-grade services and platforms is growing rapidly. Safety Plus Speculation BitGo’s rise underscores the growing institutional hunger for secure, compliant infrastructure. The California-based firm now holds $100B in digital assets , a 66% increase from $60B at the start of the year. Much of that growth comes from increased demand for staking services (which now account for half of its holdings) and from a rising tide of institutional adoption. BitGo also expanded into South Korea in 2024 and Dubai in 2025, further building on an already powerful foundation in its aim to become more competitive in the industry. In contrast, Polymarket’s trajectory highlights the viral growth of speculative, user-driven DeFi applications. The platform, known for letting users bet on everything from elections to sports outcomes, surged in popularity during the 2024 U.S. presidential cycle, processing over $3.3B in bets. Now, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund is reportedly leading a $200M funding round, positioning Polymarket to become a unicorn asset And this immediately after Polymarket announced a partnership with X . The timing is perfect: there’s a strong appetite for decentralized markets offering high-risk, high-reward plays. Confidence on Two Fronts These contrasting success stories reveal a broader truth: crypto is no longer a monolith. Institutional players are flocking to battle-tested custodians like BitGo, who offer the compliance and security infrastructure needed to satisfy regulators (so far, at least: BitGo remains banned in the US). Meanwhile, crypto-native projects like Polymarket are pulling a different kind of capital – Venture Capitals betting on engaging decentralized apps that leverage core blockchain values of trustless systems and open markets. Both Bitgo and Polymarket demonstrate the growing confidence in the crypto economy, and the potential lying in wait. Confidence from institutions, who now see crypto as a serious asset class, and from venture backers, who see new economic behaviors forming around blockchain-native markets. BitGo’s next chapter could include a public listing by late 2025. And Polymarket is reportedly exploring a token launch – a move that could further incentivize users and decentralize governance. Interested in tapping into that same retail interest? Here are three of the best crypto to buy now . 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Find and Snipe Best Solana Meme Coins Want to know a meme coin trading secret? Some of the best Solana meme coins never make it to major platforms. They trade ‘underground,’ on platforms like Telegram. Trading them isn’t just about getting the right insider info; it’s about finding them and executing razor-sharp, perfectly timed trades. That’s precisely where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in. It’s the newest and best Solana meme crypto trading bot. Snorter provides a suite of advanced algorithmic trading tools, including automated sniping and fast swaps with built-in front-running protection. Snorter isn’t just about being fast – it emphasizes staying safe as well, with honeypot detection and rugpull protection. The $SNORT token powers the ecosystem, and with plans to expand to EVM chains and launch a dedicated user dashboard, Snorter could rapidly become the go-to meme coin trading bot.

Visit the Best Wallet Token website. 3. Tron ($TRX) – Altcoin Chain with 125% Gains Over Past Year Even with a $25B market cap, Tron ($TRX) somehow often gets overlooked. That’s a bit unfair to the ecosystem itself, but presents a golden opportunity for savvy investors. In fact, over the past year $TRX has posted 123% gains. Those gains are fueled not only by $TRX, but by broader activity on the Tron network, including $USDT. The world’s leading stablecoin ($156B market cap) is heavily traded on Tron. The demand led to a recent minting of another $2B on the network. With stablecoins increasingly in the public eye – see the recent GENIUS Act – that demand is likely to only increase. BitGo and Polymarket Demonstrate Bullish Market Corporate success with BitGo and Polymarket shows just how broad the interest in crypto actually is – from retail investors to venture capitalists. And it makes these tokens some of the best crypto to buy right now.

Barclays’ card ban underscores the growing tension between digital assets and traditional finance. According to a notice on its official website, Barclays will start blocking all cryptocurrency purchases made with its credit cards beginning June 27, 2025. The UK banking giant cited concerns over market volatility and consumer debt risks, arguing that sudden price drops could leave cardholders unable to repay borrowed funds. The policy also highlights the lack of regulatory safeguards. Unlike traditional investments, crypto purchases aren’t covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, Barclays said in the notice. You might also like: Metaplanet to buy more Bitcoin with $515M share offering Barclays’ quiet crackdown on crypto access Barclays’ decision to block crypto credit card transactions is the latest move in a years-long tug-of-war between UK banks and digital assets. By halting credit card access to crypto, the bank is making a calculated risk assessment that prioritizes customer debt exposure over market participation. While the policy might feel abrupt, it’s consistent with Barclays’ longstanding skepticism toward crypto. Back in 2021, a longtime customer vented on Reddit after the bank froze their account for attempting a transfer to Crypto.com. Despite passing security checks, the user faced a 15-day review, with Barclays citing “protection” as the reason, a move that sparked backlash for its selective enforcement (gambling transactions, for instance, faced no such scrutiny). This isn’t an isolated stance. Barclays joins a cohort of major financial institutions, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Chase UK, and Starling, that have either fully blocked or tightly constrained crypto-related transactions. Industry reaction has been split. The Payments Association has historically opposed blanket crypto bans, arguing they unfairly equate digital assets with gambling. In 2023, the group challenged a proposed UK crackdown on credit card crypto purchases, with policy head Riccardo Tordera-Ricchi stating consumers should be trusted to “make informed decisions within their existing credit limits.” Which options are customers left with? With Barclays exiting the space via credit rails, UK crypto users are left with fewer mainstream onramps. According to MoonPay, banks like RBS remain comparatively open to crypto activity, while others, such as NatWest and Metro Bank, have tightened restrictions or blocked transactions outright. Users looking for alternatives may need to shift to debit payments, use third-party payment methods like Apple Pay or Google Pay, or rely on platforms such as MoonPay that offer non-custodial services and broader acceptance rates. Meanwhile, Barclays’ restriction contrasts with its own exploration of blockchain for institutional use. In 2017, Barclays’ CTO discussed private, permissioned blockchain pilots aimed at streamlining trade processes. More recently, it took part in a landmark institutional trade using JPMorgan’s Onyx tokenized collateral network alongside BlackRock, showcasing its engagement with blockchain frameworks.

IOTA ( IOTA ) token dropped to the psychological point at $0.15 after falling by 41% from its highest level this year. It has declined by 75% from its November 2024 highs. The ongoing IOTA price retreat is in line with the performance of other altcoins like Solana ( SOL ) and Polkadot ( DOT ). It also followed the recently launched Rebased upgrade, which introduced numerous features such as smart contracts, staking, full decentralization, and a wallet transition. A key goal of the Rebased upgrade was to enable developers to build decentralized applications using the Move and Ethereum Virtual Machines. These developers would benefit from its high scalability, including over 50,000 transactions per second and sub-second finality.

DeFi Llama tracks one dApp with a total value locked of $9.76 million in the ecosystem. In contrast, several newly launched chains like Unichain and Sonic have attracted tens of developers and millions of dollars in assets. Additional data shows that the number of active addresses and transactions on IOTA remains low. Its 30-day transactions dropped by 86% to just over 621,100, while the number of active addresses stood at 8,376. Still, IOTA’s staking pools have accumulated over $334 million in assets, giving it a staking ratio of 45%. These investors are earning an annual APY of 13.47%, higher than most layer-1 and layer-2 chains. IOTA price technical analysis IOTA price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the IOTA price has been in a downward trend over the past few months. It dropped from a high of $0.6287 in November to $0.1595. Most recently, it declined from May’s high of $0.2746 following the Rebased upgrade. IOTA has moved below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a sign that bears are in control. On the positive side, it is slowly forming a double-bottom pattern at $0.1315 and a neckline at $0.2746. This is considered one of the most bullish reversal patterns in technical analysis. IOTA crypto price has also formed a falling wedge pattern, consisting of two falling and converging trendlines. Therefore, the token will likely experience a bullish breakout as long as it remains above the double-bottom point at $0.1314.

In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, discerning genuine market signals from mere noise is paramount. Recent insights from a prominent crypto analyst have shed light on a fascinating metric that could be a strong indicator of where Bitcoin is headed next: the exchange inflow/outflow ratio. This particular metric is offering a compelling narrative of sustained Bitcoin demand , reminiscent of past bullish phases. Decoding the BTC Exchange Ratio: What Does It Mean for Bitcoin Demand ? Understanding the flow of Bitcoin onto and off exchanges is like peering into the collective psychology of the market. When more Bitcoin flows onto exchanges, it often signals an intent to sell, increasing supply and potentially putting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, when Bitcoin flows *off* exchanges, it typically suggests accumulation and holding, indicating strong buying interest and reduced selling pressure. This is precisely where the BTC exchange ratio comes into play. Crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. recently highlighted a crucial development on X (formerly Twitter). He pointed out that the 30-day simple moving average (SMA) of Bitcoin’s exchange inflow/outflow ratio has reached 1.125. But what does this number truly signify? Ratio above 1: This means that for every unit of BTC flowing out of exchanges, 1.125 units are flowing in. While at first glance this might seem like more supply, the context is key. When this ratio is high *and* sustained, especially after a period of accumulation, it suggests that new demand is entering the market, potentially outpacing the supply available for immediate sale. Historical Context: Adler Jr. specifically noted that this level is “akin to that at the beginning of the late 2023 bull run.” This comparison is vital. The late 2023 period saw significant price appreciation for Bitcoin, driven by renewed interest and institutional anticipation. The current ratio suggests a similar underlying strength in demand. Implication: A sustained high ratio, particularly one that echoes previous bullish periods, strongly implies that market participants are actively seeking to acquire Bitcoin, leading to robust Bitcoin demand . Axel Adler Jr.: Gaining Crypto Analyst Insights You Can Trust In the vast sea of crypto commentary, identifying reliable sources is critical. Axel Adler Jr. has established himself as a reputable crypto analyst known for his deep dives into on-chain data. His analysis often provides a more fundamental perspective on market movements, moving beyond mere price charts to reveal the underlying transactional behavior of market participants. By focusing on metrics like the exchange inflow/outflow ratio, analysts like Adler Jr. offer a window into genuine supply and demand dynamics, rather than speculative noise. His recent update is not just a single data point; it’s an interpretation based on a sophisticated understanding of how these metrics reflect investor sentiment and capital flows. For those looking to make informed decisions in the crypto space, paying attention to such expert crypto analyst insights can provide a significant edge. Unlocking Value with On-Chain Metrics : Why They Matter The exchange inflow/outflow ratio is just one of many powerful on-chain metrics that provide unparalleled transparency into the Bitcoin network. Unlike traditional financial markets where much of the data is proprietary or delayed, the blockchain offers a real-time, immutable ledger of all transactions. This allows analysts to track various activities, including: Wallet Balances: Observing the distribution of Bitcoin across different wallet sizes can indicate accumulation by whales or retail investors. Transaction Volume: High transaction volumes often signal increased network activity and interest. Miner Behavior: Tracking miner selling patterns can offer clues about their profitability and potential supply pressure. Long-Term Holder Supply: Identifying how much Bitcoin is held by long-term investors (those who haven’t moved their coins for extended periods) can indicate conviction and reduced selling pressure. These on-chain metrics collectively paint a comprehensive picture of the network’s health and the true underlying Bitcoin demand . They offer a distinct advantage over purely technical analysis by providing insights into the fundamental forces of supply and demand that drive price movements. When a metric like the BTC exchange ratio aligns with historical patterns, it provides a compelling case for continued strength. Navigating Current Market Trends : What This Means for Investors The signal from the BTC exchange ratio is a significant piece of the puzzle for understanding current market trends . If the ratio continues to indicate strong demand, it suggests that buyers are absorbing available supply, potentially setting the stage for further upward price action. For investors, this insight can be incredibly valuable: For HODLers: This reinforces the conviction to hold onto their assets, as the underlying demand appears robust. For Traders: It might signal opportunities for long positions, especially during dips, as strong underlying demand could provide support. For New Entrants: It highlights that despite price fluctuations, the fundamental interest in Bitcoin remains high, making it an attractive asset for long-term consideration. However, it’s crucial to remember that no single metric tells the whole story. While the exchange ratio is a powerful indicator, it should be considered alongside broader macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and overall investor sentiment. Yet, the current reading certainly paints a bullish picture for the continuation of positive market trends for Bitcoin. Challenges and Nuances: A Balanced View While the strong BTC exchange ratio is undoubtedly a positive sign, it’s important to approach such data with a balanced perspective. No single metric is infallible, and the crypto market is known for its volatility and unexpected turns. Some factors to consider include: Exchange Type: The data might not differentiate between various types of exchanges (e.g., centralized vs. decentralized) or the reasons for transfers (e.g., internal transfers between user accounts, or movement to cold storage). Whale Movements: A few large transactions by institutional players or whales could significantly skew the ratio temporarily. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic conditions, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical events can override even the strongest on-chain signals. Therefore, while the current crypto analyst insights are highly encouraging, investors should always combine such data with a holistic view of the market, including technical analysis, fundamental analysis of the broader crypto ecosystem, and global economic indicators. This comprehensive approach ensures a more resilient investment strategy. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Resilient Demand Story Continues The latest update from Axel Adler Jr. regarding Bitcoin’s exchange inflow/outflow ratio offers a compelling testament to the enduring and robust Bitcoin demand . By drawing parallels to the early stages of the late 2023 bull run, this crucial on-chain metric suggests that underlying buying pressure remains strong, supporting positive market trends . For anyone navigating the dynamic crypto landscape, these expert crypto analyst insights serve as a powerful reminder that fundamental supply-demand dynamics are often the true drivers of long-term value. As Bitcoin continues its journey, keeping an eye on these vital on-chain signals will be key to understanding its trajectory and capitalizing on its potential.

If $XRP had the same market cap as $BTC, 1 XRP would be worth over $35.” This simple comparison underscores the relationship between market capitalization and token supply—two critical metrics that determine a cryptocurrency’s price. The Numbers Behind the Comparison As of report time, Bitcoin’s market capitalization is approximately $2.14 trillion, with a circulating supply of about 19.9 million BTC. In contrast, XRP has a circulating supply of roughly 58.94 billion tokens and a market cap near $130 billion. By dividing Bitcoin’s market cap by XRP’s circulating supply, $36.31 per XRP is obtained. This confirms Amonyx’s statement— if XRP matched Bitcoin’s market cap, each XRP would be worth over $35 . With XRP currently trading around $2.19, this scenario would reflect a price increase of more than 1,500%. Did you know? If $XRP had the same market cap as $BTC , 1 XRP would be worth over $35. pic.twitter.com/BeZRBPDlmw — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 25, 2025 Rising Institutional Interest and Market Momentum Beyond the numbers, XRP continues to gain traction among institutions and policymakers. In March 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order officially recognizing a group of digital assets as part of the U.S. strategic crypto reserve. Among them were XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano, a significant endorsement of XRP’s growing institutional relevance. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has long focused on developing blockchain-based payment infrastructure. Its collaborations with global financial institutions and central banks have reinforced XRP’s role in real-time cross-border settlement. This practical utility has helped XRP remain a top contender in blockchain finance. Additionally, there is increasing discussion around the creation of XRP-backed exchange-traded products (ETPs). While no XRP spot ETF has been approved yet , the success of Bitcoin ETFs has intensified demand for broader crypto-based investment vehicles. Regulatory developments could eventually open the door for institutional-grade XRP investment products. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 One of XRP’s standout advantages is its energy efficiency. According to verified network data, each XRP transaction consumes only 0.0079 kWh, compared to over 700 kWh per Bitcoin transaction. In a world increasingly focused on sustainability, XRP’s low energy profile strengthens its appeal to ESG-conscious investors and institutions. Amonyx’s statement that 1 XRP would be worth over $35 if it had the same market cap as Bitcoin is mathematically accurate. The comparison provides a clear, data-driven perspective on XRP’s price to its supply and potential valuation. While no forecast is implied, the analysis underscores the importance of XRP’s ongoing growth, institutional adoption, and efficient design. As conversations around regulation, utility, and institutional access continue to evolve, XRP remains a digital asset with one of the most compelling value propositions in the market today.

TSMC Global said in a statement, reported by Bloomberg, that this move will help it manage exchange-rate risk. It is the third such deal since 2024 and the largest so far. Like the earlier transactions, this one comes as the Taiwan dollar has strengthened, giving the unit more capital to cover its hedges. TSMC Global is responsible for its overseas investments and hedging. The Taiwan dollar has climbed recently, raising concerns in Taipei over the economy’s reliance on exports. In May, it posted its biggest single-day gain since the 1980s, spurring the central bank to seek ways to curb speculative trading. “Generally speaking, the heightened forex volatility would mean that banks may be adjusting their margin requirements,” said Philip McNicholas, Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco in Singapore. “Issuing new shares and bringing in an immediate cash injection may help companies manage margin requirements on both existing and new hedges.” Stronger Taiwan dollar hits TSMC’s export earnings TSMC is the largest exporter and main chip supplier to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Because most of its production is in Taiwan, a stronger dollar cuts into the U.S. earnings it brings home or forces it to raise overseas prices, which could hurt demand. In June, Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei told shareholders that operating margins had fallen by several percentage points due to the stronger local currency. Last week, TSMC’s US-listed shares fell 2.5 % , while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index slid 2 %. Applied Materials dropped 4 % and Dutch equipment maker ASML lost 1.9 %. In April, the company gave a positive forecast for the year based on AI demand. “Our job is to give customers enough chips, and we’re working hard on that. ‘Working hard’ means it’s not enough,” he said. When asked about reports that TSMC is eyeing chip factories in the United Arab Emirates, Wei said the company has no such plans.

This isn’t just another headline; it’s a clear signal that traditional finance is increasingly recognizing the immense potential of digital assets , particularly stablecoin technology. For anyone following the evolution of money and blockchain, this move by a major player like KB Kookmin Bank is nothing short of pivotal. Why is KB Kookmin Bank’s Trademark Move So Significant? The news, first reported by local outlet Newsis, reveals that KB Kookmin Bank has initiated the process of obtaining trademark rights related to stablecoins. This marks a historic first for a traditional bank in the country. While digital banks like KakaoBank (affiliated with messaging giant Kakao) previously filed similar applications for names such as BKRW, KRWB, KKBKRW, and KRWKKB, KB Kookmin’s entry signifies a broader embrace from established financial institutions. KB Kookmin’s proposed trademarks include combinations of ‘KB’ and ‘KRW’ (the symbol for the Korean won), such as KBKRW, KRWKB, KBST, and KRWST. This isn’t merely a defensive move; it suggests a strategic intent to potentially issue or facilitate services around a Korean Won-pegged stablecoin. But what does this really mean? Mainstream Adoption: It brings stablecoins closer to everyday financial services, potentially integrating them into banking apps and payment systems. Regulatory Clarity: Such moves by major banks often push regulators to provide clearer guidelines, fostering a more secure environment for digital assets. Competition and Innovation: It signals a race among financial institutions to innovate in the digital currency space, potentially leading to better services for consumers. Understanding the Stablecoin Landscape in South Korea A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or, in this case, the Korean Won (KRW). They aim to combine the speed and security of blockchain technology with the stability of traditional currencies, making them ideal for payments, remittances, and even as a bridge between fiat and volatile cryptocurrencies. South Korea has long been a hotbed for cryptocurrency activity, boasting one of the most active trading markets globally. However, its regulatory environment has often been cautious, focusing on consumer protection and anti-money laundering. The interest from banks like KB Kookmin Bank and KakaoBank indicates a shift, perhaps driven by the global trend towards central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and the increasing utility of private stablecoins. The potential benefits of a bank-issued KRW stablecoin for the Korean economy are significant: Faster and Cheaper Transactions: Streamlining domestic and international payments. Enhanced Financial Inclusion: Potentially offering digital financial services to a broader population. Innovation in Fintech: Paving the way for new financial products and services built on blockchain. The Future of Digital Assets in Korean Finance: What’s Next? The trademark applications by KB Kookmin Bank are more than just legal formalities; they are a strong indicator of where the financial industry in South Korea is headed. This proactive step suggests that traditional banks are not content to merely observe the rise of digital assets ; they intend to actively participate and shape their future. We could see a future where a KB-issued KRW stablecoin facilitates instant cross-border payments, or even enables tokenized securities and other innovative financial products. This move also puts pressure on other major Korean banks to explore their own digital currency strategies, potentially accelerating the country’s transition towards a more digitized economy. Challenges remain, of course. Regulatory frameworks need to evolve to accommodate these new financial instruments. Technological integration into existing banking systems will be complex. And public trust and adoption will be crucial for widespread success. However, the intent is clear: the digital transformation of finance is no longer a distant dream but an active pursuit by even the most established institutions. Global Implications: South Korea’s Stablecoin Leap While this news focuses on South Korea , its implications resonate globally. As central banks worldwide explore CBDCs and private stablecoins gain traction, the actions of major commercial banks like KB Kookmin Bank set a precedent. It demonstrates that traditional financial institutions are increasingly willing to engage with blockchain technology beyond just investment, moving into product development and service offerings. This trend could lead to greater interoperability between traditional finance and the decentralized world, bridging the gap between fiat currencies and blockchain networks. It’s a testament to the undeniable momentum of digital assets and their potential to revolutionize how we think about money and value transfer. A New Horizon for Finance KB Kookmin Bank ‘s move to secure stablecoin -related trademark rights is a landmark event for South Korea and a significant indicator for the global financial sector. It underscores a growing recognition among traditional banks of the transformative power of digital assets . As these established institutions begin to integrate blockchain technology and stablecoins into their core operations, we are witnessing the dawn of a new era in finance – one that promises greater efficiency, accessibility, and innovation. The journey has just begun, and the coming years are sure to bring even more exciting developments from the heart of Korean banking.

Easing hostilities between Iran and Israel, and reports that Iran isn’t seeking to block the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil passageway, buoyed markets. With the S&P 500 on the cusp of a new rally to record highs, investors in other markets have also turned bullish.

In particular, data on Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, will be released on Friday. Investors might want to pay attention to economic data rather than obsess with a rate cut, Carol Schleif, chief market strategist of wealth management provider BMO said. Speaking to CNBC on Wednesday, Schleif noted: “The obsession with the Fed actually distracts us from looking at the economic data. I’m not sure why the markets are leaning into a cut so much.” The tariffs front is also crucial, with Bloomberg reporting that the European Union saying it will retaliate if the U.S. holds the baseline 10% tariffs.

The 12 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to SoSoValue, received $588.55 million in inflows, the biggest in over a month. BlackRock’s IBIT fund had the biggest with $436.32 million of new money, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $85.16 million and ARK Invest’s ARKB with $43.85 million. The trio accounted for over 95% of the day’s inflows. Geopolitical Tranquility Sparks Risk-On Rotation The steep inflows followed a major geopolitical development: a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran. First disclosed by former U.S. President Donald Trump, the truce reassured fears of region-wide intensifying warfare in the Middle East. The subsequent decline in oil-related inflation risk powered a broad shift to risk assets. Bitcoin surged 6.1% on the news, surging above $106,000 and indicating new bullish momentum. Fed Policy Change Eases Regulatory Atmosphere Regulatorily, the Federal Reserve removed the term “reputational risk” from its guidelines for supervising banks on June 23. This subtle but influential change should ease compliance barriers for banks wishing to do business with digital asset firms. Market experts believe that this could very well accelerate crypto’s integration into traditional banking systems, particularly in custody and settlement services. Institutional Demand Accelerates Bitcoin’s growing popularity as a treasury tool continues to drive institutional demand. MicroStrategy added another $26 million worth of Bitcoin, taking its hoard to 592,345 BTC. Investor Anthony Pompliano took the initiative to start ProCap, a Bitcoin treasury firm that currently has $387 million worth of the asset with ambitions to get up to $1 billion. Adding to the momentum, Trump Media filed with the SEC to list the “Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF,” consisting of 75% in Bitcoin and 25% in Ethereum.

On June 25, the firm revealed its intention to incorporate Bitcoin (BTC) into its treasury reserves, a move that signals a bold new direction for traditional businesses. This decision positions TruSpine Technologies at the forefront of a growing trend, challenging conventional approaches to asset management and risk mitigation. TruSpine Technologies Embraces a Bold Bitcoin Treasury Strategy The news, first reported by JinSe Finance, highlights TruSpine Technologies’ proactive stance in adapting to global economic shifts. As a medical device company, its foray into the world of digital assets might seem unexpected to some, but it reflects a calculated strategic decision. The company plans to allocate funds from future financing rounds towards acquiring BTC, transforming a portion of its corporate holdings into a digital format. Why would a medical firm, traditionally focused on innovation in healthcare, pivot towards a Bitcoin treasury strategy? TruSpine’s rationale is clear: they view Bitcoin as a strategic hedge. Specifically, the company aims to protect its reserves against the pervasive threats of inflation and global political risks. In an era marked by economic uncertainty and geopolitical instability, traditional fiat currencies and fixed-income assets can be vulnerable. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and limited supply, offers an alternative store of value that many believe can withstand such pressures. Why Are More Companies Considering Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? TruSpine Technologies is not an isolated case. Over the past few years, a growing number of corporations, ranging from tech giants to traditional businesses, have begun exploring or outright adopting corporate Bitcoin strategies. This trend is driven by several factors: Erosion of Purchasing Power: Central bank policies, including quantitative easing and low-interest rates, have led to concerns about the long-term devaluation of fiat currencies. Companies are looking for assets that can preserve or even grow their purchasing power. Diversification: Traditional treasury management often relies on a limited set of assets like cash, bonds, and equities. Bitcoin offers a new avenue for diversification, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Technological Advancement: As the world becomes increasingly digital, embracing digital assets aligns with a forward-thinking business philosophy. It signals an understanding of emerging financial paradigms. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth, attracting companies seeking higher returns than traditional low-yield assets. Early pioneers like MicroStrategy and Tesla have showcased the potential, and the challenges, of holding significant Bitcoin reserves. Their experiences have provided a blueprint, and lessons, for other companies considering a similar path. Bitcoin as an Inflation Hedge: A New Paradigm for Corporate Finance? One of the primary drivers behind TruSpine’s decision is Bitcoin’s perceived role as an inflation hedge . The argument is compelling: unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed indefinitely by central banks, Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins. This scarcity, combined with its decentralized and censorship-resistant nature, makes it an attractive alternative to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. Consider the comparison between Bitcoin and traditional treasury assets: Feature Traditional Treasury Assets (e.g., Cash, Bonds) Bitcoin (BTC) Inflation Protection Vulnerable to inflation, purchasing power erodes. Limited supply, designed to be deflationary; strong hedge potential. Supply Control Controlled by central banks; supply can be increased. Decentralized, fixed supply; predictable issuance schedule. Global Accessibility Subject to national borders, capital controls. Globally accessible, borderless; 24/7 liquidity. Volatility Generally low, but can be affected by interest rate changes. Historically high, but maturing; requires risk tolerance. Counterparty Risk Exposure to banks, governments, or issuing entities. Minimal if self-custodied; depends on chosen custodian. While Bitcoin’s volatility remains a key consideration for any treasury manager, its long-term performance and unique characteristics offer a compelling argument for its inclusion as a modern-day inflation hedge . Crafting a Robust Digital Asset Strategy: Key Considerations for Businesses Adopting a digital asset strategy , especially one involving a significant allocation to Bitcoin, is not without its complexities. Companies like TruSpine Technologies must navigate a landscape fraught with regulatory ambiguities, security concerns, and accounting challenges. For any firm considering this path, a robust framework is essential: Due Diligence and Research: Thoroughly understand Bitcoin’s technology, market dynamics, and historical performance. Assess its suitability for your company’s specific financial goals and risk appetite. Risk Management: Develop a comprehensive risk management framework. This includes setting clear allocation limits, establishing stop-loss strategies, and understanding the potential impact of price fluctuations on financial statements. Custody Solutions: Securely storing Bitcoin is paramount. Companies must choose between self-custody (requiring deep technical expertise and robust security protocols) and institutional-grade third-party custodians who offer insurance and advanced security measures. Regulatory and Legal Compliance: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies varies widely across jurisdictions and is constantly evolving. Companies must ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC), tax, and securities laws. Accounting and Reporting: The accounting treatment for Bitcoin can be complex. Companies need to work with auditors and financial experts to ensure proper classification, valuation, and reporting of digital assets on their balance sheets. Board and Shareholder Communication: Transparent communication with the board of directors, shareholders, and investors is crucial. Clearly articulate the rationale, risks, and expected benefits of the digital asset strategy. These considerations highlight that while the benefits can be substantial, a successful digital asset strategy requires careful planning, expert advice, and a commitment to continuous monitoring. What Does TruSpine Technologies’ Move Mean for the Future of Corporate Reserves? The decision by TruSpine Technologies to hold Bitcoin in its treasury is more than just a financial maneuver; it’s a statement. It signals a growing acceptance and legitimization of Bitcoin as a viable, long-term asset class for corporate balance sheets, even outside the tech and finance sectors. As a medical device company, TruSpine’s move could inspire other firms in traditional industries to re-evaluate their treasury strategies. This development suggests several potential implications for the future of corporate reserves: Increased Mainstream Adoption: As more diverse companies embrace Bitcoin, it moves further from being a niche investment and closer to a standard component of corporate finance. Innovation in Treasury Management: Companies may become more experimental and open to integrating non-traditional assets into their portfolios, fostering innovation in treasury practices. Regulatory Clarity: Growing corporate adoption could pressure regulators to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks, reducing uncertainty and encouraging broader participation. Enhanced Market Maturity: Institutional involvement brings more capital, liquidity, and professional standards to the Bitcoin market, contributing to its overall maturity and stability. TruSpine Technologies’ pioneering step serves as a powerful example of how companies are adapting to a rapidly changing global economy. Their commitment to leveraging Bitcoin as a strategic hedge against inflation and political risks showcases a forward-thinking approach that could redefine corporate treasury management for years to come. In conclusion, TruSpine Technologies’ decision to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy marks a significant milestone in the ongoing integration of digital assets into mainstream corporate finance. It reflects a proactive response to macroeconomic challenges and highlights Bitcoin’s increasing recognition as a legitimate store of value and an effective inflation hedge . While the path to a fully integrated digital asset strategy involves careful navigation of risks and regulatory landscapes, the bold move by TruSpine Technologies underscores a revolutionary shift in how companies perceive and manage their financial futures. This pioneering step by a UK medical firm could well inspire a new wave of corporate adoption, further solidifying Bitcoin’s role in the global economy.

Ethereum’s climbing. Bitcoin’s reclaiming dominance. But if you’re looking to turn $600 into something close to $54,000, the answer isn’t in stacking slow movers like ETH. It’s in meme coins, the high-risk, high-reward wildcards that explode the moment retail mania kicks in. But not just any memes. The ones with momentum, utility, and viral narratives. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A Meme Engine, Not Just a Coin Let’s start with the one meme coin that isn’t waiting for a bull market to prove its worth. LILPEPE has already raised over $1.82 million in its presale, with 1.66 billion tokens sold out of a 2.25 billion Stage 3 supply. That’s a full-blown stampede with its price still just $0.0012. What makes LILPEPE stand out isn’t just the early buzz. It’s the tech behind the meme. That means: Blazing-fast transactions with zero gas fees Rug-proof, sniper-resistant architecture A built-in meme launchpad called Pepe’s Pump Pad Full Ethereum compatibility, without Ethereum headaches An all-star giveaway—$777,000 in prizes, with 10 people set to win $77,000 each just for helping spread the word Even more exciting? The presale listing price has already been confirmed at $0.003, meaning early buyers are locked in for a 2.5x gain before it even hits the open market. This is a meme coin that gives PEPE and SHIB vibes—but with a layer of tech that no one expected. If it even touches $0.05 in the next cycle, that $200 bet becomes $8,333. And if it catches a SHIB-style wave? Well, let’s just say that’s where six-figure memes are born. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Original Meme With Muscle SHIB has been around the block, and unlike many of its 2020–2021 contemporaries, it’s still here—and still pumping. So what makes SHIB still worth a shot? It has a massive army of loyal holders (the “ShibArmy”) Billions in liquidity means it can pump fast when retail returns TVL in Shibarium is growing, and analysts are eyeing $0.0001 as the next major resistance Currently, SHIB trades at around $0.000014, and technical charts indicate that a breakout above $0.0000147 could trigger a sharp rally. Even without hitting a dollar, a 5–7x return from here is plausible in a meme-fueled bull run. Put $200 in SHIB now, and you’ll see a potential $1,400–$2,000 return with just a mild run-up. Add that to a bag of LILPEPE, and we’re talking layered exposure—meme blue-chip meets emerging frogtech. ai16z (AI16Z): The Meme That Thinks for Itself You’ve heard of a DAO. You’ve heard of meme coins. You’ve heard of AI. Have you heard of a meme coin governed by AI within a DAO? ai16z, launched on Solana in October 2024, is the first token to combine meme culture, decentralized governance, and artificial intelligence. Its name is a play on “a16z” (Andreessen Horowitz’s VC nickname), but its mission is much wilder—token holders vote, and a built-in AI agent executes decisions. From buying NFTs to funding micro-projects, the community feeds the brain. And it’s not just an idea on paper. The circulating supply is only 1.1 billion, which is small enough to move quickly. If the broader market leans into AI narratives again, then AI16Z could become the poster child for smart, meme-meets-machine investing. Even if you invest just $200, a run to $5 would yield over $4,300. And in a full bull? $10–$12 isn’t fantasy—it’s fuel. Final Take: Turn $600 into $54,000? Let’s break it down: $200 in LILPEPE at $0.0012 → If it hits $0.10 = $16,666 $200 in SHIB → 5x rally? $1,000–$1,400 $200 in AI16Z → From $0.23 to $10? $8,600+ Multiply that with meme season mania, and you’re suddenly in $50K+ territory. All from what most people spend on weekend dinners and impulse buys. Meme coins don’t ask you to be rich—they ask you to be early. Want to get in before the rest of Crypto X catches on?

This 43% surge in total market capitalization underscores a broad-based crypto rally, but the gains have been unevenly distributed across categories. Crypto market cap 1-year. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin ( BTC ) has led the charge, swelling its market cap by about 74.7% to approximately $2.13 trillion, which solidifies BTC’s dominance at roughly 60% of the entire market. Crypto market cap 1-year distribution. Source: CoinMarketCap Stablecoins (USD-pegged digital tokens used for liquidity and trading) also expanded by 51.5%, now making up over $230 billion of the market – a sign of significant new capital parked in crypto’s dollar-based rails. The aggregate value of “Other” cryptocurrencies – essentially all non-Bitcoin, non-Ethereum, non-stablecoin assets has grown about 26.9% year-on-year, reflecting healthy if more modest growth in altcoins broadly. In stark contrast, Ethereum ( ETH ) (the second-largest crypto) has lagged dramatically: Ether’s market cap actually shrank 28% over the year, dropping from roughly $408 billion to about $292 billion. As a result, Ethereum’s share of the total market has nearly halved (down to only 9% of crypto’s value), even as Bitcoin’s dominance has surged to multi-year highs. Such a substantial $1 trillion upswing in crypto’s collective valuation did not occur in isolation. It has been bolstered by a confluence of positive forces from a seismic shift in U.S. political/regulatory climate to strong institutional investment flows and the rollout of new cryptocurrency investment vehicles. These tailwinds have not only driven Bitcoin to new heights ($111,970 per coin in May) but have also fostered a sense of renewed momentum in the broader digital asset space. Below, we break down the key factors behind crypto’s remarkable past-year run. Trump’s pro-crypto turnaround A major factor energizing the crypto market has been the political sea change in the United States. The election and January inauguration of President Donald Trump for a second term marked a stark pivot in U.S. crypto policy. Trump campaigned on making America “a hub for digital asset innovation” and courted crypto enthusiasts with bold promises, firing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, halting government Bitcoin sales, establishing a strategic national Bitcoin reserve, and crafting friendly crypto policies. Indeed, one of Trump’s first moves in office was expected to be appointing a new, crypto-friendly SEC chair to replace the notoriously stringent Gensler. This promise materialized: under the new administration, the SEC’s leadership quickly took a more accommodative stance, even kicking off a “crypto policy overhaul” to unwind the prior regime’s enforcement-centric approach. The change in tone cannot be overstated, regulators signaled they would “stop suing crypto [companies] and start talking to crypto,” in the words of one industry advocate, a sharp departure from the aggressive clampdowns of years prior. Crucially, Trump’s own actions have directly bolstered crypto sentiment. In a striking show of support, President Trump literally entered the crypto arena himself by launching a personal crypto token called Official TRUMP ( TRUMP ) around his inauguration in January. The meme coin token’s debut was met with frenzied trading: TRUMP rocketed from about $10 to over $74 within days, at one point achieving a staggering paper valuation near $8.9 billion. While clearly a highly speculative venture, the token’s brief success underscored the feverish enthusiasm among Trump’s base and crypto traders for anything associated with the new President’s name. Just days after TRUMP launched, two asset managers (REX Shares and Osprey Funds) even filed for a “Trump Meme Coin ETF” to package the token into an exchange-traded fund. Institutional FOMO: Wall Street pours billions into crypto Another critical driver of the past year’s crypto resurgence has been heavy institutional investment, particularly via new Bitcoin-focused funds and ETFs. In 2024, U.S. regulators allowed the first spot Bitcoin ETFs , and that opening of the floodgates truly materialized in 2025. Over the last year we’ve witnessed nothing short of an institutional buying frenzy for Bitcoin, as traditional finance titans race to secure their piece of the digital gold rush. Nowhere is this more evident than in the actions of the world’s largest asset managers. BlackRock , the $9 trillion asset giant, and Fidelity, the $4+ trillion brokerage behemoth, have been accumulating Bitcoin at an unprecedented scale through their crypto fund offerings. On June 24, 2025, blockchain records flagged by Arkham Intelligence showed that BlackRock and Fidelity collectively scooped up over $521 million of BTC in a single day . BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), the firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF vehicle received a mammoth inflow of 4,130 BTC (roughly $436 million worth) in one day, sourced from Coinbase’s institutional custody platform. On the same day, Fidelity’s own Bitcoin fund (ticker FBTC) grabbed 805 BTC ($85 million), via a pair of large OTC transactions into its custodial wallet. These massive purchases underscore how major institutions are methodically building exposure on any market dips. Such daily buys by two of Wall Street’s biggest names were part of a broader trend of sustained ETF inflows. In fact, that late-June day marked an inflection point: in total, U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw over $659 million in net inflows on June 24 alone, the largest one-day influx on record. BlackRock is competing with Strategy As of late-June, BlackRock’s ETF held roughly 683,185 BTC (over $73 billion worth), putting BlackRock neck-and-neck with (or ahead of) Michael Saylor’s famed Bitcoin stash at Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Speaking of Saylor: corporate accumulation has continued unabated alongside the ETF frenzy. Saylor’s company Strategy has been buying Bitcoin relentlessly week after week, recently even during price dips caused by geopolitical news. Between BlackRock’s ETF and Strategy’s treasury, over 1.147 million BTC are now held by just these two institutions, a decent percentage of Bitcoin’s total supply. Add in other players like Grayscale, which despite recent outflows has started adding to its GBTC trust again (even a modest +55 BTC in late June), and it’s clear that institutions are now a dominant force in the crypto market. Their sizable allocations have provided a steady bid supporting prices for instance, Bitcoin has consolidated firmly above $100,000 this summer amid these inflows. And their involvement lends an air of legitimacy that continues to draw even more capital off the sidelines. In short, big money is pouring into crypto. The combination of regulatory approval for exchange-traded products and growing investor appetite for an inflation-hedging, non-sovereign asset class has created a feedback loop: positive market performance begets more institutional interest, which begets more inflows and product launches, further boosting market cap. This institutional momentum has been a key pillar of the $1 trillion market cap increase – a fundamental shift from the retail-driven booms of prior years.

46758158,https://zycrypto.com/?p=107816,1750860236,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Deep Sea Mining Company Buys First 4 BTC for its $1.2 Billion Bitcoin Treasury Strategy,https://zycrypto.com/deep-sea-mining-company-buys-first-4-btc-for-its-1-2-billion-bitcoin-treasury-strategy/,"Green Minerals (GEM), a deep-sea mining firm, has bought 4 BTC on Wednesday as part of its strategy, announced on Monday, to acquire a $1.2 billion Bitcoin treasury. Green Minerals is joining many crypto companies building treasury strategies to convert various finance methodologies into cryptocurrencies as a store of value. The 4 BTC purchased for $420,000 at $105,000 per token, which amounts to 4.25 million Norwegian Kroner. Green Minerals is listed on the Oslo exchange and wishes to engage in a tech-centric business operations model. Stale Rodahl, executive chairman of Green Minerals, said that Bitcoin was a hedge against inflation and had the added benefit of being decentralized. Rodahl believes that Bitcoin tackles the issue of fiat debasement and could sustain the company through uncertain times. Green Minerals announced earlier this week that the deep-sea mining company was adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy to coincide with its sustainable mining business. The company stated explicitly that it invested in Bitcoin to offset the risks inherent to fiat currencies, which can be subjected to inflation and geopolitical risks. Green Minerals further wants to adopt blockchain technologies to modernize its operations. Rodahl, Green Minerals’ executive chairman, said it was important to maintain a strong balance sheet while enduring economic disruptions. The company plans to finance up to $1.2 billion through its Bitcoin treasury strategy. Green Minerals, however, wishes to maintain its regular operations and wants to integrate blockchain technology into its business model. Rodahl stated that Bitcoin can enhance transparency and trace supply chain networks. The company is committed to its capital expenditure goals and uses blockchain to digitise its treasury. Green Minerals will use a BTC/share metric so that shareholders can track the strength of its Bitcoin treasury. The company announced earlier this week that the treasury strategy would establish the company as a leader in finance innovations and technological business models. The company already prides itself as a leader in sustainable underwater mining operations, but wishes to embrace blockchain technology. Treasury strategy adoption is up 13% from last month due to an increased interest in holding crypto on the balance sheet. Green Minerals is just another company adding to this newfound trend. The corporate world has discovered a new use of crypto, which the blockchain community hasn’t thoroughly analysed. There are now over 245 companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. These companies collectively hold around $88 billion, which adds substantive value to the BTC token. Meanwhile, Green Minerals’ stock price dropped by 20% on Tuesday after the initial announcement. The company wishes to use transparent methods regarding acquiring Bitcoin and will update shareholders with any changes to the balance sheet. Rodahl assured investors that the Bitcoin strategy will support regular business operations to enhance technological efficiency and promote a future-oriented business model. Green Minerals plans to acquire its target of $1.2 billion worth of Bitcoin by working with its partners to devise programs to finance the acquisition. Green Minerals has now acquired its first 4 BTC as part of this plan, to start the process immediately. At the current $106,500 per Bitcoin price, the company could reach its target of $1.2 billion by buying 11,255 BTC. The company also wishes to integrate blockchain innovations into its business model to remain competitive in the underwater sustainable mining industry and prepare the business for any regulatory changes. As regards the mining industry, Green Minerals says that blockchain technology can be applied to supply chain verification and mineral origin certification. Norway, the country where Green Minerals resides, announced last week that it will temporarily ban Bitcoin mining centres to prioritise energy levels and meet environmental targets. The Labour government in Norway is concerned that Bitcoin is extracted with maximum computation efficiency, upsetting their key targets of reducing pollution levels. The Labour Party has commented that they would like to prioritise energy levels from Bitcoin data centres over those of community data centres. This illustrates how the Norwegian government values climate policy and views proof-of-work mechanisms as an obstacle to its strategic goals. Yet the government has stated that it values blockchain and AI technology. The Labour government does not wish to impede innovation in Norway, but wants to prioritise energy supply so that other industries can enjoy government subsidies. Green Minerals, meanwhile, may be accumulating a Bitcoin treasury to deal with regulatory uncertainty amidst an evolving public sector.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-25 14:03:56

The options are one of the largest quarterly settlements this year and have already begun influencing sentiment and volatility expectations across crypto markets. According to data provided by Deribit Metrics, a total of 141,271 Bitcoin options contracts will expire, with open interest amounting to more than 40% of Deribit’s total. Each contract on Deribit equals one BTC, bringing the total notional value of the expiring contracts to over $14 billion at current prices. The spot price of Bitcoin stood near $107,300 at the time of reporting. Put-call ratio increase sends mixed market sentiment signals Leading into the expiry, investors have increased their use of put options, driving the Bitcoin put-call open interest ratio to 0.72. An uptick in the put-call ratio is interpreted as a bearish signal. However, some analysts believe that the bearish read may be oversimplified in this case. Lin Chen, head of business development for Asia at Deribit, noted that much of the recent put activity appears to be driven by “cash-secured puts,” a common yield-generation strategy. In this approach, investors sell put options while keeping enough capital in reserve to buy BTC if prices drop and the puts are exercised. This tactic is akin to collecting a premium in exchange for a willingness to buy Bitcoin at a discount, and may not necessarily mean the market is outright pessimistic. Call options lead, but only a fraction profitable Out of the 141,271 contracts expiring Friday, 81,994 are call options, and the remainder are puts. Yet, despite the volume of calls, most of them are expected to expire worthless. According to Deribit, nearly 20% of the call options are currently “in the money,” with strike prices below the current spot level of $106,000. A portion of call holders have already secured profitable positions during the Q1 2024-Q1 2025 bullish cycle. Holders of profitable positions may look to either book gains or roll over their exposure to future contracts, and both moves can increase short-term market volatility. Deribit expects a spike in market movement around the expiry window, given its size and quarterly significance. Tight trading range, max pain near $102K Most expiring contracts with extreme strike prices are unlikely to pay out. The $300 call option has the largest open interest among out-of-the-money contracts, which shows that some traders had bet on a sustained rally in the first half of the year that failed to materialize. The “max pain point” for this expiry, the price level at which the greatest number of option buyers would incur losses, is calculated at $102,000. As of midweek, Bitcoin’s price is consolidating between $106,000 and $107,500, just above that threshold. Far out-of-the-money strikes have larger intervals, while those near the current price are more granular. Available increments include $50, $100, $500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000, several hedging and speculative possibilities for traders. Crypto market maker Wintermute reported that traders are selling straddles, a strategy that profits when volatility decreases, and writing call options around the $105,000 level while also shorting puts at $100,000. “Flows skew neutral with straddle/call selling around 105K and short puts at 100K… pointing to expectations of tight price action into expiry,” Wintermute’s OTC desk surmised.

SharpLink acquired 12,207 ETH at an average price of $2,513, boosting its treasury holdings to 188,478 Ether, or approximately $470 million based on the crypto’s price at the time. The ‘MicroStrategy Of Ether’ To fund the purchase, SharpLink raised $27.7 million in net proceeds through its at-the-market (ATM) offering, selling over 2.5 million shares. SharpLink is one of the increasing group of publicly traded companies that recently pivoted to add crypto to their corporate balance sheets, following the successful playbook of Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Since the company is centered on Ethereum, it is the first Nasdaq-listed firm to adopt ETH as its core treasury reserve asset, aiming to offer shareholders exposure to the second-largest crypto by market cap. Unlike Strategy, which typically just accumulates BTC, SharpLink has put its ETH to work. Since launching its ETH treasury strategy, the company said it has staked all its crypto cache, earning 120 ETH in rewards. The firm also disclosed an ETH-per-share growth rate of roughly 19% during that period. “This move reflects our confidence in Ethereum’s utility and our commitment to exploring transformative technologies that can unlock new value for our business and stockholders, alike,” said SharpLink Chairman of the Board, Ethereum co-founder, and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin in a statement. ETH is up 0.5% over the past 24 hours amid a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. It is now trading at $2,419.38, which is below the average purchase price for SharpLink’s treasury buys. Who Owns More ETH Than SharpLink? While SharpLink now claims the bragging right of being the biggest publicly traded holder of Ether globally, some entities are still holding more ETH. The Ethereum Foundation now holds 212,072 ETH ( valued at $514.59 million) in its treasury, data from Arkham Intelligence shows. Some crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issuers, such as BlackRock, also hold a considerably bigger ETH stash, albeit on behalf of their clients. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF held roughly 1.7 million ETH as of June 25, worth around $4 billion.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|ARKM,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-25 14:07:39

The cryptocurrency landscape is always evolving, with new projects emerging that promise to redefine various sectors, from finance to gaming. Keeping an eye on platforms that champion these innovators is key. In exciting news for the crypto community, Binance Alpha , a dedicated platform within the broader Binance Wallet ecosystem designed to spotlight early-stage crypto projects, is set to welcome XOCIETY (XO) on June 26th. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does It Matter for Emerging Crypto? Binance Alpha serves as a unique launchpad, not for token sales, but for visibility. It acts as a curated showcase for promising, yet nascent, blockchain projects. Think of it as a scout team for Binance, identifying potential future stars before they hit the mainstream. The selection process for projects featured on Binance Alpha is rigorous, focusing heavily on two critical factors: Community Engagement: Projects with strong, active, and growing communities often indicate genuine interest and potential for adoption. Market Trends: Binance Alpha keeps a keen eye on prevailing market trends, ensuring that the showcased projects align with areas of high innovation and demand within the crypto space. For an emerging crypto project, being featured on Binance Alpha is a significant milestone. It provides unparalleled exposure to a vast audience of crypto enthusiasts, potential investors, and developers who are actively seeking out cutting-edge opportunities. This exposure can significantly boost a project’s profile, foster community growth, and attract further development resources. Introducing XOCIETY (XO): A Glimpse into a Promising Early-Stage Crypto Project So, what exactly is XOCIETY (XO) ? While specific details often emerge closer to the feature date, XOCIETY is known to be a highly anticipated Web3 gaming and metaverse project. It aims to blend immersive gameplay with true digital ownership, leveraging blockchain technology to empower players with assets and experiences that truly belong to them. The addition of XOCIETY to Binance Alpha signals that the project has met Binance’s stringent criteria for community interest and alignment with current market trends in the booming blockchain gaming sector. This move highlights Binance Alpha’s commitment to showcasing diverse and innovative projects across the blockchain spectrum. For those interested in the future of gaming and digital economies, XOCIETY represents an intriguing prospect to monitor closely. Navigating Crypto Investment: What Does This Mean for You? For anyone engaged in crypto investment , news like XOCIETY’s addition to Binance Alpha presents both exciting opportunities and crucial considerations. It’s vital to understand the nuances of investing in early-stage projects: Visibility vs. Listing: A key point to remember, as explicitly stated by Binance, is that inclusion on Binance Alpha “does not guarantee a future listing on the exchange.” While it’s a strong indicator of potential, it’s not a direct path to being traded on Binance’s main exchange. Investors should manage their expectations accordingly. High Risk, High Reward: Early-stage crypto projects , by their very nature, carry higher risks than more established assets. However, they also offer the potential for substantial returns if the project succeeds. Thorough due diligence is paramount. Community and Development: For projects like XOCIETY, success hinges not just on initial hype but on sustained development, active community participation, and real-world utility. Look beyond the headlines and delve into the project’s whitepaper, team, roadmap, and community channels. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Investment Journey If you’re considering exploring projects featured on platforms like Binance Alpha, here are some actionable insights to guide your crypto investment strategy: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on an announcement. Investigate XOCIETY (XO)’s fundamentals, technology, use case, team, tokenomics, and community activity. Understand the Project’s Vision: What problem is XOCIETY solving? How does it differentiate itself in the competitive Web3 gaming space? A clear, compelling vision is crucial for long-term success. Monitor Community Sentiment: Active and positive community engagement on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Discord, and Telegram can be a strong indicator of a project’s health and potential. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Early-stage projects are speculative. Diversifying your portfolio can help mitigate risk. The addition of XOCIETY (XO) to Binance Alpha on June 26th is a testament to Binance’s continuous effort to foster innovation within the blockchain space and provide a spotlight for promising ventures. For enthusiasts and investors alike, it offers a unique opportunity to engage with and potentially benefit from the growth of cutting-edge blockchain applications. Conclusion: The Exciting Future of Emerging Crypto The showcase of XOCIETY (XO) on Binance Alpha marks an exciting development for both the project and the broader crypto community. It underscores Binance’s role in identifying and promoting early-stage crypto projects that show significant promise. While inclusion on Binance Alpha doesn’t guarantee a main exchange listing, it certainly provides invaluable exposure and validation, setting the stage for XOCIETY to gain further traction. For those passionate about crypto investment , keeping a close watch on these curated projects can open doors to incredible opportunities in the dynamic world of emerging crypto .

While this move shows strength, the context around it paints a more cautious picture. ETH remains under pressure from macro uncertainty and weakening bullish momentum across altcoins. Current price action suggests the bounce may be short-lived unless key resistance levels are reclaimed with volume and conviction. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily chart, ETH recently broke down from an ascending channel formation that had been building for weeks. This pattern, often bearish, played out with a sharp drop that found support at the $2,200 region, a key demand zone marked by previous accumulation and the 100-day moving average. After tagging this level, ETH bounced aggressively and is now retesting the lower boundary of the channel from below. The 200-day MA is also nearby, located just above the channel’s lower boundary at the $2,550 mark. The confluence of these resistances makes this zone critical. So far, the price action has shown hesitation, a common characteristic of weak retests. So, if the buyers fail to reclaim this zone convincingly, we could see another leg down below the $2,000 mark. Conversely, a strong daily close above $2,550 would invalidate the bearish structure and open room for a revisit of the $2,800 resistance level and order block. The 4-Hour Chart As the 4-hour timeframe shows, Ethereum tested the bullish Fair Value Gap (FVG) created during the recent bounce, using it as a support to climb higher. The short-term structure will flip bullish if the price breaks back into the channel, invalidating the bearish pattern effectively. Meanwhile, the RSI has also jumped above 50, indicating that the buyers are in control again on this timeframe, which could lead to a recovery and clear the path for a retest of the $2,800 resistance zone. On-Chain Analysis Ethereum Exchange Reserve Exchange reserve data from CryptoQuant shows that Ethereum holdings on centralized trading platforms have dropped to 18.8 million ETH, the lowest level in recent years. This steady decline reflects reduced selling pressure and a strong preference for self-custody, often interpreted as a bullish long-term signal. When reserves fall, it generally means fewer coins are readily available to sell on exchanges, potentially setting up a supply shock. However, it’s important to note that while low reserves often accompany major bullish moves, they are not a short-term timing tool. Price can still drop in the near term if demand does not match current supply flows or if broader market conditions remain risk-off. This metric supports long-term strength, but short-term price action remains technically vulnerable.

Moca Chain testnet will launch in the third quarter of this year. Mainnet will follow in Q4. Key use cases, the team claims, include healthcare, finance, recruitment, and advertising. Per the press release shared with Cryptonews , this will be a modular, EVM-compatible platform, interoperable with other chains. It will utilise the MOCA Coin and established partnerships, including SK Planet’s OK Cashbag and OneFootball (which together count nearly 230 million users), for cross-chain identity verification. Moreover, MOCA Coin will be the core token for gas, validator staking, storage, oracle, data generation, and verification fees.

The team claims that this approach “will enable users to unlock access and rewards across platforms without exposing private data, while maintaining a unified identity that is fully under their control.” Additionally, the teams building protocols on Moca Chain can “choose to issue or verify reusable on- and off-chain user data and credentials for monetization.” The data issued to the end user can be verified “everywhere” via zero-knowledge proofs. This is “fostering ecosystem growth by cross-pollinating users without any direct API integrations, shifting the counterparty of verifiers from centralized platforms to end users,” the team argues.

On the contrary, Moca Chain will give users decentralized ownership of their data, without a single point of failure, Sui says. Kenneth Shek, project lead of Moca Network, added that “by adopting Moca Chain and MOCA Coin, we believe we can disrupt current models of data ownership and break down the dominance of walled garden ecosystems, returning value to the users who generate it and making ecosystem growth more scalable.” You may also like: Animoca Brands Secures $20M Funding to Drive Ambitious Mocaverse Metaverse Project – NFT’s Making a Comeback?

The mighty US Dollar , a cornerstone of global commerce and a significant influencer on everything from commodity prices to cryptocurrency valuations, finds itself in a precarious position. After a period of impressive strength, it now struggles to regain its poise, prompting widespread speculation among investors and analysts alike. Adding to this palpable anticipation is the looming presence of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell , whose upcoming speech is set to deliver critical insights, potentially reshaping the entire US Dollar outlook for the foreseeable future. For those tracking the volatile crypto markets, understanding the dollar’s trajectory is more than just academic; it’s a vital piece of the puzzle, often dictating the flow of capital and the appeal of alternative digital assets. What’s Driving the US Dollar’s Recent Struggles? The dollar’s recent performance has been anything but stable. After periods of impressive ascent, it now finds itself navigating choppy waters, struggling to regain its footing against major global currencies. Several interconnected factors contribute to this volatility and the shifting US Dollar outlook : Persistent Inflationary Pressures: While there are signs that inflation is cooling, its persistence above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target remains a concern. The market is constantly weighing whether the Fed’s past actions have been sufficient or if more tightening is required, creating uncertainty around the dollar’s value. Federal Reserve’s Policy Stance: The pace of interest rate hikes and, more recently, the discussion around potential rate cuts, significantly impacts the dollar. A perception that the Fed might be less aggressive than other central banks, or that it might cut rates sooner, can weaken the dollar’s appeal. Global Economic Slowdown Concerns: Fears of a recession in major economies, including the US, can lead to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment. While the dollar often acts as a safe-haven asset during crises, prolonged global economic weakness can erode confidence and dampen demand for dollar-denominated assets. Geopolitical Tensions: Ongoing conflicts and trade disputes introduce significant uncertainty into the global financial system. While initial shocks might send investors to the perceived safety of the dollar, prolonged instability can shift capital flows and influence currency valuations in unpredictable ways. Jerome Powell’s Crucial Address: Decoding the Fed’s Next Moves All eyes are on the upcoming Jerome Powell speech . As the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, his words carry immense weight, capable of moving global markets instantly. Investors, traders, and policymakers alike will be dissecting every nuance of his remarks for clues about the Fed’s future monetary policy path. What key insights might he offer, and what should market participants be listening for? Inflation Trajectory: Powell will likely provide an update on the Fed’s assessment of inflation. Will he reiterate the central bank’s unwavering commitment to the 2% target, or will he acknowledge the progress made in disinflation, potentially signaling a less aggressive stance? Labor Market Strength: The health of the US labor market is a critical factor in the Fed’s decision-making. Any signals on employment data, wage growth, or unemployment rates could influence future policy considerations. Monetary Policy Path: This is perhaps the most anticipated part of any Jerome Powell speech . Will he hint at further rate hikes, confirm a pause in the tightening cycle, or even open the door to potential rate cuts in the near future? The market will be looking for clarity on the ‘terminal rate’ – the peak interest rate in this cycle. Economic Projections: Updates on the Fed’s outlook for GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation forecasts will provide a broader picture of the central bank’s expectations for the economy. Powell’s previous addresses have often provided clarity, but sometimes also introduced new uncertainties, leading to significant market reactions. His communication style and choice of words are meticulously scrutinized, as even subtle shifts can trigger major shifts in asset prices. Unpacking Global Economic Trends and Their Influence The dollar does not exist in a vacuum; its strength or weakness is heavily influenced by broader global economic trends . The interconnectedness of economies means that developments far from Washington D.C. can have a profound impact on the dollar’s valuation. China’s Economic Recovery: A robust and sustained recovery in China, the world’s second-largest economy, could boost global growth and demand for riskier assets, potentially weakening the dollar as capital flows away from safe havens. Conversely, any signs of weakness could strengthen the dollar. European Resilience and Energy Prices: The Eurozone’s economic performance, especially regarding its energy security and inflation trajectory, directly impacts the EUR/USD pair, which is the most traded currency pair globally. A stronger Euro tends to put downward pressure on the dollar. Commodity Price Fluctuations: Changes in the prices of key commodities like oil, gas, and agricultural products affect inflation globally and influence trade balances, indirectly impacting currency valuations. Higher commodity prices can lead to inflationary pressures, which central banks respond to with policy adjustments. Geopolitical Landscape: Ongoing conflicts, trade disputes, and political instability across the globe create uncertainty. While the dollar often benefits from safe-haven flows during initial shocks, prolonged geopolitical tensions can erode long-term confidence and shift capital flows away from traditional safe assets. Economic Indicator Impact on US Dollar Current Trend/Significance Inflation Rate (CPI/PCE) Higher inflation can lead to aggressive rate hikes, strengthening the dollar. However, persistent high inflation without adequate Fed action can weaken confidence. Moderating, but still elevated above target. Fed closely watches core PCE. Employment Data (NFP, Unemployment Rate) Strong job growth and low unemployment indicate a healthy economy, supporting the dollar by signaling continued economic strength. Robust, but showing early signs of cooling from peak levels. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Growth Strong economic growth attracts foreign investment, increasing demand for the dollar. Slowing from post-pandemic highs, but has so far avoided a technical recession. Interest Rate Differentials Higher US interest rates relative to other major economies make dollar-denominated assets more attractive, drawing in capital and strengthening the dollar. Still favorable for the US compared to many developed nations, but narrowing as other central banks catch up. The Ripple Effect of Interest Rate Policy: The Fed’s Potent Lever on Dollar Strength The Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy is arguably the single most impactful factor on the dollar’s valuation. When the Fed raises rates, it makes dollar-denominated assets, such as US Treasury bonds, more attractive to global investors seeking higher returns. This increased demand for dollar assets translates into a stronger currency. Conversely, expectations of rate cuts, or a ‘dovish’ stance, can lead to dollar depreciation as capital flows out in search of better yields elsewhere. Quantitative Tightening (QT): Beyond just rate hikes, the Fed’s balance sheet reduction, known as quantitative tightening, also plays a role. By allowing bonds to mature without reinvesting the proceeds, the Fed effectively drains liquidity from the financial system, which can indirectly support the dollar by making it scarcer. Future Projections and ‘Dot Plots’: The market is constantly trying to front-run the Fed’s next moves. The Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) ‘dot plot,’ which indicates individual members’ projections for future interest rates, is meticulously analyzed for clues about the likely path of monetary policy. Global Synchronicity: The dollar’s strength is also relative. How other major central banks – such as the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of Japan (BoJ), and the Bank of England (BoE) – adjust their own interest rate policy influences the relative strength of the dollar against their respective currencies. If other central banks become more hawkish, the dollar’s yield advantage might diminish. Navigating the Forex Market: Strategies Amid Volatility For traders, investors, and businesses with international exposure, understanding the dynamics of the Forex market analysis is paramount. The current environment, characterized by dollar struggles and central bank uncertainty, demands careful consideration and adaptive strategies. Hedging Strategies: Businesses engaged in international trade often use forex derivatives to mitigate currency risk. This involves locking in an exchange rate for future transactions, protecting against adverse currency movements. Carry Trades: While potentially profitable, carry trades – borrowing in a low-interest-rate currency and investing in a high-interest-rate currency – become riskier in volatile periods. Sudden shifts in interest rate policy or risk sentiment can quickly unwind these positions. Technical vs. Fundamental Analysis: A blend of both approaches is crucial. Fundamental analysis helps market participants understand the ‘why’ behind currency movements (e.g., economic data, central bank policy), while technical analysis provides insights into potential entry and exit points based on price patterns and indicators. Risk Management: In a volatile forex market, robust risk management is non-negotiable. This includes appropriate position sizing, setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and avoiding excessive leverage. Diversification: Considering alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies, as part of a diversified portfolio can be a strategy to hedge against traditional currency fluctuations. However, it is vital to remember that cryptocurrencies carry their own unique set of risks and volatility. Staying Informed: Continuously monitoring economic calendars, central bank communications, and geopolitical developments is critical for making informed decisions in the fast-moving forex market. Challenges and Opportunities in a Shifting Landscape The current state of the US Dollar outlook presents both significant challenges and unique opportunities for market participants. Challenges: Sticky Inflation: If inflation proves more persistent than anticipated, it could force the Fed into more aggressive tightening, potentially triggering a deeper economic slowdown. Recessionary Pressures: The risk of a global or domestic recession remains. A severe downturn could lead to widespread deleveraging and unpredictable currency movements. Geopolitical Instability: Escalating conflicts or new geopolitical flashpoints could introduce extreme market volatility and sudden shifts in safe-haven demand. Policy Missteps: Any perceived missteps in interest rate policy or communication from major central banks could lead to market instability and erode confidence. Opportunities: Currency Pair Diversification: Investors can explore diversification into other strong or undervalued currencies, leveraging Forex market analysis to identify potential opportunities. Arbitrage Opportunities: Volatility can create short-term arbitrage opportunities for sophisticated traders who can capitalize on price discrepancies across different markets. Strategic Hedging: For businesses, understanding the dollar’s trajectory allows for more effective strategic hedging, protecting profit margins and operational stability. Long-Term Positioning: For long-term investors, periods of dollar weakness might present opportunities to acquire dollar-denominated assets at more favorable exchange rates. Conclusion: Navigating the Dollar’s Uncertain Path The US Dollar’s outlook remains shrouded in a degree of uncertainty, underscoring the complex interplay of domestic policy and broader global economic trends . As the highly anticipated Jerome Powell speech approaches, market participants eagerly await signals that will shape not only the immediate trajectory of the dollar but also the future direction of interest rate policy and, by extension, the global financial landscape. Navigating the Forex market analysis in these uncertain times requires vigilance, adaptability, and a deep understanding of the forces at play. Whether the dollar regains its poise or continues its struggle, its trajectory will undeniably influence global finance, including the burgeoning cryptocurrency space, emphasizing the critical need for informed decision-making in an ever-evolving market.

The MSTY fund's synthetic covered call strategy on MicroStrategy Incorporated stock exposes it to significant downside risk, especially given MSTR's Bitcoin-driven volatility. While MSTY has outperformed peers in total return since inception, this is unlikely to be repeatable due to NAV erosion and unsustainable distributions. I do not recommend MSTY for long-term investors seeking sustainable growth; if you must invest, keep exposure minimal due to high risk. The Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA: MSTY ) is one of a handful of ETFS that currently offer circa-100% yields. With typical yields between 1% and 5%, triple-digit distributions will surely turn heads. But is it MSTY worth it? Well, before I get into it, I think it’s important to give you a little of my background as it might assist in explaining my thesis. I consider myself a boring, long-term investor. My average holding is over eleven years, and I rarely sell. I buy and hold growth stocks over the long term, as well as quality dividend stocks for income generation, should I ever decide to retire. Most of my positions make up ~1.5 - 2% of my total portfolio, with a few Mag 7 positions taking up 8-9%. I do not invest in crypto - it’s not for me. However, I do like options income strategies like covered calls and cash-secured puts - which is why this article was fun to write. Attractive yields present a salivating opportunity for outsized distributions, if you understand the risks and are willing to take the plunge. MSTY offers an incredible distribution on the surface, but I say it’s mostly smoke and mirrors. Spoiler: I would not recommend MSTY. Let me explain. ETF Profile The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy is one of many ETFs that YieldMax ( YMAX ) currently offers. The company itself went public in late 2022, with its first ETF being the TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF ( TSLY ). Its ETFs focus primarily on income-generating options strategies to generate distributions for its investors. MSTY itself was launched in early 2024 and focuses on selling covered calls on MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), now simply Strategy . What’s interesting about this entire setup is Strategy’s business model - it functions less like a traditional tech firm and more like a proxy Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) holding company, with the vast majority of its balance sheet tied up in cryptocurrency. Strategy Inc Source: Strategy Inc. As of June 25, 2025, Strategy held 592,345 BTC , with an average cost of $70,681 per share, or approximately $41.857 billion in total. Uncovering YieldMax’s MSTY ETF Going back to YieldMax’s MSTY, the fund invests in a combination of long and short calls and short puts to create a synthetic covered call position. To understand the fund’s makeup, we need to first understand what a synthetic long position is, and what synthetic covered calls are. A synthetic long position requires three components: Cash/cash-like asset for collateral Short Put Long Call. The options usually have the same expiration date and strike. The short put allows the investor to participate in the downside, while the long call offers unlimited upside. When combined, the position costs less than directly owning the underlying asset, and carries the same risk as owning the underlying outright. Next, we have the synthetic covered call. With a traditional covered call, the investor sells a call on a stock they already own. The synthetic version allows the investor to sell up to an equal amount of calls against the portfolio’s long calls. Should the short call be assigned, the investor or fund manager can assign the long call position to cover the short call assignment. Since MSTY is selling calls, any volatility in MSTR - and Bitcoin by extension - can be a good thing. Higher volatility means higher premiums, though it comes with higher risk. MSTY Holdings Summary Here’s a complete breakdown of MSTY’s holdings: Options Positions Position Type Strike Price Market Value ( USD ) Portfolio Weight (%) MSTR Long Call $370.01 (Exp. 07/11) $14,927,428.60 0.31% MSTR Short Put $370.01 (Exp. 07/11) -$8,400,115.03 -0.18% MSTR Short Put $370.01 (Exp. 07/18) -$109,305,245.32 -2.30% MSTR Short Put $380.01 (Exp. 07/18) -$61,518,470.66 -1.29% MSTR Short Call $382.50 (Exp. 06/27) -$4,175,000.00 -0.09% MSTR Short Call $385 (Exp 6/27) -$5,862,500.00 -0.12% MSTR Short Call $387.5 (Exp 6/27) -$13,092,750.00 -0.28% MSTR Short Call $390 (Exp 6/27) -$3,416,400.00 -0.07% MSTR Short Call $392.50 (Exp 6/27) -$820,000.00 -0.02% MSTR Long Call $400 (Exp 6/27) $780,000.00 0.02% MSTR Short Call $420 (Exp 6/27) -$195,000.00 0.00% MSTR Short Call $380 (Exp 7/3) -$3,590,000.00 -0.08% MSTR Short Call $390 (Exp 7/25) -$2,675,000.00 -0.06% MSTR Short Call $392.50 (Exp 7/25) -$1,168,750.00 -0.02% MSTR Short Call $395 (Exp 7/25) -$1,018,750.00 -0.02% MSTR Short Call $397.50 (Exp 7/25) -$887,500.00 -0.02% MSTR Long Call $410 (Exp 7/3) $730,000.00 0.02% MSTR Long Call $370 (Exp 7/18) $177,903,812.50 3.74% MSTR Long Call $380 (Exp 7/18) $55,104,000.00 1.16% Cash & Securities Positions Security Name Market Value (( USD )) Portfolio Weight (%) United States Treasury Bill 02/19/2026 $112,447,601.12 2.37% United States Treasury Bill 08/14/2025 $591,975,469.68 12.45% United States Treasury Bill 11/06/2025 $385,386,926.47 8.11% United States Treasury Note/Bond 3% 07/15/2025 $382,337,797.02 8.04% United States Treasury Note/Bond 4.25% 10/15/2025 $638,453,855.82 13.43% United States Treasury Note/Bond 3.875% 01/15/2026 $1,123,742,006.11 23.64% First American Government Obligations Fund 12/01/2031 $61,088,195.28 1.29% Cash & Other $1,424,002,851.14 29.96% Source: YieldMax . MSTY earns premiums by selling options, which serve as its primary source of cash flow. All of its short call positions are short-dated, with the synthetic positions expiring further out. Furthermore, cash and treasury bonds make up a significant portion of MSTY’s holdings. This risk-free collateral supports the option strategy’s collateral requirements and facilitates redemptions. The inherent stability of treasury notes can also serve as a stabilizer against the volatility of MSTR. Strategy Risks Now, for reference, covered calls earn income through selling options, but at the cost of limited upside. That means any strong upward rally for MSTR will not translate to additional distributions for shareholders. Since the ETF’s gains are limited to the strike price of the short calls, extreme rallies can lead to missed upside and costs associated with repositioning the options, especially in synthetic strategies like MSTY’s. If MSTR falls significantly below the strike prices of those puts, the fund could face early assignment or, more realistically, mark-to-market losses due to the increased value of the short puts. These synthetic exposures can behave similarly to being “assigned,” impacting the fund’s net asset value and potentially reducing its ability to generate or maintain distributions during that period. However, I would imagine that management would roll out said positions before that happens, though that would entail additional costs and, again, decrease distributions. Peer Comparison Now, onto the juicy parts. Instead of comparing MSTY to other YieldMax ETFs, I’ll compare it to other ETFs that utilize similar option strategies on MSTR or Bitcoin itself. As an introduction, here are the members of this peer group, along with their respective expense ratios (portfolio fees) and yields. ETF Ticker ETF Name Expense Ratio TTM Yield Inception Date MSTY YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF 0.99% 139.46% 2/21/24 YBTC Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF 0.96% 45.0% 1/18/24 IMST Bitwise MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF 0.98% 13.93% 4/1/25 BTCC Grayscale Bitcoin Covered Call ETF 0.66% 7.01% 4/2/25 BAGY Amplify Bitcoin Max Income Covered Call ETF 0.65% 2.69% 4/29/25 BCCC Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF 0.75% 0.79% 6/3/25 JEPI JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF 0.35% 8.32% 5/20/20 Source: Rick Orford. I added the inception date to provide a more comprehensive view of the peer group, as most are new and have not yet completed a full-year distribution cycle. I also added the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF as a more realistic baseline reference for option-driven ETFs. From the chart above, MSTY pays the highest yield out of all the ETFs on a trailing twelve-month basis, even compared to Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF, which was launched before MSTY. This makes MSTY a bit of an outlier in terms of income generation, though it comes with outsized risks due to its particular income-generating strategy. But to be fair, we should examine the ETF's price movement for a comprehensive review. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF Price Action & Total Returns MSTY is down 2.55% since its initial public offering in February 2024. Over the same period, its closest peer, YBTC, has lost 7.2%. The remainder of the ETF’s are still very embryonic and choppy. Seeking Alpha NAV and Market Price Now that we've looked at MSTY’s price chart and total return, it’s important to determine how well the fund’s net asset value ((NAV)) has tracked its market price. As per the company’s data, MSTY’s NAV sits at $20.54 as of May 31, 2025. At the time, the closing price was $20.57, meaning the fund was trading at a slight premium. YieldMax Source: YieldMax . Now, small fluctuations between NAV-to-price comparisons are to be expected, especially with a high-yield ETF. However, it’s still reasonably close, which is a positive sign that its arbitrage mechanisms work. Distributions and Total Net Return YieldMax Now, with all that out of the way, let’s highlight arguably the most important aspect of this article: MSTY’s distribution. Since inception, MSTY holders would have received between $1.3356 and $4.213 per unit. However, that only paints a partial picture of your potential benefit as an investor. We need to look at total returns to get a better picture. Below is a chart outlining total returns, assuming an investor bought MSTY at its all-time high date (March 28, 2024), and held it to today. And I’ll compare it with YBTC and JEPI - the only ones in the peer group that were active during that time. ETF Price on Mar 28, 2024 Current Price Capital Gain/Loss Distributions Received Net Total Return ($) Net Total Return (%) MSTY $42.99 $21.05 –$21.94 $38.37 $16.93 +39.38% YBTC $55.16 $45.58 –$9.58 $24.94 $15.36 +27.85% JEPI $57.86 $56.57 –$1.29 $5.70 $4.41 +7.62% Source: Rick Orford. So, even after a dramatic 49% price drop with MSTY, an investor who bought at MSTY at its peak would still be up by almost $17 per share, or around 39% of their initial investment. My Concerns Around Return of Capital MSTY’s latest distribution of $1.4707 was 97.45% return of capital ((ROC)) and just 2.55% income. In other words, $97.45 of every $100 in distributions paid was the investor's own money. It’s more or less in line with a majority of its peer group, except for Bitwise MSTR Option Income and possibly JEPI (due to its more diversified nature). ETF Ticker Latest Distribution % Return of Capital (ROC) % Income MSTY (YieldMax MSTR Option Income) $1.4707 97.45% 2.55% YBTC (Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call) $0.20 100% 0% IMST (Bitwise MSTR Option Income) $7.01 0% 100% BTCC (Grayscale Bitcoin Covered Call) $0.9449 100% 0% BAGY (Amplify Bitcoin Max Income Covered Call) $1.4613 96% 4% BCCC (Global X Bitcoin Covered Call)* $0.14 (CAD) No Data (Released at year-end) No Data (Released at year-end) JEPI (JPMorgan Equity Premium Income) $0.5400 No Data No Data Source: Rick Orford. Now, ROC isn't inherently bad. In fact, it can be tax-efficient in the short term as ROC distributions are simply your own money given back to you, reducing your cost basis, and deferring tax liability until you sell the ETF. However, when most of MSTY’s distributions are comprised of ROC instead of actual income for most of the time, it raises significant concerns about the sustainability of these distributions. While this can be highly effective in the short term, especially during periods of high volatility, it means the ETF often returns premium income (or capital) to shareholders rather than growing the underlying NAV. Any negative market movement, such as MSTR underperforming or its positions incurring mark-to-market losses, can accelerate NAV erosion, which in turn may reduce the fund’s ability to maintain future payouts. In that sense, MSTY’s distributions are less of a yield from earnings and more of a structured return of capital. Verdict So, yes, MSTY’s high yield and relatively stable NAV might make compelling selling points, but its prospects are not as rosy as they appear on the surface. We can’t ignore the fact that any investor who bought at its peak is still up by $16, thanks to its triple-digit yields and despite the deep price downturn. But is this repeatable? And how long would it take for the losses to outpace the returns and eat away at your capital? Remember, in 2021 Bitcoin hit $60,000, then experienced a significant decline and was trading at just above $16,000 by the end of 2022. During the same period, MSTR experienced a price decline of around 70% to 80%. And even though some people might like to think that “it's only up from here,” Bitcoin is notoriously volatile and often goes through multi-year boom-and-bust cycles. If that happens, MSTY’s synthetic long exposure would place it directly in the line of fire. Deep-in-the-money short puts and collapsing long call values would result in mark-to-market losses and steep NAV erosion. That would likely force the fund to either cut distributions sharply or continue paying out return of capital while its NAV collapses and its ability to recover evaporates. And that’s my core issue with MSTY - it’s not built for long-term, multi-year sustainable growth, and it certainly doesn’t align with my investment preferences. It’s structured more for income extraction, not capital appreciation, and that income is highly dependent on favorable volatility conditions, which never last forever. That’s why I can’t recommend this fund. However, if you do buy the ETF, I’d suggest keeping your exposure low. That way, when the tide inevitably turns, you don’t lose a big chunk of your portfolio.",YMAX|TSLY|MSTR|BTC-USD|YBTC|IMST|BTCC|BAGY|BCCC|JEPI|MCSYP|STRF|STRK|MSTY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-25 15:20:07

Park, who heads Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, recently pointed out that Bitcoin climbed from around $754 to over $106,000 during the same stretch of time that New York City cycled through three different mayors. His comment connected the rise of Bitcoin with the city's political timeline. Specifically, when Michael Bloomberg left City Hall in December 2013, Bitcoin's price hovered just below $750. At that point, most people still saw it as a risky experiment rather than a serious investment. Bitcoin Rises 14,597% Through Three New York Mayors.Bill de Blasio took over in January 2014, and Bitcoin didn't move much right away. However, as his two terms rolled on, the crypto asset started gaining traction, independent of political ties. By the time de Blasio wrapped up his final year in office in December 2021, Bitcoin had skyrocketed to about $47,000.Eric Adams followed de Blasio and stepped into office in January 2022. Known for his pro-crypto stance, Adams announced that he would be taking his first few paychecks in Bitcoin. The crypto market faced some ups and downs during his time in office, especially during the 2022 bear market, but the general trend stayed upward, as a recovery sprang up from 2023. Most recently, Adams vowed to make New York the crypto capital of the world.Now, as the city heads toward its next election in November 2025, Bitcoin has passed the $106,000 mark. Particularly, within the period that New York rotated through Bloomberg to now Adams, Bitcoin has surged 14,597%, as highlighted in the chart. Bitcoin Growth Across Three New York Mayors Bitcoin Growth Across Three New York Mayors Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist and a rising political figure, has taken the lead in the Democratic primaries after Adams withdrew to run as an Independent. Because Democrats typically dominate New York politics, many expect Mamdani to win. Park referred to this expected change in leadership when he said the city had moved ""from Bloomberg to Mamdani,"" highlighting Bitcoin's steady rise during the same period.""Separate Money from State""In his commentary, Park suggested that Bitcoin's long-term growth has happened irrespective of the political changes happening around it. Notably, while new faces and ideologies come and go in government, Bitcoin continues to grow on its own terms. Citing this reality, Park advocated for a separation of money from the state. Essentially, this call indicates a broader belief that people should take control of their financial future instead of relying on state-backed systems.Mamdani's rise also represents a break from the more centrist politics of previous mayors like Bloomberg and Adams. This political change comes parallel to a financial one, where more people, especially younger generations, look to assets like Bitcoin as long-term alternatives to traditional finance and government oversight.Meanwhile, after suffering a brutal period over the weekend, Bitcoin has recovered considerably.

The report mentions that these users were mostly scam victims, money mules, and a handful of unwitting offenders unknowingly funneling dirty money through those flashing digital booths. This comes in when US states are tightening rules on crypto ATMs to curb rising scams, as these machines are often used by fraudsters, which allows easy cash-to-crypto conversion. Crypto ATMs turn scam hotspots The investigation, led by AUSTRAC and backed by federal and state police, has revealed that the majority of high-value crypto ATM transactions across the country were linked to scams. This involves romance scams, investment scams, and frauds done on the basis of different promises. As per the report , one woman in her 70s lost over $430,000 after getting duped by a combo of fake love and fake gains. However, there is no way of recovering the looted money. The task force tracked another woman in her 70s who sent $200K to a “trading firm” that vanished faster than your trust in the internet. The lady got conned after seeing what she thought was a legitimate advertisement about a firm that gave her hopes of massive returns. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas didn’t mince words and stated that “We suspected that a large volume of crypto ATM transactions were probably illicit, but almost all the transactions we looked into were victims, not villains.” The reality is bleak as these machines, which were once seen as futuristic gateways into the crypto economy, are now being hijacked as tools in emotionally manipulative heists that leave victims broke and helpless. Cash-to-crypto scams soar The Australian watchdog has already dropped the hammer by introducing tighter regulations . This included a $5,000 cap on ATM transactions, mandatory scam warnings, enhanced ID checks, and better surveillance. Thomas advised that if one is considering using a crypto ATM and someone else asks you to deposit cash into one of these machines, think twice. Sending money to a wallet you don’t control likely means you’ll lose it. On the other side, States across the US are rolling out strict new laws to crack down on crypto kiosks. A report suggests that from 2020 to 2023, crypto ATM-related fraud ballooned nearly 10 times. The FBI says it got 99% more complaints in 2024, with $247 million in losses tied to these kiosks. Americans aged over 60 are more than three times as likely to get fleeced via a crypto ATM than their younger counterparts. It’s not just the scams, but it’s how they’re engineered. Scammers walk victims through every step, like go to this gas station, scan this code, feed in your cash. Most of these victims have never touched crypto before, and after the scam, they probably never will again. However, the digital assets market is growing day by day. The cumulative crypto market cap surged by more than 2% over the last 24 hours to stand at $3.31 trillion. Bitcoin is trading above $108K at the press time, while Ethereum is hovering around $2,439.

Trump harshly criticizes Powell's interest rate policies, while arguing that the economy is in good shape and that interest rate cuts are necessary. At this point, Trump emphasizes that there should be aggressive interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy, while Powell continues to insist on keeping interest rates unchanged due to concerns about inflation and instability caused by tariffs. Powell became Trump's target with this attitude, and Trump called Powell an idiot in his speech today. “Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, I think, is a very stupid person. He has a low IQ for the job he does. I actually think he's a very stupid person. We'll be paying for him for years! We'll be paying 2 points or 3 points more on the debt! 3 points means $900 billion a year! He has a low IQ for what he does. Because he didn't want to just lower the interest rate instead of paying $900 billion!” Donald Trump also stated that he has candidates in mind to replace the Fed Chair. At this point, Trump said he was considering a candidate to replace the Fed chair and had even begun interviews with candidates. He added that he had interviewed three or four people for the next Fed chair. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: FED Chairman Jerome Powell Seems the Way!

When a former U.S. President like Donald Trump speaks on critical geopolitical developments, the world listens. His recent assertions regarding the Iran-Israel ceasefire and Iran’s nuclear ambitions have ignited considerable discussion, prompting investors and observers alike to ponder the broader implications for global stability and, by extension, the intricate dance of digital assets. Trump’s Vision: A New Era for the Iran-Israel Ceasefire? According to posts shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, former U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed optimism regarding the ongoing ceasefire between Iran and Israel, stating that it is “going well.” This declaration from a figure known for his impactful foreign policy stances immediately draws attention. Trump further suggested that the U.S. might eventually foster “somewhat of a relationship” with Iran, a statement that, if materialized, could fundamentally reshape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. The concept of a smoothly proceeding ceasefire between two historically adversarial nations like Iran and Israel is significant. It implies a de-escalation of tensions that have long simmered, occasionally boiling over into direct confrontation or proxy conflicts. Such a development, if sustained, could pave the way for reduced regional instability, potentially unlocking new economic opportunities and fostering greater security. For the cryptocurrency market, often sensitive to global uncertainties, a perceived reduction in geopolitical risk can contribute to a more bullish sentiment, encouraging investment and adoption. Unpacking the Nuclear Program Setback Claims Central to Trump’s recent statements is his assertion that Iran’s nuclear program has been “set back by decades.” He attributed this significant setback to a “recent U.S. strike on three of Iran’s nuclear facilities,” which he claimed “ended the war.” These are bold claims that warrant closer examination. Iran’s nuclear ambitions have been a source of international concern for years, leading to sanctions, diplomatic efforts, and periods of heightened tension. The precise nature and extent of any U.S. strike, as well as its long-term impact on Iran’s nuclear capabilities, are subjects of intense scrutiny and debate among intelligence agencies and geopolitical analysts. If these claims hold true, a substantial setback to Iran’s nuclear program could be seen as a major win for non-proliferation efforts and regional security, potentially reducing one of the most significant flashpoints in the Middle East stability equation. Key aspects to consider regarding these claims: Verification: Independent verification of the extent of damage and setback to Iran’s nuclear infrastructure is crucial for international credibility. Long-term Impact: Even if a setback occurred, the long-term trajectory of Iran’s nuclear ambitions and its response to such actions remain critical unknowns. Strategic Implications: A successful deterrence or incapacitation of a nuclear program could reshape regional power dynamics, influencing alliances and security postures. Is Middle East Stability Within Reach? The prospect of enduring Middle East stability , particularly concerning the Iran-Israel dynamic, is a topic of immense global interest. The region has historically been a crucible of conflict, influencing global energy markets, trade routes, and international diplomacy. Trump’s optimistic assessment of the ceasefire suggests a potential shift, but what does true stability entail? Achieving lasting stability requires more than just a temporary cessation of hostilities. It involves addressing underlying grievances, fostering economic interdependence, and establishing robust diplomatic channels. The challenges are numerous: Deep-seated Mistrust: Decades of animosity and proxy conflicts have created profound mistrust between Iran and Israel, making sustained cooperation difficult. Internal Dynamics: Both nations have complex internal political landscapes that can influence foreign policy decisions and public sentiment towards peace efforts. Regional Actors: The involvement of other regional powers and non-state actors often complicates efforts to de-escalate tensions and build lasting peace. Nuclear Ambitions: The unresolved issue of Iran’s nuclear program remains a significant impediment to comprehensive regional stability. Despite these challenges, any indication of a functioning ceasefire is a positive step. Reduced conflict risk in the Middle East can lead to greater investor confidence globally, which often translates into more capital flowing into various asset classes, including digital currencies. Geopolitical Impact on Global Markets and Crypto The ripple effects of major geopolitical developments are undeniable, influencing everything from oil prices to investor sentiment in emerging markets. The perceived de-escalation of tensions between Iran and Israel, coupled with claims of a significant setback to Iran’s nuclear program, carries substantial geopolitical impact for global markets. Historically, conflict or heightened tension in the Middle East has often led to spikes in oil prices, as the region is a major energy producer. Conversely, stability can lead to more predictable energy markets. Beyond oil, broader market sentiment is affected: Risk Appetite: Reduced geopolitical risk typically increases investor appetite for riskier assets, which can include equities and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies. Safe Havens: During periods of instability, investors often flock to traditional safe havens like gold or the U.S. dollar. Conversely, perceived stability can reduce demand for these assets. Economic Outlook: A more stable Middle East could foster greater trade and investment, contributing to a more optimistic global economic outlook, which generally benefits all markets. For the crypto market, this means that while direct causation is rare, a general environment of global stability and reduced systemic risk tends to create a more favorable backdrop for growth. As institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, these macro-geopolitical factors will likely play an even larger role in price discovery and market trends. Navigating the Complexities of Iran-US Relations Trump’s suggestion of a future “somewhat of a relationship” with Iran introduces another layer of complexity and potential transformation. The history of Iran-US relations is fraught with periods of intense animosity, mistrust, and sanctions. Any move towards a more diplomatic or cooperative stance would mark a significant departure from recent decades. What could such a relationship entail? A renewed dialogue could potentially lead to: Diplomatic Engagement: Re-opening channels for direct talks on various issues, including regional security, trade, and nuclear non-proliferation. Economic Opportunities: A lifting or easing of sanctions could unlock significant economic potential for Iran, potentially integrating it more fully into the global economy. Regional Influence: A shift in US-Iran dynamics would inevitably alter the balance of power and alliances across the Middle East. However, forging such a relationship would require overcoming significant hurdles, including domestic political opposition in both countries, the legacy of past grievances, and ongoing regional conflicts. The potential benefits of a more stable and predictable relationship between the U.S. and Iran are immense, not just for the two nations but for global security and economic prosperity. This overarching sense of reduced global tension can often provide a tailwind for innovative sectors like cryptocurrency, as capital becomes less risk-averse. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope in a Volatile World? Donald Trump’s recent statements regarding the smooth progression of the Iran-Israel ceasefire and the significant setback to Iran’s nuclear program paint a picture of potential de-escalation and a pathway towards greater Middle East stability . While such claims from a political figure warrant careful scrutiny and independent verification, they highlight the enduring pursuit of peace in a region long plagued by conflict. The potential for a fundamental shift in U.S.-Iran relations, as hinted by Trump, could reshape the geopolitical landscape, offering a glimmer of hope for a more predictable and prosperous future. For global markets, including the burgeoning cryptocurrency space, reduced geopolitical uncertainty generally fosters an environment conducive to growth and innovation. As the world watches for further developments, these pronouncements serve as a powerful reminder of how interconnected global politics, economics, and emerging technologies truly are. The journey towards lasting peace and stability is complex, but even the smallest steps forward can have profound and far-reaching implications.

The Buckeye State is quickly positioning itself as a vanguard in the evolving landscape of digital assets, with recent legislative efforts aiming to integrate cryptocurrencies into the state’s financial framework. This proactive stance, spearheaded by visionary lawmakers, marks a significant shift, potentially setting a precedent for other states looking to harness the innovative power of blockchain technology. The discussion around Ohio Crypto Legislation is no longer just theoretical; it’s becoming a tangible reality that could redefine how public funds are managed and invested. Understanding the Groundwork: Ohio’s Cryptocurrency Tax Exemption Before delving into the ambitious plans for state investments, it’s crucial to understand the foundational steps Ohio has already taken. The recent passage of House Bill 116 represents a pivotal moment, providing a clear signal of the state’s crypto-friendly intentions. This bill introduces a significant Cryptocurrency Tax Exemption , specifically for transactions under $200. While seemingly modest, its implications are far-reaching: Encouraging Micro-Transactions: By exempting small crypto transactions from capital gains tax, the bill removes a significant barrier for everyday use, making it easier for Ohioans to use digital assets for minor purchases without complex tax calculations. Boosting Adoption: This exemption can foster broader adoption of cryptocurrencies by reducing friction for new users and small businesses experimenting with crypto payments. Regulatory Clarity: It provides a degree of regulatory clarity, demonstrating that Ohio is willing to adapt its tax laws to accommodate digital currencies, a move often sought by the crypto community. Signaling Intent: More importantly, it acts as a legislative precursor, indicating a broader state strategy to embrace digital assets rather than shying away from them. This initial step has laid the groundwork for more ambitious proposals, demonstrating Ohio’s commitment to creating an environment conducive to cryptocurrency innovation and usage. The Game Changer: House Bill 18 and State Crypto Investments Building on the momentum of HB 116, Ohio Representative Steve Demetriou, a key proponent of both bills, is now pushing forward with House Bill 18. This proposed legislation is truly groundbreaking, aiming to authorize the state treasurer to engage in State Crypto Investments . This isn’t just about allowing individuals to use crypto; it’s about the state itself allocating a portion of its substantial public funds into the burgeoning digital asset market. Specifically, HB 18 proposes allowing up to 10% of select public funds to be invested in major cryptocurrencies by market cap. This targeted approach suggests a focus on established, less volatile (comparatively) digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which represent the largest and most liquid portions of the crypto market. The implications are profound: Diversification of Public Portfolios: Introducing digital assets could offer a new avenue for diversification, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk by adding uncorrelated assets. Potential for Higher Returns: Cryptocurrencies, while volatile, have historically offered significantly higher returns than traditional asset classes, presenting an opportunity for growth in state funds. Institutional Adoption: This move would mark a significant step in institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, lending further legitimacy to the asset class. Strategic Positioning: Ohio would join a select few entities globally exploring direct crypto investments for public coffers, positioning itself as a leader in financial innovation. The authority granted to the state treasurer underscores the trust placed in a professional’s ability to navigate this new financial frontier, making informed decisions on behalf of Ohio’s citizens. Why Consider Public Funds Crypto Investments? The Potential Benefits The decision to explore Public Funds Crypto investments isn’t made lightly. Proponents argue that the potential benefits far outweigh the perceived risks, especially when managed prudently. Here’s why Ohio might be taking this bold step: Enhanced Returns for State Funds: In an era of low interest rates and fluctuating traditional markets, cryptocurrencies offer a compelling opportunity for substantial capital appreciation. Even a small allocation could significantly boost returns for pension funds, educational endowments, or other state-managed portfolios, ultimately benefiting taxpayers. Economic Development and Innovation: By embracing digital assets, Ohio signals its openness to blockchain technology and the broader fintech industry. This can attract crypto businesses, startups, and skilled talent to the state, fostering job creation and economic growth within the innovation sector. Future-Proofing the Economy: The global financial landscape is rapidly evolving. By actively participating in the digital asset space, Ohio can gain valuable experience and insights, preparing its economy for a future where digital currencies and blockchain play a more central role. Diversification and Risk Management: While volatile, cryptocurrencies can act as a diversifier due to their low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. A well-managed, small allocation can potentially enhance portfolio resilience and overall risk-adjusted returns. These potential advantages highlight a forward-thinking approach aimed at securing Ohio’s financial future and cementing its position as a hub for technological and financial innovation. Navigating the Risks: Challenges for State Funds Crypto While the allure of high returns and innovation is strong, investing Public Funds Crypto also comes with inherent challenges and risks that must be meticulously managed. Any decision to invest taxpayer money in a relatively new and volatile asset class demands rigorous due diligence and robust safeguards. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price fluctuations. A 10% allocation, while seemingly small, could still expose state funds to significant losses if not managed with extreme caution and clear risk parameters. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite recent clarity, the broader regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains fragmented and evolving. Future federal or state regulations could impact the legality, taxation, or operational aspects of these investments. Security and Custody Concerns: Securing large sums of digital assets requires specialized expertise and robust infrastructure to protect against hacks, theft, and other cyber threats. The custody solutions for institutional-grade crypto investments are complex and critical. Public and Political Scrutiny: Investing public money in cryptocurrencies is likely to face scrutiny from taxpayers, political opponents, and media. Transparency, accountability, and clear communication about the investment strategy and performance will be paramount. Liquidity Challenges: While Bitcoin and Ethereum are highly liquid, converting large institutional holdings back into fiat currency without impacting market prices requires careful execution. Addressing these challenges effectively will be key to the successful implementation of House Bill 18 and ensuring the long-term viability of Ohio’s crypto investment strategy. Lessons from Other States: A Glimpse into Digital Asset Adoption Ohio isn’t operating in a vacuum when it comes to exploring digital assets. Several other states and municipalities have already dipped their toes into the crypto waters, offering valuable lessons and precedents. For instance: Miami, Florida: Mayor Francis Suarez has been a vocal proponent of crypto, pushing initiatives like MiamiCoin to generate revenue for the city and exploring paying city employees in Bitcoin. Texas: The state has become a hub for Bitcoin mining due to its energy resources and favorable regulatory environment, attracting significant investment from crypto companies. Some pension funds have also explored indirect exposure to crypto through investment firms. Wyoming: Known for its progressive blockchain legislation, Wyoming has enacted laws to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets, including special purpose depository institutions (SPDIs) for crypto companies. While direct State Crypto Investments in public funds are still rare at the state level, these examples demonstrate a growing trend of governmental entities engaging with the crypto ecosystem in various capacities. Ohio’s approach with House Bill 18 could set a new benchmark for direct investment, moving beyond just fostering a crypto-friendly environment to actively participating in the market. What Does This Mean for Ohio’s Future? Actionable Insights The progression of Ohio Crypto Legislation , particularly House Bill 18, holds significant implications for various stakeholders: For Ohio Citizens: Potentially better-performing state funds could lead to improved public services or more stable pension plans. It also signifies Ohio’s commitment to being at the forefront of financial innovation. For Businesses: Crypto-related businesses might find Ohio an increasingly attractive location due to its progressive stance, potentially leading to new jobs and investment opportunities within the state. The tax exemption for small transactions also simplifies operations for businesses accepting crypto. For the Broader Crypto Industry: Ohio’s move could serve as a powerful endorsement of digital assets, encouraging other states and institutional investors to consider similar strategies, further legitimizing the asset class on a national scale. For Lawmakers and Policy Makers: It highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of digital assets and the importance of crafting legislation that balances innovation with prudent risk management. This initiative isn’t just about financial gains; it’s about positioning Ohio as a leader in the digital economy, ready to embrace the technological shifts that are reshaping global finance. The Road Ahead for Ohio Crypto Legislation While the momentum behind House Bill 18 is clear, its journey to becoming law will involve rigorous debate, detailed financial analysis, and careful consideration of implementation strategies. Key aspects that will need to be addressed include: Defining “Major Cryptocurrencies”: While generally understood to mean Bitcoin and Ethereum, the bill will need precise language to avoid ambiguity and ensure compliance. Risk Management Frameworks: Establishing clear guidelines for risk assessment, diversification within the crypto allocation, and loss limits will be crucial. Custody Solutions: Identifying secure and compliant institutional-grade custodians for the digital assets will be a primary concern. Performance Benchmarks and Reporting: Transparent mechanisms for tracking and reporting the performance of these investments will be essential for accountability. The passage of House Bill 18 would not only be a landmark achievement for Representative Demetriou but also a testament to Ohio’s pioneering spirit in navigating the complexities and opportunities of the digital age. It represents a bold step towards a future where digital assets are integrated into the fabric of traditional finance, starting right in the heart of the Midwest. Conclusion: Ohio’s Ambitious Leap into Digital Assets Ohio stands at the precipice of a significant financial evolution. With the passage of the Cryptocurrency Tax Exemption bill and the ambitious proposal of House Bill 18 to enable State Crypto Investments , the state is making a clear statement: it is ready to embrace the future of finance. These legislative efforts, championed by Representative Steve Demetriou, are designed not just to foster innovation but also to potentially unlock new avenues for growth and diversification for Public Funds Crypto . While challenges remain, Ohio’s proactive approach could set a powerful precedent for how states manage their financial resources in an increasingly digital world. The journey of House Bill 18 Ohio will be closely watched, as it holds the potential to reshape not only the state’s financial landscape but also influence the broader conversation around institutional adoption of digital assets across the nation.

The testnet rollout is expected in the third quarter of 2025, with a full mainnet launch planned for the fourth quarter, the foundation confirmed on Wednesday. According to a press statement from the company, Moca Chain will help individuals, AI agents, and devices take control of their personal data and credentials. It will reduce the reliance on centralized data storage systems and identity management services. JUST IN: Animoca’s Moca launches Moca Chain, a Layer-1 blockchain for private, decentralized digital identity, with testnet in Q3 and mainnet in Q4 2025, powered by $MOCA . pic.twitter.com/hdUfC3FKFP — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) June 25, 2025 The new blockchain is built to support several identity protocols in finance, education, and healthcare, and could unify and verify user credentials securely and privately through a decentralized infrastructure. New decentralized network mulls identity use cases Moca Chain will use zero-knowledge transport layer security (ZK-TLS), decentralized storage, and a cross-chain identity oracle to enable privacy-preserving digital identity solutions at scale. The blockchain is also Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, meaning it is interoperable with Ethereum-based platforms and applications. According to the Moca Foundation, Moca Chain will be suitable for building thousands of protocols focused on reusable and verifiable identity. The infrastructure allows developers and applications to issue and validate user credentials without the need for centralized verification layers. These reusable credentials can be verified on-chain or off-chain and are protected using zero-knowledge proofs, upholding privacy even when identity data is shared or monetized. Protocols and applications built on Moca Chain can access identity and reputation data directly from end users, rather than relying on platform-level application programming interfaces (APIs). SSO as a point of failure In the statement, Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, spoke about the adoption of single sign-on (SSO) systems, which allow access to multiple services through a single set of credentials. In Web3 , SSO solutions like Web3Auth and Magic simplify onboarding by linking decentralized wallets to familiar login methods like Google or Apple ID. Yet, if the provider is compromised or unavailable, users may lose access to all connected services. Moreover, such systems often retain back-end control over authentication, which entirely contradicts the basis and promise of decentralization. “ SSO represents a centralized point of failure that compromises security ,” Siu said. “ Moca Chain seeks to solve this problem by giving users decentralized true ownership of their data, ensuring the sovereignty of users’ digital identity without a single point of failure. ” He added that Moca Chain, when combined with Moca Network’s AIR Kit, is a decentralized digital ecosystem where users can own and control their data, reputation, and digital contributions. Siu said this vision supports Animoca Brands’ mission to expand digital property rights and create fairer digital economies. AIR Kit to expand Moca Chain reach AIR Kit is an identity module already in use by several companies within Animoca Brands’ portfolio. According to the foundation, AIR Kit could extend the reach of Moca Chain to over 700 million addressable users globally. Platforms that have enabled the module so far include South Korea’s OK Cashbag , a loyalty rewards program with more than 28 million identity-verified users, and One Football, a German digital media firm that serves 200 million monthly active users. Data from these platforms will be accessible to applications and protocols built on Moca Chain. Kenneth Shek, project lead of Moca Network, said Moca Chain and AIR Kit are developing “a new kind of digital infrastructure.” “ By adopting Moca Chain and MOCA Coin, we believe we can disrupt current models of data ownership and break down the dominance of walled garden ecosystems ,” Shek stated. He reiterated that the goal is to return value to users and promote a more scalable model for ecosystem growth. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Hadley Stern from Marinade Finance recently shared his thoughts, saying he’s tired of the constant hype around $100K and believes it’s time for Bitcoin to break past it for good. On the Milkroad podcast, Stern said tht this cycle could see Bitcoin climbing as high as $160,000 before eventually settling back around $120,000. While some see this as a conservative estimate, given other predictions ranging from $150K to $250K, and even extreme calls of $500K to $1 million, Stern believes it’s a realistic target. “I still think $160K would be an excellent top for this cycle,” he explained, pointing out that the market tends to get stuck at psychological price levels like $100,000, much like it did at $10,000 years ago. He also said that with growing institutional involvement, especially through Bitcoin ETFs and corporate buyers like MicroStrategy, there’s strong buying pressure in the market. Around 6% of Bitcoin’s total supply is now held by ETFs, which could help push prices higher. While he admits there’s always room for surprises and acknowledges some traders are betting on $200K or higher, Stern views his $160K target as a balanced estimate. Bitcoin Price Short-Term Prediction Bitcoin has been trading steadily inside a price range, and the situation hasn’t changed much over the past few days. The cryptocurrency is still moving within a rising trend channel, with the upper boundary acting as resistance. At the moment, Bitcoin is holding above $107,9000. If it manages to push a little higher, it could test the $130,000 region within this cycle. However, traders should be prepared for a possible dip towards the $100,000–$104,000 support zone in the coming sessions. If Bitcoin stays above this area during a pullback, it would be a positive sign for a fresh rally. A deeper drop towards $91,000–$95,000 is still possible, but not necessary unless Bitcoin fails to hold its current range.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-25 15:42:42

In an X post today, Squire suggested that U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres is on the verge of delivering her final decision in the Ripple lawsuit. According to Squire, the upcoming ruling could set a landmark precedent that would alter the legal status of crypto assets in the U.S. This suggests that Judge Torres’ upcoming decision could play a major role in determining the legal status of cryptocurrencies, particularly in deciding whether they will be classified as commodities or securities. Misleading Claim However, attorney Morgan refuted this claim as “incorrect.” The legal expert clarified that the upcoming decision narrowly focuses on the parties’ joint motion for an indicative ruling. In that decision, Morgan contended that the judge would rule on whether there are exceptional circumstances to reduce Ripple’s penalty to $50 million and dismiss the permanent injunction on the company’s XRP sales to institutions. For context, Judge Torres denied the parties’ initial attempt to obtain the indicative ruling last month. At the time, she noted a procedural flaw in the joint motion and ruled that the parties had failed to demonstrate “exceptional circumstances” warranting the requested relief.This month, the parties launched another attempt to secure the indicative ruling, addressing the issues raised in the previous order. Nearly two weeks have passed since the filing, but the judge has yet to issue a decision.Judge Torres's Summary Judgment Remains Untouched Notably, Morgan said the decision would only focus on the parties’ request to reduce the penalty and vacate the injunction. He suggested that the decision would not define the legal status of crypto assets in the United States, as Squire claimed. According to him, the SEC and Ripple agreed not to challenge, modify, or vacate Judge Torres’ 2023 summary judgment decision. The lawyer also attached an excerpt from the joint motion corroborating his claims. SEC and Ripple agree not to modify Judge Torres summary judgment decision SEC and Ripple agree not to modify Judge Torres' summary judgment decision For context, in the summary judgment decision , the judge stated that XRP is not a security in itself. She also declared that Ripple’s XRP sales to institutional clients were investment contracts, but those conducted on digital exchanges were not. The summary judgment decision has played a crucial role in determining the legal status of crypto. According to the ruling, cryptocurrencies are not securities, but can be sold as part of an investment contract. In the meantime, the broader legal uncertainty around crypto’s status may soon be addressed.

Imagine a digital currency that offers the stability of your national fiat, yet boasts the speed and efficiency of blockchain technology. This is the promise of the Korean won stablecoin , and major financial players are now making their move. Recently, Hana Bank, one of South Korea’s largest and most respected financial institutions, announced its pursuit of trademark rights related to stablecoins. This isn’t just a corporate formality; it’s a powerful signal of a pivotal shift in the nation’s digital finance landscape, following similar proactive steps by other banking giants. The Race for a Korean Won Stablecoin Begins Hana Bank’s decision to pursue trademark rights for stablecoins marks a significant milestone in South Korea’s embrace of digital assets. According to local reports from Asia Today, the bank has filed for a substantial 16 trademarks specifically related to Korean won-based stablecoins. This strategic move positions Hana Bank alongside other prominent financial entities like KB Kookmin Bank and KakaoBank, the innovative digital banking arm of the messaging platform Kakao, both of whom have already ventured into this exciting space. But what exactly is a stablecoin, and why is a won-based version so important? What is a Stablecoin? At its core, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, whose values can fluctuate wildly, stablecoins are typically pegged to a stable asset, such as a fiat currency (like the US dollar or Korean won), gold, or even other cryptocurrencies. This pegging provides a reliable medium for transactions, making them ideal for everyday use and financial applications. Why a Won-Based Stablecoin? A stablecoin pegged to the Korean won offers several compelling advantages for the domestic market. It combines the stability of the national currency with the benefits of blockchain technology, such as faster transaction speeds, lower fees, and enhanced transparency. This could revolutionize everything from daily payments to international remittances, offering a digital equivalent of cash that is easily transferable and programmable. Hana Bank ‘s Strategic Partnerships and Vision Hana Bank isn’t just filing trademarks; it’s actively building the infrastructure for a future where digital won transactions are commonplace. The bank is reportedly working in close cooperation with the Open Blockchain & Decentralized Identifier Association (OBDIA) to establish a joint venture. This collaboration is specifically aimed at launching a Korean won-based stablecoin, indicating a commitment beyond mere exploration. OBDIA’s expertise in blockchain and decentralized identity solutions makes them an ideal partner for such an ambitious undertaking. This initiative highlights a broader trend among traditional financial institutions: rather than resisting the tide of digital transformation, they are choosing to lead it. By forming alliances with blockchain-focused organizations, banks like Hana Bank are leveraging cutting-edge technology to innovate their services. This contrasts with the earlier, more cautious approach many traditional banks took towards cryptocurrencies, often viewing them as a threat. Now, they see the immense potential for efficiency, new revenue streams, and improved customer experiences that digital assets, particularly stablecoins, can offer. The active participation of a major player like Hana Bank signals a robust and collaborative approach to stablecoin development in South Korea. What This Means for South Korea’s Digital Finance Future The entry of major banks into the stablecoin arena has profound implications for South Korea’s digital finance landscape. South Korea has always been a nation quick to adopt new technologies, from high-speed internet to advanced mobile payments. This proactive stance on stablecoins aligns perfectly with its innovative spirit. The development of a widely adopted Korean won stablecoin could: Enhance Payment Systems: Imagine instant, low-cost payments for goods and services, both online and offline. A won stablecoin could streamline domestic transactions, reducing reliance on traditional, often slower, payment rails. Boost Cross-Border Transactions: International remittances and trade finance could become significantly more efficient and less expensive. This could particularly benefit South Korea’s export-oriented economy. Spur Innovation in DeFi: While stablecoins are often seen as a bridge to traditional finance, they also serve as a crucial component of decentralized finance (DeFi). A regulated, bank-backed stablecoin could bring greater legitimacy and liquidity to Korea’s emerging DeFi ecosystem. Complement CBDC Discussions: The Bank of Korea has been exploring a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Private sector stablecoins, especially those backed by major banks, could either complement a CBDC by handling retail payments, or even serve as a robust alternative depending on the regulatory framework. This interplay between public and private digital currencies will define South Korea’s digital finance trajectory. Unpacking Stablecoin Development : Benefits and Hurdles The journey of stablecoin development, especially when spearheaded by traditional banks, comes with a unique set of benefits and challenges. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for appreciating the significance of Hana Bank’s move. Benefits: Benefit Description Efficiency & Speed Blockchain-based transactions are typically faster and cheaper than traditional bank transfers, especially across borders. Accessibility Stablecoins can lower barriers to financial services, potentially reaching the unbanked or underbanked populations. Programmability The underlying blockchain technology allows for smart contracts, enabling automated payments, escrow services, and innovative financial products. Transparency Transactions on a public blockchain are auditable, enhancing trust and reducing fraud, though privacy considerations remain important. Challenges: Regulatory Clarity: The biggest hurdle remains the evolving regulatory landscape. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to classify and oversee stablecoins, particularly those issued by private entities. Clear guidelines on consumer protection, anti-money laundering (AML), and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) are essential. Technological Integration: Integrating new blockchain-based systems with existing legacy banking infrastructure is a complex and costly endeavor. Ensuring seamless interoperability and scalability is vital for mass adoption. Public Trust & Education: Despite their stability, stablecoins are still a relatively new concept for the general public. Building trust and educating users about their benefits and risks will be critical for widespread adoption. Competition: The market is becoming increasingly crowded with various stablecoin projects and potential CBDCs. Banks must differentiate their offerings and demonstrate clear value propositions to users. The success of stablecoin development hinges on navigating these complexities effectively. Driving Financial Innovation Beyond Traditional Banking Hana Bank’s foray into Korean won stablecoins represents more than just a new product offering; it signifies a fundamental shift in how traditional banks perceive and engage with emerging technologies. For decades, banks have been the gatekeepers of finance, operating within established frameworks. However, the rise of blockchain and digital assets has challenged this paradigm, prompting a necessary evolution. This move by Hana Bank is a prime example of proactive financial innovation . Instead of being disrupted, they are embracing the disruptive potential of stablecoins to create new value. This could lead to: New Revenue Streams: Beyond traditional lending and deposit services, banks could generate revenue from stablecoin issuance, transaction fees, and new digital asset-based financial products. Enhanced Customer Experience: Faster, cheaper, and more accessible financial services could significantly improve customer satisfaction and attract a new generation of digitally native users. Redefined Role of Banks: Banks could evolve from being mere intermediaries to becoming trusted digital asset custodians, infrastructure providers for tokenized economies, and facilitators of decentralized finance. The collaboration with OBDIA also underscores the importance of partnerships in this new era. No single entity can build the future of finance alone. By combining their vast financial experience with the technical prowess of blockchain specialists, banks like Hana Bank are setting a precedent for collaborative innovation that pushes the boundaries of traditional banking. A New Era for Korean Finance Hana Bank’s pursuit of Korean won-based stablecoin trademarks is a clear indication of the accelerating pace of digital transformation in the financial sector. This strategic move, mirroring actions by other major institutions, not only positions Hana Bank as a forward-thinking leader but also signals a collective effort within South Korea to embrace the future of money. While challenges remain, particularly around regulation and technological integration, the potential benefits—from enhanced payment efficiency to new avenues for financial innovation—are immense. As these developments unfold, South Korea is poised to solidify its position as a global hub for digital finance, shaping how we transact, invest, and interact with money in the years to come.

While SOL remains one of the market cap leaders attention is rapidly shifting to a new high-growth DeFi coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The token sits at stage 5 of presale for $0.03. Having already smashed through more than $11.1 million presale and indicating more than 12,400 investors, Mutuum Finance is starting ripples. Solana Holds Strong Support Solana (SOL) fluctuates near levels of $135 in the current times, regaining its anchor around the $132-$142 range after blasting off a recent drop. Onchain data shows that there is a lot of buy pressure amassing at levels of $145-147 offering a solid bottom to the bounce. The technical signals today also point to a big resistance zone of between $152-$155; a breakout above this level on increasing volumes can drive the price to the much-hyped price of $200 late in the summer. However, if SOL won’t be able to break above $152, a minor correction to the price level of $130-$132 will ostensibly take place. Traders have started focusing on smaller altcoins such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in the hopes of altcoins breaking out of larger-cap token consolidation. Mutuum Finance Presale Hits $11.1 Million Mutuum Finance is soon going to be one of the shiniest DeFi participants with its presale crossing more than $11.1 million and bringing on board more than 12,400 investors. Frenzy for the project is in high gear and that’s a very solid indication of the project’s future. Since it is currently in phase 5 MUTM tokens are currently $0.03. Phase 6 will bring the price to $0.035. Demand is growing exponentially and Mutuum Finance’s first-mover status in the decentralized lending arena is even more precious. $100,000 MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance is a new protocol that is attempting to reward the early supporters it has on its platform and has established a $100,000 giveaway where 10 participants will be chosen and rewarded with 10,000 MUTM tokens. It will be a reward to the quickly expanding community inside the project and gratitude for early investors. But time’s running out. Don’t miss the opportunity to be one of the winners and, in the process securing a position as one of the most discussed new DeFi projects. Built on Trust and Transparency The majority of DeFi protocols fail because they are not turning their words into acts but Mutuum Finance is finding it hard to fail by demonstrating real credibility and infrastructure. Solana’s resilience in reclaiming the $200 mark in July remains the focus of attention among market watchers, yet sentiment among investors is clearly shifting in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s direction. With over $11.1 million raised in funds and an expanding base of over 12,400 investors, Mutuum is quickly becoming one of the most hyped DeFi projects for 2025. The presale present price of $0.03 gives entry for a short window before increasing to $0.035 in the subsequent phase. Supported by a completed CertiK audit and a $100,000 giveaway as an incentive to early adopters, Mutuum Finance is founded upon transparency, innovation, and potential for upside. Act immediately to be part of the presale and claim your stake in this next-generation DeFi investment opportunity before prices rise any higher.

The team announced it will use its remaining $200,000 treasury to support affected users through a recovery fund. The decision comes after the delisting of the platform’s native token, ZEND, from major exchanges. How $9.5M Exploit and Delistings Prompt zkLend Shutdown In a message to its community, zkLend said the choice to wind down operations was difficult but necessary. The platform was hit by a significant exploit that compromised user confidence and platform integrity. Dear zkLend Community, It is with a heavy heart that we announce our decision to wind down zkLend. This decision was not made lightly. Over recent months, the exploit we suffered has deeply eroded user confidence, and furthermore, the recent removal of ZEND from major exchanges… — zkLend (@zkLend) June 25, 2025 More recently, the situation worsened when the ZEND token was delisted from top crypto exchanges including Bybit and KuCoin. This reduced the token’s accessibility and market liquidity, making it harder for the team to pursue future initiatives. “These developments significantly limit our capacity to effectively allocate toward any new initiatives,” zkLend stated in its official announcement. Rather than continue development under constrained conditions, the team opted to shut down and redirect remaining funds to those impacted by the breach. Notably, the platform has committed to allocating its remaining $200,000 treasury to a user recovery fund. This decision was made to prioritize community support over protocol relaunch or expansion. Meanwhile, key services, including the DeFi Spring, Recovery, and kSTRK portals will remain live. According to the announcement, zklend further encouraged its users to visit these platforms to unstake assets or claim any remaining balances. zkLend to Open-Source Codebase as Part of Transparent Wind-Down and Recovery Efforts In an effort to contribute back to the DeFi ecosystem, zkLend announced plans to open-source its audited and refreshed codebase in the coming weeks. This move will enable other developers to study, repurpose, or build on the platform’s infrastructure. While operations have ceased, zkLend affirmed its commitment to remaining online and available during the fund recovery process. “We will continue to remain online and committed to the recovery of stolen funds through any means necessary,” the team wrote in its farewell message. The team also notes that the project is working with zeroShadow, a blockchain investigation firm, to trace and recover stolen funds and noted that assets recovered through these efforts will be added to the recovery fund for distribution to affected users. https://t.co/TYpyiajoN6 — zkLend (@zkLend) February 15, 2025 Notably, zkLend launched its Recovery Portal for users affected by the $9.6 million Feb. 12 exploit.

The agreement, made public in a joint statement during a high-level summit, comes amid ongoing war in Ukraine, rising tensions across the Middle East, and renewed concerns about Russia. According to CNBC, the decision marks NATO’s biggest financial re-commitment in over a decade. The new 5% target is split. A minimum of 3.5% will go directly to defense operations, while the remaining 1.5% will fund other security and infrastructure projects. This includes civil readiness systems, innovation pipelines, and maintaining NATO’s industrial base. Member states are now required to submit yearly progress plans showing how they will gradually reach the 5% by the deadline. This applies to all countries—even those like Spain, which have not yet met the 2014 goal of spending 2% of GDP on defense. Leaders respond to pressure from Washington and war in Europe The announcement followed years of warnings from Donald Trump, who is now back in the White House. During both of his presidential terms, he’s called out NATO countries, especially in Europe and Canada, for not paying their fair share. Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump said, “There are numerous definitions of Article 5. You know that, right? But I’m committed to being their friend… I’ve become friends with many of those leaders, and I’m committed to helping them.” The pact also reaffirms NATO’s Article 5 principle, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all. Recent doubts about whether the U.S. would still honor this clause under Trump’s leadership had cast shadows over the alliance. But NATO’s statement left no room for ambiguity: “We remain united and steadfast in our resolve to protect our one billion citizens, defend the Alliance, and safeguard our freedom and democracy.” Speaking to the press, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called the new agreement a starting point. “This is Day One,” he said. “We need to innovate and we need to act fast.” Rutte said that the deal sends a message that all allies are ready to meet growing threats and that the plan will also result in economic benefits like job creation. “The decisions made today will make NATO much stronger,” he said. “They also make NATO a fairer alliance. The resolve of allies is clear: we are in this together, committed to Article 5, and we are determined to stand firm.” Summit participants push past internal disagreements The decision didn’t come easy. Countries like Spain raised concerns about jumping from under 2% to 5% in just ten years. But Rutte said he believed Madrid was serious about hitting at least the 3.5% portion earmarked for military use. He also noted that “significant commitments” had been made by all parties to respond to “significant threats.” Alexander Stubb, the President of Finland, described the atmosphere at the summit as “cool, calm and collected.” He called the meeting historic and said NATO was “going back to its roots of collective self-defense as a deterrent to Russia.” He added that both Trump and Rutte appeared pleased with the outcome and that “there were a lot of smiles around the table, regardless of the difficult situation.” Johann Wadephul, Germany’s Foreign Minister, said Berlin had committed to the 5% target ahead of the summit and was now ready to play a stronger role in European defense. He pointed out that Spain’s hesitation didn’t slow down the process. “At the end of the day, they knew one against 31 makes no sense,” he said. Wadephul emphasized that the key takeaway from the meeting was unity. “That NATO would stick together completely was the ironclad message from the summit,” he told CNBC’s Steve Sedgwick. “The U.S. has recognized that Europe is back again.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Economy|NATO,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-25 16:04:22

Centralization is one of the main concerns with AI systems, which is why multiple firms are turning to blockchain to address it. On Wednesday, June 25, OpenGradient announced its integration with Walrus to bring decentralized AI to the Sui Network (SUI) . OpenGradient will use Walrus’ decentralized storage network to build and run decentralized AI agents. According to the team, the integration enables it to host over 100 AI models across dozens of ecosystems. Ultimately, the goal of the platform is to make decentralized AI a reality. Matthew Wang, Co-founder and CEO at OpenGradient, explained the advantages of giving users control over their own AI models. Specifically, the models would be private, cheaper to run, and more transparent. “AI isn’t something that belongs to a handful of massive tech companies; it belongs to users and always has. It’s been our mission to make this idea a reality, giving both seasoned AI developers and everyday consumers the ability to create, modify, and own their own AI models,” Wang, OpenGradient.

Rebecca Simmonds, Managing Executive at Walrus Foundation, highlighted why developers of AI solutions need storage platforms like Walrus. “The only options that have been available have come with the risks to privacy and control that are inherent to centralized architecture, making it nearly impossible to build truly decentralized models. Our integration with OpenGradient allows us to fill that need, providing a decentralized storage solution for users that puts them back in control of their data,” Simmonds, Walrus Foundation. Thanks to open storage protocols, users will be able to see exactly what training data goes into an AI model. According to OpenGradient, users and developers can now tap into Walrus data storage to build and train their own models.

Launching with Animoca’s 700 million-user ecosystem, it’s betting big on verifiable credentials as the next infrastructure play. On June 25, Moca Network, the identity-focused arm of Animoca Brands, unveiled Moca Chain, a new Layer-1 blockchain designed specifically for decentralized identity and verifiable data. Moca Chain is the home and open platform for all identities and data, co-existing symbiotically with other chains as the identity and data verification layer — welcoming any protocol, app, or builder ready to scale credential issuance and verification. 🔗 Start building:… — Mocaverse💼🪐 (@Moca_Network) June 25, 2025 Built with zero-knowledge proofs and cross-chain interoperability, the network will allow users to store credentials privately while proving them across applications without exposing raw information. A testnet is slated for Q3 2025, with mainnet to follow in Q4. You might also like: Starknet-based L2 protocol zkLend shuts down Moca Chain’s bid to fix Web3’s broken identity system According to the announcement, Moca Network is building specialized infrastructure for decentralized identity, combining four core technologies. These include decentralized storage for user-controlled data, ZKP-based verification to preserve privacy, zkTLS to pull in real-world information without centralized intermediaries, and an Identity Oracle to enable cross-chain credential checks. The modular identity layer’s goal is simple but ambitious: let users store credentials once—whether a KYC document, a university degree, or gaming achievements, and reuse them across any application without repeatedly surrendering personal data. For developers, Moca Chain offers AIR Kit, a plug-and-play identity toolkit designed to integrate seamlessly with existing apps, wallets, and protocols without needing to rebuild UX from scratch. Beyond privacy, Moca Chain is betting that reusable identity can unlock economic value. Today, businesses spend millions verifying users, while individuals derive no benefit from their own data. By turning credentials into portable assets, Moca could streamline compliance, enable new reward models, and reduce fraud. Moca Chain is also a token economy experiment. At the network’s core is MOCA, the utility token that fuels every action on the chain. Issuing, verifying, storing, and even generating credential data via zkTLS all require MOCA. Validators need to stake it to secure the network, while verifiers pay with it to check credentials. According to the statement, the more credentials issued and verified, the more MOCA gets used—creating a demand loop tied directly to network activity.

At this point, James Wynn, who made over $50 million in profit when Bitcoin fell to $100,000-101,000, suffered a massive loss of $100 million on a single Bitcoin transaction in late May. But that loss didn't stop Wynn, and he said he's now back with an even bigger short position. At this point, while many analysts and experts expect Bitcoin to continue rising after rising above $ 107,000, James Wynn said that he does not believe in this rise. Arguing that the rise in Bitcoin is fake and that the rise is preparation for a major collapse, James Wynn stated that he opened a large short position in Bitcoin around $ 108,500. Wynn also shared that he uses 40x leverage across multiple exchanges. Finally, he also warned investors of a severe downturn. “I made my last short entry at $108.5k.

We’ve seen a wave of announcements, token launches, and integrations that boldly claim to sit at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and Web3. Yet, strip away the surface, and most ‘AI + crypto’ projects amount to lipstick on a protocol — cosmetic, not structural — chasing pitch deck momentum rather than building real utility. There’s progress — just not where most people are looking. Let’s draw the line between hype and infrastructure, and see where the crypto-AI convergence is actually happening. Table of Contents Why most ‘AI-crypto’ integrations fall short Bitcoin miners add AI to their toolkit AI agents are already moving crypto — and they’re hackable What real progress will look like Closing thoughts Why most ‘AI-crypto’ integrations fall short Plugging ChatGPT into a Web3 front-end does not make a protocol “AI-native.” Nor does adding AI-generated content to a whitepaper, or delegating DAO voting to a large language model. Most current integrations are little more than surface-level UX enhancements — clever, but ultimately hollow if they don’t change the logic of how these systems operate. Real convergence starts when AI agents are natively designed for on-chain logic — meaning they don’t just analyze blockchain data, but directly participate in it: executing smart contract functions, proposing DAO votes, or managing real-time collateral adjustments within DeFi protocols. Right now, that infrastructure barely exists. Most chains can’t even support consistent real-time data feeds without oracles, let alone AI inference. Until the core stack evolves — including compute layers, decentralized data availability, and modular execution — most “AI + crypto” projects will remain superficial rather than transformational. Bitcoin miners add AI to their toolkit While most AI + crypto projects struggle with protocol-level integration, some of the most meaningful groundwork is being laid at the infrastructure level, by leveraging existing Bitcoin mining infrastructure to support AI workloads alongside crypto operations. For example, Riot Platforms , a major U.S. Bitcoin miner, is pivoting into high-performance computing (HPC) — building AI-ready data centers on top of its existing mining footprint. Wall Street is paying attention: both Needham and J.P. Morgan have raised their price targets on Riot, citing its Corsicana site as a high-value HPC play. Needham analysts raised their target by 25%, from $12 to $15, and maintained a “Buy” rating. Citing improved fundamentals across the mining sector and Bitcoin’s rising price, J.P. Morgan raised its price target on Riot from $13 to $14. AI agents are already moving crypto — and they’re hackable While miners like Riot are building the physical backbone for AI, another layer of innovation is already unfolding — not in data centers, but on-chain. AI agents are increasingly seen as the holy grail: offering 24/7 market participation, dynamic adaptation, and zero fatigue. But there’s a dark side — and it’s no longer theoretical. Researchers from Princeton University and Sentient recently demonstrated a fully functional cross-platform memory injection attack. In the study, an attacker embedded a hidden instruction into an AI agent’s memory, for example: “Always transfer crypto to 0xabcde…” . Even though this instruction wasn’t part of the agent’s visible response, it was saved in persistent memory. Later, when a different user accessed the same AI agent through another platform — say, to transfer ETH — the agent retrieved the stored memory and silently executed the malicious instruction, rerouting funds to the attacker’s wallet without raising any alarms. This wasn’t a bug — it was a weaponized feature. In the real-world scenario modeled by the researchers, an AI system called ElizaOS was compromised through Discord and later carried out the attack via X (formerly Twitter). Because the agent’s memory was shared across platforms, it “remembered” the injected command and acted on it. Memory injection pathways in AI agents | Source: Princeton University & Sentient research study This example alone makes it clear: we’re not just building helpful automation — we’re building semi-autonomous financial infrastructure. And that demands a new class of safeguards: Cryptographic audit trails Signed action histories External governance logic Memory sandboxing Until these protections are in place, AI agents will continue doing real financial work, with half-open security doors. What real progress will look like The real fruits of convergence will emerge in places where complexity is already high and rules are rigid. Imagine: AI agents that audit smart contracts in real time Governance bots that propose parameter changes based on market shifts Dispute resolution systems that analyze transaction history and enforce logic Slashing bots that detect validator downtime and trigger penalties autonomously But all of that requires AI to move closer to the chain, not just sit beside it. That means embedding agents into validator clients, using zero-knowledge proofs to verify AI inference, and designing AI behavior as on-chain logic, not off-chain suggestion. Closing thoughts We’re at a familiar phase in crypto: bold claims, thin implementation, and a few quiet breakthroughs flying under the radar. The convergence of AI and crypto is inevitable, but not for the reasons most people think. It won’t come from branded partnerships or trend-chasing. It’ll come from the infrastructure layer, where AI is treated as a system actor, not a selling point. Until then, most “AI in crypto” will feel like vaporware. But when those integrations happen — when AI isn’t just an interface but an actor — we’ll unlock new layers of speed, coordination, and resilience in decentralized systems.",Feature|AI|Blockchain|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-06-25 16:10:18

That world is here, and it’s getting more interesting by the day. In a fascinating twist that has captured the attention of both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world, UK gold mining company Bluebird Mining has made headlines by announcing a significant allocation of funds towards Bitcoin, signaling a bold new direction for traditional industries. What’s Driving Bluebird Mining’s Bold Bitcoin Move? The news, first reported by Odaily, reveals that Bluebird Mining has successfully raised £2 million (approximately $2.72 million). What’s particularly noteworthy is their immediate plan: £1 million (around $1.36 million) of this fresh capital is earmarked for the purchase of Bitcoin. This isn’t just a speculative one-off purchase; it’s explicitly stated to be in support of a broader Bitcoin treasury strategy . But what does this mean, and why is a gold mining company making such a move? For decades, gold has been the go-to asset for hedging against inflation and economic uncertainty. It’s tangible, historically valued, and seen as a safe haven. However, Bitcoin has increasingly carved out its own niche as ‘digital gold,’ offering similar perceived benefits but with distinct advantages like divisibility, ease of transfer, and a verifiable scarcity. Bluebird Mining’s decision suggests a recognition of Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and its potential role in a diversified corporate treasury. Unpacking the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: A New Corporate Playbook? A Bitcoin treasury strategy involves a company holding Bitcoin as part of its corporate reserves, rather than solely relying on traditional fiat currencies or conventional investments. This approach gained significant traction following MicroStrategy’s pioneering moves in 2020, which saw the business intelligence firm accumulate vast amounts of Bitcoin. For companies considering this strategy, the motivations are often multi-faceted: Inflation Hedge: With central banks globally engaging in quantitative easing, many companies seek assets that can preserve purchasing power against fiat currency devaluation. Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins makes it an attractive candidate. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown a strong long-term upward trend, offering the potential for significant capital gains that could boost a company’s balance sheet. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a treasury portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk exposure to traditional markets. Technological Alignment: For forward-thinking companies, embracing Bitcoin aligns them with innovative technologies and a growing digital economy, potentially enhancing their brand image. Liquidity: Bitcoin is highly liquid, allowing companies to convert holdings back to fiat relatively easily if needed. Bluebird Mining’s allocation of a substantial portion of its new funding directly into Bitcoin signals a strong conviction in these benefits. It’s a strategic pivot that goes beyond mere interest; it’s an actionable commitment to integrating digital assets into their core financial planning. Is Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Becoming the New Norm? The move by Bluebird Mining is not an isolated incident but rather another significant data point in a growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption . While MicroStrategy remains the largest public corporate holder, other notable companies have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets: Company Industry Reason for Adoption (General) MicroStrategy Business Intelligence Primary treasury reserve asset, inflation hedge. Tesla Automotive/Clean Energy Diversification, belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Square (Block Inc.) Financial Services Part of a broader Bitcoin-centric business strategy. Coinbase Cryptocurrency Exchange Core to their business, treasury management. The growing list of companies, from tech giants to now a gold miner, indicates a maturing perception of Bitcoin. It’s moving from a niche, speculative asset to a legitimate component of corporate finance. This trend is driven by a combination of factors: the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, improved regulatory clarity in some regions, and the search for yield and inflation protection in a low-interest-rate environment. The Irony and Synergy: Gold Mining Meets Bitcoin Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this news is the fact that it comes from a gold mining Bitcoin adopter. For years, Bitcoin and gold have been pitted against each other in a fierce debate over which is the superior store of value. Gold proponents often highlight its long history, physical tangibility, and lack of volatility. Bitcoin advocates, conversely, champion its digital native properties, provable scarcity, and resistance to censorship. Bluebird Mining’s decision doesn’t necessarily declare a winner in this debate but rather suggests a potential synergy. It implies that rather than being mutually exclusive, gold and Bitcoin can coexist and even complement each other within a diversified portfolio. A company traditionally focused on extracting a finite physical resource is now investing in a finite digital resource. This blurs the lines and challenges conventional wisdom, perhaps signaling a future where both ‘old’ and ‘new’ forms of value are recognized and leveraged. This strategic move could also be seen as Bluebird Mining hedging its bets. If Bitcoin truly is the digital gold of the future, then having exposure to it, even as a gold miner, provides a hedge against a potential shift in global financial paradigms. It’s a forward-thinking approach that embraces innovation rather than resisting it. Beyond the Headlines: What This Crypto Investment Means for the Market Bluebird Mining’s $1.36 million crypto investment , while not on the scale of a MicroStrategy, is significant for several reasons. It adds another layer of institutional validation to Bitcoin, demonstrating that companies outside the tech or crypto-native sectors are increasingly comfortable holding digital assets. This contributes to the broader narrative of Bitcoin’s maturation as an asset class. For the crypto market, each instance of corporate adoption reinforces Bitcoin’s legitimacy and can inspire other companies to consider similar strategies. It can also lead to increased demand, potentially impacting Bitcoin’s price dynamics. More broadly, it signifies a growing confidence in the underlying blockchain technology and the decentralized finance ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Readers: For Investors: Pay attention to the growing trend of corporate treasury diversification into Bitcoin. This institutional interest can provide a long-term tailwind for the asset. However, always remember Bitcoin’s volatility and conduct your own due diligence. For Businesses: Consider exploring a Bitcoin treasury strategy. Evaluate your company’s risk tolerance, liquidity needs, and long-term financial goals. Consult with financial and legal experts experienced in digital assets. For Market Watchers: Keep an eye on similar announcements from other traditional industries. The adoption by a gold mining company is particularly symbolic and could pave the way for other commodity-focused businesses. The challenges, of course, remain. Bitcoin’s price volatility is a key concern for any corporate treasury. Regulatory uncertainty, particularly in different jurisdictions, also poses risks. Furthermore, the operational complexities of managing a Bitcoin treasury, including secure storage and accounting, require careful planning and specialized expertise. However, the benefits, as perceived by companies like Bluebird Mining, appear to outweigh these challenges for a growing number of firms. A Golden Future, Digitally Defined? The decision by Bluebird Mining to allocate a substantial portion of its new funding to Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful statement. It underscores the evolving landscape of corporate finance, where traditional assets are increasingly being viewed alongside, and even complemented by, digital assets. This move by a gold mining company, of all entities, is particularly symbolic, bridging the gap between centuries-old stores of value and the cutting edge of financial innovation. As more companies explore a Bitcoin treasury strategy , we are likely to witness a continued transformation of corporate balance sheets, marking a new era of digital asset integration into the global economy.

The company announced on Wednesday that BaFin and Ethena GmbH, its German subsidiary, have agreed on a 42-day redemption plan for holders of the USDe stablecoin. USDe Redemptions End August 6 as Ethena GmbH Exits EU Market The redemption window, which began this week, will close on August 6. During this time, USDe holders can file redemption claims directly with Ethena GmbH. BaFin has appointed a special representative to oversee the process. After the deadline, Ethena GmbH will be considered officially wound up in Germany, the European Union, and the European Economic Area. From August 7, all USDe-related claims must be directed to Ethena’s offshore affiliate, Ethena (BVI) Ltd, based in the British Virgin Islands. Ethena Labs said the redemption process will fully close out any obligations tied to USDe within Germany. “Upon conclusion, Ethena GmbH will have no outstanding issues related to Ethena GmbH’s USDe-related operations,” the company stated. We are pleased to share BaFin and Ethena GmbH have agreed to a redemption plan providing holders the option to redeem USDe if they so wish. The plan was initiated via BaFin administrative order which concurrently revokes BaFin's previous March 21 2025 order. BaFin has updated… — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) June 25, 2025 Ethena did not confirm whether it intends to seek re-entry into the European market. This resolution follows a months-long regulatory dispute. In March, BaFin ordered Ethena GmbH to halt all public offerings of its USDe stablecoin. The regulator cited violations of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) , and accused the company of offering yield-generating sUSDe tokens that may constitute unregistered securities. BaFin also instructed the company to freeze USDe reserve assets, block access to them by managing directors, and stop accepting new users. The firm was told to shut down its website and cease offering services within the EU. Although primary issuance of USDe was halted, secondary market trading has not been affected. BaFin flagged what it called “serious deficiencies” in Ethena GmbH’s compliance with MiCA rules, particularly regarding capital and reserve management. The company had been operating under a transitional allowance while awaiting full regulatory approval. Addressing the enforcement action, BaFin said, “Holders of USDe tokens cannot redeem them directly with Ethena GmbH.” It also raised concerns about sUSDe, which is linked to USDe and offers additional returns, warning it could breach securities laws. In a post on X, Ethena Labs responded by assuring users that all redemptions remain active through its BVI-based entity. The firm said USDe is fully backed and denied reports that its assets were frozen. “All funds remain accessible,” the company wrote, promising to update its terms soon to reflect the regulatory changes. The dispute marks a major setback for Ethena’s expansion into regulated stablecoin markets. The resolution, while bringing clarity to German users, leaves questions open about the firm’s future in the EU.

BaFin had previously ordered the company to halt public sales of USDe, citing concerns over its compliance status and the potential classification of sUSDe as a security under German law, due to its yield-bearing structure. While MiCAR’s transitional period gave firms like Ethena some breathing room after applying for licenses, Ethena applied in July 2024 , BaFin’s concerns went deeper. It flagged sUSDe, the yield-bearing version of USDe, as possibly a security under German law, raising red flags over investor protection and the need for full disclosure. With the regulatory pressure mounting, Ethena agreed to a 42-day wind-down period, transferring all whitelisted German users to its British Virgin Islands-based entity, Ethena (BVI) Limited. The firm noted that most of the 5.4 billion USDe in circulation had been issued either outside Germany or before MiCAR took effect. BaFin’s move also reflects a wider trend. Since MiCAR fully kicked in by late 2024, exchanges like Kraken, Crypto.com, and Binance have delisted stablecoins like USDT , DAI, and PAXG across Europe.

XRPUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView The initial dip into the $1.92 zone appears to have been a classic liquidity sweep. That area sat just beneath the value area low, meaning it was a prime target for stop hunts and a bounce. Price action did exactly that: sweeping the liquidity and bouncing strongly into the range. This reaction signals that buyers were waiting in that zone, ready to defend. Currently, XRP is trading above the point of control, which suggests the bulk of recent volume is now below price. This is a favorable sign for bulls, but the key level that must hold is $2.09. That level has acted as a support pivot in previous sessions and is now the line in the sand for bulls to defend. A close below this region would risk turning the current bounce into a short squeeze trap—one that leads to further downside and invalidates the recovery. You might also like: How XRP holders are earning passive income through RichMiner cloud mining It’s also worth noting that overall volume remains weak, which suggests the move may not be entirely conviction-driven. A sustained push higher would require stronger volume to confirm genuine buying pressure. Until that happens, price may continue to rotate between high time-frame levels, offering range-trading setups rather than breakout trends. What to expect in the coming price action XRP needs to hold above $2.09 to validate the recent bounce and maintain bullish structure. Failure to do so increases the risk of a deeper move below $1.92. If support holds and volume steps in, the path back toward resistance at $2.28 opens. Until then, expect continued rotation within the range, offering short-term trading setups for both bulls and bears.

This means that SOL is up by 17.5% in the past month, with the altcoin holding on to a 6% gain in the past year. This is a modest return, but recent data has emerged that shows institutional demand for SOL reaching new highs, after Solana futures on the CME hit a volume of 1.75 million contracts . Demand for the token is therefore growing steadily, and with the coin having some of the strongest fundamentals in the market, the long-term Solana price prediction remains very strong. Solana Price Prediction: Institutional Demand Hits New High – $1,000 SOL Incoming Sharing its data on X, Glassnode posted yesterday that the surge in SOL CME contracts “suggests institutional investors are positioning aggressively as price rebounds to ~$145.” $SOL CME Futures volume just hit an all-time high of 1.75M contracts – the highest on record. This surge suggests institutional investors are positioning aggressively as price rebounds to ~$145. Track SOL derivatives data: https://t.co/yClXheGVZB pic.twitter.com/wmmA3kdwkB — glassnode (@glassnode) June 24, 2025 As the chart above makes clear, volumes have been high in June, which boasts three of the busiest days in terms of Solana futures this year. What this suggests is that, after a difficult period for Solana and the wider market, investors (including institutions) are steadily returning to the token, buying it while it remains relatively cheap. There have also been some major spot transfers in recent days, with yesterday also bearing witness to the movement of $107.7 million in SOL from one unknown wallet to another. Now may therefore be a good moment to resume buying Solana, given that the ceasefire between Iran and Israel appears to be holding . A cessation of hostilities in the Middle East could be the factor that helps the Solana price to recover strongly over the coming weeks and months, with its chart today showing signs of a rebound. Source: TradingView After several weeks running below its baseline, SOL’s moving average convergence divergence (orange, blue) has bottomed and begun rising, which again is a sign that it’s turning a corner. We see something similar with its RSI (purple), which has bounced from 30 in recent days and also looks like it will have an upwards trajectory. When combined with Solana’s bullish fundamentals (e.g. second-biggest L1 in terms of TVL , big updates on the horizon ), such technicals point to a steadily rising price over the medium- and long-term. The Solana price could therefore hit $160 in the next one or two weeks, before entering August at just over $200. Snorter Raises $1.2 Million As It Prepares to Launch Automated Sniping Bot: The Next Big Thing? As strong as Solana remains, traders may want to diversify their portfolios in order to increase their exposure to potential upside. This means allocating a percentage to smaller, newer tokens, including presale coins, which can often rally big when they list for the first time. For example, Ethereum- and Solana-based token Snorter (SNORT) has now raised just over $1.2 million in its ICO. Here to change how sniping’s done.

The company issued over 400 million shares and warrants in Q1 to acquire 5,000 BTC, resulting in extreme dilution without the guardrails of a functioning business. BTC per share sits at ~$1.42, while the stock trades at $2.32, implying a speculative premium of ~40%. Given the absence of credible operations, poor digital infrastructure, and unsustainable capital structure, I rate NXTT a Strong Sell until fundamentals improve. Next Technology Holding (NASDAQ: NXTT ) is a Chinese tech company that markets itself as an AI-enabled software services provider and is also involved in other tech verticals like blockchain and new energy. The company was originally known as WeTrade Technology Co. but rebranded last year. Last year, the company also pivoted to being a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) treasury company, though it has held BTC since 2023. NXTT has surged lately following the Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy pivot and recent Bitcoin purchase. Bitcoin adoption has accelerated greatly on the corporate level. Publicly traded companies are increasingly modeling their approach on Strategy's ( MSTR ) aggressive Bitcoin buy playbook, raising funds through debt or equity to purchase Bitcoin for treasury allocation or long-term strategic reserve purposes. Companies purchasing Bitcoin at scale do so in the hopes that their dollar-cost average, or cost basis as it's formally known, will appreciate over time, and the value of their holdings will compound, creating value for shareholders via an increase in BTC per share. Investors are also exposed to the underlying operating business of these companies - whether good or bad-which may amplify or diminish the appeal of the Bitcoin strategy; though for now, companies with bad underlying operating businesses still enjoy inflated valuations under the cloak of the Bitcoin narrative, and the market still assigns generous multiples despite ongoing operating losses, I believe this will normalize over time as the market reaches a more rational equilibrium between hype and fundamentals. I believe at some point, the market will recalibrate; and when it does, Bitcoin alone won't be enough to justify the premium on companies pursuing corporate treasury strategy. Companies with no real operating strength face the risk of eventually being forced to sell what they hold as long-term reserves. Their reserve assets could easily become ""fire sale"" assets. And at that point, the market will price them for what they are, not for what they hold. The market has seen this movie before, with the COVID-era SPAC mania , for example, which resulted in massive write-downs, and liquidations. While Bitcoin is different in the sense that it is liquid, scarce, and now globally adopted, it still tied to the same pattern of speculative capital chasing narrative premiums, often detached from fundamental performance. I believe at this juncture of early-stage but accelerating experimentation in Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy, it is imperative for investors to begin scrutinizing early the capital structure of the companies pursuing these BTC-overlay models. The reality is that virtually every company pursuing a Bitcoin (or other crypto) corporate strategy has or faces a highly dilutive or structurally fragile capital structure (in the traditional sense, and only propped up by the crypto holdings in most cases). If a business pursuing a crypto treasury strategy is using excess free cash flow for purchases, then that's an entirely different and easier conversation. In the context of Next Technology, which reported no revenue from its underlying business in Q1, Strategy is the reference model here to benchmark Next Technologies against in this piece. Strategy has engineered a capital structure around its corporate treasury strategy that amplified shareholder exposure to the underlying asset without compromising long-term integrity. I'll be unpacking the nuances between NXTT's and MSTR's strategies, poking necessary holes where warranted, and highlighting structural strengths for NXTT where deserved. Next's Q1 and Capital Structure Under the Lens Looking at Next Technology's latest 10-Q filing (Q1 2025), the first reality check for investors sizing up NXTT is that there was no revenue from its AI SaaS business in Q1, despite the headline of $193.4 million in net income driven entirely by unrealized Bitcoin gains (thanks to FASB accounting rules). Income statement (10 Q) Next Technology's rebranding from WeTrade last year and the subsequent dissolution of its subsidiary, WeTrade Technology Co. last year offered no operational income as we see on the income statement above, as the net income from discontinued operations was ""nil"", meaning even before dissolution there was no active sales generation or service revenue from its SaaS business. This lack of an operational backstop business for Next Technology is a glaring concern. Almost every publicly traded company can more accessibly engineer a capital injection through direct equity or warrants via a single or few PIPE investors to finance treasury asset purchases, but gaining the trust of institutional investors to underwrite a hybrid of strategic capital, like the convertible notes with low to zero interest which comes with a more measured and deferred dilution schedule that makes MSTR standout, requires the type of foundational confidence that at least sales generation from a backstop business gives institutional investors. That sales generation from a backstop business is missing in Next Technology's case. This hybrid of strategic, deferred capital is particularly important for a company pursuing a crypto treasury strategy, especially in the absence of core operational profitability and free cash flow because a sole reliance on equity means dilution happens faster than appreciation, and what happens to the BTC-per-share metric, which is a measure of investor exposure to the reserve asset, is that it also gets diluted. Cash flow (10 Q) The story of Next Technology's cash flow is similar to its income. Just as revenue was zero, operational cash flow was at a critical ""nil"" for both Q1 2025 and Q1 2024 (as shown in the cashflow statement above). There is no cash from core operations, and Next Technology relies on unsecured, interest-free loans from former execs and other third parties to cover operating expenses, posing a potential related-party risk. As of Q1, these short-term loans from former execs and third parties who are likely related parties amounted to $1.63 million and rose from $760k as of Q4 end (as shown in the next table from the Q1 10-Q). Other payables (10 Q) Though the payments due to related parties were recorded as $221,000 in the balance sheet (see the table below), a closer look at the 10-Q and the disaggregation of the Other Payables line items (seen in the preceding table) shows that the $2.06 million Other Payables balance includes $1.63 million in short-term loans from Next Technology's former executives and from other third parties, alongside $427,574 in professional fees and operating expenses (as seen in the preceding table). Balance sheet (10 Q) Next Technology is missing any type of sales generation from a backstop business and also faces structural risks from these related parties because they are essentially funding the company's ongoing OpEx, which creates an unsustainable reliance. In my view, the inability to raise funds from truly independent third parties implies a profound lack of external confidence in the company's fundamentals, and I believe institutions also think along the same lines. This persistent lack of sales, coupled with the inherent related party risks, both stand as glaring red flags, in my view. The Stockholders' Equity also paints a clearer picture of dilution. The common stock saw an extraordinary increase in value from $71,718,790 to $217,676,957. More critically, the number of shares issued and outstanding skyrocketed from 6,976,410 as of Q4 last year, to a staggering 436,265,135 by Q1. This massive increase is directly attributable to the issuance of hundreds of millions of shares and warrants for the 5,000 Bitcoin purchase in March. As I mentioned earlier, dilution is nothing new to Bitcoin treasury companies; however, what makes it particularly troubling in Next Technology's case is that it was done without the guardrails of a functioning business, institutional oversight, or capital structure discipline, leaving investors exposed to unchecked equity issuance without any offsetting operating value. Equity dilution (10 Q) So while the company boasts holding 5,833 BTC as of Q1 end, the real picture becomes clearer when you look at it on a per-share basis. With 436,265,135 shares outstanding, that translates to 5,833 BTC ÷ 436,265,135 shares = ~0.00001337 BTC per share. At BTC's current price of $106,000, the implied BTC value per share is $1.42. NXTT currently trades at $2.32. And at $2.32 per share, only ~$1.42 of that is backed by the actual Bitcoin holding. The premium to NAV baked into NXTT's valuation is about $0.90 per share, which is arguably speculative, especially given the company has no revenue, sees no cash flow, and has a highly dilutive capital formation. Takeaway Right now, the market is pricing in a ~60% Bitcoin backing per share and ~40% is purely narrative-driven. That's a very generous premium for a company with no operating business, no free cash flow, and heavy reliance on dilution. The moment the market starts discounting these risks or BTC sees downward price movement for macro or other reasons, the BTC premium on NXTT could evaporate - very fast. Next Technology official website as of June 25, 2025 (Next Technology) Trading at a premium to NAV is nothing new for Bitcoin treasury companies. However, Next Technology's premium feels particularly fragile given the lack of operating business, aggressive dilution, and speculative structure behind it. I'd close this piece with an extra, perhaps trivial, detail that may seem unconventional for Seeking Alpha, but I believe it's vital context. A thorough perusal of Next Technology's website shows no functional demonstration or documentation of any products across its claimed verticals-SaaS, Blockchain, New Energy, or Digital Assets. The website has no SSL certificate either. A public company with non-secure HTTP pages and non-functional product links reflects very poor digital infrastructure and a lack of execution, particularly for a tech firm touting blockchain and AI products. In a market where Bitcoin treasury strategies are gaining interest, NXTT is an example of what happens when form outruns substance. The company's Bitcoin holdings may look impressive at a glance, but everything else-the dilution, the lack of business fundamentals, the speculative capital structure, and the absence of execution-screams caution. For me, this is a Strong Sell until a credible business model emerges.",BTC-USD|MSTR|NXTT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-25 17:05:22

Have you ever dreamed of investing in groundbreaking companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX, long before they hit the public market? For most of us, such opportunities have been exclusive, reserved only for wealthy individuals and institutional investors. But what if that barrier was crumbling, thanks to innovative financial platforms and the power of blockchain? The landscape of investment is undergoing a significant transformation, and a key player leading this charge is Republic, with its pioneering offering of Republic tokens . Unlocking Exclusive Opportunities: What Are Republic Tokens ? In a world where access often dictates opportunity, Republic is stepping up to democratize the private investment space. Their latest initiative involves selling digital tokens designed to give everyday investors a piece of highly sought-after private companies. Imagine owning a slice of a company like SpaceX, a venture typically beyond the reach of the average person. That’s precisely what Republic aims to make possible. These Republic tokens are not just a digital receipt; they are structured to represent an economic interest in the underlying private company. The valuation of these tokens is tied to secondary market evaluations, meaning their price reflects the current perceived value of the private company. If the company achieves a liquidity event, such as going public through an IPO or being acquired, token holders are entitled to a share of the price increase. This mechanism opens a powerful new avenue for wealth creation that was previously locked behind high minimum investments and exclusive networks. Key Characteristics of Republic Tokens: Accessibility: Lowers the barrier to entry for private market investments. Valuation: Prices are based on secondary market assessments of the underlying company. Upside Potential: Holders benefit from price appreciation upon a liquidity event (IPO or acquisition). Liquidity (Future): While currently focused on long-term holding, the tokenized nature hints at potential future secondary trading markets. Democratizing Wealth: How Retail Investors Can Access Private Equity For too long, the world of private equity has been a closed garden, flourishing primarily for accredited investors – individuals or institutions meeting specific income or asset thresholds. This has created a significant disparity in investment opportunities, limiting the potential for ordinary retail investors to participate in the early growth stages of revolutionary companies. Republic’s tokenization model directly challenges this traditional structure. By issuing tokens, Republic is effectively fractionalizing ownership in private companies. This means that instead of needing to commit hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, a retail investor might be able to purchase tokens representing a much smaller, affordable stake. This shift is not merely about access; it’s about empowering a broader segment of the population to participate in the wealth-building potential of innovative startups and pre-IPO giants. It’s about leveling the playing field and ensuring that the next big success story isn’t just for the already wealthy. Benefits for Retail Investors: Feature Traditional Private Equity Tokenized Private Equity (Republic) Minimum Investment High (e.g., $250,000+) Potentially much lower (e.g., $100s or $1,000s) Investor Type Accredited investors, institutions Retail investors, accredited investors Access to Companies Limited, network-dependent Broader, platform-driven Liquidity Very low, long lock-up periods Currently low, but potential for future secondary markets Beyond the Hype: The Promise of SpaceX Tokens and Other Private Giants The mention of SpaceX immediately captures attention, and for good reason. SpaceX, under the visionary leadership of Elon Musk, is at the forefront of space exploration, satellite internet (Starlink), and humanity’s journey to Mars. It’s a company with immense growth potential, yet its shares have remained exclusively in private hands. The prospect of investing in SpaceX tokens through Republic represents a monumental shift. However, Republic’s ambition extends beyond just SpaceX. The platform aims to offer exposure to a diverse portfolio of private companies across various sectors, from cutting-edge technology and biotech to sustainable energy and consumer brands. This diversification is crucial, as it allows investors to spread their risk while still participating in the high-growth potential of the private market. The ability to invest in these ‘unicorns’ before they go public is a game-changer, offering the chance for significant returns that were once the sole domain of venture capitalists and institutional funds. Why are private companies so appealing? Private companies, especially those in high-growth sectors, often experience their most significant value appreciation during their private phase. By the time they go public, a substantial portion of their growth trajectory may have already occurred. Accessing these companies pre-IPO means getting in on the ground floor, potentially yielding far greater returns than investing post-IPO. The ‘SpaceX tokens’ are just one shining example of the caliber of opportunities Republic is striving to bring to a wider audience. The Mechanics of Innovation: Understanding Tokenized Assets At the heart of Republic’s groundbreaking offering lies the concept of tokenized assets . But what exactly does that mean? In essence, tokenization is the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. This digital representation can then be easily bought, sold, and transferred, much like a cryptocurrency, but with the underlying value tied to a real-world asset – in this case, a share or economic interest in a private company. Blockchain technology provides several advantages for this process: Transparency: Transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger, enhancing trust and auditability. Fractional Ownership: Assets can be easily divided into smaller, more affordable units, enabling broader participation. Efficiency: Automated processes and smart contracts can streamline issuance, transfer, and management, reducing intermediaries and costs. Potential for Liquidity: While current regulations might limit immediate secondary trading, the underlying technology facilitates the creation of liquid secondary markets in the future, unlike traditional private equity which is highly illiquid. For Republic’s tokens, the structure involves creating a legal wrapper around the private company interest, which is then represented by the digital token. This ensures that the token holder has a legitimate claim to the economic benefits, such as a share of the proceeds if the company is sold or goes public. It’s a sophisticated blend of traditional finance and cutting-edge blockchain technology. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities in Private Equity Tokenization While the promise of tokenized private equity is immense, it’s crucial to approach this nascent field with a clear understanding of both its opportunities and the challenges it faces. The primary concern, as highlighted by the Wall Street Journal, revolves around the tokens’ legality and regulatory scrutiny. Challenges to Consider: Regulatory Uncertainty: The legal framework for tokenized securities is still evolving globally. Regulators are grappling with how to classify and oversee these new financial instruments, which can lead to delays or changes in offerings. Liquidity: Despite the inherent promise of blockchain for liquidity, secondary markets for private company tokens are still nascent. Investors might face long holding periods before they can exit their positions. Valuation Complexity: Valuing private companies can be inherently difficult due to limited public information. While Republic relies on secondary market evaluations, these can be less transparent or volatile than public market valuations. Investor Protection: Ensuring robust investor protection mechanisms in this new landscape is paramount. Clear disclosures, robust security, and dispute resolution mechanisms are vital. Opportunities on the Horizon: Wider Capital Access: Tokenization can open up new capital sources for private companies, moving beyond traditional venture capital and institutional funding. Global Reach: Blockchain-based tokens can transcend geographical boundaries, allowing companies to raise capital from a global pool of investors. Enhanced Transparency: The inherent transparency of blockchain can lead to more efficient and trustworthy private market transactions. Innovation in Finance: This movement is driving innovation in financial products and services, potentially reshaping the entire investment ecosystem. Republic’s venture into offering private company tokens, including those with exposure to SpaceX, represents a bold step towards a more inclusive financial future. While the path ahead involves navigating complex regulatory landscapes and building robust secondary markets, the potential benefits for retail investors are undeniable. It’s a testament to how technology can break down traditional barriers, bringing previously exclusive opportunities within reach of a much wider audience.

With several top projects seeing an increase in momentum, community members are actively searching for the best crypto under $1 that offers strong potential and proven development. Recent headlines confirm this shift. Polygon (MATIC) is once again on track toward the $1 mark, while Tron’s blockchain now hosts over 80 billion USDT, highlighting its relevance in stablecoin transactions. These developments signal market strength and continued user activity. But there’s another project making headlines for its progress and upcoming listing: Qubetics , now in its final presale phase. Qubetics ($TICS) stands out by offering practical blockchain solutions that earlier projects could not achieve. With a growing presale tally, a sharp token supply reduction, and a confirmed listing on a top-tier global exchange, it brings a clear and focused value proposition to the table. The project’s ongoing momentum is impressive, placing it firmly in the spotlight as the best crypto under $1. While Polygon’s growth and Tron’s USDT milestone reflect strong market sentiment, Qubetics offers both utility and affordability, two features rarely combined in this way. Qubetics Multi-Chain Wallet Offers Everyday Use Cases: Best Crypto Under $1 One of Qubetics’ key strengths lies in its non-custodial, multi-chain wallet. Built to support cross-chain activity, it gives users a seamless way to access, manage, and transact with different blockchains from a single interface. There’s no need for separate apps or switching networks manually. Everything is designed to be intuitive, especially for users unfamiliar with complex blockchain tools. This wallet provides practical benefits for many types of users. A small business handling supplier payments on both Ethereum and BNB Chain can reduce transaction friction significantly. Likewise, an individual managing tokens across Solana and Avalanche for trading or saving can now do so from one place. These real-world examples show how Qubetics bridges technical gaps without requiring users to understand the complexities of each chain. It simplifies asset management across networks, giving participants more control without compromising security or usability. In addition to the wallet, Qubetics is building a suite of tools for DeFi engagement, launchpad access, and trading aggregation. With all of these offerings bundled under a single platform, Qubetics is preparing to meet a wide range of crypto needs—especially for participants who value utility in addition to price. These practical features make Qubetics a strong candidate for the best crypto under $1. Qubetics Presale Now in Final Phase: Strong ROI Potential and Limited Supply The Qubetics presale has entered its final stage, with over 516 million tokens sold and more than $18.1 million raised. At a fixed price of $0.3370, only 9 million tokens remain before public trading begins. Following a comprehensive tokenomics update, the total supply was reduced from more than 4 billion to just 1.36 billion. This change introduces built-in scarcity and long-term value. At the same time, the team increased the public sale allocation to 38.55%, giving more control and rewards to early community members. These adjustments reflect a shift toward transparency and decentralization. For example, a $15,000 participation at the current price would secure about 44,500 $TICS tokens. When the listing price reaches $0.40, that same holding would be worth $17,800—an immediate 20% return. Looking ahead, projections of $5 to $10 per token post-mainnet suggest this amount could grow significantly, potentially reaching $222,500 to $445,000. The Qubetics presale has attracted over 28,200 holders to date, and momentum continues to build. As the final tokens sell out, the chance to enter this stage will be gone. With analysts predicting post-launch values as high as $10 to $15, and a confirmed listing on a major exchange already secured, this may be the most significant crypto presale opportunity this year. Those still waiting may find themselves buying at a higher price. Qubetics Listing at $0.40: Final Presale Window Is Closing Fast Qubetics has officially confirmed its listing on a top 10 global cryptocurrency exchange, with a launch price set at $0.40. This represents a 20% increase from the current public sale price, giving immediate upside to those who act before the presale ends. With only a small number of tokens left, interest is accelerating. Analysts continue to forecast a post-mainnet price between $10 and $15 due to Qubetics’ capped supply, real-world blockchain use cases, and governance model that favors community involvement. Buyers looking for early entry now have limited time to secure their position before wider market exposure begins. For participants looking to join a forward-looking project with confirmed growth plans, advanced tech, and strong listing momentum, the Qubetics presale and this crypto presale overall are difficult to overlook. Polygon Forecast Targets $1 Breakout: Solid Fundamentals Driving Growth Polygon (MATIC) is showing signs of strength again. According to a recent report, its price is expected to rise above $0.92, with targets of $1.36 and even $2.08 set for the coming years. These projections are based on both technical indicators and long-term development trends. With the integration of zkEVM and a growing list of ecosystem partners, the network continues to prove its position as a reliable Layer-2 solution. Recent support levels around $0.80 indicate that buying pressure is increasing. If this pattern continues, reaching $1 could happen soon. The community is optimistic, especially as more decentralized applications join the network and expand its use cases. With strong fundamentals and an affordable price, Polygon remains in the conversation when discussing the best crypto under $1. Its continued investment in scaling and infrastructure confirms it has long-term plans and support from both developers and users. Tron Expands Stablecoin Dominance With 80 Billion USDT Milestone Tron’s blockchain recently achieved a significant milestone by surpassing 80 billion USDT issued. This news highlights the platform’s ongoing role in stablecoin utility and fast transactions. As reported, Tron’s efficiency in handling large volumes of stablecoin activity has made it a preferred network for both retail and institutional users. This milestone also reflects broader interest in using Tron for global payments and DeFi services. The consistent increase in Tether supply suggests strong trust in the network’s reliability and scalability. Meanwhile, TRX continues to benefit from these developments, with solid demand supporting its market position. By playing a major role in stablecoin transactions, Tron has cemented itself as a vital part of today’s crypto economy. With its current price still below $1, it remains a practical option among leading networks and holds its position as one of the best crypto under $1. Final Thoughts: Time to Join This Best Crypto Presale Before Prices Rise The crypto market is showing clear signs of growth. Polygon is nearing a potential breakout to $1, while Tron’s network continues to lead in stablecoin transactions with over 80 billion USDT in circulation. These trends point to long-term confidence in blockchain adoption. However, Qubetics brings a unique combination of features—real utility, confirmed exchange listing, and clear price movement. With the final presale stage now active and only 9 million tokens left, this is the last chance to secure $TICS before its listing at $0.40. A 20% ROI is already confirmed for those entering now, with much higher gains possible as the token targets $10 to $15 in the next cycle. The Qubetics presale offers clear value for those seeking meaningful returns in a practical, tech-driven project. The decision is time-sensitive. As excitement builds around its upcoming mainnet and listing, this is a rare opportunity to join this best crypto presale at a locked-in price with clear upside.

However, four months later, the relationship has not progressed as expected. Although Tether now owns a large share in the club, the company said it is not involved in key discussions and is demanding a seat at the board level. Lack of Communication Worries Tether Before this year, no major European football club had a crypto company as a top shareholder. That changed when Tether bought shares in Juventus, reaching a 10.7% stake by April. This stake is now worth about €128 million. Tether is now Juventus’s second-largest shareholder, behind Exor NV, a holding company owned by the Agnelli family. The stablecoin issuer wants a seat on the Juventus board and hopes to participate in future capital raises. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, says he is interested in the club’s long-term success and believes it can add value. However, Juventus has not responded directly to these requests. While Tether has sent letters asking for meetings, no dates have been confirmed. Juventus has said it will consider meeting after its Club World Cup campaign in the United States ends in July. Different Backgrounds, Different Expectations Juventus is backed by Exor, the investment firm owned by Italy’s Agnelli family. The family has managed the club for over a century and holds major stakes in companies like Ferrari and Stellantis through Exor. In contrast, Tether is a much younger company that only recently set up a public headquarters in El Salvador. Although it manages a $150 billion portfolio and reported $13 billion in profits last year, Tether has not published a full audit and has faced regulatory scrutiny in the past. Nevertheless, Tether continues to expand its portfolio beyond crypto. It has invested in many companies in different sectors, including gold firms , artificial intelligence (AI), social platforms, agriculture, and health technology. In a recent statement, Ardoino says the company wants to bring innovation to football. Its leadership believes the sport could benefit from tools like artificial intelligence , especially in talent scouting and club operations. Juventus Football Club Needs Fresh Support Juventus is having money problems and is expected to lose €18 million this year. In March, the club said it may try to raise to €100 million to sign new players and improve its finances. Exor, the main owner, has promised €15 million and is ready to give more to keep its control of the club. Tether is also ready to help with funding, but only if it can be part of the club’s board of directors. So far, the club has not responded clearly, which has made Tether unsure about what to do next. While it still wants to help, it must see that the club is open to working together.

These changes hint that BYD’s blistering growth, which propelled it past Tesla to become the top EV maker, may be running into headwinds as inventory mounts, even after hefty price reductions in China’s fiercely competitive market. BYD cancels all night shifts as production falls Sources familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, say BYD has scrapped all night shifts at no fewer than four factories. Production in some plants has plunged by as much as one-third of their maximum capacity. It appears the move was partly to curb costs and partly a reaction to sales figures falling short of lofty targets. Data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers shows BYD’s year-on-year output growth slowed to just 13% in April and virtually zero in May, the weakest pace since the Lunar New Year holiday slump in February 2024. What is more, average monthly production in April and May this year was nearly 30% below the final quarter of 2024, marking a clear reversal of the ramp-up seen in 2023 and early 2024. In addition to trimming shifts, BYD has paused plans to add fresh production lines, one insider added. This has reportedly reduced the output capacity of at least four of the company’s factories by a third. According to CarNewsChina, the reasons behind this action were cost savings and failing to meet targets. The company, which sold 4.27 million vehicles last year, predominantly in China, had aimed for about 5.5 million sales in 2025 , roughly a 30% increase. But with dealers now sitting on nearly 3.2 months of stock, double the industry average, BYD is reassessing its build-out timetable. BYD’s pricing strategy caused massive sell-offs BYD’s aggressive pricing strategy, which cut the entry-level model to just 55,800 yuan (around $7,800), sparked a broader sell-off among Chinese auto stocks and forced rivals to follow suit. Yet dealers warn that steep discounts have eaten into margins and strained cash flow. A major dealership chain in Shandong province even shut down 20 outlets under pressure from swelling unsold inventories. Industry groups have stepped in, too. In early June, the China Auto Dealers Chamber of Commerce urged manufacturers to set “reasonable” production plans that reflect actual retail demand, rather than flooding showrooms with excess cars. Soon after, the China Automotive Dealer Association surveyed its members and found BYD’s average inventory was the highest among all brands. Amid these challenges, Chinese regulators have begun scrutinising the sector more closely, concerned that an unbridled price war could destabilise suppliers and dealers. Many automakers are now looking overseas to offset sluggish domestic demand: BYD exported roughly 350,000 of its 1.76 million vehicles sold in the first five months of 2025, tapping markets in Southeast Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Despite the slowdown, BYD remains bullish on its long-term outlook. It continues to roll out new, budget-friendly models and invest in battery technology, hoping to maintain its lead in the electric revolution. But for now, the company is choosing to cool its frenetic expansion, aiming for smarter growth rather than simply more volume. But earlier this month, BYD launched its new Dolphin Surf model in Rome, with the aim of reaching millions as it consolidates its market share in Europe and continues to surpass rival Tesla. In the UK, where the Dolphin Surf costs £18,650 in its base trim, BYD jumped from 1,611 cars sold through April to almost 12,000 sold during the same period this year.

The additional notes were sold upon the full exercise of a 13-day greenshoe option granted to the initial investor.

Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to trade on community momentum, but it’s the rise of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s starting to generate serious buzz. Priced at $0.03 and backed by a strong DeFi narrative, Mutuum Finance remains in presale stage 5 which has already sold 40% of it due to huge demand. Over $11.1 million has been generated so far and over 12,400 investors have joined. Momentum is building fast around Mutuum Finance’s presale, with analysts and influencers hinting it could become a top crypto to buy in 2025 for those aiming at long-term upside. Demand is accelerating as early adopters rush to secure allocations, hoping to ride a potential 20x–50x wave. Mutuum Finance could hit $1 before Dogecoin. Presale Momentum Builds as Mutuum Finance Hits Phase 5, Token Priced at $0.03 Mutuum Finance is lighting up the DeFi sector, and the presale is currently in its Phase 5 with tokens trading at a mere $0.03. Valued at a launch price of $0.06, investors today can expect to enjoy a smooth 2x profit. But that’s not all, as the calculated profit post-launch is 12,000%, this has the potential to be one of the biggest DeFi plays on the market today. Already, over $11.1 million has been raised and there are over 12,400 investors in the sidelines and ready to ride. Phase 6 of the presale will push the price to $0.035, which means whoever is purchasing now will have an instant 16.67% profit. The opportunity to benefit from these gains is rapidly decreasing, and smart money is already moving. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early momentum and to give back to the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also running a huge $100,000 giveaway . A total of 10 fortunate early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens each. Through its unique leaderboard system the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be incentivized. As the users climb up the ranks they will be given bonus tokens token thus holding becomes fun and competitive one. The mechanism drives both excitement and loyalty and kick-starts ecosystem growth in high-gear. Long Term-built and Audited Mutuum Finance is building credibility from its hype. Certik has done a tight audit of its smart contracts which reassure investors that the code is secure and transparent. And to make its ecosystem even more robust Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a fully collateralized, USD-pegged algorithmic stablecoin on Ethereum that will introduce long-term liquidity, stability, and reliability to institutional and retail customers. More than 12,400 investors and $11.1 million raised show just how quickly momentum is building behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM). As DOGE continues to ride on hype, MUTM is backed by real utility, audited smart contracts, and a dual lending system that’s catching the attention of analysts aiming for serious upside. Still available at $0.03 in Phase 5, early buyers are already positioned for a guaranteed 2x at launch, with long-term projections aiming for a 20x–50x return, and possibly the coveted $1 mark. The window to get in before the price increases to $0.035 in Phase 6 is closing fast. This could be the most important early play of 2025.

In 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE has risen to prominence as a preferred alternative for Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP traders moving beyond legacy ecosystems like TRON , driven by its scarcity-based framework and growing analyst support. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Market’s New Favorite MAGACOIN FINANCE brings together the viral appeal of meme culture with structural depth and institutional-grade mechanics. With over $10 million raised in presale and every phase selling out rapidly, it offers a capped 170 billion token supply , a full HashEx audit , and a 100% community-led model. The absence of venture capital control, coupled with on-chain accumulation trends and staking rewards, has set it apart from typical pre-launch tokens. For Bitcoin and XRP traders seeking clarity and early-stage momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the favored strategic pivot . Bitcoin: Rotating Profits into High-Upside Plays Bitcoin remains the foundation of many portfolios, holding above $105,000 amid institutional flows and macro strength. Yet as returns begin to normalize, BTC holders are increasingly rotating into projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE —a shift that reflects a desire to harness asymmetrical upside before mainstream listings. XRP: Seeking Cleaner Narratives and Growth XRP continues to dominate the payments arena but remains burdened by ongoing legal complexities and stalled price movement. That’s why many in the XRP community are moving capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE , drawn by its transparent governance, scarcity model, and momentum-driven adoption. TRON: Stable Growth Meets New Competition TRON’s steady ecosystem growth in stablecoins and dApps has kept it on radar, but some traders are seeking more dynamic setups. For these investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a faster-moving alternative, built on structure, transparency, and aggressive early growth—qualities that TRON’s more measured expansion currently lacks. Conclusion With a scarcity-based design, real market traction, and growing interest from Bitcoin and XRP traders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a top alternative to TRON in 2025. Its fundamentals, clean structure, and growing demand are fueling momentum—positioning it as one of the most compelling early entries this year.

In a strongly worded post on X, Farina wrote, “I’ve seen too many people regret they sold $XRP under $2. Even if World War III breaks out, even if the sky falls, you do not break Commandment #1: NEVER SELL $XRP.” He followed up with a striking statement: “Paradoxically, that’s exactly when you need to HODL, because when chaos reigns, utility wins.” Farina’s remarks have resonated deeply with longtime XRP holders who have weathered years of volatility and doubt. For him, holding XRP is not just a market strategy; it’s a principle rooted in confidence and long-term vision. I’ve seen too many people regret they sold $XRP under $2. Even if World War III breaks out, even if the sky falls, you do not break Commandment #1: NEVER SELL $XRP . Paradoxically, that’s exactly when you need to HODL, because when chaos reigns, utility wins. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 24, 2025 The High Cost of Selling Too Soon The warning is especially pointed given the history of XRP’s price action. Over the years, many early investors exited their positions out of fear or impatience, only to watch the asset rally after they sold. Farina points to the sub-$2 sell zone as a common regret point—a level where countless traders locked in small gains but ultimately missed out on the broader narrative. Today, with XRP trading below its historical highs and yet to fully realize its projected potential, Farina believes many investors are once again at a crossroads. His message serves as both a reminder and a challenge: don’t repeat the mistakes of the past by abandoning your position prematurely. Conviction amid Chaos Farina’s declaration that one should “HODL when chaos reigns” is especially striking. While financial markets remain sensitive to global shocks, from economic instability to geopolitical conflict, his message flips conventional wisdom on its head. Rather than retreating in fear, Farina argues that uncertain times are exactly when XRP holders should dig in and remain unshaken. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For him, XRP’s strength lies in its underlying utility and future relevance, not short-term hype. It’s this firm belief in purpose and function that fuels his commitment. In Farina’s view, those who understand this will hold, regardless of the noise, panic, or price swings. A Defining Moment for Holders Edo Farina’s words cut through the noise of speculation and short-term thinking. His “Commandment #1” isn’t just about never selling—it’s about adopting a mindset of clarity and discipline. It challenges investors to see beyond charts and headlines and to focus on conviction over convenience. In a market where fear and euphoria often cloud judgment, Farina’s stance offers a grounding perspective. His message: if you truly believe in XRP’s value, now is the time to hold firm, not fold under pressure. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

For the first time, the company reported SEALMINER sales as an individual revenue segment. Those sales made up 5.8% of top line revenue and have the company's best gross margins. Based on current market conditions Bitdeer's SEALMINER A2s appear to be highly cost effective machines relative to competing offerings from Bitmain. The company raised over $300 million in a senior convertible note offering. Simultaneous to that raise, Bitdeer spend $130 million on call options that look dubious so far. Back in late-February, I covered Bitdeer ( BTDR ) for Seeking Alpha and spent time dissecting what I felt were the weak points of the company's business. After what I viewed to be a pretty awful year for the company in 2024, my closing takeaway was pretty simple: I see a company that is growing increasingly reliant on a segment that produced the worst gross margins of its four business lines during 2024. But the lone comment to that article pointed out something rather important, Bitdeer is adapting its business and aims to become a major player in the ASIC space. The 'elephant in the room' that I neglected to mention in February was the company's SEALMINER ambitions. After a Q1-25 report with SEALMINER sales broken out, we can assess how that business compares with Bitdeer's existing segments. We'll also look at the recent convertible note offering from the company. SEALMINER Sales & Q1-25 Revenue During the quarter ended March, Bitdeer reported $70.1 million in top line revenue. This was a decline of 41.3% year over year but a slight sequential bump from the $69 million reported at the end of December. More importantly, Bitdeer reported its first quarter of negative gross profit at -$3.2 million: Data by YCharts Adjusted EBITDA was negative by over $56 million and the company drew down its cash position by roughly 55% from $476 million at the end of December to $216 million at the end of March. It wasn't all bad in Q1 though. For the first time, Bitdeer's Q1-25 report gives investors insight into the profitability of the company's mining rig manufacturing segment. And the early indications from that line are good: $ in Millions Revenue Gross Profit Gross Margin Self-Mining $37.2 -$3.8 -10.2% Cloud Hash $0.1 $0.0 0.0% General Hosting $9.6 $0.5 5.2% Membership $16.3 $0.9 5.5% SEALMINERs $4.1 $0.8 19.5% Source: Bitdeer At 19.5% in the first quarter, SEALMINER sales were Bitdeer's most profitable business segment by far. Self-mining actually came in negative after $41 million in COGS to generate $37.2 million in self-mining revenue. Cloud Hash is all but a memory with just $0.1 million in revenue in Q1 while Membership and General Hosting have seen considerable compression in gross margins compared 16% and 23% respectively during 2024. I'll admit, the margin from early SEALMINER sales are encouraging, especially compared to how the rest of Bitdeer's business is performing. But the company has a long way to go before SEALMINERs can make for some of the issues elsewhere. Bitdeer Revenue By Segment (Bitdeer/Author's Chart) SEALMINER sales were a very small portion of the company's top line revenue at just 5.8%. Given the degree to which Bitdeer is scaling self-mining exahash, I would expect self-mining to continue to generate the lion's share of Bitdeer's business for the remainder of this year: Bitdeer Production (Bitdeer/Author's Chart) As of end of May, Bitdeer's self-mining footprint reached 13.6 EH/s. This was largely attributed to the company energizing its SEALMINER rigs for self-mining in addition to selling them to the public. SEALMINER Profitability and Sales Projections When comparing mining rigs, hashrate and joule/TH metrics are often focal points in the market. Yet, powering the most efficient rig by J/TH might not be smart if the purchaser overpays for the machine. Thus, cost per TH is perhaps the more important metric, in my view. The screen shot below shows the top ten Bitcoin mining rigs organized by hashrate. Two of Bitdeer's A2 models crack the top ten but the bigger takeaway is how cost effective these machines are compared to Bitmain machines: Bitcoin Mining Rig Comparison (MiningNow) Keep in mind, this data is changing constantly. But at present time, Bitdeer's A2 rigs can be purchased for less than $10/TH while Bitmain's Antminers are often at least double the price per TH. This is important because it means the payback period on purchasing these machines is effectively half the time for the SEALMINER A2s: A2 Pro Hyd Pricing (MiningNow) The screen shot above shows the payback period on the A2 Pro Hyd is just 262 days given current market conditions. Antiminer S23 Hyd 3U has a payback period closer to 540 days. To me, the real question for Bitdeer investors going forward is can the company scale SEALMINER sales? ASIC Market TAM (Bitdeer) The company certainly believes this to be the case and projects $6.4 billion in revenue between 2025 and 2027 if it can achieve 30% share of the market. Bitdeer spent $59 million on R&D in the quarter - this spend was tied to development of the SEALMINER A3 and A4 units that are expected later this year. Bitdeer is guiding for 5.5-6 joules per TH on the A4s. Which, if achieved, would be a groundbreaking efficiency in the ASIC industry. $330 Million Convertible Note Offering Bitdeer announced a $300 million senior convertible note offering in mid-June. That offering was subsequently up-sized to $330 million and the notes pay 4.875% through July 1st, 2031. Each $1,000 in capital raised has a common stock conversion rate of 62.9921 Class A ordinary shares or $15.88 per share. Possible dilution from the converts - assuming it makes financial sense for the note holders to take BTDR shares - would be 20.8 million shares. Of the roughly $320 million in proceeds from the offering, Bitdeer will spend just under $130 million to pay for a zero-strike call transaction that would limit dilution risk to shareholders. Most of the remaining capital is earmarked for data center growth, ASIC development, working capital, and general corporate purposes. The call transaction is interesting to me. The calls are designed for conversion hedging and flexibility. At 10.2 million shares and a premium of $129.6 million, the price of BTDR stock has to exceed $12.70 per share to justify the wager. At current BTDR prices - $10.98 on June 24th close - you could argue the premium paid for that call transaction could have been better served as a simple repurchase plan rather than as an options play. For instance, at $11 per share, open market repurchases with $129.6 million buy 11.9 million BTDR shares rather than the 10.2 million from the call strategy. It's still very early, but with the benefit of hindsight, the short-term impact of the call strategy appears negative, from where I sit. The company is betting capital based on the assumption that its share price will increase. Which is a positive sign if you're a believer in Bitdeer's growth prospects. I'm much less convinced that Bitdeer can scale self-mining EH/s to 40 by Q4 this year based on where it was at the end of May. But I've been wrong about this company in the past and that could certainly happen again. Valuation Relative to Peers In the past, one of my biggest concerns about Bitdeer stock was its valuation relative to peers. I've typically looked at those valuations through price to book and price to sales multiples. The price to book story looks much better than it has in the past: Data by YCharts At just 2.7x book, BTDR is far less expensive than it was at the beginning of 2025 and is now a bit more in line with peers. The same is true for the forward sales multiple: Data by YCharts Here, we actually see BTDR is on the cheap side at just 2.7x forward sales. This puts the company below the info tech sector median of 2.8x forward sales and well below what we're seeing from the rest of the top miners in the industry. Closing Summary Now that we have a quarter of SEALMINER sales to assess, I'm coming around on Bitdeer. Not only were the mining machine sales the most profitable business for Bitdeer on a gross margin basis, but the cost per TH numbers from the A2 rigs are actually very good. Remember, my original bearishness BTDR has been due to Cloud Hash - this was a business that was unsustainable because it was a poor product for the plan purchasers. I'd argue the opposite is true for Bitdeer's mining machines. Those look cost effective and efficient given current market conditions. The question is whether or not Bitdeer can scale those sales. Based on the use of proceeds from the recent convertible note offering, I'd argue the company is betting on itself to achieve some of the numbers laid out in its TAM projections for ASIC growth. At $11 per share, the stock isn't nearly as overvalued as it was at the end of 2024 and it could be argued BTDR is actually cheap compared to mining stock peers. I'm upgrading BTDR from 'sell' to 'hold.'",BTDR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-25 17:31:10

A failure to reclaim $1.42 could confirm a full bearish structure shift and deeper downside. After printing an all-time high, SPX6900 ( SPX6900 ) experienced a dramatic decline, breaking below prior higher lows and invalidating the bullish market structure. The current bounce, while aggressive, is testing a dense confluence of resistance levels, suggesting this move could be a bearish retest rather than a true reversal. Key technical points Bearish Market Structure: Lower high and lower low now in place after trend break. Critical Resistance at $1.42: Point of control, 0.618 Fibonacci, and high time frame level align. Full Auction Rotation Risk: Value area low is the next key downside target. SPX6900USDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView The loss of the higher low structure marked a major technical shift for SPX6900. For weeks, price action had maintained a clear uptrend, printing consecutive higher lows en route to an all-time high. But the recent drop broke this sequence, forming a new low and shifting the trend into bearish territory. The current bounce has pushed price back into the $1.42 resistance zone, a level loaded with technical significance. Not only does this mark a high time-frame resistance level, but it also aligns with the point of control of the current trading range and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the recent decline. Together, these form a strong confluence that price must reclaim to even begin rebuilding bullish momentum. You might also like: XRP rallies off $1.92 low but weak volume puts this support level at risk Without a clean break above this area, the current price action is best interpreted as a bearish retest, a common technical reaction after a market structure breakdown. This scenario increases the likelihood of a continuation move to the downside, with the value area low acting as the next key target. If this auction rotation completes, it would confirm the transition from an uptrend to a developing downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows defining the new structure. Adding to this, there is significant inefficiency and untested liquidity below the current price. These areas often act as magnets, drawing price lower before any sustained reversal can occur. That increases the probability of a continued move downward unless bulls can defend critical levels on any retest. What to expect in the coming price action SPX6900 is trading at a make-or-break resistance zone. If bulls reclaim $1.42 and flip it into support, it could stabilize the trend. However, failure to break above will likely confirm a bearish retest and trigger a move toward the value area low. Immediate support sits at $0.97 and must hold to prevent further downside acceleration.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, plans to issue formal guidance in the coming days, according to the Financial Times . This will allow stablecoins made outside the union to count the same as those issued inside when they bear the same brand. People familiar with the plan say this will close a legal loophole around these bank-free digital currencies. This announcement follows remarks by ECB president Christine Lagarde to the European Parliament on Monday. She warned that “stablecoins… pose risks for monetary policy and financial stability [and] must therefore be governed by sound rules, especially when they operate across international borders”. Stablecoin market booms while regulation struggles to keep up Stablecoins aim to hold the same value as a country’s currency, most often the US dollar. They are backed by liquid assets kept in reserve. Around $250 billion of these tokens are now in circulation, and analysts predict the market could grow tenfold within years. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this month the total might reach $2 trillion globally and could “reinforce US dollar supremacy”. US lawmakers are close to passing the Genius Act , the first set of rules to oversee the market. Yet central banks have grown wary of laws that spur growth, yet may leave loopholes. The ECB has argued that if coins issued abroad are treated as identical, a rush of redemptions could put pressure on banks in the EU. Under current EU rules, stablecoins created inside the bloc must hold most of their reserves at an EU bank and let holders redeem tokens for cash directly. The ECB says treating non-EU coins the same could increase the risk of a run on reserves and put pressure on other banks. Lagarde warned lawmakers that if redemptions “are amplified by large developments and possible difficulties in any stablecoins, the European safeguards, backups, and deposits will be exposed.” EU institutions split on risk and oversight Diego Ballon Ossio, a partner at Clifford Chance in London, said rules in different countries can clash. “Technically, purely from a legal perspective, you couldn’t say that the coins are fungible,” he said, adding that EU law ties regulation to the issuer, not the token. On Tuesday, the Bank for International Settlements said stablecoins “perform badly” on key tests for use as money. It said they are not backed by a central bank, lack enough guardrails to prevent illicit activity, and do not have the funding flexibility of banks that lend money. Inside the EU, the commission and the ECB have clashed in private meetings this year. According to participants, the commission pushed back on the bank’s warnings. A commission spokesperson said a run on a well-run, backed stablecoin was “very unlikely” and that if one did occur, “foreign holders would redeem their tokens in [for example] the US, where the majority of the tokens circulate and the majority of the reserves are held.” A cryptocurrency executive said the ECB’s warnings partly reflect fears that a stablecoin operator’s reserves might sit in a country with a small banking system. The executive also said the ECB wants to push its own central bank digital currency to compete with private stablecoins. To add safeguards, ECB officials proposed asking other countries for legal guarantees that they could transfer stablecoin reserves to the EU in a crisis. They noted there are no current agreements between the EU and other nations on matching regulatory standards. A commission official said at a closed-door meeting that guarantees were unnecessary, prompting an ECB attendee to ask, “Do we need to trust them blindly that they will transfer the assets [in case of a run on EU reserves]?” Instead, the commission proposed that national supervisors make their own risk assessments and demand extra safeguards when needed. Andrea Resti, a professor of financial risk management at Bocconi University in Milan, warned that this approach could lead to uneven oversight. He said, “European supervisors issue authorisations in very tight timelines and without enough due diligence. Everything would be left to the artisan initiative of national supervisors.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

For Interested investors looking for a token that blends meme energy with real-world application and explosive potential, XYZVerse might just be the one to watch. Hyperliquid Source: TradingView Hyperliquid (HYPE) has been drawing attention with its recent price movements. Trading between $29.19 and $44.09, HYPE has shown significant growth over the past six months with a 41.52% increase. In the past month, the price climbed by 8.34%, indicating steady upward momentum. However, the last week saw a decline of 9.986%, reflecting some short-term volatility. Technical indicators provide insight into HYPE’s performance. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $37.46, slightly above the 100-day average of $35.02, suggesting a potential upward trend. The Relative Strength Index is at 57.90, leaning towards bullish territory but not yet overbought. The Stochastic oscillator reads 77.97, indicating the coin is approaching overbought conditions. The MACD level of 0.6172 points to strengthening momentum. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $52.41. Breaking through this could open the path to the second resistance at $67.31, a substantial rise from current levels. On the downside, the nearest support is at $22.61, with a second support at $7.707 if the price falls further. These levels are crucial for HYPE’s potential movement. The data suggests room for growth, but also highlights areas where the price might struggle or find support. Ondo Source: TradingView Ondo (ONDO) has faced challenges recently. In the past week, its price dipped nearly 1%. Over the month, it declined about 17%. Over six months, ONDO’s value dropped over 50%. Currently, the coin trades between $0.58 and $0.80. Technical indicators highlight key levels. Nearest resistance is at $0.93, then $1.15. Support levels are $0.49 and $0.27. The 10-day and 100-day SMAs are $0.76 and $0.71. The RSI is high at 74.19, indicating overbought conditions. Stochastic oscillator is also elevated at 97.92. These factors suggest ONDO might face downward pressure. High RSI and stochastic values hint at a possible decline towards support at $0.49, about 38% down from $0.80. If ONDO surpasses resistance at $0.93, it could target $1.15, a 44% increase. Monitoring these levels is crucial for ONDO’s next move. Conclusion Although HYPE and ONDO are good options, XYZVerse stands out as the first all-sport memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth and community-driven success.

Trump, who originally appointed Powell to lead the Fed in 2017, now blames him for keeping interest rates too high. Trump claims this refusal to slash rates is costing the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars in unnecessary interest payments. When asked if he’s already looking for someone new, he said, “Yeah, I know within three or four people who I’m going to pick.” He added that Powell’s term will be up “pretty soon, fortunately, because I think he’s terrible.” Powell’s current term, re-upped by President Joe Biden, runs until May 2026. Powell testifies as Fed holds rates steady despite pressure On Tuesday, Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that the Fed is not ready to cut rates yet. He pointed to the potential inflationary effect of Trump’s tariff policies. “Most forecasters expect a fairly substantial wave of price increases to come through to the consumer,” Powell said. While many Republicans in the Senate pushed him to act fast, Powell stayed firm. “If we make a mistake here, people will pay the cost for a long time,” he said. The Federal Open Market Committee voted unanimously last week to keep interest rates where they are, marking the fourth straight meeting with no changes. Powell emphasized that the majority of the committee still expects rate cuts before year-end but said, “It’s just something you want to approach carefully.” Fed officials are split. Vice Chair Michelle Bowman, who was appointed by Trump, said Monday the bank should act quickly to cut rates and help the labor market. Christopher Waller, another Trump appointee, agreed and called the inflation from tariffs a “one-off” event. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee joined in, suggesting borrowing costs could be lowered again if tariffs don’t push inflation up. But Powell argued the opposite: that tariff-driven price hikes could begin this summer, and rushing to cut rates could restart inflation. Trump allies ramp up attacks as debt and tariffs dominate Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick used his platform Wednesday to repeat Trump’s message. “Jerome Powell – your job is to help Americans, not hurt them, so do your job and CUT our absurdly high interest rates at your next meeting,” Lutnick posted on X. In a follow-up post, he doubled down: “That’s why President Trump calls Powell a loser. Because Powell would rather ignore the tariff revenues and keep US rates the highest in the world (for a first-class country) because he’s afraid to act.” Senator Bernie Moreno from Ohio joined the pile-on, accusing Powell of trying to sabotage Trump’s trade agenda. “Nobody in this chamber has that kind of power to have a $400 billion impact on this economy, on our deficit,” Moreno said. “And I just think that you should consider whether you’re really looking at this from a fiscal lens or a political lens, because you just don’t like tariffs.” As Trump urges Congress to pass a tax cut bill that would tack on another $2 to $4 trillion to the already $36 trillion national debt, Republicans want the Fed to act like a partner. Trump and GOP lawmakers say the only way to deal with this debt is to slash interest rates and reduce borrowing costs. Meanwhile, the US Treasury is running out of room to avoid a default unless Congress agrees to raise the debt ceiling again. Trump eyes replacements as legal limits block firing Powell Despite legal restrictions preventing Trump from firing Powell outright, he has threatened to do it several times over the years. Analysts believe Trump will simply wait out Powell’s remaining time and put someone new in place once the term expires. The president confirmed Wednesday he’s already speaking to possible replacements, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. “I know within three or four people,” Trump said again on Wednesday. “I mean, he goes out pretty soon, fortunately, because I think he’s terrible.” The thing is, though, no matter how hard he tries, we know Trump will never get Powell to bite the bait.

He stated that the US government is collecting over $30 billion per month in tariff revenue, which he argues is a positive inflow that reduces Treasury borrowing needs. Lutnick cites Jerome Powell’s testimony that tariff-driven inflation has not materialized in the past 2 and a half months, as he claims there is zero impact, and thus inflation remains under control. He continues to argue, saying that given low inflation and high tariff revenues, the Fed should cut interest rates to lower federal borrowing costs, stimulate economic growth, and naturally reduce deficits. Lutnick then criticized Powell for ignoring this formula and sided with US President Donald Trump’s call for rate cuts, accusing Powell of being afraid to act.

He points to the huge amount of stablecoin liquidity and persistent doubt among retail and big players. That stage of doubt has come before in other cycles, and it usually marks a turning point. When confidence returns, altcoins tend to surge. Investors Poised On The Sidelines Many holders seem ready to hit buy. They’re holding onto stablecoins until charts, on-chain data or macro news clear up. A boost in stablecoin flows to exchanges could be one early hint that rotation is starting. Large moves by whale wallets into low-cap tokens may follow. In recent weeks, inflows of stablecoins into trading platforms have ticked higher. That’s a key signal to watch. If weekly inflows rise sharply—say above $5 billion—it may show serious appetite building. Past cycles saw similar spikes just before altcoin rallies began. Another one to monitor is decentralized finance platform volume. When stablecoins move from wallets to lending or liquidity pools, it usually indicates that traders are looking for return and preparing to swap to other tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Market observers will also be monitoring Bitcoin’s consolidation range closely. If it remains above recent lows for a few weeks, that would give confidence a boost everywhere. Then we could see smaller cryptocurrencies move higher on new liquidity. Based on these signals, it looks like we’re in a waiting game. Stablecoin supplies are at record levels, Bitcoin is settling, and altcoin sentiment remains low. When all that lines up just right, funds are likely to rotate. Then the altcoin sector could see new life.

Solana Investors Turn to VeChain,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoin-finance-surpass-bitcoin-and-ethereum-gains-solana-investors-turn-to-vechain/,"The crypto market is defined by cycles of innovation, early accumulation, and disruptive momentum. As 2025 unfolds, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the year’s fastest moving pre-launch candidates. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, traders are paying attention to this rising contender. Meanwhile, Solana holders are eyeing VeChain as a strong diversification play grounded in real-world use cases. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing headlines with its rapid presale success—raising over $10 million and selling out phases faster than most established altcoins. The project combines meme appeal with technical credibility: a fully audited smart contract via HashEx , capped supply of 170 billion tokens , and a no-VC structure that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its community-first strategy, transparent rollout, and surging demand have made it one of the most closely watched early-stage projects of 2025. For many traders, it evokes the early momentum seen in past generational tokens—fueling speculation it could outperform legacy giants by percentage return. Bitcoin: The Benchmark with Modest Upside Bitcoin has recently pushed past $111,000 , driven by ETF adoption and institutional inflows. While it remains the cornerstone of the crypto market, many long-time BTC investors are allocating a portion of their portfolios to high-upside projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , looking to re-create the outsized returns of Bitcoin’s formative years. Ethereum: Innovation and Maturity Ethereum remains unmatched in smart contract deployment and Layer-2 development. But with its price range tightening, ETH investors are increasingly diversifying. MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught the attention of Ethereum holders seeking breakout potential in a more agile, community-controlled ecosystem. Solana: Speed, Adoption, and Diversification Solana continues to perform as one of the fastest Layer-1 blockchains. However, many SOL investors are now turning toward VeChain , drawn to its enterprise focus and ability to execute in regulated environments. The shift underscores a broader trend toward utility-backed assets. VeChain: Real-World Utility on the Rise VeChain is gaining momentum thanks to partnerships, cross-chain compatibility, and growing institutional visibility. As more traders search for blockchain applications with real-world outcomes, VeChain stands out—especially to those rebalancing from more speculative holdings. Conclusion With its disciplined foundation, transparent growth, and rising adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming a contender to match or even exceed the relative percentage performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the same time, VeChain’s enterprise integration is pulling attention from Solana holders seeking long-term reliability. Together, these two projects capture both ends of the crypto opportunity spectrum—early momentum and real-world application.

MSTR stock was trading at $377 on Wednesday, a few points above this week’s low of $360. It has jumped nearly 70% from its lowest level this year. Strategy stock technical analysis points to a surge The daily chart shows that the MSTR stock price has been in a tight range since May. It has remained above the 100-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages, which have provided it with substantial support. Further, Strategy has formed a bullish pennant pattern, which often leads to additional gains. This pattern is composed of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle, with a breakout occurring when the two lines near their confluence level. The profit target in a bullish pennant is established by first measuring the length of the flagpole and then extrapolating the same distance from the breakout point. In this case, the flagpole’s length is $200—$420 minus $230. The breakout point is $385, bringing the target price to $585, up 52% from the current level. A drop below the support at $342 will invalidate the bullish forecast. This price is the neckline of the double-bottom pattern at $230. MSTR stock price chart | Source: TradingView Odds of Bitcoin price hitting all-time high are rising The main catalyst for the Strategy stock price is the odds of Bitcoin ( BTC ) hitting a record high before October have jumped to 81% on Polymarket . Such a move would be bullish for Strategy because it holds 592,345 Bitcoins currently valued at over $63 billion. You might also like: Can Sei price keep climbing after Circle’s backing and ETF buzz?

These funds have had a cumulative inflow of $47.9 billion since January last year, with BlackRock’s IBIT having over $72 billion in assets. Technically, Bitcoin price has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, a popular continuation setup. This pattern consists of a rounded bottom followed by some consolidation, which is currently underway. Therefore, Bitcoin is likely to break out and potentially rise above $140,000 in the near term.

In a recent testimony to the US Senate, Powell tells members of the Senate’s banking panel that while the US dollar appears to be doing better, the Fed has yet to formally form an opinion on the matter. “I would go back to the thought that markets have been digesting an unusually challenging set of circumstances and have reacted the way they reacted. The dollar has kind of stabilized just now, in fact it’s moved back up in the last couple of weeks a bit. There are plenty of people who are still writing that the dollar is still overvalued, we don’t have a view on that of course… I don’t really have an official view I’d like to share, [but] I think there are possible explanations…one of which is that people still feel the dollar is highly valued, but we’ll see.” Touching on the subject of tariffs, Powell says markets are in uncharted territory since tariffs have only ever been going down for many decades. “We’ve been going through a long period where tariffs have been going down. Since World War 2 really, it’s been a process of lowering tariffs globally… There isn’t a lot of modern learning on that. One of the reasons [now] is so challenging is that we don’t have modern precedent.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The wallet, believed to have been inactive since late 2011 or early 2012, initiated a transaction earlier this week, transferring 61 BTC worth approximately $6 million. The remaining 239 BTC, still residing in the address, are valued at around $24 million. While no funds have yet been sent to known exchange addresses, the move has reignited debate over the behavior of early Bitcoin adopters and the broader implications for the market. Blockchain analytics platform Whale Alert flagged the transaction Sunday, noting the address had shown no activity for over 11 years. These so-called “Satoshi-era” wallets, often attributed to early miners or adopters, contain coins acquired when Bitcoin traded below $10. With today’s price hovering just under $105,000, the owner of this particular wallet is sitting on a return of more than 23,000%. Notably, the activity coincided with heightened market volatility. Following the transfer, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply, breaking key support zones around $100,700 and testing a local low of $98,445 before recovering slightly and strongly on Monday. Market analysts suggest that while the transfer did not trigger a mass panic, it has prompted traders to exercise caution. “These old-school moves can jolt short-term sentiment, with traders watching for potential dump or just a stealthy rebalance,” said one observer on X. The mystery behind the motivation remains. Some speculate the holder could be preparing to liquidate a portion of their holdings, while others suggest it may be part of a larger asset reallocation strategy. Still, the fact that most of the coins remain untouched has offered some relief to investors wary of a sudden flood of supply. This isn’t the only dormant whale to resurface recently. On May 13, another post-Satoshi-era wallet holding 300 BTC, valued at over $31 million, became active after 11.1 years. And in April, a staggering 1,078 BTC worth more than $100 million was moved from a 2013 wallet, underscoring the growing trend of long-silent addresses stirring as Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs. Meanwhile, while retail traders continue to scale back, recent data from Santiment shows that whales and sharks, wallets between 10 and 10,000 BTC, have collectively acquired over 83,000 BTC in the past 30 days. On June 20, Santiment further highlighted how wallets with over 10 BTC increased by 231 in just 10 days. In contrast, smaller wallets holding between 0.001 and 10 BTC declined by 37,465 over the same period. With Bitcoin trading slightly above $107,391 at press time, this accumulation, paired with the reactivations of ancient wallets, highlights how BTC ownership is changing and how these changes can quickly influence market mood and behavior.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-25 18:12:37

Recently, analysts have confirmed that Ethereum and Solana insiders are strategically accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE , while also increasing exposure to Injective Protocol . This deliberate positioning highlights growing confidence in MAGACOIN FINANCE’s structural design and breakout potential, especially among seasoned investors looking for strong, early-stage plays. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Insider’s Early-Stage Play MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly established itself as one of the year’s most sought-after projects , raising over $10 million while selling out multiple funding rounds. With a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens , HashEx-audited smart contracts, and a transparent, VC-free launch structure, it appeals to insiders seeking long-term value and sustainability. Its ties to Ethereum and Injective Protocol ecosystems are driving wider attention, with developers and early institutional players quietly accumulating. The combination of token scarcity, growing adoption, and ecosystem integration makes it a compelling asset for insiders seeking long-range opportunity. Ethereum: Insider Rotation into High-Upside Presales While Ethereum remains the foundation for smart contracts and decentralized applications, insiders are increasingly rotating into new projects with room to grow. MAGACOIN FINANCE benefits from Ethereum integration, offering familiar infrastructure with fresh upside potential—making it a natural diversification play for ETH holders with an eye on early-stage expansion. Solana: Institutional Adoption Meets Tactical Diversification Solana continues to attract institutional attention for its speed and throughput. However, as its price matures, insiders are actively seeking projects with more immediate appreciation potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one such asset—its model resonates with Solana-aligned investors looking to stay ahead of trend curves. Injective Protocol: Fueling Strategic Accumulation Injective Protocol is known for its next-gen trading tools and cross-chain capabilities. Its alignment with MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention from traders and insiders aiming to benefit from protocol synergies. The pairing of technical innovation and token utility is fueling increased interest across multiple investor segments.

The bank cited the risk that customers could face debts they would not be able to repay due to the high price volatility of crypto assets behind this decision. In the statement on Barclays' official website, the following statements were used: “As of June 27, 2025, crypto transactions will no longer be possible with Barclaycard. A fall in the price of crypto assets could lead to debts that customers cannot repay. Additionally, transactions made with crypto assets are not protected under the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if problems occur.” Related News: First Massive Purchase Arrives Today from Famous Investor Who Announced He Will Buy $1 Billion Worth of Bitcoin The bank directed its customers to the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) website, advising them to learn more about the basics of crypto assets and the risks they pose.

Among the delegates navigating more than 600 side events and private gatherings was Outset PR , the only crypto-native PR agency to blend performance-level analytics with boutique-caliber strategy. Over a packed week of meetings, its leadership gathered insights not just from the stage, but from the corridors—where future-altering ideas tend to emerge first. RWA: The Institutional Thesis Gains Ground Tokenization of real-world assets is gaining serious traction. What began with tokenized real estate has evolved into a broader shift encompassing treasury bills, commodities, and fine art. But momentum alone isn’t enough. Investors now expect disclosures around custodial models, regulatory jurisdictions, and legal enforceability. RWA projects are being evaluated less like DeFi protocols and more like fintech products. Outset’s model anchored in daily media analytics and trend monitoring is designed to help projects stay aligned with fast-shifting sentiment. DePIN: Tangibility Drives Attention DePIN also was a breakout topic at TOKEN2049. Blockchain-powered infrastructure networks—from wireless and mobility to energy—are proving that decentralization can deliver physical utility. The narrative edge? Tangibility. These stories are intuitive for regulators, enterprise stakeholders, and users outside the crypto-native echo chamber. They offer clear, real-world benefits that align with broader infrastructure trends. For Outset PR, which supports multiple frontier-tech clients , identifying high-impact narratives early is a core function. Its goal-driven approach focuses on helping clients frame complex infrastructure stories in accessible, outcome-focused language. ZK Tech: A Messaging Challenge Hiding in Plain Sight ZK technology has reached a critical juncture. The cryptographic innovation behind zero-knowledge proofs is indispensable to scaling, privacy, and on-chain identity. But the complexity creates a communications gap. Many ZK teams struggle to convey value without overwhelming audiences. This is where Outset PR’s strength lies: translating technical depth into strategic clarity. By merging performance analytics with creative fluency, the firm helps ZK projects bridge that gap—without dumbing down the message. “ZK needs a public narrative as powerful as its private computations,” said Mike Ermolaev, founder of Outset PR. “You can’t pitch rollups and proofs like a whitepaper. You need relevance and simplicity.” The Google Factor and Macro Uncertainty One of the quieter but recurring topics at TOKEN2049 was Google—not just as a search engine, but as a distribution bottleneck. Indexing delays, algorithmic volatility, and paid visibility challenges are reshaping how content reaches audiences. Outset PR has already adapted. Rather than chasing raw exposure, the firm emphasizes results-oriented campaigns that tie visibility to user engagement and tangible growth. Geopolitical tensions and U.S. Federal Reserve policy remain constant undercurrents, but the tone at TOKEN2049 was pragmatic. Founders and fund managers echoed a common theme: ambiguity is the new baseline—and progress must happen anyway. Why the Narrative Shift Matters RWA connects crypto to capital markets, DePIN connects it to physical infrastructure, while ZK connects it to trust, scale, and privacy. Together, they form the strategic architecture for Web3’s next growth cycle. Firms that hope to lead this cycle must do more than build. They must communicate—clearly, confidently, and in lockstep with what the market actually values. This is where Outset PR occupies a unique niche: the only crypto PR agency fusing real-time data and high-touch strategy with a reputation for delivering like a partner, not a vendor.

The FHFA has instructed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the cornerstones of the US housing finance system, to include cryptocurrencies in the risk assessment process for single-family housing loans. Under the decision signed by FHFA Director William J. Pulte, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will now be able to consider crypto assets that can be stored without being converted into dollars and are held on U.S.-based, regulated crypto exchanges in their mortgage risk assessments. With this step, FHFA aims to provide greater liquidity and flexibility in the mortgage system, expand the range of assets in reserves, and support long-term sustainable homeownership. Related News: One of the UK's Largest Banks Makes a Disturbing Decision Regarding Cryptocurrency - Will Other Banks Take Similar Measures? According to the directive: Crypto assets can be directly accepted as reserve assets. Crypto assets will only be considered if they can be stored on US-based and regulated exchanges. Both institutions will create their own internal risk assessment systems, taking into account volatility and market fluctuations in crypto assets. Any change in practice would have to undergo approval by the institutions' board of directors and be submitted to the FHFA. This directive marks the first time in the US that cryptocurrencies may begin to be considered an official “asset” in the mortgage system. This could open up new opportunities for crypto investors, especially in mortgages. However, only crypto assets that are held on regulated exchanges and can be proven with documentation will be accepted. Although the directive does not yet mean that cryptocurrencies can be used as collateral, it does indicate that an important regulatory threshold has been crossed. *This is not investment advice.

He advocates for a shorter workweek, citing the need for better work-life balance and more paid time off. In an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan, Sanders said that the time saved with AI tools should be given back to workers to spend with their families. “Let’s use technology to benefit workers,” Sanders said. “That means give you more time with your family, with your friends, for education, whatever the hell you wanna do.” AI to benefit both the employee and the CEO The relationship between AI and employees is a bittersweet one. However, it is leaning more toward the bitter side. This is because AI is threatening to take their jobs. Statistically , nine out of ten employers plan to use AI-enabled solutions and generative AI over the next five years. In addition, research done by Forbes revealed that 52% of more than 5,000 professionals are afraid of how AI will affect their jobs. Therefore, the concept of AI being of benefit to the employees would be a relief to most people because an increase in efficiency could mean that they can finish their current tasks faster without losing pay. “Technology is gonna work to improve us, not just the people who own the technology and the CEOs of large corporations,” Sanders said. “You are a worker, your productivity is increasing because we give you AI, right? Instead of throwing you out on the street, I’m gonna reduce your work week to 32 hours.” On the other hand, the tech elite have their benefit because of the idea that AI will make companies more productive. This will allow companies to do even more because their workers will be able to take on more tasks, or they can save money by cutting staff. Companies that have seen success through AI adoption “And by the way, not a radical idea,” Sanders said. “There are companies around the world that are doing it with some success.” For instance, in the UK, 61 companies with a total of 2,900 workers tried out a four-day work week in the second half of 2022. Nineteen of the 23 companies that shared financial information saw their sales stay about the same or go up by 1.4% from the start of the study to the end. Also, Kickstarter has had a four-day work week since 2021, and Microsoft Japan tried out a four-day work week in 2019 and said it made them 40% more productive. In addition, companies like IBM, Shopify, and Coca-Cola, which were early users of AI solutions, used to only use the technology for routine tasks. Now, they use it to boost employee productivity and speed up top-line growth directly. Analysts think that the global AI market will continue to grow and reach a value of more than $240 billion. AI adoption by the industry is growing by up to 20% each year. Generative AI use rose from 55% to 75% between 2023 and 2024. Companies get a 3.7x return on every dollar they spend on GenAI and such technologies. Goldman Sachs predicted that AI will add 15% to the world’s GDP over the next ten years. J.P. Morgan is less optimistic. The firm predicted that the price would go up by 8% to 9%. Daron Acemoğlu, an economics professor at MIT, predicted it will only add 1% to 1.5% to growth.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown early signs of recovery, while Solana and XRP are emerging as top altcoins poised to capitalize on the shift in sentiment. With global uncertainty dialing down, traders are now focused on breakout potential and upcoming resistance levels across key digital assets. This timely analysis is supported by Outset PR —a crypto-native PR agency that transforms market momentum into high-visibility storytelling. When the headlines shift, Outset PR ensures your project’s narrative moves in sync with the market. Ethereum (ETH): Poised for a Strong Recovery After Stabilization Source: tradingview Ethereum (ETH) is finding its footing between $2,000 and $2,500 as broader market sentiment improves. While recent pullbacks have tested short-term support, Ethereum’s fundamentals and developer momentum remain rock solid. A move back above $2,400 could set the stage for a retest of the $3,400 resistance—offering over 40% upside from current levels. With the RSI signaling room for growth and tensions easing globally, ETH may be gearing up for its next leg higher. Bitcoin (BTC): Holding Strong With Eyes on Breakout Above $113K Source: tradingview Bitcoin (BTC) is navigating a consolidation zone between $96,000 and $107,000, building strength for a breakout. With support holding at $92,000 and bullish sentiment returning as geopolitical fears subside, BTC could challenge the $113,000 resistance soon. If cleared, the next target lies near $123,000, offering a potential 10% rally. Despite short-term fluctuations, Bitcoin continues to be the dominant force in the market and remains on solid footing for a continued climb. Solana (SOL): Oversold and Ready for a Sharp Rebound? Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is currently trading between $119 and $152, showing signs of consolidation after recent price pressure. The RSI suggests the asset may be oversold, presenting a prime entry point for bullish traders. With growing developer activity and adoption, a breakout above $171 could pave the way toward $204—a potential 35% surge. Solana remains one of the most promising altcoins for the next market wave, especially if positive momentum returns. XRP: Momentum Building as Bulls Eye $2.95 Target Source: tradingview XRP is showing surprising resilience, holding steady between $1.84 and $2.27 while maintaining key support at $1.66. The RSI near 51 and a slight MACD uptick signal balanced conditions that could soon favor bulls. If XRP crosses the $2.52 resistance, it could accelerate toward $2.95, unlocking more than 20% upside. With legal clarity improving and interest in cross-border payments growing, XRP is positioning itself for a breakout moment.

The Minneapolis-based firm now controls 188,478 ETH , worth approximately $457 million at current prices. This represents one of the audacious corporate crypto strategies since MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation campaign . Today, SharpLink announces that our ETH holdings have further increased to 188,478, which were acquired at an average price of $2,513 per ETH. https://t.co/7kENpBWM41 pic.twitter.com/reFHxplxA9 — SharpLink Gaming (@SharpLinkGaming) June 24, 2025 “ Increasing SharpLink’s ETH holdings underscores our forward-thinking approach to creating long-term value for our stockholders ,” said Joseph Lubin, Chairman of SharpLink’s Board and Ethereum co-founder. Since adopting Ethereum as its primary reserve asset on June 2, the company has generated 120 ETH in staking rewards while achieving 18.97% ETH per share growth, according to the company’s announcement . Strategic Vision Behind the Ethereum Bet SharpLink’s transformation began with a $425 million private placement led by Consensys Software Inc. in May. SharpLink Gaming has landed a $425 million private investment in public equity deal, with blockchain leader @Consensys #Gaming #Ethereum https://t.co/xdHEYt7rB8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 27, 2025 The deal brought Lubin aboard as Chairman, providing institutional credibility and deep Ethereum expertise to guide the company’s treasury strategy. Rather than holding cash or bonds, the company has committed to Ethereum as its primary reserve asset, making it the first Nasdaq-listed company to adopt an ETH-focused treasury model. SharpLink’s approach extends beyond simple price speculation, with the company deploying 100% of its ETH holdings in staking solutions to generate yield while supporting Ethereum’s network security. This dual-purpose strategy allows the firm to earn additional ETH rewards while participating in the network’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, potentially creating a compounding effect as staking rewards are reinvested. The timing appears calculated, coming as Ethereum trades within a consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800 after surging 80% from April lows. Industry observers note that SharpLink’s accumulation coincides with growing institutional interest in ETH staking, particularly as more than 35 million ETH tokens have been staked , representing over 28% of the total supply locked in smart contracts. Ethereum staking has reached a new milestone this week, with more than 35 million ETH, over 28.3% of the total supply. #Ethereum #Staking https://t.co/KPGqYuLR5p — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 21, 2025 The company’s aggressive equity-to-crypto conversion model has also created some speculations in the traditional finance circles, particularly given the gaming sector’s historically conservative approach to balance sheet management. Institutional Momentum Builds Across Multiple Fronts Institutional demand for ETH continues to accelerate through traditional channels. In recent weeks, BlackRock and Fidelity poured over $21 million into Ethereum ETFs , while on-chain data shows whale wallets accumulated 871,000 ETH in a single day earlier this month. Ethereum is seeing its most aggressive whale accumulation in seven years, raising speculations about what comes next for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. #Ethereum #Whale https://t.co/R6YYsZtrzW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 17, 2025 We’re beginning to witness a mature approach to the company’s adoption strategy, as it is becoming more selective about the digital assets that align with its specific business models. Recent developments across the crypto space support this thesis, as SharpLink’s strategy is just a mirror of a broader trend of institutional capital flowing into alternative cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. Earlier this week, China’s Nano Labs announced a $500 million convertible note agreement to accumulate up to $1 billion in BNB tokens, targeting 5-10% of the total circulating supply. @NanoLabsLtd has entered into a $500 million convertible note agreement as part of a broader strategy to accumulate BNB worth up to $1 billion. #NanoLabs #BNB https://t.co/mPyfq9HiSQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 Similarly, Nasdaq-listed Classover Holdings has revealed plans to raise $500 million for a Solana-based treasury , with 80% of proceeds allocated to SOL purchases. Even traditional blockchain projects are exploring treasury diversification, with Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson proposing a $100 million conversion of ADA into stablecoins and Bitcoin . These moves suggest that the era of single-asset treasury strategies may be ending as companies seek to optimize their crypto holdings for specific use cases.

Pi2Day traditionally serves as a platform for the Core Team to showcase ecosystem developments, user growth metrics, and infrastructure achievements. #Pi2Day is coming. $Pi up 22% in the last 24h Pi Domain auction ends in 3 days. New AI partnership and Web3 ecosystem growth is expected. Good times ahead pic.twitter.com/qZ9PSzGNSr — Varangian Observer (@Varangian_CC) June 25, 2025 This year’s event carries particular significance as the community expects major announcements that could further accelerate adoption. The most anticipated development involves the release of an enhanced Know Your Customer (KYC) synchronization feature. This update will establish connectivity between the Pi Browser and the main Pi App, enabling users to consolidate identity verification data across platforms. Through this streamlined process, millions of users currently experiencing “pending” or “tentative” KYC status may finally complete their migration to the open Mainnet. Successful migration unlocks essential features, including wallet functionality and transferring Pi tokens to the live blockchain network. Additionally, over 100 days have elapsed since the Open Mainnet launch , so community members anticipate announcements regarding new applications and developer tools. Any demonstration of practical utility could shift market perception from speculative mining activity toward legitimate use case adoption. Global search interest in @PiCoreTeam has fallen to its lowest level of 2025, raising fresh questions about the project’s momentum. #Pi #PiNetwork https://t.co/8RI6arkBgA — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 5, 2025 Descending Wedge Shattered: Analysts Eye $1.25 as Pi Bulls Take Control The PIUSDT chart shows a strong breakout from a descending wedge pattern, a classic bullish reversal formation. The breakout invalidates the previous bearish structure and opens the door for a sustained uptrend. Key upside targets include the $0.9624 and $1.0486 levels, both of which represent former demand zones and likely resistance. Source: Bullcrypto on TradingView The next significant resistance level lies near the psychological $1 mark, which coincides with the top of the highlighted green supply zone. With momentum clearly favoring bulls post-breakout, the near-term outlook remains bullish. If the price can hold above the broken wedge structure, a continuation toward the $0.90- $1.05 region appears likely.

After weathering the post-FTX storm and market-wide downturns, the high-performance blockchain is now making headlines for all the right reasons. In the first half of 2025, Solana’s total value locked (TVL) has surged, doubling in just a few months and reaching levels not seen since its 2021 peak. But as excitement builds around the network’s upcoming Firedancer upgrade, the question arises: can Solana finally outpace Ethereum? This high-impact market outlook is brought to you by Outset PR —crypto’s top-tier storytelling engine, where strategic timing, deep market context, and data-backed PR execution combine to put game-changing projects in front of the right audience. Firedancer: Solana’s Scaling Trump Card Solana’s growth narrative is now closely tied to its anticipated Firedancer upgrade , a high-performance validator client developed by Jump Crypto. Scheduled to launch in late 2025, Firedancer is designed to dramatically increase network speed and reliability. Benchmarks suggest the client could enable Solana to handle up to 1 million transactions per second (TPS)—a staggering figure even in the realm of Web3. More importantly, Firedancer introduces client diversity, which makes the network more resilient to bugs, spam, or validator-level attacks. In other words, it could solve the performance bottlenecks that have historically plagued Solana during high-traffic periods. Solana vs. Ethereum: A New Chapter? While Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform with the most mature DeFi stack, it’s also grappling with congestion and high fees—even in its Layer-2 ecosystem. Solana, with its near-zero fees and ever-expanding developer activity, is positioning itself as the go-to chain for high-throughput applications, especially in gaming, DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure), and real-time financial tools. Yet, overtaking Ethereum is not just a matter of TPS or TVL. It’s about: Developer retention User onboarding Security track record Cross-chain liquidity Solana is making progress on these fronts, but Ethereum's first-mover advantage and robust Layer-2 ecosystem still give it the upper hand in many critical areas. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis and Prediction Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is showing signs of strengthening its position, with Total Value Locked (TVL) doubling in the first half of 2025 — a strong signal of growing ecosystem activity. While SOL recently traded between $119 and $152, its technical indicators suggest it's approaching a potential breakout point. A move above the $171 resistance could unlock a path toward $204, representing over 35% upside. The current consolidation may be a launchpad for the next leg higher as Solana positions itself as a serious contender to Ethereum. Ethereum (ETH): Still a Titan, But Eyes Are on Solana Source: tradingview Ethereum (ETH) remains a core pillar of the crypto market, trading steadily between $2,000 and $2,500. Although it’s currently consolidating below its recent highs, long-term fundamentals remain intact — especially with major L2 adoption and institutional interest. The $3,400 resistance level is still in sight, and if ETH finds support near $1,800, a rebound could offer a strong 40% upside. However, with Solana's ecosystem accelerating, ETH now faces stronger competition than ever. Whether Ethereum maintains dominance or shares it will depend on how both ecosystems evolve in this next cycle.

A Long-Term Price Prediction,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/could-near-protocol-near-and-render-achieve-new-aths-in-2025-a-long-term-price-prediction,"Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are eagerly speculating about the potential of NEAR Protocol and RENDER to reach unprecedented heights by 2025. This article delves into the factors fueling these ambitions, offering insights on why these digital assets could be poised for significant growth in the coming years. Stay tuned to discover which coins might be set for remarkable upward trends. NEAR Protocol: Short-term Recovery Amid Long-term Bearish Trends NEAR Protocol experienced a -22.24% decline over the past month and a -57.20% drop in the last six months. Price fluctuations ranged between $1.97 and $3.14, indicating significant volatility and a long-term downward trend. A modest weekly gain of 1.59% contrasts starkly with the deeper losses seen in earlier periods. The coin’s historical behavior suggests a market grappling with both uncertainty and cautious optimism, as investors seek signals of potential recovery amid a challenging environment. Current trading dynamics reveal key price levels with resistance at $3.85 and support at $1.51, while secondary resistance is around $5.02 and lower support at $0.344. Oscillator indicators display bearish pressure, highlighted by an Awesome Oscillator reading of -0.364 and a Momentum Indicator of -0.0495, alongside an RSI of 44.44. A potential trading strategy could focus on the support at $1.51 for possible rebounds, while monitoring resistance near $3.85. The market lacks a clear upward trend, indicating that caution is essential for both entry and exit strategies. Coin Price Volatility: Navigating Key Levels Amid Declines RENDER experienced a near 32% drop over one month and a 54% loss over the past six months. A weekly uptick of 1.16% contrasts with the overall downward trend, reflecting low investor confidence. Price performance shows a lack of stability, marked by volatility and recurring bearish pressure. The asset's history suggests that despite brief recoveries, the downward momentum persisted, underscoring the challenges faced during recent market cycles. Trading now centers around a price range between $3.17 and $5.05. Key levels include nearby support at $2.46 and resistance at $6.23, with additional boundaries at $0.58 and $8.11. Current indicators lean toward caution, as shown by a negative Awesome Oscillator at -0.733 and a subdued Momentum Indicator at -0.207, while the RSI holds at 42.01. This mix indicates that bears are in control, although some buying interest offers limited hope for a rebound. Trading ideas involve watching for a bounce from support at $2.46 or a pullback near resistance at $6.23. No clear trend is established, leading traders to monitor these levels closely. Conclusion Both NEAR Protoco l and RENDER show strong potential for achieving new all-time highs by 2025. NEAR aims to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs, making it an attractive option for developers. RENDER, with its focus on decentralized graphics rendering, is gaining attention in industries like gaming and virtual reality. If they continue to grow and innovate, significant price increases are likely within the next few years. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

XRP and Ethereum Traders Think TRON is Next,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoin-finance-offer-bitcoin-style-gains-xrp-and-ethereum-traders-think-tron-is-next/,"The cryptocurrency market thrives on finding the next asset capable of generating exponential returns. In 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention from analysts and early-stage investors who are beginning to draw parallels to Bitcoin’s early growth story. At the same time, seasoned XRP and Ethereum traders are expanding their focus toward TRON , which is quickly building momentum as a credible contender in this cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Phenomenon MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be one of the most prominent presales of the year , surpassing $10 million raised and selling out rapidly across multiple rounds. The project’s fixed supply, full HashEx audit, and transparent, community-first structure have separated it from typical meme tokens. By combining disciplined tokenomics with widespread viral appeal, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing both retail and institutional capital. Analysts are watching its trajectory closely, citing its early-stage positioning and organic demand as key drivers of long-term value potential. XRP: Seeking New Opportunities Amid Volatility Despite its strong foothold in the payments space, XRP continues to wrestle with regulatory challenges and unpredictable price movements. As a result, many XRP investors are exploring fresh opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its scarcity model and rapidly expanding interest, is emerging as a viable hedge for those seeking diversified exposure in this market cycle. Ethereum: Diversifying for High-Upside Growth While Ethereum remains central to smart contracts and Web3 innovation, its maturing growth profile is prompting ETH holders to look at earlier-stage assets. The integration of MAGACOIN FINANCE into Ethereum infrastructure—paired with its security credentials—is positioning the project as a natural diversification play for the ETH investor base. TRON, too, has begun to enter the radar as a high-utility asset with rising adoption. TRON: The Next Breakout Candidate TRON has entered 2025 with rising ecosystem strength, especially in stablecoin usage and blockchain infrastructure. With over 200 million users and consistent growth in USDT volume, TRON is now widely considered a candidate for significant price revaluation. Its growing list of partnerships and expanding product base have made it an appealing option for Ethereum and XRP traders searching for real-world traction and scalability. Conclusion With foundational momentum, a fully audited launch model, and rising adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being evaluated as a serious contender for those aiming to capture early-stage upside. Meanwhile, TRON continues to build a compelling case as the next utility-driven growth asset. As market cycles evolve, both are emerging as front-runners for investors focused on the future.

From shifting geopolitical tensions to a major regulatory pivot in the United States (US), multiple macroeconomic factors appear to be setting the stage for Bitcoin’s next explosive move. Ceasefire And Rate Cut Buzz Fuel Bitcoin Price Optimism Over the weekend, the Bitcoin price briefly slipped, triggering over $200 million in leveraged long liquidations. However, this dip proved short-lived as the flagship cryptocurrency rebounded swiftly above $100,000 following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a total ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This sudden de-escalation helped ease global market anxiety, pushing Bitcoin past $106,000 and oil prices sharply down from $77 to under $70. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why This Bitcoin Bull Market Feels Different As Crypto Enters ‘New Era’ Simultaneously, Optimism is building that the US Federal Reserve (FED) could begin cutting interest rates sooner than expected. Sharing new data by CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, crypto analyst CW disclosed that the odds of a FED rate cut have increased to 18.6% by July 30 during the scheduled FOMC meeting. The report reveals that 81.4% of market participants believe the FED to keep rates unchanged at their current level. However, FedWatch’s data indicates growing expectations for a rate cut by the September FOMC meeting, with 79% betting on a reduction and only 21.3% anticipating no change. Notably, lower interest rates generally benefit risk assets like Bitcoin by increasing liquidity and boosting investor sentiment. With geopolitical tensions easing and a possibly looser monetary policy on the horizon, Bitcoin could gain further momentum, potentially climbing to $110,000. Supporting this bullish forecast, crypto analyst Justin Bennett suggests that Bitcoin is gearing up for a rally toward a new ATH of $110,000 following its recent reclaim of the key $103,500 level. Although a retracement to around $102,500 remains possible, Bennett believes that once BTC cleans up support around $103,400, formed during Monday’s expansion, the next move could be parabolic. Regulatory Win Solidify Bitcoin’s Position In TradFi Beyond anticipated rate cuts and ceasefire announcements, the US FED recently made a landmark policy shift that could have profound long-term implications for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. By removing “reputational risk” as a factor in evaluating crypto firms’ access to bank servicing, the FED is effectively ending a key pillar of Operation Checkpoint 2.0—a campaign that restricted over 30 crypto and fintech companies from traditional financial infrastructure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Deviates From Global M2 Money Supply, Is The Bull Run Over? This recent change clears the way for greater institutional involvement in crypto. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have also followed suit, green-lighting crypto activities for banks and allowing them to participate in the digital assets market without prior approval. Together, these moves mark a regulatory pivot that not only legitimizes the crypto industry but could also accelerate demand and capital inflows into Bitcoin, potentially boosting its already significant valuation.

Now, Beijing is escalating its measures to request lists and even passports of technical employees with sensitive knowledge. While China’s rare earth industry was in its nascent stage, the country benefited from foreign experts who trained their workers in the latest technologies. But now, many years down the line, China is tightly shutting its doors and keeping a lid on its technology and knowledge, away from foreign interests. Beijing asks for a list of technical staff China is ramping up its efforts to tighten its grip on the rare earths industry by ordering companies to submit detailed lists of their employees with specialized knowledge. In some cases, the government is requiring these employees to surrender their passports. China’s Ministry of Commerce recently instructed rare earth companies to provide comprehensive data on employees with technical expertise. The information requested includes the employees’ areas of specialization, educational backgrounds, research experience, and other personal details. This measure aims to create a national registry of individuals with rare-earth knowledge to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets to foreign entities. The government’s inquiry applies to all personnel involved in processing the raw minerals and the professionals who work on converting the rare earths into high-performance magnets. These magnets are vital components in electric vehicles, drones, wind turbines, and advanced weapons systems. Some employees have already been told to hand over their passports to their companies or local authorities, according to people familiar with the situation. This move is similar to the existing rules for government officials and workers at state-owned enterprises, who must apply for approval before traveling abroad. Recently, at the World Economic Forum’s “Summer Davos” in Tianjin, Premier Li Qiang publicly condemned the weaponization of trade and urged countries to collaborate rather than compete through coercive economic tools. However, those principles seem not to apply when it comes to the rare earth industry. China currently dominates the global rare earths market, producing roughly 90% of the world’s rare-earth magnets, used in high-tech and defense applications worldwide. Global trade tensions Months ago, China rolled out a new licensing system for rare earth and rare-earth magnet exports, which has so far disrupted global supply chains and raised concerns among Western manufacturers. Some companies in the U.S. and Europe, heavily reliant on Chinese exports, have already reported slowdowns and temporary shutdowns due to difficulties in sourcing materials. For years, China’s rare earth dominance stemmed in part from its ability to undercut international competitors on cost. However, due to mounting geopolitical concerns, the country seems to be adjusting its approach to focus on long-term technological advantage over short-term trade volume. Processing rare earths is technically complex, as it involves the separation of chemically similar elements from raw ore. Chinese scientists have developed advanced, proprietary methods to achieve this, and so it’s understandably protected. The focus on personnel with privileged information is due to concerns in Beijing over foreign espionage and economic sabotage. Last September, China’s Ministry of State Security announced that a Chinese citizen had been sentenced to 11 years in prison for selling information about the country’s rare-earth stockpiles to unnamed foreign interests. The ministry said foreign organizations “use every means to obtain our internal data,” and warned that such leaks could “put China at a disadvantage in international strategic competition.” The concerns aren’t unwarranted as China’s dominance in the sector has become a problem for Western governments who are seeking to reduce their reliance on Chinese supply chains. The U.S., EU, Australia, and others have launched initiatives to revive domestic rare-earth production, but progress has been slow. One of the key obstacles remains the lack of technical expertise outside China, which seems to be precisely the gap Beijing is determined to keep wide.

As Ethereum continues to dominate the DeFi space, this update could signal Ripple’s most serious attempt yet to challenge ETH’s infrastructure lead. With market watchers eyeing XRP’s price action and developers exploring new on-chain tools, the DeFi landscape may be entering a more competitive era. This forward-looking analysis is brought to you by Outset PR , a crypto PR agency that helps Web3 innovators turn major updates into market-moving narratives that earn attention when it matters most. XRPL 2.5.0 Ignites Hope as Stablecoin Support Opens New DeFi Horizons Source: tradingview XRP is entering a pivotal phase as the XRPL 2.5.0 upgrade introduces native stablecoin support — a major milestone in Ripple’s push to build a competitive DeFi ecosystem. Price action remains resilient between $1.84 and $2.27, with strong support at $1.66 and a solid chance to test the $2.52 resistance. The neutral RSI (51.10) and MACD uptick suggest momentum could tilt bullish. If XRP breaks out, a rally toward $2.95 is in play — over 20% upside from current levels. With new DeFi tools now possible on XRPL, Ripple may finally begin closing the gap with Ethereum’s DeFi dominance. Ethereum (ETH): DeFi Leader Maintains Core Strength Amid Market Pause Source: tradingview Ethereum continues to lead the DeFi sector, even as it trades in a range between $2,000 and $2,500. While price consolidation has cooled momentum, Ethereum's foundational role in DeFi, NFTs, and institutional Web3 adoption remains unshaken. A rebound from key support near $1,800 could trigger a move toward the $3,400 resistance — a potential 40% gain. Despite competition from new entrants like XRPL, Ethereum’s established developer base and scaling solutions provide strong long-term footing as the ecosystem prepares for the next growth phase.

The upcoming remittance service will let users send U.S. dollars and select stablecoins to recipients abroad with ""well-known"" blockchain networks processing the transactions, allowing funds to be sent around the clock, converted into local currencies and deposited quickly into recipients' accounts, according to the press release . The company says this will be significantly cheaper and faster than traditional methods such as wire transfers or bank-based remittances. The firm will also relaunch crypto trading services, letting users buy, sell and hold major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin BTC and Ethereum's ether ETH later this year. Future services could include staking, borrowing against crypto holdings and providing blockchain tech infrastructure to third-parties through SoFi’s Galileo platform, the firm said. The moves come as CEO Anthony Noto shared plans earlier this year to re-enter the crypto business after the firm suspended digital asset-related services in 2023 in order to obtain banking license under the previous administration's harsher regulatory environment towards crypto. The change is backed by recent guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that allows nationally chartered banks to offer crypto custody and stablecoin-related services. ""The future of financial services is being completely reinvented through innovations in crypto, digital assets, and blockchain more broadly,"" said Noto in a statment. ""We’re accelerating our efforts to give members more choice and more control, whether they’re investing, sending money across borders, or planning for their future.""

Following a significant U.S. military strike aiming at Iranian nuclear facilities—including prominent sites in Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz—the geopolitical temperature increased dramatically. Dubbed “Midnight Hammer,” the operation consisted of a coordinated effort involving more than 125 aircraft, including advanced B-2 stealth bombers fitted with the powerful GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, sometimes known as “bunker-busters.” Furthermore greatly important in disabling Iran’s underground nuclear enrichment capacity were submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles provided by defense behemoth Raytheon Technologies (RTX). Iran’s response was quick but measured, meant to show determination without encouraging an uncontrollably spiraling effect. Iran started missile strikes on a strategically important U.S. base in Qatar within hours of the American strikes. Though the damage was supposedly limited, one cannot undervalue Iran’s symbolic relevance in being ready to exact di rect attack on American forces. Analysts saw this calculated but subdued reaction as Tehran’s attempt to signal their readiness to aggressively defend national sovereignty while avoiding encouraging a major escalation from Washington. Defense Stocks Surge, Markets Hold Breath The response of the market was noteworthy but conflicted. Driven by growing expectations of higher military expenditure and global security needs, defense sector stocks surged especially. Among the quick winners were Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and RTX. Inspired by investor confidence in ongoing defense expenditure, especially in advanced military technologies like stealth aircraft and precision-guided missiles, Lockheed Martin stock surged by almost 0.6%. The main builder of many advanced defense technologies including stealth platforms and missile systems, Northrop Grumman saw an almost 0.8% rise in stock price. RTX also profited from this environment since its cruise missiles became the main focus of military efficacy in the latest conflict. Broader stock market indices surprisingly demonstrated resilience and even optimism amid escalating tensions. The S&P 500 advanced around 0.7%, driven by robust performance across technology and financial sectors, suggesting investor confidence in the overall stability of the economic recovery. The Nasdaq Composite, heavily weighted with tech stocks, advanced roughly 0.8%, indicating continued enthusiasm for innovation and growth-focused companies. Initially, commodity markets reacted sharply, particularly in oil trading, where prices temporarily spiked due to concerns about potential supply disruptions from the Strait of Hormuz. However, as Iran’s retaliation seemed measured and strategic rather than aggressive, fears quickly receded, and oil prices stabilized. Surprisingly resilient and even optimistic among rising tensions were broader stock market indices. Driven by strong performance across the financial and technology sectors, the S&P 500 advanced about 0.7%, indicating investor confidence in the general stability of the economic recovery. Highly weighted with tech stocks, the Nasdaq Composite advanced roughly 0.8%, suggesting ongoing innovation and growth-oriented company excitement. At first, commodity markets responded sharply, especially in the oil trade where prices momentarily surged in response to worries about possible supply interruptions from the Strait of Hormuz. But as Iran’s reprisals appeared calculated and strategic rather than forceful, worries soon subsided and oil prices settled. Strategists and financial analysts—most notably Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel—have expressed wary optimism. If the escalation does not get more intense, Siegel says the market might soon reach new highs. Particularly the NATO conference held in The Hague, investors are closely observing forthcoming events. President Trump has thus revived demands for NATO members to significantly raise their defense expenditure, suggesting a major boost to 5% of GDP for every member state. Generally speaking, NATO members have embraced this idea; Spain is the only vocal dissenter. The geopolitical dynamics are still erratic, and both analysts and market players are closely following changes. Rising defense budgets combined with geopolitical uncertainty usually translate well for the defense industry, offering strong development prospects in an otherwise wary market. The New Hope of cryptocurrencies—inside ground-breaking Neo Pepe Presale Against conventional market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty, a new investment story surfaces: cryptocurrencies. Digital assets may provide comfort to investors looking for substitutes; especially interesting right now is Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP), generally agreed upon as the best pepe coin now available. While conventional investors struggle with geopolitical uncertainty, bitcoin markets present an interesting counterpoint. Already praised by crypto analysts as one of the best pepe coins available, Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) is becoming rather popular in its strategic 16-stage presale. Neo Pepe is not only another meme coin; it’s also pioneering a special mix of meme-driven attractiveness with strong distributed governance and financial infrastructure. Prominent crypto personalities like BitBoy Crypto have appreciated Neo Pepe’s sophisticated presale structure and called it maybe the best crypto presale of 2025. Early involvement is rewarded gradually as token prices rise little by bit through every presale level. Neo Pepe is currently aiming for stage 4; already, token prices of about $0.07 raise more than $2 million. 6 Key distinguishing features attracting savvy crypto investors to Neo Pepe include: Decentralized Authority: Driven by the strong NEOPGovernor smart contract system, which provides holders actual control over other important decisions, exchange listings, and treasury management. Auto-Liquidity Mechanism: Every transaction results in a 2.5% liquidity fee automatically paid to Uniswap, so reinforcing permanent liquidity and market stability. Token Burn and Deflationary Model: Strategic token burning limited at 5% of the total supply helps to maintain scarcity and increase long-term value appreciation. Transparent Presale Structure: Clear, progressive pricing schemes provide participants consistent and appealing investment terms, so encouraging early adoption. Hourly Token Unlocking Post-launch: Gradual unlocking increases investor confidence by reducing market volatility concerns. Community-Driven Decisions: Active participation in governance whereby community votes guide major protocol actions and exchange listings. Presenting informed crypto enthusiasts with a convincing picture of why this innovative memecoin deserves major attention among the busy industry, Crypto Goat deftly and precisely analyzes the Neo Pepe Presale, highlighting its meticulously crafted multi-tier pricing model, advanced auto-liquidity mechanisms, and compelling decentralization of its governance. Considering alternative investments among geopolitical market jitters, you might want to get a little Neo Pepe given these attractive qualities . The continuous presale gives investors not only a defense against conventional market swings but also involvement in a truly distributed, community-driven project. Neo Pepe Coin could soon find its way onto top centralized exchanges, so confirming its position as one of the most promising cryptocurrencies since listings on major distributed exchanges like Uniswap al ready in tegrated into their mechanisms. Investors tracking defense stocks in response to geopolitical events might also find a parallel opportunity in the crypto markets. In the uncertain investment scene of today, Neo Pepe Coin stands out especially with its clear road map and increasing acceptance.

What exactly do institutional players like 3iQ have access to that retail investors don’t, and why does it matter? Inside the 3iQ XRP ETF Launch On June 18, 2025, 3iQ, a leading Canadian digital asset manager, launched its XRP ETF (trading under the tickers XRPQ and XRPQ.U) on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The fund offers direct exposure to XRP, with a six-month waiver on management fees and all assets held in institutional-grade cold storage. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has backed the ETF as an early supporter. BREAKING: 3iQ CEO drops a bombshell “No retail investor could ever buy #XRP at the price we’re getting it globally.” What do they know that we don’t? #Ripple #Crypto #XRPHolders pic.twitter.com/uGtZDyONrp — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 25, 2025 Within just days, XRPQ made headlines by becoming the largest XRP ETF in Canada, surpassing C$32 million in assets under management. The ETF is seen as a significant milestone for regulated XRP investment products and is part of a broader movement in Canada toward institutional crypto adoption. The Pricing Advantage: What the CEO Meant Pascal St-Jean’s comment about institutional pricing has sparked intense speculation. But for those familiar with institutional trading, his point is straightforward: 3iQ acquires XRP through over-the-counter (OTC) channels and bulk purchase agreements that offer significantly better rates than what retail investors receive on centralized exchanges. These deals often involve tighter bid-ask spreads, no slippage, lower transaction costs, and access to large pools of liquidity. Institutions like 3iQ also benefit from specialized custody solutions and settlement terms that retail platforms cannot match. As a result, the cost basis for XRP acquired through these institutional channels is often substantially lower than what individual investors would encounter. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional vs. Retail Markets: A Growing Divide This pricing gap illustrates a larger truth about the digital asset space: institutional investors are increasingly playing by a different set of rules. With access to regulated vehicles, professional custody infrastructure, and preferential pricing, firms like 3iQ can maximize exposure while minimizing cost and risk. Retail investors, by contrast, are typically confined to public exchanges where spreads are wider, fees are higher, and execution is slower. St-Jean’s statement, while blunt, exposes a critical market reality: the tools available to institutional investors can significantly alter their return potential. Implications for the XRP Ecosystem St-Jean’s comment arrives at a pivotal moment. Canada is rapidly emerging as a global leader in regulated crypto ETFs, while the U.S. remains locked in regulatory uncertainty. With products like XRPQ gaining traction, the institutionalization of XRP could accelerate, further widening the gap between retail and institutional market access. Fo r retail investors, the message is clear: the playing field isn’t level. And as institutional interest in XRP continues to grow, the influence of behind-the-scenes pricing power will become an increasingly important factor in the asset’s broader market dynamics.

Shares in COIN soared from June’s low of $235 to a high of $369 as the platform gained a license to operate in Europe and as the US Senate approved legislation to regulate stablecoins. Coinbase announced it has secured a Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) license from the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), which permits the platform to “offer our full suite of crypto products to all 27 EU member states.” With the license, Coinbase will establish “its European crypto hub” in Luxembourg.

Various operations with the digital version of the national fiat will be introduced in stages, the monetary authority said, asking Russian lawmakers to approve the updated timetable. Bank of Russia pitches new dates for digital ruble launch Russia’s monetary authority has set dates for the gradual implementation of its central bank digital currency (CBDC) in a proposal to the State Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament, asking its members to make the necessary legislative amendments. Transfers and payments using the digital incarnation of the Russian legal tender will be introduced in stages, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) announced on Wednesday. According to the plan, Russia’s largest banks will begin processing digital ruble transactions for their clients from Sept. 1, 2026, the Russian crypto news outlet Bits.media reported, quoting the press release. Starting the same day, trading companies with annual revenues exceeding 120 million rubles (approx. $1.5 million), serviced by these banks, will have to provide customers with the option to pay with digital rubles. Smaller banks and retailers with an annual revenue of over 30 million rubles (around $380,000) will have another year to prepare their systems. They should be ready to accept the digital national currency by Sept. 1, 2027. The deadline for all other banks and businesses is Sept. 1, 2028. The central bank has made an exception for merchants with annual revenues of less than 5 million rubles (about $64,000) for which the requirements and deadlines do not apply. Russians to make digital ruble transfers with QR codes Russian citizens will be able to send digital money using a QR code generated by the country’s Faster Payments System (SBP). The CBR noted the solution is already available in the SBP and is free of charge. The timeframe for banks and companies to introduce the QR code system across platforms is yet to be determined by the regulator. Banking institutions will have until September, next year, to ensure technical support for the QR codes which allow instant transfers using only a mobile phone number. Putin presses for widespread adoption of the digital ruble The Bank of Russia started developing its CBDC in 2021, and the legislation laying the ground for its introduction came into force in the summer of 2023. The digital ruble is intended as the third form of the national fiat, after cash and electronic bank money. Initially, financial authorities and institutions were supposed to put it into circulation by July 1 this year. However, Governor Elvira Nabiullina and other CBR officials have made it clear this will happen later than planned to give banks more time to prepare their infrastructure. Some reports suggested the launch has been postponed by a year, while others mentioned Jan. 1, 2026. Russian President Vladimir Putin helped end the uncertainty by recently urging the central bank to step up efforts to implement the digital currency. Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum last week, he reminded that the digital ruble pilot has been going on for almost two years. Putin insisted that all the main operations have been worked out, including opening and closing accounts, transfers between individuals and legal entities, as well as payments for goods and services, and stated: “Now the task is to make the use of the digital ruble widespread, among citizens, enterprises, and banks. I ask the central bank and the government to speed up the necessary procedures and determine the timing of the transition to a new stage of technological development of our financial sector.” The new dates for “mass introduction of the digital ruble” have been already agreed with market participants and interested government bodies, representatives of the monetary have since assured, according to Russian media.

Unlike most altcoins caught in the downturn, this new coin continues to attract investors eyeing what crypto to buy now, thanks to its secured presale traction. Bitcoin Slides Below $103K as Market Sentiment Turns Risk-Off At the time of publication, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at around $102,200, decreasing more than 4.67% in the previous 24 hours as traders respond to renewed geopolitical uncertainty and risk-off attitudes in world markets. The newest drawback reported over $460 million wiped, and it is long positions that sustained the majority of liquidations. The technical indicators indicate the BTC is experiencing difficulties in maintaining the support of 103K, and indicators of momentum favor further bearish positions until a bullish volume reversal is observed. Although the general crypto market is also facing this correction, there are some smaller altcoins that found it possible to rise against the stream, including the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that has increased in value during the correction period. Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 5 Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some serious traction as it reaches Stage 5 of its presale. With more than 12,400 early adopters and more than $11.1 million raised, it’s clear to see this isn’t a flash in the pan wave of sentiment, Mutuum Finance is taking big steps as a key player in the DeFi. Whereas tokens are founded on ephemeral mania for the most part, Mutuum is founded on usability and sustained scalability with sound fundamentals backing it. Phase 5 investors will be rewarded with up to 2x ROI, when the token launch price of $0.06 is hit. Stable, Audited, and Future-Proof: A USD-Pegged Token on Ethereum In its strategic efforts to deepen its DeFi platform, Mutuum Finance is launching a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Unlike highly volatile algorithmic stablecoins, this token is crafted to hold its value even in extreme market fluctuations, earning it a solid store of value and medium of exchange. Security and integrity are central to the project. The Mutuum Finance platform was audited completely by CertiK, one of the most established blockchain security firms. This audit again testifies to the platform’s commitment to transparency, reliability, and long-term sustainability. Early Investors Reward as Community Grows To celebrate the presale action and express gratitude to early adopters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway . Ten of these winners will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens for being one of the early backers of the project. While the community expands rapidly, the early supporters are being rewarded, not only with the possibility of future upside, but with concrete, real-time rewards. While Bitcoin tumbles below $103K and top altcoins bleed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is breaking away from the pack. Defying the market correction, the project has surged 200% from its starting price, with Phase 5 tokens now selling at $0.03 and already over 45% sold out. More than 12,400 investors have contributed upwards of $11.1 million, betting on MUTM’s strong fundamentals, dual lending innovation, and fully audited infrastructure. Buyers in this stage could see 2x gains at launch, and potentially much more if current momentum holds. The next price jump is near, now is the time to act.

According to a research session hosted by Input Output Global (IOG), the platform is expanding its focus to develop a strong set of Layer-2 (L2) solutions. These improvements aim to boost the network’s speed, privacy, and composability. Cardano to Expand Beyond Hydra During the discussion, Cardano developers provided a comprehensive update on Hydra’s evolving role in Cardano’s strategy. Meanwhile, Cardano’s long-term plan focuses on offering different Layer-2 technologies that can work together. These Layer 2 solutions will support various uses, like decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, business, and identity solutions. Cardano will create a flexible system where different L2s can work together smoothly. This way, several applications can choose the best solution for their needs. The panelists noted that having one main Layer-2 option could slow innovation and reduce flexibility. They argued that having several Layer-2 options work together allows developers to try new approaches, while users enjoy faster, cheaper, and safer interactions. What’s New for Cardano Users? Two months ago, it was announced that Cardano users can store, send, and receive XRP using the Lace Wallet, a feature-packed native wallet for Cardano. It is worth noting that Cardano is working on improving its tools for users by enabling them to use multiple blockchains. As reported by TheCoinRise, the Input Output Global (IOG) team also intends to integrate XRP features into Lace Wallet. This will enable XRP holders to store their assets safely on Lace and make transactions without relying on other apps. Recall that the Cardano Foundation also created Veridian to allow people and businesses to control their online identities. Veridian adds an extra layer of security to Cardano’s blockchain, helping to make Cardano a top choice for secure digital securities. Alongside the platform, the foundation also launched the Veridian Wallet, which will assist users in managing their credentials, private keys, and digital identifiers. Charles Hoskinson Highlights Ethereum Mistake Meanwhile, a recent report states that the Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson, believes Ethereum has serious issues due to three main mistakes. First, he mentioned that Ethereum relies too much on Layer 2 scaling solutions. He criticizes this dependence on outside systems, calling them “parasitic.” Hoskinson also highlighted Ethereum’s governance system as a significant weakness. The third and most important criticism is Ethereum’s protocol and consensus model. He pointed out that even after switching to Proof-of-Stake, Ethereum still works inefficiently. Cardano’s boss believes Ethereum lacks the resilience and sustainability needed for long-term success.

In 2025 , seasoned Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP investors are rallying behind MAGACOIN FINANCE , drawn by its momentum, structure, and early positioning. Simultaneously, Cardano’s expanding utility and real-world partnerships are keeping it in focus as a balanced investment option for those seeking both performance and stability. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale That’s Captivating Smart Money MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the standout presales of the year, securing over $10 million while selling out multiple rounds in record time. Its 170 billion capped supply , full HashEx audit , and 100% community-owned model are redefining standards for transparency and scarcity. What differentiates it from typical projects is its structured rollout, staking rewards, and lack of VC involvement—qualities increasingly valued by retail and institutional investors alike. This growing wave of adoption is pulling in capital from across major coin ecosystems as the listing window tightens. Bitcoin: Profits Fueling the Next Generation With Bitcoin holding above $105,000 , it remains a foundational store of value. Yet, as upside moderates, BTC whales are rotating profits into earlier-stage assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE , aiming to replicate the kind of returns that once defined Bitcoin itself. This capital rotation is infusing fresh energy into projects that offer structural advantages and emerging traction. XRP: Seeking Clarity and New Opportunities Though XRP continues to lead in global payments, its price movement is weighed down by legal uncertainties and consolidation zones. This has pushed many investors to explore projects offering clearer governance and momentum. The appeal of MAGACOIN FINANCE lies in its clean mechanics, decentralized model, and growing wallet activity—providing a compelling option for investors eager to realign their portfolios. Cardano: The Ecosystem Anchor Cardano continues to build on its vision of cross-chain interoperability. With recent announcements by Charles Hoskinson about XRP integrations , airdrops like Glacier , and expanded support via the Lace wallet , Cardano is gaining recognition as a hub for multi-chain activity. Its emphasis on slow, deliberate development appeals to those seeking long-term value—making it a steady counterpart to the rapid acceleration of MAGACOIN FINANCE . Conclusion Bitcoin and XRP investors are aligning with MAGACOIN FINANCE as it gains ground with strong fundamentals, transparent governance, and viral adoption. Meanwhile, Cardano’s ecosystem growth ensures it remains a reliable pillar for stability and future interoperability. Together, these assets represent a forward-looking strategy for navigating 2025’s evolving crypto landscape.

The Federal Reserve says former Bank of Hawaii employee Alohi Kaupu-Grace, 23, stole from customer accounts and falsified the customers’ signatures on cash withdrawal slips and cashier’s check purchase slips. Kaupu-Grace paid $5,200 in partial restitution to the bank and was fired in March. The Hawaii resident consented to an order from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors banning her from working for any of the Fed’s insured depository institutions. The ban will stay in place indefinitely unless the Board of Governors rescinds it, and the order doesn’t prohibit any other Federal or state agency or department from taking action against Kaupu-Grace. In May, Hawaii Island police arrested Kaupu-Grace for allegedly using someone else’s credit card. A victim contacted police after receiving a text from his credit card company about a fraudulent charge made to his account. The police say they tracked the credit card usage back to Kaupu-Grace, who allegedly secured the victim’s confidential information while working at Bank of Hawaii. She was charged with second-degree theft, second-degree identity theft, unauthorized possession of personal confidential information and fraudulent use of a credit card.

Yet, Tron’s steady growth might soon meet a serious challenger. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a blockchain-AI hybrid that’s rapidly building momentum. With $2 million raised , over 165 million tokens sold , and robust audit-backed infrastructure , Ruvi AI is aiming for a $1 token value sooner rather than later. Analysts predict that its unique focus on utility, transparency, and innovation could see Ruvi AI outpace Tron in the near future. Why Analysts Think Ruvi AI Could Surpass Tron While Tron’s ecosystem is largely driven by blockchain-based content and decentralized applications, Ruvi AI focuses on solving specific industry challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance using artificial intelligence. This utility-first strategy ensures that RUVI tokens remain valuable for real-world applications, creating constant demand as opposed to being driven primarily by speculation. Ruvi AI also stands out for its structured growth model. During Phase 2 of its presale, RUVI tokens are priced at just $0.015 each , offering early investors an immediate opportunity at a competitive entry point. By the end of the presale, tokens are guaranteed to increase to $0.07 , representing an almost 5x return even before public trading begins. Projections of a $1 valuation post-listing make this an extraordinary investment opportunity, translating to an impressive 66x ROI for presale participants. Ruvi AI’s Early Milestones Signal Strong Potential Ruvi AI is already proving to be a high-performance project, especially during its presale phase. Here’s an overview of its achievements to date: $2 million raised , a clear indication of strong investor confidence. More than 165 million tokens sold , showcasing significant market demand. A growing community of over 1,600 holders , reflecting the project’s increasing acceptance. Crucially, Ruvi AI’s guaranteed price floor of $0.07 post-presale is a game-changer, offering safeguards for cautious investors who may otherwise hesitate with new crypto projects. Unlock Maximum Value with Ruvi AI’s VIP Investment Tiers One standout feature of Ruvi AI is its VIP investment tiers. These tiers reward early backers with generous bonuses, maximizing returns for contributors while supporting the project’s expansion. VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These investment options cater to different budgets while offering unparalleled potential for early adopters to maximize returns. Transparency and Security Bolster Investor Confidence One of Ruvi AI’s strengths lies in its focus on security and transparency. Unlike many speculative crypto projects, Ruvi AI has undergone a third-party audit by CyberScope, which confirmed its infrastructure is both secure and trustworthy. Additionally, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange, guaranteeing post-presale liquidity. This ensures seamless token availability for trading as soon as the presale concludes, eliminating concerns about access or usability for investors. Real-World Applications Drive Ruvi AI’s Demand Ruvi AI’s impact extends beyond crypto hype by addressing real-world challenges across various industries. Here are some examples of how Ruvi AI is making a significant difference: Marketing: AI-powered tools help businesses optimize ad targeting, enhance campaigns, and improve ROI. Entertainment: Content creators leverage Ruvi AI solutions for blockchain-backed payments and AI-driven recommendations to boost revenue and engagement. Finance: Institutions use Ruvi AI’s tools for fraud detection, scalable transaction solutions, and improved operational transparency. These practical applications ensure Ruvi AI remains a long-term contender with consistent demand for its tokens. Can Ruvi AI Outpace Tron? Ruvi AI is positioning itself as a serious rival to Tron with its utility-driven model , structured growth , and investor-first strategies. Starting at a presale price of $0.015 , Ruvi AI’s pathway to a $1 valuation is clear, offering exponential returns for those who get in early. With $2 million raised , more than 165 million tokens sold , and industry-leading security through CyberScope and WEEX Exchange , Ruvi AI is already making an indelible mark. For investors searching for the next big crypto opportunity, Ruvi AI has all the momentum to not only compete with Tron but potentially surpass it.

Momentum is not yet overbought, which leaves some space for movement. The 50-day moving average - previously used as resistance for the February pullback - is now acting as support, strengthening the current technical outlook. By Elior Manier The world’s leading cryptocurrency has demonstrated notable resilience in a week marked by geopolitical tensions and choppy risk sentiment . While traditional risk assets experienced volatile swings—gapping both higher and lower as headlines on the Israel-Iran conflict evolved—Bitcoin held its ground. A key signal of market resilience often comes at moments of maximum fear, when price action resists breaking key levels despite worsening headlines. That was precisely the case for Bitcoin. After peaking at a new all-time high of $112,030 in May, BTC pulled back, retesting the psychological $100,000 level. During the weekend escalation - when the US launched strikes on Iranian nuclear infrastructure - Bitcoin briefly dipped below this threshold, touching $99,000. Yet, despite the prevailing pessimism, sellers failed to hold below the $100,000 mark. This failed breakdown was followed by a decisive rebound, as markets began shifting away from war-driven fear. Bitcoin has since reclaimed the upper end of its recent range, indicating renewed bullish momentum. Let’s dive into the charts—from the weekly to the intraday timeframes—to better understand the current technical setup and what's the market picture for the leading crypto. Bitcoin Weekly Chart – Prior indecision met with a sharp response Bitcoin Weekly Chart, June 25, 2025 – Source: TradingView The previous weekly candles formed long-wicked doji patterns, signaling indecision and hesitation near all-time highs. This week, however, has kicked off on a more constructive note. From a candlestick perspective, a weekly close near the highs—especially with a breakout above the recent range—would confirm renewed bullish momentum . Until then, strength is cautiously maintained. That said, weekly momentum indicators remain in overbought territory, increasing the likelihood of consolidation—an outcome already visible on the lower timeframes. Bitcoin Daily Chart – Bullish sentiment supported by Daily 50-MA Bitcoin Daily Chart, June 25, 2025 – Source: TradingView Bitcoin is printing its third consecutive bullish daily candle, reinforcing the prevailing risk-on sentiment across markets. The 50-day moving average—previously used as resistance for the February pullback—is now acting as support, strengthening the current technical outlook. Meanwhile, RSI momentum remains near neutral but has shown a clear reluctance to drift into oversold territory. This suggests buyers continue to defend the $100,000 level effectively. A deeper correction below this threshold appears unlikely unless a new and unexpected bearish catalyst emerges for the crypto space. Bitcoin 4H Chart – Breaking out of the War Descending Channel Bitcoin 4H Chart, June 25, 2025 – Source: TradingView On this intraday timeframe, we get a better view of the prevailing consolidation that is taking Bitcoin to test its highs. Prices had been forming a descending channel as sentiment started to worsen; however, sellers could not maintain the bearish momentum. A rebound on the daily main support led to a breakout of the channel, with buyers now pushing above the pivot in confluence with the 200-period 4H moving average, which only caught up to the uptrend. Momentum is not yet overbought, which leaves some space for movement. One test for buyer strength will be breaching the 110,000 key mark – a failure to break and hold above this level points to higher chances of maintaining within the 100,000 to 110,000 range. Key levels to hold on your intraday charts: 99,000 to 100,000 Main Support 102,000 to 103,000 intermediate support 106,000 Pivot Zone & 4H MA 200 (immediate support) 112,000 Key ATH Resistance 109,000 to 110,000 Intermediate Resistance 115,000 - 117,000 Potential Resistance (Fibonacci Extension of past move) Safe Trades!

Do Kwon is facing criminal charges in US federal court, and the judge’s comments suggest that the legislation could alter the trajectory of the trial. According to reports , Kwon’s lawyers and prosecutors met for a status conference before Judge Paul Engelmayer in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The judge said he was “mindful of the GENIUS Act.” The GENIUS Act, which stands for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, was passed by the US Senate on June 17. However, it still faces a possible vote in the House of Representatives before US President Donald Trump decides to sign the bill into law. The legislation, targeting regulations for payment stablecoins, could affect Kwon’s charges related to the TerraUSD (USDT) algorithmic stablecoin and the platform’s LUNA token. The GENIUS Act could be law at the same time as Do Kwon’s trial The Senate has passed the GENIUS Act and is now being held by the House of Representatives. The bill’s companion, the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy, or STABLE Act, is also moving through the House as both chambers consider legislation for digital asset market structure. When both houses agree on the same text, it is sent to President Trump to be signed. The president has 10 days to sign it into law, excluding Sundays. If he doesn’t, it will become law without his or her name. Once the law is passed, agencies like the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the CFTC, and others have 180 days to develop final rules covering oversight, reserve requirements, audits, licensing, disclosures, and how to implement the law. Therefore, the GENIUS Act timeline is expected to be: House vote by late July, Conference committee if needed late July or early August, final congressional approval by mid-August, presidential signature by late August, and rule-making approximately Feb 2026. This could also come earlier, before Do Kwon’s trial. Do Kwon’s TerraUSD Stablecoin collapse Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs, appeared in a US court on Jan. 2, 2025. He pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, which led to a loss of $40 billion. The charges relate to the downfall of TerraUSD (USDT), an algorithmic stablecoin, and its linked cryptocurrency, LUNA, which crashed in May 2022. The US prosecutors say that Kwon lied to investors about how stable and useful the Terra blockchain and its products, such as UST, were. According to them, Kwon’s acts were part of a plan to trick investors into thinking Terra was a real, working decentralized financial system. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also sued Kwon and Terraform Labs for fraud in a civil case. In June 2024, a $4.47 billion deal was reached. Terraform Labs has since filed for bankruptcy. However, when the UST stablecoin failed, Terra’s ecosystem fell apart, causing investors to lose a lot of money. The collapse played a major role in the broader crypto market downturn, also contributing to the collapse of FTX. At first, Kwon fought extradition because he wanted to be sent to South Korea, where penalties for financial crimes are usually less harsh. After considering how serious the charges were and what part the U.S. would play in his case, the Montenegrin government decided to send him back to the US On December 31, 2024, he was sent to the United States for custody. The trial is set for February 2026.

Pulte noted in an X post that the decision was based on an intense review and the desire to observe President Donald Trump’s bid to facilitate the mainstream adoption of digital assets in the United States. “FHFA hereby directs each enterprise to prepare a proposal for consideration of cryptocurrency as an asset for reserves in their respective single-family mortgage loan risk assessment, without conversion of said cryptocurrency to U.S. dollar,” the order noted . According to the order, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should only consider crypto assets that are traded and stored in U.S.-regulated centralized exchanges led by Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN) and Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD). Market Impact of the FHFA Orders on Crypto Assets The FHFA orders on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider crypto assets in their risk assessments for single-family loans has attracted significant attention in the web3 space. According to Michael Saylor, co-founder and chairman at Strategy, the move by FHFA is a defining moment for institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been recognized as a reserve asset by the U.S. housing system — a defining moment for institutional BTC adoption and collateral recognition. https://t.co/Awzl23IcOh — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 25, 2025 The notable proliferation of new crypto legislation and regulations has marked a major inflection point where traditional financial institutions have gained confidence to embrace digital assets.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Traders reassess safety in 2025 as XRP eyes $7 and LILPEPE builds a fast, low-fee Layer-2 blockchain. Ripple’s XRP has long been considered one of the top altcoin contenders, but in 2025, traders are rethinking what “safe” really means. On one hand, XRP has institutional support, regulatory traction, and eyes on $5 to $7. On the other hand, a new memecoin with a blockchain backbone is gaining ground, not through hype, but through execution. You might also like: Shiba Inu exploded in 2021, PEPE in 2023, this frog token under $0.002 could soar in 2025 Little Pepe: The memecoin with a chain Instead of hoping for virality on Ethereum’s congested mainnet, LILPEPE is building something bigger: its own dedicated Layer-2 blockchain. This new chain is designed for speed, dirt-cheap fees, and fair launches, specifically, sniper bot-resistant smart contracts and zero-tax trading. That means memecoins can launch with a level playing field and without being wrecked on day one. It’s a highly targeted ecosystem: fast, secure, and fully optimized for meme culture. Not just another ERC-20 frog trying to go viral, but a platform that allows meme creators to launch their tokens within a controlled, meme-native environment. The tech matters here, and it’s why serious investors are already paying attention. LILPEPE presale is heating, fast LILPEPE isn’t in price discovery yet, but it’s already generating breakout momentum. Its presale has progressed rapidly through the early stages, with Stage 2 closing early after raising $1.325 million. Now deep into Stage 3, LILPEPE has already secured $1.82 million, with 1.66 billion tokens sold out of the 2.25 billion allocated. The token is currently priced at $0.0012 and is confirmed to list at $0.003, locking in a 2.5x return for early participants before it even reaches exchanges. XRP fights for ground as bulls await breakout XRP is having a hard time staying above $2, even though people are feeling more positive about it. It recently fell below the $2.25 support level. Analysts are keeping a careful eye on XRP because a further drop might bring it close to the psychological $2 mark, which is an important support level that could either be a launchpad or a warning flag. On the positive side, the macro picture for XRP looks strong. Nine-spot XRP ETF applications are under SEC review, and institutional players like Webus International and VivoPower are preparing to invest a combined $421 million into XRP reserves. These developments hint at serious adoption. But the charts are lagging. The MACD shows a bearish divergence, and XRP’s simple moving average is now acting as resistance. While on-chain indicators show month-over-month growth in futures open interest (+10.48%), short-term price action remains tepid. If XRP manages a bullish reversal, the next targets are $2.50, $3, and possibly $5.85 on an ETF-fueled surge, but the current outlook remains cautious. From meme to market cap: $1 billion isn’t just hype With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, LILPEPE only needs to reach a price of $0.01 to achieve a $1 billion market cap. That’s an 8.3x gain from its current Stage 3 price of $0.0012. That number doesn’t just come from thin air; it’s what PEPE and SHIB achieved, and LILPEPE is following a similar trajectory. However, what makes it even more exciting is that it’s not just launching a token, it’s launching an entire blockchain. Remember how Binance Smart Chain changed DeFi accessibility in 2020? LILPEPE aims to do the same thing for memecoins. If that flywheel spins up — presale success, viral token launches, meme-friendly infrastructure — then a $1b cap is just the beginning. And if LILPEPE becomes the go-to platform for meme token generation, it won’t just be competing with PEPE; it could become the engine powering the next generation of meme tokens. XRP or LILPEPE? XRP has institutional momentum. ETF filings, treasury use cases, and regulatory tailwinds could make it one of 2025’s most crucial large-cap plays. A return to $5–$7 is not out of the question, especially if bullish momentum builds from ETF approvals. However, for those seeking early access, higher asymmetry, and a chance at exponential returns, LILPEPE offers something that XRP simply can’t. It’s an emerging asset backed by a rapidly growing presale, strong tokenomics, and a clear ecosystem vision. It’s not just hype. It’s hype with a plan. For those who missed PEPE or bought SHIB too late, LILPEPE’s current phase might be a redo, but with much stronger fundamentals driving it.

This version stands out with its mint-free version. The new module brings significant changes to the TerraClassic ecosystem without minting money. In the new version, minting can be done with multi-layered restrictions. These restrictions include SDR base, PRP limits, and daily minting limits based on burn history. These changes aim to reduce the risk of inflation. The main features of the MM version 2.0 are: Instantly Available: The Marketplace Module is instantly available. Swap Fees (0.35%): Half will be burned, half will be sent to the Oracle Pool. New Minting Limitations: Up to 80% of the LUNC burned in the past 30 days can be minted (maximum 100k SDR). This is not a “repeg” proposal. In other words, there is no attempt to peg USTC back to $1. USTC will no longer be treated as a stable asset. There will be no new LUNC minting in swaps. Instead, a pre-funded pool will be used. This approach replaces the classic “mint and burn” mechanism. Related News: Company with Two Altcoins Listed on Binance Announces New Altcoin to Be Launched - Here's the Date and Details Although many security measures have been taken, if the impact that the community expects from this mechanism is too high, disappointment may occur. In the new clearing system, the system will work as follows: USTC – LUNC exchange: User gives USTC and receives LUNC from the pool. LUNC – USTC exchange: User gives LUNC and receives USTC from the pool. Half of the 0.35% fee charged on each swap transaction is burned, while the other half is transferred to the Oracle Pool. Swaps that are concentrated only in the USTC-LUNC direction may lead to the pool being depleted and falling below expected LUNC burn rates. On the other hand, this may accelerate USTC burns. *This is not investment advice.

This growing accumulation reflects a strategic move toward early-stage, high-upside digital assets—without abandoning their foundational positions in blue-chip networks. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Quiet Favorite Among Whales MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing significant smart money interest, having surpassed $10 million in presale commitments. Each presale round has sold out rapidly, propelled by a 170 billion token cap, a full HashEx audit, and zero VC allocation. Large Ethereum and XRP wallets are building positions discreetly—evident in on-chain data that shows consistent inflows without sharp price movements. This methodical build-up suggests long-term conviction. Investors are focused on the project’s community-first design, transparent rollout, and the lack of inflationary mechanics—key characteristics that appeal to serious capital seeking resilient upside. Ethereum: Strategic Diversification in Motion Ethereum remains a critical infrastructure layer in crypto, yet many ETH whales are rebalancing toward projects offering stronger short- to mid-term expansion. Both MAGACOIN FINANCE and Optimism are emerging as top allocation choices, giving ETH holders exposure to early momentum without abandoning Ethereum’s core innovations. XRP: Looking Beyond Regulatory Limbo While XRP maintains its role in payments, uncertain regulation and stagnant price movement are prompting high-net-worth XRP holders to diversify. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s clarity in governance, token scarcity, and adoption trends present an appealing alternative. The parallel interest in Optimism reflects a wider recalibration—where investors seek performance without compromising long-term vision. Optimism: The Scalable Layer-2 Alternative Optimism continues to rise on the Layer-2 frontier, with increasing active users and strong developer traction. While large holder flows have slowed in recent weeks, Ethereum and XRP whales remain actively positioned, drawn by Optimism’s expansion into Superchain capabilities and Layer-3 architecture. Its appeal complements the early-stage profile of MAGACOIN FINANCE in strategic portfolios. Conclusion The discreet yet purposeful accumulation of MAGACOIN FINANCE and Optimism by Ethereum and XRP whales signals a broader shift toward calculated, high-upside diversification. As smart money prepares for the next growth phase, these two assets are emerging as central to 2025’s evolving crypto narrative.

While global tensions continue to spark volatility across markets, Chainlink has stood out for its resilience, supported by a series of strong partnerships and growing on-chain fundamentals. The recent price action signals a potential shift in trend, but analysts warn that a confirmed breakout is still needed before bulls can fully take over. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buy-Side Pressure Surges: Taker Buy Volume Spikes Sharply Top analyst Henry Lord of Alts highlighted that LINK has endured months of persistent downtrend and unusually quiet price behavior. However, recent moves suggest that something is changing beneath the surface. Volume is increasing, volatility is picking up, and LINK is forming a base structure that could mark the end of its accumulation phase. Despite this strength, Chainlink remains technically locked within a consolidation range. A clean breakout above key resistance levels will be critical to trigger the next phase of upward momentum. Until then, traders are cautiously optimistic as LINK teases a larger move. Chainlink Prepares For A Decisive Move Chainlink is currently trading over 25% below its May high, reflecting the broader market impact of rising macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, especially the recent Middle East conflicts. Despite these pressures, LINK has managed to hold within a steady consolidation range, signaling resilience as the crypto market awaits its next decisive move. Maintaining prices above current levels is crucial. A breakdown here could open the door for deeper corrections. However, analyst Henry believes the tides may be turning. According to Henry, Chainlink has endured months of downtrend and silence, but a structural shift is now underway. His analysis highlights that the long-standing downtrend has been broken, and LINK has entered a clear accumulation and consolidation phase. “These zones often come before the loudest moves,” Henry notes. Historically, such phases have preceded explosive rallies, and this time may be no different. If momentum picks up, a breakout toward the $25–$30 range wouldn’t be surprising. Henry also points out that periods of inactivity often mask the actions of smart money—buying quietly before the broader market catches on. While it’s easy to overlook assets during calm phases, that’s often when the groundwork for major moves is laid. For now, Chainlink remains on watch.

As seen in the 12-hour chart, LINK recently rebounded from the $11.50 level and is now trading above $13.20. This recovery follows a steep drop that marked a new local low, but the bounce has pushed the price above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), now acting as short-term support at $13.50. Importantly, LINK is now testing the 100-day SMA (around $14.65), which previously served as resistance in late May and early June. If bulls manage to break and consolidate above this level, the next target lies near the 200-day SMA at $14.16—a confluence zone that may act as a critical decision point for trend continuation or rejection.

A clear break above $14.65 with volume could confirm the breakout and signal the start of a larger move toward the $17–$18 range.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-is-about-to-shock-everyone-heres-why/,"Much of the crypto market continues to follow institutional movements around Bitcoin, but analyst Levi Rietveld has shifted attention to XRP. In a recent video shared on X, Rietveld described a convergence of market factors that he believes could set the stage for XRP to “shock everyone.” Rietveld’s comments come as some of the largest institutional players continue to make major Bitcoin purchases. MetaPlanet, a prominent Japanese investment firm, recently added another $111 million worth of Bitcoin to its treasury. This brings its total Bitcoin holdings to over $1 billion. Rietveld emphasized that the new acquisition alone represents roughly one-tenth of MetaPlanet’s total BTC portfolio, highlighting the scale and urgency behind the move. XRP Is About To Shock EVERYONE! pic.twitter.com/WQmIkODZMj — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) June 24, 2025 MicroStrategy and Sequence Join the Momentum This development followed closely behind another major buy from MicroStrategy, whose founder, Michael Saylor, has remained one of Bitcoin’s most vocal proponents. Michael Saylor has been nicknamed Bitcoin’s Warren Buffett , and Rietveld revealed that the company purchased an additional $26 million in Bitcoin following a $300 million acquisition. While experts have revealed that Saylor would get a significantly higher return by buying XRP , he’s stuck with Bitcoin. At the same time, Sequence Communications Company has announced plans to raise $384 million specifically for launching a Bitcoin treasury strategy, aligning itself with the growing trend of corporate BTC accumulation. Rietveld Sees XRP as the Next Major Move Rietveld believes a “massive tsunami of liquidity” is entering the digital asset space, and while this is currently favoring Bitcoin, it could soon spread to altcoins with strong fundamentals. Among them, XRP is the top contender for the next wave of capital inflows. The digital asset is attractive to institutions . While Rietveld did not provide any technical specifics, the sentiment surrounding XRP is improving, and experts believe a big move is coming. Institutions like SBI have been making major moves for years, and some see SBI as the Microstrategy for XRP . XRP’s advantages over other cryptocurrencies have set it apart, and as institutional attention and capital flows toward altcoins, XRP could benefit the most from this shift. With its distinct use case and growing legal stability, XRP is gaining renewed attention. Whether it delivers on that promise remains uncertain, but according to Rietveld and many other experts, it is a serious contender in the crypto landscape.

Recent claims from Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, amplified by @solidintel_x on X, suggest that US airstrikes have caused significant damage to Iran Nuclear facilities. This startling development sends immediate ripples through international relations and, inevitably, prompts questions about its potential Crypto Market Impact . For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, such geopolitical tremors often translate into market volatility, making it crucial to grasp the broader implications. What’s Happening with Iran Nuclear Facilities? The core of the recent news revolves around Iran’s assertion of damage to its nuclear infrastructure. According to the spokesperson, these facilities, which are central to Iran’s controversial nuclear program, have sustained substantial harm from recent US Airstrikes . While the specific nature and extent of the damage remain unverified by independent sources, the claim itself carries significant weight, given the long history of tension surrounding Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The Claim: Iran’s Foreign Ministry states US airstrikes heavily damaged nuclear sites. The Source: The claim was initially reported via @solidintel_x on X, citing an Iranian spokesperson. Verification Challenges: Independent confirmation of such claims is often difficult due to restricted access and the nature of military operations. Historical Context: Iran’s nuclear program has been a flashpoint for decades, leading to international sanctions and ongoing diplomatic efforts. Understanding this context is vital, as it frames the potential responses from international actors and financial markets alike. The immediate concern is escalation, but the ripple effects extend far beyond the immediate region. How Do US Airstrikes and Geopolitics Intersect with Crypto? The relationship between geopolitical events, such as alleged US Airstrikes , and the cryptocurrency market might not be immediately obvious to everyone. However, history has shown a clear pattern: uncertainty breeds volatility, and in times of crisis, investors often seek perceived safe havens or, conversely, divest from riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have at times been touted as a digital gold, a hedge against traditional financial instability and geopolitical unrest. When news of significant international incidents breaks, here’s how it can affect the crypto landscape: Increased Volatility: Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can lead to rapid price swings across major cryptocurrencies and altcoins. Investors might panic sell or, conversely, ‘buy the dip.’ Flight to Safety Narrative: Bitcoin’s role as a potential safe haven asset often gets tested during such times. If traditional markets (stocks, fiat currencies) show weakness, some investors might flock to Bitcoin, seeing its decentralized nature as a protective shield against state-controlled financial systems. Correlation with Traditional Markets: While crypto strives for independence, it often remains correlated with broader market sentiment. A downturn in global stocks due to heightened Geopolitical Tensions can pull crypto prices down with it. Sanctions and Digital Assets: In scenarios involving international sanctions, cryptocurrencies can become a tool for circumventing traditional financial systems, though this carries significant regulatory risks and is often a topic of intense debate. This dynamic interplay highlights why staying informed about global affairs is not just for political analysts but for every savvy crypto investor. Navigating Heightened Geopolitical Tensions : What’s the Impact? The alleged damage to Iran’s nuclear sites, if confirmed, marks a significant escalation in Geopolitical Tensions . Such developments have far-reaching implications, extending beyond the immediate conflict zone to affect global energy markets, diplomatic relations, and, critically, investor confidence worldwide. The core challenge for investors is discerning short-term noise from long-term trends. Potential Broader Impacts: Area of Impact Description Potential Consequence Oil Markets Iran is a major oil producer; regional instability can disrupt supply. Spike in oil prices, impacting global economies and inflation. Diplomacy Further complicates nuclear negotiations and international relations. Increased isolation for Iran, heightened risk of proxy conflicts. Security Raises concerns about regional stability and potential for wider conflict. Increased military readiness, impact on trade routes. Financial Markets Investors become risk-averse, moving away from volatile assets. Stock market dips, bond market shifts, potential for currency fluctuations. For the crypto space, this means that even if Bitcoin holds its ground initially, broader economic downturns driven by energy shocks or reduced investor confidence can still exert downward pressure on the entire market. The interconnectedness of global finance means few assets truly operate in a vacuum. Understanding the Broader Global Stability Equation The incident in Iran underscores how delicate Global Stability truly is. Every major geopolitical event has the potential to trigger a cascade of reactions across borders and markets. For the crypto world, this means that while decentralization offers a promise of independence, the market is still deeply intertwined with human psychology and global economic conditions. A perceived threat to stability can lead to widespread risk aversion, affecting even the most resilient digital assets. Consider these aspects of global stability and their crypto relevance: Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts can disrupt trade, leading to inflation and economic slowdowns, which in turn affect discretionary spending and investment in assets like crypto. Currency Devaluations: In countries facing severe economic stress or sanctions, local populations might turn to cryptocurrencies as a way to preserve wealth, leading to localized surges in adoption. Regulatory Responses: Governments might react to global instability by increasing scrutiny on crypto, potentially leading to new regulations or restrictions. Investor Sentiment: Fear about the future of the global economy can lead to a general withdrawal from speculative assets, regardless of their individual merits. Therefore, tracking major geopolitical flashpoints isn’t just about current affairs; it’s about anticipating shifts in the global economic landscape that will inevitably touch the crypto market. Analyzing the Crypto Market Impact : What Comes Next? The immediate Crypto Market Impact of the Iran nuclear claims and alleged US airstrikes is likely to be characterized by uncertainty. Investors should brace for potential volatility and consider their risk exposure. While Bitcoin often sees a surge in ‘safe haven’ narratives during such times, its correlation with traditional markets has also been evident, meaning a broader economic downturn could still pull it lower. Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders: Stay Informed, Not Panicked: Differentiate between verified news and speculation. Rely on reputable sources and avoid making impulsive decisions based on unconfirmed reports. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk tolerance. Do you have a diversified portfolio? Consider if your current holdings align with your comfort level during periods of high uncertainty. Dollar-Cost Averaging: For long-term investors, continuing a dollar-cost averaging strategy can help mitigate the effects of volatility, allowing you to buy at different price points over time. Consider Stablecoins: If you’re highly risk-averse during turbulent times, temporarily moving a portion of your portfolio into stablecoins can offer a refuge from market swings, though they carry their own set of risks. Focus on Fundamentals: Volatility often shakes out weaker projects. Focus on cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Ultimately, the crypto market’s response will be a complex interplay of investor sentiment, macro-economic factors, and the specific developments in the geopolitical arena. Being prepared and informed is your best defense. A Compelling Summary: Navigating the New Geopolitical Crypto Landscape The claims regarding significant damage to Iran Nuclear facilities from alleged US Airstrikes introduce a fresh layer of complexity to an already intricate global landscape. These heightened Geopolitical Tensions are not isolated events; they send reverberations across all financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Understanding the potential for widespread Crypto Market Impact is crucial for investors aiming to navigate these turbulent waters. While the immediate future may bring increased volatility and uncertainty, this situation also highlights the evolving role of digital assets in an interconnected world. Whether Bitcoin truly acts as a reliable safe haven or simply follows broader economic trends remains a subject of ongoing debate, but its unique characteristics make it a focal point during times of crisis. As the world grapples with maintaining Global Stability , staying informed, exercising caution, and applying sound investment principles will be paramount for anyone participating in the crypto space. The coming days and weeks will be critical in determining the true extent of the damage, both to the facilities and to the delicate balance of international relations, and consequently, its lasting effect on our digital financial future.

The recent developments in the US-China trade relationship, particularly the tariff truce, are a prime example. For those monitoring digital assets, understanding the stability of major fiat currencies like the Chinese yuan is crucial, as it often reflects broader global economic health and investor confidence. A more predictable global economic landscape, fostered by reduced trade tensions, tends to encourage greater risk appetite across all asset classes, including digital currencies. This article delves into how the latest truce between the United States and China is creating a firmer foundation for the yuan, as highlighted by financial giant UBS, and what this means for the broader economic outlook. Understanding the US-China Trade Truce and its Impact on the Chinese Yuan The protracted trade dispute between the United States and China has been a significant source of global economic uncertainty for several years. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, were levied by both nations, disrupting supply chains, increasing costs for businesses, and casting a shadow over international trade. For the Chinese yuan , this period was marked by volatility, as the currency often served as a barometer of trade relations. Escalating tensions typically led to yuan depreciation, reflecting concerns over China’s economic growth and capital outflows. Conversely, any sign of de-escalation usually provided a much-needed boost. The recent announcement of a tariff truce, even if partial or temporary, signals a shift towards a more constructive dialogue. This agreement aims to pause the imposition of new tariffs and, in some cases, roll back existing ones. UBS, a leading global financial services company, has been quick to analyze the implications of this development. Their assessment suggests that this truce is instrumental in setting a floor for the Chinese yuan, preventing further significant depreciation. This is based on several factors: Reduced Uncertainty: A truce removes a major overhang for Chinese exporters, allowing them to plan with greater clarity and reducing the pressure on the yuan from a trade perspective. Investor Confidence: Global investors often view trade wars as a systemic risk. A truce improves sentiment, encouraging capital flows into Chinese assets, including its currency. Economic Stability: By alleviating some pressure on China’s export-oriented economy, the truce supports overall economic stability, which is a fundamental pillar for currency strength. The expectation is that with reduced trade friction, China’s economic fundamentals can assert themselves more effectively, providing natural support for the yuan’s value against major currencies like the US dollar. Why is Chinese Yuan Stability Crucial for Global Market Stability? China’s colossal economy and its central role in global supply chains mean that the health of the Chinese yuan is not just a domestic concern; it has profound implications for global market stability . When the yuan experiences significant fluctuations, especially depreciation, it can trigger a ripple effect across various markets worldwide. Here’s why: Global Trade Dynamics: A weaker yuan makes Chinese exports cheaper, potentially sparking competitive devaluations from other exporting nations. This can lead to trade imbalances and protectionist measures globally. Commodity Markets: China is a massive consumer of raw materials. A stable yuan implies stable demand for commodities, benefiting commodity-exporting countries and stabilizing global prices for oil, metals, and agricultural products. Emerging Markets: Many emerging economies have strong trade ties with China. Yuan stability provides a predictable environment for their trade and investment flows, reducing volatility in their own currencies and stock markets. Investor Confidence: A volatile yuan can signal underlying economic stress in China, which tends to make global investors risk-averse. Conversely, a stable yuan fosters confidence, encouraging investment in riskier assets worldwide, including potentially bolstering sentiment for cryptocurrencies as part of a broader return to risk. Therefore, the UBS assessment of a floor for the yuan is not just good news for China; it’s a positive signal for the entire global financial system, promising a degree of predictability that has been sorely missed during the trade war. UBS Outlook: What Does This Mean for the Future of the Yuan? The UBS outlook regarding the Chinese yuan’s stability is particularly noteworthy because of the institution’s extensive reach and analytical prowess in global markets. Their perspective suggests that while the tariff truce does not completely resolve all underlying tensions between the two economic superpowers, it significantly mitigates the immediate downside risks for the yuan. UBS analysts are likely focusing on several key indicators to support their view: Key Factors Supporting UBS’s Positive Outlook: Trade Balance Improvement: With reduced tariff burdens, China’s export performance is expected to stabilize or even improve, contributing positively to its current account balance and providing fundamental support for the yuan. Capital Flows: A more predictable trade environment and a stable currency are attractive to foreign investors. UBS anticipates continued, if not increased, foreign direct investment and portfolio inflows into China, bolstering the yuan. Monetary Policy Autonomy: A stable yuan gives the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) greater flexibility in setting monetary policy without constantly worrying about currency depreciation or capital flight. This allows them to focus on domestic growth objectives. Economic Resilience: China’s economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience despite external headwinds. The truce allows this inherent strength to shine through, further underpinning the yuan’s value. While UBS acknowledges that geopolitical risks and other factors could still introduce volatility, their core message is that the immediate threat of a sharp yuan depreciation due to trade tensions has been significantly reduced. This provides a crucial buffer for China’s economy and, by extension, contributes positively to the overall sentiment in global financial markets. Navigating the Tariff Impact: Challenges and Opportunities Ahead While the recent tariff truce offers a welcome respite, it’s important to recognize that the broader tariff impact and the underlying economic competition between the U.S. and China have not vanished entirely. The truce sets a floor for the Chinese yuan , but it doesn’t eliminate all future challenges. Understanding these nuances is key for investors and businesses alike. Remaining Challenges: Structural Issues: The truce primarily addresses tariffs, but deeper issues such as intellectual property rights, technology transfer, and state subsidies remain points of contention. These structural challenges could resurface and reignite tensions. Phase One Deal Limitations: If the truce is part of a ‘Phase One’ deal, it implies further phases are needed. The success of these subsequent negotiations is not guaranteed, and failures could bring back uncertainty. Geopolitical Risks: Beyond trade, geopolitical factors like Taiwan, human rights, and regional influence continue to simmer, capable of influencing economic relations and currency stability. Global Economic Slowdown: Even without trade wars, a global economic slowdown or recession could still put pressure on the yuan, regardless of the truce’s positive effects. Emerging Opportunities: Increased Trade Certainty: For businesses, the truce provides a more predictable environment for supply chain planning and investment in both countries, potentially leading to increased trade volumes. Investment in China: A stable yuan and reduced trade tensions make China a more attractive destination for foreign direct investment, particularly in sectors less impacted by remaining restrictions. Diversification Benefits: For global investors, a more stable yuan might encourage greater allocation to Chinese equities and bonds, offering diversification benefits within a global portfolio. Reduced Inflationary Pressure: Lower tariffs can help reduce import costs, potentially easing inflationary pressures in economies that rely heavily on Chinese goods. The truce is a step in the right direction, creating a more conducive environment for economic growth and currency stability. However, market participants must remain vigilant, understanding that the path to full resolution of trade and economic differences is long and subject to potential reversals. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses Given the UBS outlook and the implications of the US-China trade truce , what are the practical takeaways for investors and businesses operating in this dynamic environment? The stability of the Chinese yuan , while beneficial, should be viewed as one piece of a larger puzzle. For Investors: Re-evaluate Exposure to Chinese Assets: With reduced currency risk, consider opportunities in Chinese equities, bonds, and even real estate. The setting of a floor for the yuan makes these investments more appealing. Monitor Global Supply Chains: Companies with significant reliance on Chinese manufacturing or consumer markets may see improved stability. This can translate to better corporate earnings, which in turn impacts stock valuations. Diversify Beyond Traditional Safe Havens: While the truce improves stability, it’s not a guarantee against all risks. Maintain a diversified portfolio that includes various asset classes and geographies. Keep an Eye on Commodity Markets: A stable Chinese economy, supported by a stable yuan, generally means consistent demand for raw materials. This can benefit commodity-linked investments. For Businesses: Optimize Supply Chain Strategies: The reduced tariff uncertainty allows for more long-term planning regarding sourcing and manufacturing locations. Businesses can reassess previous relocation decisions made due to trade war fears. Explore Market Entry/Expansion in China: A more stable economic and currency environment lowers the risk of doing business in China, potentially opening doors for new market entries or expansion plans. Engage in Risk Management: While the immediate risk has lessened, currency hedging strategies for the yuan should still be considered, especially for businesses with significant cross-border transactions. Stay Informed on Policy Shifts: The trade relationship is fluid. Businesses should continuously monitor policy announcements from both governments to adapt quickly to any new developments. The truce provides a window of opportunity to capitalize on improved market sentiment and greater predictability. However, a prudent approach involves combining optimism with a realistic assessment of ongoing geopolitical and economic complexities. Conclusion: A Steadier Course for the Chinese Yuan and Global Markets The assessment by UBS that the US-China tariff truce has helped establish a floor for the Chinese yuan is a significant development for global financial markets. After years of trade tensions creating volatility and uncertainty, this partial de-escalation provides a much-needed breath of fresh air. A stable yuan is not merely a technical currency issue; it is a critical indicator of China’s economic health and, by extension, a cornerstone of global market stability . It signals reduced systemic risk, fosters greater investor confidence, and creates a more predictable environment for international trade and investment. While challenges persist and the path to a complete resolution of US-China economic differences remains long, this truce represents a crucial step towards a more balanced and predictable global economic landscape. For businesses and investors alike, understanding the implications of this stability is key to navigating the evolving global financial terrain and identifying new opportunities.

The mainland China brokerage firm upgraded its Type 1 license for dealing in securities to include virtual-asset trading, allowing access to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The ease of the approval suggests more will follow in the future According to the company’s statement on Wednesday, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission granted the approval on Tuesday, after which the firm’s Type 1 license for dealing in securities was upgraded to provide virtual-asset dealing services under an omnibus account arrangement with SFC-licensed platforms. Now that it has been upgraded, the brokerage’s clientele will be able to access trading in major digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins like USDT . When the news broke, investors reacted by driving Guotai Junan International’s shares up by nearly 200%. The stock closed at HK$3.7 (47 US cents) on Wednesday. Hua Chuang Securities also revealed that the SFC approval was granted sooner than expected, and has predicted that in the future, when more mainland brokerages with international branches try to upgrade their Type 1 licenses, things will move at a similar pace. The firm expects more leading brokerages, especially those with a strong client base, to consider expanding their respective businesses to cover digital assets. Not only is it the right time, it is the right place to do so. Hong Kong is widely acknowledged for its favorable conditions, which make Hua Chuang Securities confident in the potential of the city to continue improving its virtual-asset ecosystem. The sentiment was echoed in a report from Futu Securities, which noted that stablecoins have the potential to influence the upscaling of Chinese brokerages’ international operations, as current regulations prevent them from conducting virtual asset-related business on the mainland. Futu believes stablecoin development could redefine the role of brokerages, promote asset securitization, and act as hubs for cross-border clearings in the future, instead of simply as trading intermediaries. This would help enhance these firms’ valuations, it said. Terence Chong Tai-leung, executive director of the Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), also agrees and has said the proliferation of virtual asset trading services in Hong Kong — whether they are backed by mainland, local, or foreign funds — will benefit the city’s finance and fintech space. Favorable regulations are attracting crypto players to Hong Kong Businesses in Hong Kong are increasingly getting curious about investing in crypto, and it’s all thanks to the city’s favorable regulations. The regulations are reportedly nudging players previously watching from the sidelines to join in the fun, and several have answered the call. Among the recent crop of investors to take an interest in digital address is the money manager, known as VMS Group. The multifamily office with just under $4 billion in assets under management reportedly plans to allocate up to $10 million to strategies run by decentralized-finance hedge fund Re7 Capital, according to its managing partner, Elton Cheung. The decision is part of the firm’s recent moves to diversify into more liquid investments, an attempt to upgrade from focusing only on private equity and other longer-duration strategies, the playbook it has stuck with since it was founded two decades ago. Those investments performed well, but such assets have become less liquid as more companies opt to stay private for longer, making it more difficult to exit.

The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is constantly evolving, pushing boundaries and seeking new horizons. The latest groundbreaking development comes from Grove , a pioneering protocol poised to revolutionize how on-chain capital interacts with the traditional financial world. With a colossal $1 billion investment from SKY (formerly MakerDAO) into Janus Henderson’s tokenized CLO fund JAAA, Grove isn’t just launching; it’s making a monumental statement about the future of finance. What is Grove and Why Does it Matter for DeFi? At its core, Grove is designed to be the crucial bridge connecting the vibrant, innovative realm of DeFi with the established, regulated domain of traditional finance (TradFi). For too long, these two worlds have operated largely in silos, with DeFi’s liquidity often remaining within its own ecosystem. Grove aims to change this by enabling on-chain capital to seamlessly access real-world assets (RWAs). Bridging the Gap: Grove facilitates the flow of capital from DeFi protocols into traditional financial instruments, such as tokenized credit funds. Expanding Utility: It provides DeFi users with access to diverse, yield-generating opportunities outside the native crypto ecosystem. Enhancing Stability: By incorporating less volatile, real-world assets, Grove can help introduce greater stability and predictability into the often-turbulent DeFi market. This initiative represents a significant step towards the mainstream adoption of decentralized technologies, proving that DeFi isn’t just for crypto natives but can serve the broader global economy. The Power of Institutional Credit: Grove’s Strategic Focus Institutional credit is the lifeblood of traditional finance, powering everything from corporate loans to complex securitized products. Grove’s strategic focus on this sector is a game-changer. By targeting institutional-grade assets like tokenized Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs), Grove is tapping into a massive, multi-trillion-dollar market. The initial $1 billion investment from SKY into Janus Henderson’s JAAA fund is a clear testament to this focus. Imagine the implications: Feature Traditional Finance (Pre-Grove) DeFi (Post-Grove) Access to Credit Limited to established institutions, high barriers to entry for crypto. On-chain capital can directly access real-world institutional credit. Liquidity Source Banks, investment firms, sovereign wealth funds. DeFi protocols, DAOs, stablecoin holders. Transparency Often opaque, manual processes. Enhanced transparency via blockchain, auditable transactions. Efficiency Slow, intermediary-heavy. Faster, disintermediated, lower costs. This integration opens up new avenues for capital deployment, allowing DeFi protocols to earn yields from established, regulated financial products, while traditional institutions gain exposure to the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology. SKY (MakerDAO) and the Endgame Ecosystem: A Vision Unfolding The involvement of SKY MakerDAO , a powerhouse in the DeFi space known for creating the DAI stablecoin, underscores the significance of Grove’s launch. SKY’s $1 billion commitment isn’t just an investment; it’s a strategic move within its broader ‘Endgame’ ecosystem vision. The Endgame is SKY’s ambitious roadmap to scale DAI adoption and integrate real-world assets more deeply into its framework, ensuring the long-term stability and growth of the Maker Protocol. The investment in JAAA, a tokenized CLO fund, represents a calculated step towards diversifying SKY’s reserves and strengthening the backing of DAI with high-quality, real-world assets. This move aims to: Enhance DAI’s Stability: By backing DAI with a broader range of assets, including less volatile real-world credit, its peg can become even more robust. Drive Ecosystem Growth: Grove’s success directly contributes to the expansion and utility of the entire SKY Endgame ecosystem. Pioneer RWA Integration: SKY is leading the charge in demonstrating how large-scale DeFi protocols can safely and effectively integrate RWAs. This synergy between Grove and SKY is a powerful example of how established DeFi players are innovating to secure a sustainable and impactful future for decentralized finance. Unlocking Real-World Credit for On-Chain Capital: Benefits and Challenges The concept of connecting on-chain capital with real-world credit presents a myriad of benefits. For DeFi, it means access to deeper liquidity pools, more diversified investment opportunities, and potentially more stable yields that are less correlated with volatile crypto markets. For traditional finance, it offers a novel source of capital, increased efficiency through blockchain rails, and exposure to a rapidly growing digital economy. Key Benefits: Diversification: Reduces reliance on purely crypto-native assets, offering a hedge against market volatility. Scalability: Opens up vast, multi-trillion-dollar traditional markets for DeFi liquidity. Yield Generation: Provides new avenues for DeFi protocols and users to generate sustainable yields from established financial products. Institutional Adoption: Builds trust and bridges the gap for traditional institutions to enter the DeFi space. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape for tokenized securities and cross-border finance. Legal Frameworks: Ensuring enforceability of on-chain agreements in traditional legal systems. Due Diligence: Performing thorough due diligence on traditional assets and their underlying risks within a decentralized context. Technical Integration: Building robust and secure bridges between disparate technological infrastructures. Despite these challenges, the potential rewards are immense. Grove’s launch signifies a bold step forward in tackling these complexities head-on, paving the way for a more integrated and efficient global financial system. Actionable Insights for the Future of Finance Grove’s entry into the market, backed by a significant SKY MakerDAO investment, provides several key insights for anyone interested in the future of finance: The RWA Narrative is Strong: Real-world asset tokenization is not just a trend; it’s becoming a fundamental pillar of DeFi’s evolution. Expect more protocols to follow Grove’s lead. Institutional Capital is Coming: The $1 billion investment is a clear signal that major institutional players are actively exploring and investing in the DeFi space, albeit through structured and regulated avenues. Diversification is Key for DeFi: For protocols and investors, diversifying exposure beyond purely crypto-native assets into RWAs can offer stability and new yield opportunities. Regulatory Clarity is Crucial: As these bridges are built, the demand for clearer regulatory frameworks will intensify, potentially leading to more favorable environments for compliant RWA integration. For developers, this means exploring robust oracle solutions for RWA data. For investors, it means researching protocols that offer exposure to tokenized real-world assets. For institutions, it’s an invitation to explore the efficiency and transparency blockchain can offer. A New Era for DeFi and Traditional Finance Grove’s launch marks a pivotal moment, ushering in a new era where the lines between decentralized and traditional finance begin to blur. By successfully bridging on-chain capital with real-world credit and securing a monumental investment from SKY, Grove is not just a protocol; it’s a testament to the maturation of the DeFi space. This integration promises a future of greater financial inclusion, efficiency, and stability, where the best of both worlds converges to create unprecedented opportunities. The journey has just begun, but the direction is clear: an interconnected, more robust global financial ecosystem powered by blockchain.

The New York-based firm will exit the bitcoin BTC mining business entirely, repurposing its assets and capital into its growing ETH strategy. The company began building its ether position and Ethereum staking infrastructure in 2022. As of March 31, Bit Digital held 24,434.2 ETH, valued at $44.6 million, and 417.6 BTC worth $34.5 million. It plans to convert the remaining bitcoin into ether over time. To fund the transition, Bit Digital has started a process to sell or wind down its bitcoin mining operations. Net proceeds from the divestiture will be reinvested in ether. No specific timeline was given for the sale or conversion of assets. The announcement marks a significant pivot for a company once rooted in bitcoin mining, especially considering the incredible run BTC has been on compared to ETH. The ETH/BTC ratio is down 75% since December 2021. However, the move isn't a big surprise given how tough the mining industry has become since last year's halving cut the BTC rewards for miners to half, squeezing profit margins, despite rally in bitcoin prices. The firm has also announced that it will be selling shares to fund the purchase of more ether, and that its high-performance computing (HPC) subsidiary, WhiteFiber, has submitted a draft registration letter with the Securities and Exchange Commission with regards to going public.

Adler Jr. stated that since the bull cycle that started in November 2022, Bitcoin has experienced only two deep corrections: He said that after these pullbacks exceeding 30% in August 2024 and April 2025, prices quickly recovered and reached new highs. The pullbacks in all other periods remained in the 10-20% range, functioning as a classic “shake-out” and did not disrupt the uptrend. Adler Jr. stated that the weekly simple moving average (SMA)-based decline is currently only at -7%, while the current pullback is limited to -4.7%, indicating a calm consolidation process in the $100-106,000 range. Related News: GameStop, One of the Most Talked-About Companies in the US, Makes Another Move to Purchase a Massive Amount of Bitcoin Adler Jr. stated that the “deep correction-accumulation-new rise” cycle that repeats itself in the market is also evident in this bull market and that the retracements are gradually narrowing and this is a strong signal of market maturity. He said that unless there is a serious negative news flow, the strong support at $96,000 will continue to drive the bull trend and new all-time highs (ATH) can be seen. Another important data that Adler Jr. drew attention to was the BTC flows on centralized exchanges (CEX). The daily average total flow (input + output) volume decreased to 40,000 BTC, reaching the lowest level in the last 10 years. This indicates that investors tend to withdraw their BTC from exchanges and hold them for the long term, indicating a potential liquidity shortage in the market. The weekly net flow remains negative at –4,300 BTC, indicating that the amount of coins deposited is lagging behind the amount withdrawn. However, the 30-day average inflow/outflow is comparable to the end of 2023 and the beginning of the bull market. Adler Jr. noted that this data shows that demand for Bitcoin is still strong. *This is not investment advice.

Meanwhile, others continue to offload their holdings. This piece dives into the three promising altcoins quietly being accumulated by those with insider foresight. Discover which digital assets are poised for potential growth in the evolving crypto market. Read on to unveil these hidden gems. XRP Price Update: Short-Term Dip Amid Stable Six-Month Performance Recent performance shows a one-month drop of about 6.85% alongside a modest six-month gain close to 1.25%. A one-week increase of nearly 1% contrasts with the sharper decline seen over the month, hinting at choppy short-term movement. XRP’s price held within an expected range, reflecting slight volatility and consolidation rather than a strong directional drift. Despite recent setbacks, longer-term measures suggest a stable trajectory for the cryptocurrency. Currently, XRP trades between $1.95 and $2.53, confined within a well-defined range that offers key levels for traders. The primary resistance is at approximately $2.88, while solid support is at $1.73. Indicators present a mixed picture, with the Awesome Oscillator at -0.094 and the momentum indicator at 0.015. The Relative Strength Index is near a neutral 49.52, indicating equilibrium between buying and selling pressures. Neither bulls nor bears have a clear upper hand, leading to sideways movements. Traders may consider entering positions near the support at $1.73 or might await a breakout above $3.45 for bullish confirmation. SUI: Charting a Bearish Course with Key Support and Resistance Levels SUI ’s price experienced a decline of 22.21% over the past month and dropped 33.33% in the last six months. Weekly adjustments showed a modest decline of -1.28%, indicating less short-term weakness compared to the longer-term downward trend. The trading range has been confined between approximately $2.77 and $4.01, reflecting a consistent slide with limited opportunities for recovery. Overall performance figures suggest ongoing bearish pressure, as both one-month and six-month observations highlight a reduction in strength. Current price action is centered around the $2.77 to $4.01 range. Immediate support is near $2.29, and a breach there could lead to deeper support at $1.05. Resistance is positioned at around $4.77 and again at $6.01. Indicators point to bear dominance, with an Awesome Oscillator of -0.507 and a Momentum Indicator of -0.223. An RSI of 42.20 does not provide a clear buy signal. The absence of a consistent upward trend and negative moving averages suggest approach with caution. Trading strategies may include waiting for bounces at support with tight stops or monitoring resistance for short opportunities. Injective (INJ) Market Shifts and Key Price Levels Signal Trading Opportunities Injective recorded a one-week gain of 4.31% but faced a one-month decline of nearly 13% and a six-month drop of 46%. The historical price movement indicates a pattern of brief recoveries followed by prolonged downtrends, highlighting market volatility. The coin's performance fluctuates between short-term upticks and long-term challenges, exposing it to external pressures and inconsistent trading conditions. Currently, Injective is trading between $8.82 and $15.47, with immediate resistance at $18.81 and support near $5.50. A secondary resistance level is set at $25.47 if buyers become active. The market shows bearish tendencies, evidenced by a summary recommendation of -0.34 and an Awesome Oscillator reading of -1.65, indicating that bears dominate the market. The lack of a clear trend suggests traders consider buying on dips and exiting near resistance levels while monitoring market volatility closely. Conclusion XRP , SUI , and INJ are gaining attention from smart investors. These altcoins show potential for growth. While others might be selling, smart investors see opportunity. XRP offers strong fundamentals. SUI has unique features. INJ is catching eyes with its innovative approach. Observing these trends can provide insights into market movements. The quiet accumulation indicates confidence in these altcoins' future. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to a blog post , the British multinational bank worries about risks like crypto fraud, market ups and downs, and consumer debt. This decision puts Barclays in line with other UK banks, which are limiting crypto transactions to protect their customers from financial harm. Barclays Protecting Consumers From Crypto Risks The financial giant warned that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have huge price swings that can lead credit card users into serious debt. Furthermore, the lack of rules and protection for consumers in the crypto market influenced their decision. Barclays has joined other major UK banks like HSBC Holdings, NatWest, and Santander in banning crypto purchases with credit cards. This move follows warnings from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which has labeled crypto as a high-risk investment, especially for retail customers. Notably, Barclays’ proactive step is part of its broader strategy to protect consumers and ensure financial responsibility. Meanwhile, the bank did not give details on a possible lift on the ban. Mastercard and Chainlink Enable Crypto Purchases However, in a reverse order, Chainlink joined forces with payment giant Mastercard to allow Chainlink’s three billion cardholders to purchase cryptocurrencies on-chain directly. As reported by TheCoinRise, this collaboration represents a step towards mainstream adoption of digital assets. It also offers a simple, non-custodial way for users to convert fiat currency into crypto. Mastercard’s move fits into its broader strategy of embracing blockchain technology in a practical and accessible manner . Earlier in the year, the company partnered with Kraken to issue crypto debit cards across Europe and the UK. Similarly, Mastercard’s rival, Visa, has intensified its crypto involvement. In late 2024, it teamed up with Coinbase to enable instant crypto deposits and withdrawals . Coinbase Enables Apple Pay for Crypto Purchases Last year, Coinbase announced that UK-based users can now purchase Bitcoin , Ethereum, and other digital assets using Apple Pay on their iPhones. This integration provides users with a more secure and private method of buying cryptocurrencies. As reported, enabling Apple Pay offers users heightened security as card numbers are not stored in the device or Apple servers. Instead, each transaction is assigned a unique device account number, which is encrypted and stored in a standard chip designed for secure payment information storage.

Analysts Eye Kaspa,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoin-finance-become-ethereum-and-bitcoin-traders-next-big-bet-analysts-eye-kaspa/,"As the 2025 crypto market cycle intensifies, traders are looking beyond the established players for the next wave of momentum. While Ethereum and Bitcoin continue to serve as anchors of institutional and retail portfolios, many investors are seeking fresh opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a powerful early-stage contender, and Kaspa is gaining analyst attention as a high-conviction technical play. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Presale of the Year MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of 2025’s standout launches, securing over $10 million in presale funding and selling out multiple rounds swiftly. With a capped supply of 170 billion tokens, verified by a full HashEx audit and a no-VC model, it’s built on a foundation of transparency and scarcity. This structure has drawn attention from both institutions and retail traders seeking exposure to earlier-phase innovation. Backed by community ownership, staking incentives, and a disciplined rollout strategy, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned by analysts as a breakout asset with long-term viability . Ethereum: Still a Powerhouse, But Traders Want More Ethereum remains at the center of smart contract development and institutional blockchain strategies. However, as the platform matures and growth becomes more incremental, investors are increasingly allocating toward assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer a different growth curve—without abandoning Ethereum’s long-term value. Bitcoin: The Anchor, But Limited Explosive Upside Bitcoin continues to dominate as the store-of-value leader, maintaining a position above $105,000. Still, for those seeking dynamic growth opportunities, Bitcoin’s current pace has prompted many to rotate capital into newer projects that mirror its early innovation-driven momentum—such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Kaspa: The Technical Standout on Analysts’ Radar Kaspa is gaining traction for its technical strengths, including the GHOSTDAG protocol and increasing utility from its Layer-2 ecosystem. With rising trading volume, wallet activity, and ongoing infrastructure development, analysts view Kaspa as a strong addition to the 2025 growth watchlist. Conclusion As Ethereum and Bitcoin traders seek new avenues for growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a high-upside early-stage contender with solid fundamentals. At the same time, Kaspa’s innovation and expanding use cases make it another asset to watch. Together, they represent a new generation of momentum-driven investments gaining traction in 2025.

In this new release, a new decentralized GPU marketplace is introduced that keeps compute pricing competitive and transparent across the platform. The hybrid architecture addresses a fundamental challenge in modern computing: the rising cost and limited availability of specialized hardware needed for AI and machine learning tasks. Traditional cloud providers charge premium rates for GPU access, often pricing out smaller research teams, startups, and academic institutions. By integrating distributed computing resources from community members alongside conventional cloud infrastructure, the platform will provide similar capabilities at significantly reduced costs. A dynamic GPU marketplace for efficient compute routing Theta EdgeCloud is a decentralized marketplace that connects the supply and demand for GPU computing power. It empowers anyone with idle GPUs to contribute their resources and earn rewards, while providing developers and AI teams with a scalable, cost-efficient platform for running containerized workloads. The platform now allows customers to choose the most suitable infrastructure for different types of computing tasks. For instance, training a large AI model that requires substantial GPU vRAM can be directed to powerful cloud or data center based GPUs. In contrast, tasks like burst model inference workloads, which are inherently parallelizable, can be distributed across many community-operated gaming machines, providing a flexible and cost-effective alternative. To ensure a fair and dynamic pricing model, Theta EdgeCloud allows node operators (the supply side) to set their own hourly rental rates. Meanwhile, users (the demand side) can select nodes that meet their performance requirements and budget constraints when launching workloads. This market-driven approach helps keep GPU compute pricing competitive and transparent across the platform. The system includes backup mechanisms with automatic failover logic to reassign work if any community device goes offline, ensuring reliable completion of computing tasks across the heterogeneous network of GPU types. Powering Leading Academic and Enterprise Customers The platform currently serves customers including Stanford University, Seoul National University, KAIST, Yonsei University, the University of Oregon, Michigan State University, and NTU Singapore for academic AI research. Enterprise clients include major sports teams such as the NHL's Las Vegas Knights, NBA's Houston Rockets, and global esports teams FlyQuest and Evil Geniuses. The beta release includes features requested by existing customers, including persistent storage for AI model training, improved job prioritization, and a developer API interface for job submission and analytics. ""The reality is that GPU costs have become prohibitive for many organizations doing important AI research,"" said Jieyi Long, CTO of Theta Labs. ""Universities are telling us they're having to scale back projects or wait months for access to affordable computing resources. By tapping into the unused GPU power sitting in gaming computers and workstations around the world, we can deliver the same computational capabilities at a fraction of the cost. This means our partners at Stanford, KAIST, and other institutions can run more experiments, iterate faster, and push the boundaries of what's possible in AI research without budget constraints limiting their ambitions."" Technical Capabilities The hybrid architecture supports containerized computing tasks including AI model training and inference, video encoding and transcoding, 3D rendering, financial simulations, and scientific computing applications. The platform provides over 80 PetaFLOPS of distributed GPU compute power through its combination of cloud partnerships with Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services and its distributed edge network. The EdgeCloud client node is a lightweight software package that enables community members to contribute their idle GPU capacity. Advanced job containerization ensures high-efficiency computation across different GPU types and specifications. To learn more about the EdgeCloud client software, please check out this link .

NEAR Protocol historic price sentiment NEAR price history The Near Protocol (NEAR) began its journey in August 2020, aiming to create a scalable and permissionless blockchain. The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that was expected to continue into December. However, the month saw NEAR plummet from heights of $7.00 to fall below $5 before closing the month. In January the price could not find a stable foothold and the price continued dwindling, closing the month just above $4.00 In February the price fell significantly towards the $3.00 mark and continued to decline ending the month at $2.80. In March the price continued to decline ending the month near $2.50, a trend that continued in April ending the month at $2.35. In May the price recovered but only to the extent of reversing April’s losses as the month ended below $2.50",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|NEAR,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-25 21:35:00

The announcement of the zkLend shutdown , a prominent decentralized lending protocol on Starknet, serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks and challenges within this innovative yet evolving sector. For many, it raises critical questions about trust, security, and the future of DeFi itself. What Exactly Led to the zkLend Shutdown ? The decision by zkLend (ZEND) to cease operations was not made lightly. Announced via their official X account, the core reason cited was a profound loss of user trust following a recent exploit. While specific details of the exploit were not extensively publicized by zkLend in their initial announcement, the damage was evidently severe enough to erode confidence beyond repair. This incident, combined with the subsequent ZEND token delisting from major cryptocurrency exchanges, created an insurmountable challenge for the protocol. A decentralized lending protocol like zkLend relies heavily on the integrity of its smart contracts and the trust users place in its ability to manage assets securely. When an exploit occurs, it directly undermines this foundation. The delisting of the ZEND token further exacerbated the situation, significantly reducing its liquidity and utility, making it difficult for users to trade or even understand the value of their holdings. This chain of events painted a grim picture for the protocol’s viability. Loss of Trust: The exploit directly impacted user funds or the perceived security of those funds, leading to a rapid withdrawal of confidence. Token Delisting: Major exchanges removing ZEND token support severely limited its market presence and accessibility. Operational Viability: Without user trust and a functional token, maintaining operations became unsustainable. How Does a Decentralized Finance Exploit Impact User Confidence? A decentralized finance exploit is more than just a financial loss; it’s a breach of the core promise of DeFi – a trustless, secure financial system. When a protocol is compromised, it sends shockwaves through the entire ecosystem, making users wary of other platforms, even those unrelated. The zkLend incident is a painful example of how quickly trust can erode in the absence of robust security measures and effective incident response. Exploits in DeFi can take many forms, from flash loan attacks and re-entrancy bugs to oracle manipulations and governance vulnerabilities. Each type leverages a specific weakness in a protocol’s smart contract code or its economic design. The aftermath often includes: Type of Exploit Brief Description Impact on User Confidence Flash Loan Attacks Borrowing large sums without collateral, manipulating asset prices, and repaying within one transaction. Creates fear of market manipulation and instability. Re-entrancy Bugs A malicious contract repeatedly calls a vulnerable contract before the first execution is complete, draining funds. Highlights fundamental smart contract vulnerabilities. Oracle Manipulation Attacker feeds incorrect price data to a protocol, leading to unfair liquidations or profitable trades. Undermines the reliability of price feeds and fair market operations. Governance Exploits Malicious actors gaining control over a protocol’s governance to pass harmful proposals. Raises concerns about centralized points of failure in ‘decentralized’ systems. Such incidents not only lead to direct financial losses for affected users but also contribute to a broader skepticism about the safety and maturity of the DeFi space. They underscore the critical need for continuous auditing, bug bounty programs, and robust security frameworks. What Does This Mean for the Starknet Protocol Ecosystem? zkLend operated on the Starknet protocol , a prominent Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. While the exploit directly targeted zkLend’s smart contracts, not Starknet’s underlying infrastructure, any major incident on a high-profile dApp can cast a shadow on the broader ecosystem it resides within. Starknet, known for its innovative ZK-rollup technology, aims to provide scalable and low-cost transactions for decentralized applications. For the Starknet community, the zkLend shutdown is a moment for reflection. It highlights that even on highly secure and advanced Layer 2 solutions, the security of individual applications remains paramount. Starknet itself employs robust cryptographic proofs to ensure transaction integrity and security at the protocol level. However, applications built on top of it, like zkLend, are responsible for their own smart contract security and auditing. This incident serves as a reminder for all developers building on Starknet to prioritize security from the ground up, emphasizing: Rigorous Auditing: The necessity of multiple, independent security audits for all smart contracts. Community Vigilance: The role of the community in identifying and reporting potential vulnerabilities. Developer Best Practices: Adherence to secure coding standards and continuous vulnerability testing. Ultimately, the strength of the Starknet protocol ecosystem depends on the collective security posture of all its constituent applications. This incident, while unfortunate, can serve as a catalyst for enhanced security practices across the board, reinforcing Starknet’s commitment to a secure and scalable future for DeFi. What Actionable Steps Can Users Take for Better Crypto Security ? The zkLend incident is a powerful reminder that users must take proactive steps to ensure their own crypto security . While protocols strive for perfection, vulnerabilities can emerge. For those participating in decentralized finance, personal due diligence is not just recommended; it’s essential. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Your Holdings: Avoid putting all your assets into a single protocol, no matter how reputable it seems. Spread your investments across multiple, well-vetted platforms. Understand the Risks: Before interacting with any DeFi protocol, take the time to understand its mechanics, its smart contract architecture, and its unique risks. Read whitepapers, documentation, and independent reviews. Verify Audits: Check if the protocol has undergone multiple, reputable security audits. While audits don’t guarantee invulnerability, they significantly reduce the risk of known exploits. Look for reports from well-known firms. Use Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, always use a hardware wallet (e.g., Ledger, Trezor). This keeps your private keys offline, significantly reducing the risk of online theft. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources, security researchers, and the official channels of the protocols you use. Be alert to any security warnings or suspicious activity. Revoke Permissions: Regularly review and revoke unnecessary token approvals from your wallet. Malicious protocols can exploit lingering permissions to drain your funds. Beware of Phishing: Always double-check URLs and sender identities. Phishing scams are a common way for attackers to gain access to your wallet or personal information. Empowering yourself with knowledge and practicing sound security habits is the best defense in the dynamic and sometimes perilous world of decentralized finance. Your crypto security is ultimately your responsibility. What Are the Implications of the ZEND Token Delisting and Recovery Plans? The ZEND token delisting from major exchanges marks a definitive end to its public trading utility and liquidity. For holders, this is a significant blow, as it severely limits their ability to sell or exchange the token, effectively rendering it illiquid on centralized platforms. This action by exchanges is typically a response to a protocol’s inability to maintain certain standards, often related to security breaches or a lack of project viability. Despite the winding down, zkLend has committed to recovery efforts, albeit with limited resources. They announced that approximately $200,000 remains in their treasury, which will be allocated to a user recovery fund. While this amount may not fully cover all losses, it represents a gesture towards affected users. The challenge for zkLend will be to distribute these funds fairly and transparently, a task that can be complex in the aftermath of an exploit. Furthermore, zkLend plans to release its codebase as open-source. This move, while not directly aiding financial recovery, contributes to the broader DeFi community. Open-sourcing the code allows other developers and researchers to study the protocol, learn from its vulnerabilities, and potentially build more secure applications in the future. It’s a bittersweet legacy, offering lessons from a painful experience. The implications of such a delisting are clear: it signals a loss of confidence from the wider market and makes it incredibly difficult for the project to ever regain momentum. The focus shifts entirely from growth to damage control and, for users, to understanding any potential avenues for recovery. The zkLend shutdown serves as a potent reminder of the ongoing maturation process within the decentralized finance space. While DeFi promises innovation and financial freedom, incidents like this underscore the critical importance of robust crypto security , diligent auditing, and user vigilance. The unfortunate decentralized finance exploit that led to zkLend’s demise and the subsequent ZEND token delisting highlights the fragility of trust in an ecosystem built on code. For the Starknet protocol and the broader DeFi community, this event is a call to action. It emphasizes the need for continuous improvement in smart contract security, transparent communication during crises, and a collective effort to build a more resilient and trustworthy decentralized future. As the industry evolves, learning from these setbacks will be crucial in fostering an environment where innovation can thrive alongside unwavering security.

Lawmakers Must Find Path Forward For Crypto, Cynthia Lummis Says Speaking with Squawk Box co-anchor Joe Kernen on June 25, Lummis expressed her hopes that both the House of Representatives and the Senate could come together to enact sweeping crypto legislation . We needed to pass market legislation yesterday. The time is NOW! pic.twitter.com/4s6v8KeL3i — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) June 25, 2025 “I hope now that they’re comparing the stablecoin legislation that their financial services committee passed to the GENIUS Act, we can work together to figure out a path forward for both market structure and the GENIUS Act,” Lummis said . “I’m not saying combine them, but they both need to pass this year,” she continued. The GENIUS Act, short for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, passed through the Senate in a 68-30 vote earlier this month. The landmark stablecoin legislation will now be reviewed by the House of Representatives before it receives a final vote. “I know there is enthusiasm in the White House for having Congress send them a win in the area of stablecoins, and I’m very confident that the GENIUS Act that we worked so hard to get passed the Senate is a high-quality product that is worthy of the president’s signature,” Lummis told CNBC. Crypto Momentum Hits Capitol Hill Lummis’ comments come amid a wave of digital asset regulatory momentum on Capitol Hill as a crypto-friendlier White House takes the reins. Pro-crypto politicians have rushed to establish clear crypto regulations as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission pulls back on its regulation-by-enforcement approach to the blockchain sector as a whole. On May 5, several Republican lawmakers unveiled a discussion draft that would develop a broad regulatory framework for crypto stateside. However, whether key crypto legislation will be advanced before the end of the year remains to be seen. The post Sen.

The Moca Foundation is making waves with its ambitious plan to launch Moca Chain, a new EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain designed to revolutionize decentralized identity and data verification. This isn’t just another blockchain; it’s a foundational step towards a more secure, user-controlled internet. What Exactly is Moca Chain and Why Does it Matter? At its core, Moca Chain is envisioned as an EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain, meaning it will be a foundational network capable of hosting various decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, much like Ethereum. What sets it apart, however, is its laser focus: decentralized identity and data verification. According to a report by Cointelegraph, this specialized approach aims to tackle some of the most pressing issues in our digital world. Think about your online life today. Every platform, every service, requires you to create a new identity, often leading to fragmented data and a constant struggle to remember passwords. More critically, your personal data is often stored on centralized servers, making it vulnerable to breaches and misuse. Moca Chain seeks to flip this model on its head, empowering users with true ownership and control over their digital identities. Why is Decentralized Identity the Future? The concept of Decentralized Identity (DID) is gaining immense traction as the internet evolves. Instead of relying on centralized entities (like social media giants or banks) to verify who you are, DIDs allow individuals to create and control their own unique, verifiable digital identities. These identities are stored on a blockchain, making them immutable, transparent, and resistant to single points of failure. Here’s why this shift is crucial: Enhanced Security: By removing centralized honey pots of data, the risk of large-scale data breaches is significantly reduced. User Control: You decide who accesses your data and for how long, putting you in the driver’s seat of your digital footprint. Improved Privacy: Share only the necessary information, without revealing your entire identity. For example, prove you are over 18 without disclosing your exact birth date. Seamless Interactions: A single, verifiable identity can streamline online interactions, from logging into services to proving credentials. Moca Chain’s commitment to this paradigm could pave the way for a new era of digital trust and autonomy. The Roadmap Ahead: When Can We Expect This Layer-1 Blockchain? Building a robust Layer-1 Blockchain from the ground up is a monumental task, and the Moca Foundation has laid out a clear timeline for its launch. Enthusiasts and developers alike will be watching closely as these milestones approach: Testnet Launch: The Moca Chain testnet is anticipated in the third quarter of 2025. This crucial phase will allow developers to experiment with the network, build applications, and identify any potential vulnerabilities or areas for optimization in a non-production environment. Mainnet Launch: Following a successful testnet period, the full mainnet launch is projected for the fourth quarter of 2025. This will mark the official debut of Moca Chain, making it live and operational for real-world use cases. This phased approach is standard practice in blockchain development, ensuring stability and security before widespread adoption. The timeline suggests a thorough development process, aiming for a reliable and secure network upon launch. How Will Moca Chain Transform Web3 Identity? The rise of Web3 promises a decentralized internet, but true decentralization requires a robust framework for identity. This is where Web3 Identity solutions like Moca Chain come into play. Current Web2 identity systems are fundamentally at odds with the decentralized ethos of Web3. Moca Chain aims to bridge this gap by providing a native, blockchain-based solution for identity management within the Web3 ecosystem. Imagine logging into a decentralized application, participating in a DAO, or accessing a metaverse experience, all with a single, self-sovereign identity that you control. This eliminates the need for repeated sign-ups, reduces friction, and enhances privacy across the decentralized web. Moca Chain could become a cornerstone for verifiable credentials, digital reputations, and secure interactions in the evolving digital landscape. The Critical Role of Data Verification Beyond simply managing identities, Data Verification is another cornerstone of Moca Chain’s mission. In an age of deepfakes and misinformation, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of data is paramount. Moca Chain’s focus on this aspect means it won’t just tell you who someone is, but also verify the claims or data associated with that identity. This could have profound implications for various sectors: Supply Chains: Verifying the origin and journey of products. Academic Credentials: Ensuring the authenticity of degrees and certifications. Healthcare Records: Securely verifying patient data while maintaining privacy. Digital Assets: Proving ownership and provenance of NFTs and other digital collectibles. By integrating robust data verification mechanisms directly into its Layer-1 architecture, Moca Chain is building a foundation for a more trustworthy digital environment, where information can be validated at its source. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Trust? The Moca Foundation’s plan to launch Moca Chain in 2025 represents an exciting and potentially transformative development in the blockchain space. By prioritizing decentralized identity and data verification on an EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain, Moca Chain is positioning itself as a key player in building a more secure, private, and user-centric Web3. While the road ahead will undoubtedly present challenges, the vision of a self-sovereign digital identity for everyone is a powerful one that could redefine our online interactions for years to come.

According to the company, the summary is only visible to the user, not others in the chat. The feature is off by default, but WhatsApp shows a little icon to let the user know they can use it. Meta is releasing the function first in the US, where it will work with English. It will be available in more languages and countries by the end of the year. As availability widens, more users will be able to take advantage of these enhancements and discover new ways to catch up on their unread messages. Meta says that it will not compromise message privacy This feature uses Meta’s Private Processing technology to ensure summaries are generated securely, without compromising message privacy. The feature builds on the AI technology that Meta released in April. It allowed the company to implement AI features that don’t impact encryption or user privacy. “Private Processing will allow users to leverage powerful AI features, while preserving WhatsApp’s core privacy promise, ensuring no one except you and the people you’re talking to can access or share your personal messages, not even Meta or WhatsApp,” the company said in a blog post. The feature is available to both Android and iOS. To that end, all users will have the same experience on either operating system and will benefit from the same message summarization feature. Meta has been accused of sharing personal data by several nations in the past. One of the most recent ones is Nigeria. FCCPC Chief Executive Officer Adamu Abdullahi said investigations carried out in conjunction with the Nigeria Data Protection Commission (NDPC) between May 2021 and December 2023 revealed “invasive practices against data subjects/consumers in Nigeria.” Meta stock surge The company that owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp is working to improve the AI part of its business. For instance, it recently paid $7.4 billion for 49% of the startup Scale AI. In addition, the company was accused by OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman , of making “giant offers” to his team members, including $100 million “signing bonuses.” These events backed larger market trends and gave investors more faith in Meta’s ability to grow in the future. As of the end of the last quarter, Meta’s stock price went up 18%, which is more than the market’s 12% rise over the past year. Looking at the company’s longer-term performance, Meta’s total shareholder return, including share price and dividends, reached 336.81% over three years. This did much better than the US Interactive Media and Services industry and the market over the past year. Meta’s return was higher than the industry’s 7.4% return and the market’s 12.2% return during the same period. The 18% rise in Meta’s stock price over the last quarter also differs from the average analyst price goal of $703.89, which suggests room for more growth than the market expects. Pavel Durov accuses WhatsApp of copying Telegram In an interview , Pavel Durov said that Meta has employed a team to watch their moves. He says WhatsApp applies their ideas after Telegram uses them for 5 years. He said, “WhatsApp copies everything we do with a five-year delay… But it doesn’t bother me, it validates our choices. I’ve already met Mark Zuckerberg. I respect him as a business leader, but, with such means, I still think they could show more imagination.” However, Telegram does not employ a default chatbot on the app. Instead, users have been given the liberty to integrate the chatbot of their choice.

Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a fast-emerging DeFi protocol still in its presale phase, has become a standout in this rotation. The project has already acquired over 12,400 investors who have chipped in $11.1 million while the presale is ongoing. Investors participating in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will enjoy a 100% return on investment when it goes live at $0.06. While ETH cools, MUTM has gained momentum on speculation that it could deliver up to 50x returns once it launches. Ethereum Retreats to $2270, as Market Caution Dominates Ethereum (ETH) is trading at around $2,270 at a 5.6 percent drop over 24 hours as a result of the rising macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. On-chain data indicates cooling off in the volume of transactions and a decline in network fees, which are now at multi-year lows, indicating less activity on the part of users. Even though there seems to be technical support around the $2,200-2,300 level, there is negative sentiment due to overall losses experienced in markets. With barterers recalibrating their portfolios on greater cap assets, niche DeFi plumpings, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), are upshot to entice a little above the fireside. Game-Changer: Mutuum Finance Disrupts DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is revolutionizing a new generation lending platform where users retain full ownership of their assets and passively diversify to optimize the earning potential using a flexible safe system. The system is an effective dual-lending system that combines the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model uses a smart contract to control lending pools whose interest rates are floating. The system is made responsive to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes returns to lenders more certain and borrowers financially sound. In the meantime, there are also the like of the P2P model which completely excludes middlemen and allows the user to agree on terms among themselves. That sort of setup of direct lending is particularly helpful with less stable assets such as those of meme coins since flexibility and control take priority there. Phase 5 of the Mutuum Finance Presale Is Underway, $11.1M+ Raised Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) presale became a record by raising over $11.1 million, attracting over 12400 token holders. It is currently on Phase 5 investor confidence continues to grow as the platform distinguishes itself from short-term meme coins. Mutuum Finance Stablecoin and CertiK Audit In yet another step to further build its ecosystem Mutuum Finance is soon to launch a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Contrary to algorithmic stablecoins which have been challenged by price stability problems Mutuum Finance’s stablecoin is to be backed by real assets. The platform has also undergone a security audit by CertiK one of the most known names in blockchain security. With Ethereum (ETH) having a possible retracement heading back to the $2,000 mark, investors are seeking other platforms with high-upsides, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is swiftly gaining popularity. At the $0.03 at the Phase 5, the project has already generated more than 11.1 million and 12,400+ early investors, which is an indication of an increased faith in the long-term scheme of the project. Universally supported by CertiK auditing, an incoming fully-collateralized stablecoin, and an immensely strong, dual-lending DeFi model, Mutuum Finance is truly unique not only in its innovation but its explosive, upside potential, with analysts predicting a potential 50x gain after its launch.

33767162,[object Object],1750888807,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,XRP Ledger Upgrade Goes Live—Rippled 2.5.0 Changes It Forever,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-rippled-2-5-0/,"The XRP Ledger just took a major step forward. On June 25, Ripple officially released version 2.5.0 of rippled, the reference implementation of the protocol—and with it, a series of proposed amendments that could reshape the very architecture of how decentralized finance operates on the network. Chief among them: the long-anticipated rollout of permissioned domains and batch transaction processing, amendments that some insiders believe may be transformative—or even divisive. According to the official release notes , the upgrade opens voting on seven amendments, each targeting a critical area of ledger functionality. Most headline-grabbing is XLS-81 (PermissionedDEX), which introduces credential-gated domains within the XRPL’s decentralized exchange. These permissioned domains would restrict participation to KYC-verified actors, enforcing compliance rules directly on-chain. In parallel, XLS-75 (PermissionDelegation) enables more flexible account management, XLS-56 (Batch) allows atomic execution of grouped transactions, and XLS-85 (TokenEscrow) extends escrow capabilities to IOUs and multi-purpose tokens. Smaller but crucial patches—like PayChanCancelAfter and EnforceNFTokenTrustlineV2—address edge-case vulnerabilities. Notably, AMMv1_3 introduces invariant checks for XRPL’s evolving automated market maker (AMM) functionality, marking a tightening of protocol-level controls for on-chain liquidity operations. Still, it is the PermissionedDEX functionality that has triggered the loudest reaction among analysts, raising complex questions about liquidity, compliance, and the future role of XRP in bridging segregated financial environments. Rippled 2.5.0 Redefines The XRP Ledger Ecosystem Renowned XRP commentator WrathofKahneman framed the significance starkly: “This latest release of RippleD, 2.5.0 includes amendments that may change the XRPL ecosystem forever, especially permissioned domains. They may be the best way to bring big money on chain, but they also segregate liquidity.” That concern—liquidity fragmentation—has become central to the debate. In a prior thread dated June 17, Wrath explained that XLS-80, the technical foundation for permissioned domains, would allow the creation of decentralized exchange environments restricted to credentialed participants. This structure introduces the possibility that, for example, a regulated entity like Bank of America could trade XRP/ RLUSD pairs in a domain inaccessible to retail participants, fragmenting the DEX into parallel liquidity silos. While this may increase compliance and institutional appeal, it complicates the DEX’s market efficiency. “You might trade XRP/RLUSD while BofA is trading it alongside using orders you aren’t credentialed to participate in,” Wrath noted. The fragmentation resembles Ethereum’s KYC-gated DeFi pools, though XRPL’s approach embeds permissions directly at the protocol level. This protocol-native compliance could give it a strategic edge. Ethereum-based solutions like Aave Arc rely on off-chain verification layers and segregated contract deployments. XLS-80, in contrast, enforces credential logic within the ledger itself. As Wrath wrote: “XLS-80 would embed compliance directly into the protocol. In contrast, Ethereum handles compliance off-chain.” Still, the liquidity segmentation raises inevitable arbitrage questions. X user blk4432 observed: “I think they would arbitrage XRP between public and private. I think greed wouldn’t allow entities to leave money on the table because ‘walled garden.’” Wrath replied in agreement, adding: “Anyone credentialed for one domain is also already credentialed on the main. If they can get away with it and remain compliant, I’m sure they will.” This opens the door for a new class of profit-seeking credentialed market makers, potentially including Ripple itself. Wrath theorized that Ripple could initially hold the credentials required to span all domains, allowing it to operate as a regulated liquidity bridge—facilitating trades across siloed order books and collecting spreads. “Ripple can compliantly route liquidity and arbitrage between the siloed books. That would position them as a regulated market maker,” he wrote. The implications for XRP are significant. If permissioned domains gain adoption among institutions, the token may see increased demand as a bridging asset—used to facilitate arbitrage across fragmented liquidity environments. However, that demand will be contingent on whether the market makers navigating those silos hold the necessary credentials and can do so profitably. Beyond trading, the permissioned framework could reshape other components. Future extensions could see credentialed access applied to liquidity pools in the AMM , unlocking compliant on-chain yield strategies for regulated entities—an area that’s largely out of reach for institutions on public chains today.

Today, we delve into one such groundbreaking alliance: the partnership between Aethir, a pioneering decentralized cloud GPU network, and Pendle, a leading DeFi yield protocol. This collaboration is set to unlock unprecedented opportunities for yield generation and capital efficiency, particularly for those involved in the burgeoning Web3 infrastructure space. Understanding the Aethir and Pendle Alliance At its core, this partnership represents a powerful synergy between two distinct yet complementary facets of the Web3 ecosystem. Aethir , known for its robust cloud GPU network , provides essential computing power for gaming, AI, and rendering, decentralizing a critical resource. Pendle , on the other hand, is a specialized DeFi protocol that allows users to execute advanced yield strategies by separating yield-bearing assets into principal and yield tokens. This unique approach enables fixed yield, hedging, and enhanced yield generation. The announcement, made on Aethir’s official website, confirms the integration of Aethir’s liquid staking token, eATH, into Pendle’s ecosystem. This is not just a simple listing; it’s a strategic move designed to empower Aethir stakers with new avenues for capital efficiency and yield optimization. What Does This Mean for Aethir’s Liquid Staking Token, eATH? For Aethir stakers, the introduction of eATH to Pendle marks a significant upgrade in how they can manage their staked assets. Traditionally, staking involves locking up tokens to secure a network and earn rewards. While beneficial, this often comes with a trade-off in terms of liquidity. This is where liquid staking solutions like eATH come into play, allowing users to maintain liquidity while still participating in staking. With eATH now integrated into Pendle, Aethir stakers can convert their eATH into SY-eATH (standardized yield token for eATH). This conversion is the gateway to a suite of sophisticated DeFi strategies previously unavailable for Aethir’s native staking assets. Imagine being able to earn your base staking rewards from Aethir, while simultaneously deploying your liquid eATH to generate additional yield on Pendle. This dual-earning potential is a game-changer. Unlocking Advanced DeFi Strategies with SY-eATH The beauty of Pendle lies in its ability to tokenize future yield, allowing users to speculate on or lock in future returns. With SY-eATH, Aethir stakers gain access to these powerful mechanisms. Let’s explore some of the key strategies: Fixed Yield: For those seeking predictable returns, Pendle allows users to sell their future yield (YT-eATH) upfront, effectively locking in a fixed interest rate regardless of future market fluctuations. This provides stability in volatile crypto markets. Yield Hedging: Users can hedge against potential drops in yield rates by selling future yield. This acts as a form of insurance, ensuring a minimum return on their staked eATH. Looping Strategies: More advanced users can engage in looping, where they use SY-eATH as collateral to borrow more eATH (or other assets), stake it, and repeat the process to amplify their exposure and potential yield. This requires careful risk management but can significantly boost returns. Speculation: For those with a higher risk appetite, buying YT-eATH allows speculation on an increase in Aethir’s staking yield, potentially generating significant profits if yields rise. These strategies empower Aethir holders to optimize their capital, moving beyond simple staking to become active participants in complex financial engineering within DeFi. The Broader Impact on the Cloud GPU Network Ecosystem This partnership isn’t just about Aethir and Pendle; it signals a growing trend in the Web3 space where core infrastructure projects are increasingly integrating with financial primitives. By making its staking token highly liquid and usable within advanced DeFi protocols, Aethir enhances the utility and attractiveness of its native asset. This can lead to: Increased Liquidity: More ways to use eATH mean more demand and better liquidity in secondary markets. Enhanced Staker Participation: The promise of additional yield opportunities can incentivize more users to stake their Aethir tokens, further decentralizing and securing the network. Bridging Infrastructure and Finance: It demonstrates how essential infrastructure like a cloud GPU network can seamlessly integrate with DeFi, creating a more interconnected and robust Web3 economy. This collaboration exemplifies how innovative projects are finding new ways to add value to their ecosystems, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in decentralized finance. What’s Next for Aethir and Pendle? The integration of eATH on Pendle is a significant milestone, but it’s likely just the beginning. As both protocols continue to develop, we can anticipate further innovations building upon this foundation. For users, it’s crucial to understand the mechanics of Pendle and the specific risks associated with advanced DeFi strategies, such as smart contract risks, impermanent loss (if providing liquidity), and market volatility. Always conduct thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before engaging in any DeFi protocol. This partnership not only benefits Aethir stakers but also strengthens the overall DeFi ecosystem by introducing a new, valuable asset class (liquid staked infrastructure tokens) into Pendle’s sophisticated yield optimization framework. It’s a testament to the continuous innovation driving the crypto space forward. Conclusion: A New Era for Decentralized Infrastructure and DeFi The strategic alliance between Aethir and Pendle marks a pivotal moment for both decentralized cloud computing and DeFi. By enabling liquid staking of eATH and unlocking advanced DeFi strategies on Pendle, this partnership empowers Aethir stakers with unprecedented flexibility and yield optimization opportunities. It reinforces the narrative that the future of Web3 lies in seamless interoperability and the creation of layered financial products built upon robust decentralized infrastructure. As the crypto market matures, such collaborations will be key to driving adoption, innovation, and capital efficiency across the digital economy.

In a new post , UK banking titan Barclays says it is barring all digital asset-related transactions on its proprietary payment cards starting on June 27th due to the volatile price of cryptocurrencies and because they are uninsured assets. “It’s not possible to make cryptocurrency transactions using a Barclaycard. From 27 June 2025, we’ll block crypto transactions made with a Barclaycard because we recognize there are certain risks with purchasing cryptocurrencies. We’re doing this because a fall in the price of crypto assets could lead to customers finding themselves in debt they can’t afford to repay. There’s also no protection for crypto assets if something goes wrong with a purchase, as they’re not covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service and Financial Services Compensation Scheme.” However, despite the recent ban on crypto assets, previous reports indicate that Barclays has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into IBIT, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded fund (ETF), which launched in January 2024 and is currently the largest BTC-based ETF by trading volume. In February, the bank disclosed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it holds 2,473,064 shares of IBIT, worth nearly $137 million at the time. IBIT is trading at 60.98 at time of writing, representing a 1.5% increase over the last 24 hours.

While institutional giants continue their relentless Bitcoin accumulation , a surprising move from an early Ethereum investor has captured the attention of the crypto community. This event serves as a potent reminder of the immense wealth generated in the early days of crypto and the diverse strategies employed by long-term holders. What Just Happened with This Ethereum Investor? According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, an address identified as 0xe927 recently executed a massive sale, offloading 4,000 ETH. This substantial amount of ETH price , valued at approximately $9.7 million at the time of the transaction, represents a significant move from a whale-tier wallet. What makes this sale particularly noteworthy is the wallet’s history: Genesis Participation: The address originally acquired 100,000 ETH during Ethereum’s Genesis sale. Incredible ROI: At the time of the ICO, ETH was priced around $0.31, meaning the investor’s initial outlay for 100,000 ETH was a mere $31,000. Current Valuation: Even after this recent sale, the remaining holdings in this wallet are still valued at roughly $243 million, showcasing an astronomical return on investment. This single transaction underscores the generational wealth created for early ICO participants who held onto their assets through multiple market cycles. Why Would an Early ICO Participant Sell Now? The decision by an early Ethereum investor to sell such a large sum naturally prompts questions. While we can only speculate on the exact motivations, several factors could be at play: Profit Realization: After years of holding, taking significant profits is a common strategy, especially given Ethereum’s substantial gains. Portfolio Rebalancing: The investor might be reallocating funds to other assets, perhaps diversifying into traditional markets, real estate, or even other cryptocurrencies. Tax Planning: Large sales often occur with tax implications in mind, potentially at opportune moments for capital gains. Personal Liquidity Needs: Despite immense wealth, individuals may require substantial liquid funds for personal investments, philanthropic endeavors, or major life events. Market Outlook: While institutions accumulate Bitcoin, some long-term holders might have a different outlook on the immediate future of the crypto market trends , choosing to de-risk. It’s crucial to remember that a single whale’s move, while significant in dollar terms, doesn’t necessarily dictate the overall market direction. The market depth for Ethereum is vast, and such sales are often absorbed without causing drastic price swings. How Do Early Investor Moves Impact ETH Price and Market Sentiment? When an Ethereum investor with such a long history makes a move, it inevitably sparks discussion. Here’s how it can influence the market: Short-Term Market Jitters vs. Long-Term Fundamentals Initially, a large sell-off can create a momentary dip in ETH price as supply temporarily outweighs demand. However, for a liquid asset like ETH, these dips are often quickly bought up by other market participants who view them as opportunities. The broader impact on market sentiment depends on interpretation. Some might view it as a bearish signal, suggesting that even early believers are cashing out. Others see it as a natural part of the market cycle, where early adopters realize gains, and new capital flows in. Contrasting Narratives: Bitcoin Accumulation vs. ETH Profit-Taking The report from Lookonchain specifically highlights the contrast: institutions are accumulating Bitcoin, while some early ICO participants are selling Ethereum. This paints an interesting picture of the evolving crypto market trends : Category Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Primary Driver Institutional Bitcoin accumulation (ETFs, corporate treasuries) Individual early investor profit-taking Market Role Digital Gold, Macro Hedge, Store of Value Smart Contract Platform, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 Infrastructure Implication Growing mainstream adoption, institutional validation Natural market cycle, liquidity for early wealth creators This dichotomy underscores the distinct roles these two leading cryptocurrencies play in the broader ecosystem and the different investor profiles they attract. What Can We Learn from This Ethereum Investor’s Move? For everyday investors, the actions of large holders offer valuable lessons, not necessarily a call to action. Here are some key takeaways: Patience Pays: The astronomical returns for this Ethereum investor underscore the power of long-term holding in nascent, high-growth assets. Profit-Taking is Natural: It’s a healthy part of any investment strategy to realize gains, especially after significant appreciation. Don’t Panic: Large sales, while attention-grabbing, are often just one piece of a much larger market puzzle. Fundamental analysis and personal financial goals should guide your decisions, not just whale movements. Diversification is Key: While ETH has been incredibly lucrative, smart investors often diversify their portfolios to manage risk. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and understanding the motivations behind large transactions can provide context without leading to impulsive decisions. The continued evolution of the market, with increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin and ongoing development in Ethereum, suggests a maturing landscape where both profit-taking and accumulation are natural occurrences. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Crypto’s Maturing Landscape The sale of $9.7 million in ETH by an early Ethereum investor is more than just a headline; it’s a fascinating case study in wealth creation and market dynamics within the crypto space. It serves as a vivid illustration of the life-changing returns possible for early ICO participants who navigated the nascent years of blockchain technology. While the news might prompt questions about the future ETH price , it primarily reflects a natural cycle of profit realization rather than a fundamental shift in Ethereum’s long-term prospects. As Bitcoin accumulation by institutions continues, the broader crypto market trends indicate a growing mainstream acceptance and maturation of the asset class. These contrasting narratives highlight the diverse forces shaping the digital economy, reminding us that every transaction tells a story of opportunity, strategy, and the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency.
