Just a year after sparking excitement and raising funds through a community-driven crowdfunding initiative, the project has announced a complete reversal, leaving many wondering what went wrong. Are you curious to know the inside scoop on why the Dogwifhat logo won’t be lighting up the Vegas skyline after all? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story. What Happened to the Dogwifhat Las Vegas Sphere Dream? The ambitious plan to project the Dogwifhat logo onto the Las Vegas Sphere was initially met with enthusiastic support from the memecoin community. Spearheaded by the pseudonymous organizer @GamesMasterFlex, the project aimed to take crypto advertising to new heights, leveraging the Sphere’s unparalleled visual impact. However, recent updates indicate a significant change of direction. According to a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), @GamesMasterFlex announced the shelving of the Sphere advertising project. This news has been confirmed by Decrypt and has sent ripples through the Dogwifhat community and the broader crypto space. But what exactly led to this sudden change of heart? Unpacking the WIF Refund and Project Shelving The announcement of the project’s cancellation was coupled with the promise of a full WIF refund to contributors. This move, while likely disappointing for those who were excited about the Sphere campaign, is being seen by many as a responsible and community-centric approach. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: Project Shelved: The Las Vegas Sphere advertising campaign for Dogwifhat is officially off the table. Full Refunds: Contributions made to the crowdfunding campaign will be returned to donors. Reason Unclear: As of now, the specific reasons behind the decision to abandon the project remain somewhat vague. The announcement from @GamesMasterFlex provided limited details beyond the project being shelved. Community Reaction: The community’s reaction is mixed, with some expressing disappointment but largely appreciating the transparency and commitment to refunding contributions. The lack of a detailed explanation for the cancellation has naturally fueled speculation within the crypto community. Was it logistical challenges, financial hurdles, or perhaps a strategic shift in marketing focus for Dogwifhat ? As we await further clarification, it’s worth considering the potential factors that might have played a role. Potential Challenges in Crypto Advertising on the Las Vegas Sphere While the idea of showcasing a memecoin like Dogwifhat on the Las Vegas Sphere is undeniably attention-grabbing, executing such a campaign comes with its own set of challenges. Let’s explore some potential hurdles that might have contributed to the project being shelved: Challenge Description Potential Impact on Dogwifhat Project Cost Advertising on the Las Vegas Sphere is known to be exceptionally expensive. Budget constraints or unexpected cost increases could have made the project financially unviable. Logistics and Regulations Coordinating advertising on a venue like the Sphere involves complex logistics and regulatory approvals. Potential bureaucratic delays or unforeseen regulatory hurdles could have stalled the project. Market Volatility The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. Fluctuations in the value of Dogwifhat or SOL could have impacted the project’s funding and feasibility over the past year. Shifting Priorities Project priorities and marketing strategies can evolve in the fast-paced crypto world. Dogwifhat team might have decided to reallocate resources to other marketing initiatives or project developments. It’s important to note that these are just potential challenges. The official reason for shelving the Las Vegas Sphere campaign and issuing the WIF refund is yet to be fully disclosed by the project organizers. Memecoin Marketing and the Power of Community The Dogwifhat Sphere campaign, even in its cancellation, highlights the unique and often unconventional marketing strategies employed in the memecoin space. These projects often thrive on community engagement and virality, and the initial enthusiasm for the Sphere idea is a testament to this. While the crypto advertising landscape is still evolving, memecoins like Dogwifhat demonstrate the power of grassroots movements and community-driven initiatives to generate buzz and attention. Here are some key takeaways about memecoin marketing: Community Focus: Memecoin marketing heavily relies on building and engaging a strong online community. Viral Potential: The goal is often to create viral moments and trends that spread rapidly across social media. Unconventional Approaches: Memecoins are known for embracing unconventional and often humorous marketing tactics. Risk and Reward: Memecoin marketing can be highly effective in gaining attention quickly but also carries inherent risks due to market volatility and project lifecycles. What’s Next for Dogwifhat and Crypto Advertising? While the Las Vegas Sphere dream might be on hold, the Dogwifhat story is far from over. The project still boasts a vibrant community and continues to be a prominent player in the memecoin arena. The decision to issue a WIF refund and shelve the Sphere campaign could even be seen as a strategic move to re-evaluate and potentially pivot towards new marketing avenues. As for crypto advertising in general, the industry is constantly experimenting with new and innovative ways to reach audiences. From social media campaigns to partnerships and sponsorships, the strategies are diverse and ever-evolving. The Dogwifhat Sphere saga serves as a reminder of both the ambitious spirit and the inherent uncertainties within the crypto space. Conclusion: Lessons from the Dogwifhat Sphere Setback The cancellation of Dogwifhat’s Las Vegas Sphere advertising campaign is undoubtedly a setback for those who were eagerly anticipating it. However, it also offers valuable lessons about the realities of ambitious projects in the fast-paced and unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. The commitment to a WIF refund demonstrates a level of responsibility and community focus that is commendable. As Dogwifhat moves forward, it will be interesting to see what new strategies and initiatives they pursue to maintain their momentum and engage their dedicated community. The world of memecoin marketing continues to be a fascinating space to watch, full of surprises and unexpected turns.

42772663,https://timestabloid.com/?p=62545,1743546536,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"ChatGPT Explains Why XRP Price Has Fallen, Despite Multiple Positive Announcements",https://timestabloid.com/chatgpt-explains-why-xrp-price-has-fallen-despite-multiple-positive-announcements/,"Software engineer and crypto enthusiast Vincent Van Code recently shared a tweet analyzing why XRP’s price declined despite multiple positive developments. His post included a conversation with ChatGPT. He asked why XRP’s price fell from $2.50 to $2 before recovering slightly to $2.16, despite major bullish announcements. The AI’s response covered several factors, with Van Code emphasizing point three, which referenced market manipulation. I asked ChatGPT why price of XRP has fallen, despite multiple positive announcements.. no 3 was the kicker, even it knows the price is manipulated, to SHAKE OUT RETAIL. Must read Prompt: There have been dozens of XRP pro announcements from FDIC. to case settlement, you name… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) March 30, 2025 The tweet suggests that XRP’s price action does not align with expectations, given the stream of favorable news, including FDIC-related announcements and the resolution of legal matters. ChatGPT outlined six primary reasons for this disconnect. Market Dynamics and Sentiment One explanation given was the common market phenomenon of “buy the rumor, sell the news.” This occurs when investors anticipate good news and price it in beforehand. Once the news becomes official, traders may take profits, leading to a selloff instead of further gains. This behavior is common in both traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets. The second factor was the broader market sentiment. Even when XRP has positive news, overall market conditions influence its ability to gain traction. Bitcoin’s price movements, macroeconomic factors like inflation concerns, and regulatory uncertainty can weigh down altcoins, including XRP. Even strong developments may not drive price increases if the general market environment is unstable. Influence of Whales and Liquidity Strategies Van Code highlighted ChatGPT’s mention of price manipulation as a significant takeaway. The AI pointed out that XRP has a history of being influenced by large holders and institutions who may intentionally push the price lower to shake out retail investors. These liquidity strategies, often employed by market makers and institutional traders, create psychological pressure on smaller investors. The suggestion that price movements may not always be driven by logical fundamentals but rather by deliberate strategies is the key focus of the tweet. Another factor mentioned was the lack of new retail money entering the market. Even with positive announcements, its price may struggle to rise if no fresh capital flows into XRP. A significant increase requires not just existing traders cycling through positions but new participants willing to buy at higher prices. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Lingering Effects of Legal Issues and Supply Considerations The AI also pointed to the residual effects of the SEC lawsuit. While the case was largely resolved in Ripple’s favor, regulatory uncertainty has left a lasting impact. Institutional investors remain cautious, while some exchanges have yet to integrate XRP trading without restrictions. These factors contribute to sentiment issues that can suppress price growth. Finally, token supply dynamics were identified as another potential reason. Ripple holds a substantial amount of XRP and distributes tokens through monthly unlocks and over-the-counter (OTC) sales. While these distributions are part of a structured plan, they can introduce selling pressure, affecting price stability. Van Code’s tweet highlights the frustration within the XRP community regarding price movements that do not seem to reflect ongoing positive developments. The response from ChatGPT outlined multiple reasons why the price may not have reacted as anticipated, with market dynamics, sentiment, liquidity strategies, and supply considerations all playing a role. The emphasis on whale manipulation as a possible factor underscores concerns that price movements in the crypto market are not always organic. Whether this is a temporary consolidation phase before a larger breakout remains uncertain. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

42772458,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145380,1743546620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Claim: Researchers Expose OpenAI’s GPT-4o Training on Paywalled Books,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-gpt4o-paywalled-books-claim/,"Is OpenAI, the giant behind ChatGPT, embroiled in another data sourcing controversy? A new report from the AI Disclosures Project is making waves with a serious accusation : OpenAI may have trained its advanced GPT-4o model using copyrighted, paywalled books from O’Reilly Media without permission. This revelation intensifies the ongoing debate about AI training data ethics and the boundaries of copyright in the age of artificial intelligence. For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals following the AI revolution, this news raises critical questions about data transparency and the future of content creation. Unpacking the Copyright Infringement Claim Against OpenAI The core of the accusation revolves around the source of data used to train sophisticated AI models like GPT-4o. Think of AI models as incredibly complex learning machines. They digest massive amounts of information – text, images, code – to identify patterns and generate outputs based on prompts. When you ask ChatGPT to write a poem or create an image, it’s drawing upon this vast knowledge base to produce its response. It’s not creating something entirely new, but rather intelligently remixing and extrapolating from what it has learned. While many AI labs, including OpenAI, are exploring AI-generated synthetic data to augment their training datasets, relying solely on synthetic data presents challenges. Performance can degrade, and the models may lose touch with the nuances of real-world data. This is where the controversy around AI training data sourcing becomes critical. The AI Disclosures Project, spearheaded by Tim O’Reilly and Ilan Strauss, suggests that OpenAI’s latest model, GPT-4o , exhibits a strong understanding of content from paywalled O’Reilly books. This is particularly concerning because O’Reilly Media, a prominent publisher of technical and business books, does not have a licensing agreement with OpenAI. Key findings from the AI Disclosures Project paper: GPT-4o’s Superior Recognition: The research indicates that GPT-4o demonstrates a significantly higher recognition of paywalled O’Reilly book content compared to OpenAI’s earlier model, GPT-3.5 Turbo. DE-COP Method: The researchers employed a technique called DE-COP, a “membership inference attack,” to assess whether AI models have prior knowledge of specific texts from their training data. This method tests if a model can distinguish between original human-written text and AI-paraphrased versions. Extensive Testing: Over 13,000 paragraph excerpts from 34 O’Reilly books were used to probe the knowledge of GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and other OpenAI models. Paywalled Content Recognition: The results strongly suggest that GPT-4o “recognized” a far greater amount of paywalled O’Reilly book content than its predecessors. GPT-4o and the Mystery of Paywalled Books: What Does It Mean for Copyright? The paper highlights a stark contrast between GPT-4o and older models like GPT-3.5 Turbo. While GPT-3.5 Turbo showed more familiarity with publicly accessible O’Reilly book samples, GPT-4o excelled in recognizing content behind paywalls. This raises serious questions about how OpenAI sourced its AI training data for its most advanced model. According to the research, “GPT-4o [likely] recognizes, and so has prior knowledge of, many non-public O’Reilly books published prior to its training cutoff date.” However, the researchers acknowledge that this isn’t definitive proof of copyright infringement . They concede that their method isn’t foolproof and that OpenAI could have indirectly accessed the book excerpts through user interactions with ChatGPT – users might have copied and pasted snippets of paywalled content into the platform. Furthermore, the study didn’t analyze OpenAI’s newest models, leaving open the possibility that data sourcing practices may have evolved. Why Does AI Training Data Matter in the Crypto and Tech World? For those in the cryptocurrency and broader tech space, the implications of this copyright infringement claim are significant: Data Ethics and Transparency: The crypto world champions decentralization and transparency. Questions around AI data sourcing mirror these concerns. Where AI models get their data and how ethically it’s obtained are crucial for building trustworthy AI systems. Impact on Content Creators: If AI models are trained on copyrighted material without proper licensing, it undermines the rights of content creators – authors, artists, musicians, and more. This could stifle creativity and innovation in the long run. Legal Battles and Regulatory Scrutiny: OpenAI is already facing multiple lawsuits regarding its data practices. This new report will likely add fuel to the fire, potentially leading to stricter regulations around AI training data and copyright . Future of AI Development: The search for high-quality AI training data is intensifying. AI companies are exploring various avenues, including licensing deals, synthetic data generation, and even hiring domain experts to inject knowledge directly into AI systems. The resolution of the copyright infringement debate will significantly shape the future landscape of AI development. OpenAI’s Stance and the Broader Industry Trend OpenAI has publicly advocated for more flexible rules regarding the use of copyrighted data for AI training . They argue that access to a wide range of data, including copyrighted material, is essential for developing powerful and beneficial AI models. The company does have licensing agreements with some publishers and offers opt-out mechanisms for copyright holders, though these are often criticized as insufficient. The trend of AI companies seeking higher-quality AI training data is undeniable. OpenAI has even hired journalists to refine its models’ output, and the industry is seeing a rise in AI firms recruiting experts across various fields to infuse specialized knowledge into AI systems. While OpenAI does pay for some training data through licensing deals, the O’Reilly paper underscores the ongoing tension between AI development and copyright law. As OpenAI navigates multiple lawsuits and increasing scrutiny, this new report from the AI Disclosures Project adds another layer of complexity to the copyright infringement debate. OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment, leaving the allegations unanswered for now.

The case challenges our assumptions about wealth and exposes risky behavior behind online allure. It sparks debate on how financial pressures can distort personal values and family ties. Andre Rebelo, an Australian crypto investor and former partner of Instagram influencer Grace Piscopo, was sentenced to 25 years in prison on April 1 in Perth after being found guilty of murdering his mother in 2020. Andre Rebelo Sentenced for Killing Mother in High-Profile Case Rebelo was convicted of murdering his mother, Colleen, after an eight-week trial where his siblings and ex-girlfriend testified. Colleen Rebelo was found dead in the shower of her suburban home in Perth on May 25, 2020, by her son. Authorities did not determine an exact cause of death, though some reports suggested possible asphyxiation. Andre Rebelo — the ex-partner of social media influencer Grace Piscopo — must have carried out some form of violent act against his mother when he killed her but exactly what he did may never be known. https://t.co/LrhqdfCWEB — The West Australian (@westaustralian) March 31, 2025 “You killed your own mother, in a particularly egregious and shocking nature,” Justice Bruno Fiannaca said. “This is a crime that right minded people would regard with horror, murdering your mother was the ultimate betrayal of her trust and everything she gave,” he added. Debt and Financial Motives Behind Andre Rebelo’s Crime According to The Sydney Morning Herald , Colleen’s therapist, Narina Sidhu, alerted police shortly following her client’s death that Rebelo had repeatedly contacted her about signing a life insurance claim in his mother’s name. Authorities found that Rebelo had created the policies himself and forged documents to claim up to AUD $1 million (around USD $627,000). Prosecutors said Rebelo and Piscopo had accumulated nearly AUD $100,000 (about USD $62,000) in debt due to their spending habits, which may have influenced Rebelo’s actions. The investigation did not uncover clear details about Rebelo’s cryptocurrency investments , but prosecutors focused instead on his financial struggles and motive. Social Media Activity and Final Sentencing Piscopo, who shares a child with Rebelo and has since separated from him, did not attend the sentencing. Two days before the sentencing, Piscopo shared a beach photo from Bali on Instagram, captioned “paradise.” Rebelo will be eligible for parole in 2047, after serving at least 25 years.

42772743,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145381,1743547216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark STABLES Act: Coinbase CEO’s Urgent Plea for Crypto Regulation Support,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stables-act-crypto-regulation-coinbase/,"Is the U.S. finally on the verge of establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets? Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes we might be. In a significant move, Armstrong has publicly urged bipartisan support for the STABLES Act, labeling its upcoming markup by the House Financial Services Committee as a potentially “historic moment” for the crypto industry. Let’s dive into why this act is so crucial and what it could mean for the future of crypto in the United States. Why is the STABLES Act a Landmark for Crypto Regulation? The STABLES Act , or the “Eliminating Backlogs Act of 2023”, is not new, but its renewed momentum is capturing significant attention. Brian Armstrong’s vocal support amplifies its importance, especially as the crypto industry navigates a complex and often unclear regulatory landscape. But what exactly makes this act so pivotal? Clarity for Stablecoins: The core focus of the STABLES Act is to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reserve asset like the U.S. dollar, are crucial for everyday crypto transactions and the broader DeFi ecosystem. Current regulations are fragmented, creating uncertainty for businesses operating with stablecoins. Federal Oversight: The act proposes to bring stablecoin issuers under federal oversight, potentially treating them more like traditional financial institutions. This could involve stricter requirements for reserves, audits, and consumer protection, aiming to build trust and stability in the stablecoin market. National Framework: A federal framework could preempt state-level regulations, creating a more unified and less burdensome environment for stablecoin issuers to operate across the U.S. This national approach is highly desired by industry leaders who seek consistent rules rather than a patchwork of state laws. Brian Armstrong’s Urgent Call for Support: A Pivotal Moment Brian Armstrong’s engagement is not just a casual endorsement; it’s an urgent call to action. His recent activity on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting both the STABLES Act and the Senate’s progress on the GENIUS Act, underscores the industry’s push for comprehensive crypto regulation . Why is his voice so important right now? Industry Leadership: As the CEO of Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., Armstrong’s opinion carries significant weight. His advocacy can influence both lawmakers and the broader public perception of crypto regulation. Timing is Critical: With the House Financial Services Committee markup approaching, Armstrong’s public appeal is strategically timed to maximize pressure on lawmakers to consider and support the STABLES Act. This is a crucial window of opportunity to shape the future of digital assets regulation. Bipartisan Push: Armstrong specifically called for bipartisan support, recognizing that for any legislation to pass and be effective, it needs to transcend partisan divides. Crypto regulation is not a Republican or Democrat issue; it’s an issue of innovation and economic competitiveness for the U.S. Beyond STABLES: The GENIUS Act and a Broader Vision for Digital Assets Armstrong also mentioned the Senate’s progress on the GENIUS Act. While the STABLES Act focuses on stablecoins, the GENIUS Act represents a broader effort to establish a comprehensive digital asset framework . How do these pieces fit together? Act Focus Significance STABLES Act Stablecoin regulation, federal oversight of issuers. Provides immediate clarity and stability to a critical segment of the crypto market. GENIUS Act Broader digital asset regulatory framework, potentially covering various types of cryptocurrencies and crypto activities. Aims to create a more comprehensive and future-proof regulatory environment for the entire digital asset ecosystem in the U.S. Both acts are vital components of building a robust and innovation-friendly regulatory landscape for crypto in the U.S. Armstrong’s mention of both signals a holistic approach, advocating for both immediate needs (stablecoin clarity) and long-term vision (comprehensive framework). What are the Potential Benefits of Clear Crypto Regulation? Why is this regulatory push so important for the future? Clear crypto regulation offers numerous benefits, not just for crypto companies but for the entire U.S. economy: Increased Investment and Innovation: Regulatory clarity reduces uncertainty, making it more attractive for institutional investors and traditional businesses to enter the crypto space. This influx of capital and talent can fuel innovation and growth. Consumer Protection: Robust regulations can protect consumers from fraud and scams, fostering greater trust in digital assets and encouraging wider adoption. Economic Competitiveness: A clear and sensible regulatory framework can position the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset space, attracting businesses and talent while preventing innovation from moving overseas. Mainstream Adoption: As regulations become clearer and more established, cryptocurrencies and digital assets can move closer to mainstream adoption, integrating further into the traditional financial system. Armstrong in D.C.: Actionable Insights and What’s Next Brian Armstrong’s presence in Washington, D.C., this week is not merely symbolic. It represents direct engagement and lobbying efforts ahead of the crucial August recess. What actionable insights can we glean from this situation? Direct Engagement Matters: Armstrong’s meetings with lawmakers demonstrate the importance of direct industry engagement in shaping policy. Crypto leaders need to be actively involved in discussions and negotiations. Education is Key: Part of Armstrong’s mission is likely to educate lawmakers about the nuances of crypto and the potential benefits of well-crafted regulation. Bridging the knowledge gap between the tech industry and policymakers is crucial. Momentum Building: The simultaneous progress on the STABLES Act and the GENIUS Act, coupled with industry advocacy, suggests a growing momentum towards comprehensive crypto regulation in the U.S. This is a space to watch closely. Conclusion: A Historic Opportunity for Digital Assets? The upcoming House Financial Services Committee markup of the STABLES Act, combined with the ongoing Senate discussions on the GENIUS Act, truly represents a historic opportunity for the United States to define its stance on digital assets . Brian Armstrong’s urgent appeal for bipartisan support is a powerful reminder that the time for decisive action is now. Whether this moment will indeed be “historic” depends on the choices lawmakers make in the coming weeks and months. The crypto community, and indeed anyone interested in the future of finance and technology, will be watching closely.

The establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as a “digital Fort Knox” is part of Bitcoin’s growing role as a long-term store of value in federal financial strategy. This transparency may influence global crypto adoption and market dynamics, as this marks a turning point for both regulation and institutional confidence in digital assets. Following President Donald Trump’s recent executive order, the US Department of the Treasury and federal agencies are expected to disclose their Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency holdings on April 5. The announcement is anticipated to reveal whether assets such as XRP, Solana, and Cardano, previously mentioned by Trump, are included in the government’s digital asset reserves. How Much Crypto Does the U.S. Really Own? Treasury Set to Reveal Holdings President Trump signs executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. White House crypto czar David Sacks says the reserve will start with 200K BTC already owned by the gov, with plans for budget-neutral accumulation. BTC price dips 3%… https://t.co/4e2bJH7c72 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 7, 2025 Trump’s executive order issued on March 6 mandated the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile. According to a presidential document published on March 11, all federal agencies were given 30 days to report their digital asset holdings to the Treasury Secretary. The directive also requires the establishment of two new offices to oversee these assets, with the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve specifically designated for Bitcoin acquired through civil or criminal forfeiture. Unlike other holdings, Bitcoin in this reserve will not be sold, positioning it as a long-term store of value akin to a “digital Fort Knox.” April 5th (this Saturday) the USA must complete a full audit of the nation’s bitcoin holdings. Depending on what we learn, might answer many of the open questions about the recent price action. — David Bailey $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) March 31, 2025 The forthcoming disclosure is expected to clarify the scope of the government’s crypto holdings, which could have broader implications for the market. David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc, noted that the audit results might help explain Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations. “Depending on what we learn, it might answer many of the open questions about the recent price action,” Bailey said. Bitcoin’s price has been highly volatile since the announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Concerns over trade tensions and recession risks have contributed to a 10% decline, with Bitcoin dropping from over $92,000 to around $82,000. According to data from Arkham Intelligence , the US government currently holds approximately 198,012 BTC, valued at around $16 billion. White House crypto czar David Sacks stated that the government has accumulated roughly 400,000 BTC through asset forfeitures over the past decade. However, about half of that (195,000 BTC) was sold, generating $366 million. If those holdings had been retained, their value today would exceed $17 billion. U.S. States Push Bitcoin Legislation Amid Federal Crypto Transparency Efforts As federal agencies prepare to disclose their crypto holdings, U.S. states are making aggressive moves to integrate Bitcoin into their financial systems. While this federal transparency initiative unfolds, individual states aren’t waiting to forge their own paths forward. According to Bitcoin Laws, at least 23 states have introduced Bitcoin reserve bills, with 35 proposals still under consideration. Kentucky recently took a big step, with Governor Andy Beshear signing the “Bitcoin Rights” bill (HB 701) into law . This legislation grants residents the right to self-custody Bitcoin and supports crypto mining, reinforcing Kentucky’s position as a major mining hub. Kentucky is currently responsible for 11% of the U.S. Bitcoin hash rate. NEW: North Carolina Bitcoin Investment Bill House Bill 506 would create a new independent NC Investment Authority headed by the Treasurer. The NCIA would have authority to invest 5% of various state funds in digital assets. pic.twitter.com/YuYmI8YyY2 — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) March 25, 2025 Other states are following suit. Oklahoma’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB 1203) cleared the House with a 77-15 vote and is now awaiting Senate approval. If passed, it would allow state funds to be allocated to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Meanwhile, Arizona lawmakers advanced two key bills, SB 1373 and SB 1025, permitting the state treasurer to invest up to 10% of reserve and pension funds into Bitcoin. North Carolina is also exploring crypto investments, with multiple bills proposing to allocate up to 10% of state funds to digital assets. If enacted, these measures could provide long-term financial protection against inflation while reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in public finance. According to Bitcoin Laws, if these state initiatives proceed, they could result in up to $23 billion in Bitcoin purchases, potentially adding 247,000 BTC to government reserves. The upcoming federal crypto disclosure represents an interesting moment in US financial policy. As federal agencies prepare to reveal their holdings while states increasingly incorporate Bitcoin into their financial frameworks, the nation appears to be at a crossroads. The transparency initiative could legitimize cryptocurrencies as a mainstream asset class and potentially influence global adoption patterns. Regardless of whether this signals the beginning of a new era where digital assets become integral to national financial strategy, the April 5 disclosure will undoubtedly provide crucial insights into the government’s long-term vision for cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How could the U.S. Treasury’s crypto holdings transform global perceptions of Bitcoin? The U.S. could legitimize Bitcoin as a strategic asset by publicly holding it, potentially influencing other nations to adopt similar reserves and accelerating Bitcoin’s mainstream acceptance. What does this disclosure mean for state-level Bitcoin reserve initiatives? Federal transparency might encourage states to expand their Bitcoin legislation, which could directly create a unified national approach to integrating digital assets into public finance. How might this influence institutional investment in cryptocurrencies? A federal endorsement of crypto holdings could ignite institutional confidence, drive inflows into digital assets, and foster broader market participation. Of course, this all depends on broader macroeconomic forces and other factors.

42773171,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145382,1743547814,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Explosive Growth: Crypto M&A Transactions Soar to Record Highs in Q1,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-ma-transactions-record-high/,"Get ready for a seismic shift in the crypto landscape! The first quarter of this year has witnessed an unprecedented surge in crypto-related mergers and acquisitions (M&A), signaling a major evolution within the digital asset space. Buckle up as we delve into the details of this explosive growth and explore what it means for investors, businesses, and the future of cryptocurrency. Crypto M&A Transactions Reach Unprecedented Heights The numbers are in, and they’re staggering. According to a recent report from M&A consulting firm Architect Partners, as highlighted by Blockworks, the world of Crypto M&A has just experienced its most active quarter ever. We’re talking about a whopping 62 deals finalized in just the first three months of the year! To put this into perspective, this figure nearly doubles the 33 transactions recorded in Q3 of last year. This dramatic increase underscores a significant acceleration in consolidation and strategic partnerships within the crypto industry. What’s Fueling this Cryptocurrency Acquisitions Frenzy? So, what’s behind this dramatic uptick in Cryptocurrency Acquisitions ? Several factors are likely contributing to this surge: Market Maturation: The crypto market is maturing. Early-stage projects are evolving, and established companies are looking to expand their reach and capabilities. M&A provides a faster route to growth than organic expansion. Strategic Consolidation: In a competitive market, companies are merging to gain a competitive edge, consolidate market share, and eliminate redundancies. This is a natural progression as the industry matures. Access to Talent and Technology: Acquiring companies can provide access to valuable talent, cutting-edge technology, and intellectual property that would be costly and time-consuming to develop in-house. Bull Market Confidence: Optimism surrounding the future of crypto, fueled by recent market uptrends and institutional adoption, is likely encouraging companies to make strategic moves and invest in growth through acquisitions. Preparation for the Next Bull Run: Companies are positioning themselves for the anticipated next bull run. Expanding through Crypto Mergers and acquisitions now allows them to capitalize on future market growth. The Prediction: An M&A Boom Alongside Crypto IPOs Adding further credence to this trend, Dan Tapiero, founder of cryptocurrency investment firm 10T Holdings, anticipated this very scenario. Speaking at Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit last month, Tapiero predicted an imminent M&A Boom Crypto wave, coinciding with the activation of crypto-related initial public offerings (IPOs). This prediction appears to be materializing even sooner than some might have expected, given the Q1 figures. Tapiero’s insight highlights a crucial point: the crypto industry is moving towards greater institutionalization and integration with traditional financial markets. M&A activity is a key indicator of this evolution, paving the way for a more structured and mature crypto ecosystem. Benefits of Crypto Mergers and Acquisitions: Why It Matters The surge in Crypto Investment Boom through M&A isn’t just about numbers; it has tangible benefits for the entire crypto ecosystem: Benefit Description Increased Innovation Mergers can combine complementary technologies and talent, fostering innovation and accelerating the development of new crypto products and services. Enhanced Market Stability Consolidation can lead to stronger, more resilient companies, reducing market fragmentation and potentially contributing to greater market stability in the long run. Wider User Adoption Larger, more established entities resulting from mergers can have greater resources for marketing and user acquisition, potentially driving wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. Improved Regulatory Compliance Larger companies often have more resources to navigate the complex regulatory landscape, leading to better compliance and increased investor confidence. Investor Confidence Boost Increased M&A activity signals a maturing market, attracting more institutional and traditional investors who see crypto as a viable and evolving asset class. Navigating the Challenges of Crypto Acquisitions While the outlook for crypto M&A is bright, it’s important to acknowledge the potential challenges: Valuation Complexity: Valuing crypto companies can be complex due to the nascent nature of the industry, fluctuating token prices, and varying business models. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape in different jurisdictions adds complexity to cross-border M&A deals. Integration Hurdles: Integrating different company cultures, technologies, and teams can present significant challenges post-acquisition. Talent Retention: Retaining key talent from acquired companies is crucial for successful integration and value realization. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market can impact deal valuations and post-acquisition performance. Examples of Crypto M&A in Action While specific details of the 62 Q1 deals are still emerging, we can look at past examples to understand the types of Cryptocurrency Acquisitions happening in the space. These include: Exchanges Acquiring Infrastructure Providers: Major exchanges might acquire custody solutions or blockchain analytics firms to enhance their service offerings and security. NFT Marketplaces Merging: Consolidation in the NFT space could see larger marketplaces acquiring smaller, niche platforms to expand their reach and NFT categories. DeFi Protocols Combining Forces: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols might merge to create more comprehensive and robust financial ecosystems. Traditional Finance Entering Crypto: We could see traditional financial institutions acquiring crypto firms to gain a foothold in the digital asset market and offer crypto-related services to their clients. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors So, what does this Record Crypto M&A activity mean for you? Keep an Eye on M&A News: Stay informed about merger and acquisition announcements in the crypto space. These deals can signal shifts in market dynamics and identify emerging leaders. Research Acquired Companies: Pay attention to companies being acquired. Their technologies and teams might become integral to larger crypto ecosystems. Consider Investing in Consolidating Sectors: Sectors experiencing consolidation through M&A could present investment opportunities as stronger, more competitive entities emerge. Understand the Long-Term Implications: M&A activity points towards the long-term maturation and institutionalization of the crypto market. This trend could lead to greater stability and broader adoption. Conclusion: A New Era of Crypto Evolution The explosive growth in crypto M&A during Q1 is not just a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful indicator of the crypto industry’s evolution. As the market matures, strategic consolidation and acquisitions will likely become even more prevalent. This wave of mergers and acquisitions promises to reshape the crypto landscape, fostering innovation, enhancing market stability, and paving the way for wider adoption. The future of crypto is being built through strategic alliances and powerful combinations, and the Q1 M&A figures are just the beginning of this exciting new chapter.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-projects-xrp-price-to-702-heres-the-timeline/,"Crypto analyst and social media figure CryptoSensei posted a tweet that presented a speculative future price trajectory for XRP. The tweet included a video in which an individual used a pen to tap on various projected price levels, outlining what appeared to be a trading strategy from the present time into 2026. WATCH THE PEN MOVE! $2.13 $3.40 → $7.60 $29.50 → $702.50 $XRP #XRP #Ripple pic.twitter.com/nAJwkzWe7x — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) March 30, 2025 Breakdown of CryptoSensei’s Price Projection The video began by showing XRP’s current price at €2.40 before moving to three days later, where the asset was depicted at €2.13 with a signal to buy. One week later, XRP was projected at €7.60 with an indication to sell. Two weeks into the future, the price was marked at €3.40, with another buy signal. The next target was set at €29.50 in seven months, again with a recommendation to buy. The final projection is extended to 2026, displaying a price of €705.50 with the word “Rich” written alongside it. The numbers in the caption, although in a different currency, reflected the price points highlighted in the video, reinforcing the suggested pattern of accumulation and selling. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reaction The post attracted responses from XRP holders and cryptocurrency traders. Some showed enthusiasm, and others expressed skepticism. One response from a user named The Real Sazkuach stated: “So if I draw some lines and tap my pen real hard, then this lends credence to my guess of future value? Fucking ridiculous.” This comment conveyed criticism of the methodology presented in the video, questioning the legitimacy of the predictions based on visual cues rather than technical analysis or fundamental factors. Broader Context XRP has been a focal point in the cryptocurrency space due to its association with cross-border payments and ongoing regulatory discussions. Price predictions for the asset have varied widely, with some analysts forecasting significant long-term appreciation and others remaining cautious. CryptoSensei’s projection aligns with a more optimistic outlook, but its validity remains uncertain. Market participants have historically been drawn to speculative forecasts, particularly in the volatile cryptocurrency sector. While some traders may interpret such projections as potential scenarios, others emphasize the importance of research, historical trends, and external market influences when considering future price movements.

33767162,[object Object],1743548401,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,April 5 Could Be A Game-Changer For Bitcoin: Here’s What To Watch,https://bitcoinist.com/april-5-game-changer-bitcoin/,"The US Department of the Treasury and other federal agencies are expected to disclose their holdings of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies on April 5. The upcoming reveal stems from President Donald Trump’s executive order on March 6, which called for the formation of both a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) and a broader Digital Asset Stockpile. According to a presidential document published on March 11, all federal agencies must submit their digital asset holdings to the Treasury Secretary within 30 days of the order. The Treasury Secretary has also been instructed to establish two offices designed to manage government-held digital assets. The SBR in particular, will hold Bitcoin acquired through criminal or civil forfeiture with a mandate not to sell the BTC—akin to a “digital Fort Knox” for long-term value storage. The upcoming audit results could offer greater clarity on Bitcoin’s recent price movements, according to David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc and a close advisor to President Trump. On X, Bailey commented: “April 5th (this Saturday) the USA must complete a full audit of the nation’s Bitcoin holdings. Depending on what we learn, might answer many of the open questions about the recent price action.” When asked about the public release of the audit findings, Bailey responded, “I imagine we’ll learn quickly.” He also speculated on whether the US might hold more or fewer BTC than expected, remarking, “I suspect less but it’s just a guess.” In response to a question on how the amount of US government-held BTC could influence market sentiment, Bailey maintained an optimistic stance: “Everything is bullish for Bitcoin.” Questions Over US Bitcoin Holdings Speculation around the actual figure the government holds has been fueled in part by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), who spoke at the Digital Asset Summit on March 19. She indicated that the prior administration may have sold a significant portion of the United States’ confiscated BTC. These holdings, thought to exceed 207,000 BTC based on forfeitures tied to illicit activities, could form the foundation for the newly created Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. “We’re trying to find out how much Bitcoin and whether they are fully surrendered to US custody,” Lummis said. “We think that could be the basis for the first year’s installment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. We think the United States has held about 200,000 Bitcoin in asset forfeiture. What we don’t know is how much of that the Biden administration was selling right before the Trump administration took office.” Although official numbers remain unverified, Bo Hines, Executive Director of the US Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, offered further insight into the government’s prior dealings. In an interview two weeks ago, Hines suggested the US once possessed around 400,000 BTC, having sold approximately half for a fraction of its present market value. He lamented the missed opportunity: “If we would have held on to that, it would have been worth $17 billion today. I mean, it just goes to show you how important this asset is and what we can do with it to benefit the American people.” Hines also confirmed that budget-neutral expansion of US Bitcoin reserves is a priority. “We feel like it’s in the best interest of Americans to hold on to this asset long term and accumulate as much as we can get. … We’ve talked about building the digital Fort Knox for the United States,” he said, adding that an internal working group is currently exploring methods to achieve this goal without burdening taxpayers.

The buzz is building as Hut 8 Mining, a prominent name in the Bitcoin mining arena, has teamed up with an investment group boasting ties to the Trump family. Together, they’re charting a course to launch American Bitcoin Corp. onto the public market through an Initial Public Offering (IPO). This bold move is not just about raising capital; it’s a strategic play to redefine the future of Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure. Are you prepared to witness the dawn of a new era in crypto? What’s the Buzz Around this Bitcoin IPO? The news, initially reported by Bloomberg, details the ambitious plan for American Bitcoin Corp. to go public. This isn’t just another company entering the market; it’s a venture born from the collaboration of Hut 8 Mining and a significant investment group linked to Donald Trump’s sons. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot has articulated a vision of synergy, aiming to forge two distinct yet interconnected public entities. One will concentrate on the bedrock of energy and infrastructure, while the other will laser-focus on Bitcoin mining operations and reserve management. The ultimate goal? A vertically integrated powerhouse poised to dominate the Bitcoin space. Let’s break down what makes this Bitcoin IPO so noteworthy: Strategic Separation: Hut 8 is aiming to split its operations into two publicly traded companies. This allows for focused management and potentially unlocks greater value in each sector. Vertical Integration: By controlling both energy/infrastructure and Bitcoin mining, American Bitcoin Corp. aims for greater efficiency, cost savings, and resilience. Trump-Linked Investment: The involvement of a group connected to the Trump family adds a layer of political and potentially influential backing to the venture. Capital Raise: The IPO is designed to inject significant private capital into American Bitcoin Corp., fueling its growth and expansion plans. Hut 8 Mining: A Strategic Power Play? For Hut 8 Mining, this move appears to be a calculated step towards optimizing its business structure and capitalizing on the burgeoning Bitcoin mining industry. Splitting into two specialized companies could offer several advantages: Aspect Energy & Infrastructure Company Bitcoin Mining & Reserves Company Focus Developing and managing energy resources and infrastructure crucial for Bitcoin mining. Operating Bitcoin mining facilities and managing Bitcoin reserves. Potential Benefits Attract investors interested in energy and infrastructure assets; potentially more stable revenue streams. Attract investors focused on Bitcoin and crypto assets; direct exposure to Bitcoin price movements. Synergy Provides stable, cost-effective energy for the mining company. Guaranteed demand for energy and infrastructure services. This strategic separation allows each entity to pursue its specific goals more effectively and attract different types of investors. The energy and infrastructure arm can focus on innovation in sustainable energy solutions for mining, while the Bitcoin mining company can concentrate on maximizing hash rate and Bitcoin accumulation. Why is Trump Crypto Group’s Involvement Significant? The involvement of an investment group with ties to the Trump family injects a unique dimension into this Cryptocurrency IPO. While the specifics of the group and their exact roles are still unfolding, the Trump name carries significant weight, particularly within certain political and economic circles. Here’s why their participation is generating considerable interest: Brand Recognition: The Trump name is globally recognized and can attract media attention and investor interest. Political Influence: Depending on the level of involvement and future political endeavors, this could signal a growing acceptance or even advocacy for Bitcoin within certain political spheres. Investor Network: The Trump network could bring in a new wave of investors who might not have previously considered Bitcoin ventures. Potential for Controversy: The Trump association could also attract controversy and scrutiny, both positive and negative, impacting public perception and market sentiment. It remains to be seen how deeply the Trump-linked group will be involved and what long-term implications their participation will have on American Bitcoin Corp. and the broader crypto industry. However, it undeniably adds a layer of intrigue and complexity to this IPO. Benefits of Investing in a Bitcoin Venture IPO Considering an investment in a Bitcoin Venture IPO like American Bitcoin Corp. presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. Let’s explore some potential benefits: Early Access: IPOs offer the chance to invest in a company at its initial public offering price, potentially before broader market awareness drives up valuation. Growth Potential: Bitcoin mining and related infrastructure are growth sectors, and a vertically integrated company like American Bitcoin Corp. could be well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. Diversification: Investing in a Bitcoin-focused company can provide portfolio diversification, especially for those seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency market without directly holding Bitcoin. Transparency of Public Markets: Publicly traded companies are subject to regulatory scrutiny and reporting requirements, potentially offering greater transparency compared to private crypto ventures. However, it’s crucial to remember that IPOs and crypto investments are inherently risky. Thorough due diligence and understanding your risk tolerance are paramount before making any investment decisions. Challenges and Considerations for American Bitcoin Corp. While the Bitcoin IPO of American Bitcoin Corp. is generating excitement, it’s essential to acknowledge the potential challenges and considerations: Bitcoin Price Volatility: The profitability of Bitcoin mining is heavily dependent on Bitcoin’s price, which is known for its volatility. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving and can pose risks to mining operations. Competition: The Bitcoin mining industry is competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Energy Costs: Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive, and fluctuating energy prices can impact profitability. Execution Risk: Successfully splitting into two companies and achieving vertical integration is a complex undertaking with execution risks.

The significant milestone attained by Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain of Shiba Inu, could be an indication of the growing adoption of the token within the cryptocurrency space. Related Reading: Could XRP Actually Reach $10,000? Expert Weighs In Shiba Inu Milestone: 1 Billion Transactions Reports disclosed that in less than two years, Layer-2 blockchain Shibarium has already made a mark in the crypto space after the token has processed its 1 billionth transaction. Meme coin Shiba Inu only introduced Shibarium in August 2023 and four months before celebrating its second anniversary, its transaction volume has surpassed the 1 billion mark. Analysts said that Shibarium achieved the incredible feat of 1 billion transactions yesterday, March 31, noting that the Layer-2 blockchain was able to reach that level after recording four million transactions daily. As of writing, Shiba Inu’s blockchain has reached the record level with a current transaction volume of over 1.001 billion. Market observers believed that Shibarium’s achievement suggested that the blockchain can handle high transaction volumes, which they attributed to the token’s robustness and the active participation of the blockchain community. Faster Than Bitcoin Crypto analysts said that other blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have already processed more than a billion transactions. However, they noted that what makes Shibarium’s achievement stand out is the speed at which it reached that remarkable feat. Market observers compared Shibarium with other established blockchains that attained the same mark. They explained that Shibarium’s journey to attain 1 billion transactions is unique because the Layer-2 blockchain achieved it faster than the other blockchains. For example, Bitcoin needed 15 years to reach 1 billion transactions, while Shibarium did it in less than two years. Over 193 Milion Addresses Aside from the milestone in transactions, the popular L2 blockchain also has more than 193.93 million blockchain addresses that have interacted with Shibarium since it was introduced in 2023. According to Shibariumscan, Shiba Inu’s blockchain network boasted a total of 10.23 million mined blocks, with an average block time of 5.0 seconds.

42773531,https://coingape.com/?p=246937,1743548485,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Rep French Hill Rejects Proposal for Interest on Stablecoin Holdings,https://coingape.com/rep-french-hill-rejects-proposal-for-interest-on-stablecoin-holdings/,"During a briefing on April 1, Representative French Hill addressed the ongoing discussions surrounding the regulation of stablecoins. One key aspect that has garnered attention is the proposal to allow consumers to earn interest on their stablecoin holdings. However, Hill rejected this proposal, stating that there is no consensus among lawmakers to support it. The debate has become a point of focus as the U.S. Congress moves closer to passing new legislation for stablecoins. French Hill Points Lack of Consensus Among Lawmakers Rep. French Hill, who represents Arkansas, made it clear that there is currently no agreement on the proposal for consumers to earn interest on stablecoins. In his remarks, Hill acknowledged the concerns of those advocating for this change but emphasized the lack of consensus among both the House and Senate. “I hear the point of view but I don’t think that there’s consensus among the parties or the houses on having a dollar-backed payment stablecoin pay interest to the holder of that stablecoin,” Hill stated during the briefing. French Hill comments come as part of ongoing discussions on the “STABLE Act” (H.R. 2392), which seeks to regulate stablecoins in the U.S. The legislation, in addition, aims to provide clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers and establish a framework for how these digital assets can be used in financial transactions. However, the bill, as it stands, does not include provisions for stablecoin holders to earn interest. The STABLE Act and Recent Amendments The latest version of the STABLE Act, referred to as the Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute (ANS), was made available on the Financial Committee’s website on the morning of April 2, 2025. This updated version of the bill includes recent amendments and additions. The ANS will serve as the basis for the upcoming markup session set for April 3, 2025. Despite calls from industry advocates for a more modern approach that includes interest-bearing stablecoins, the STABLE Act does not appear to have embraced these proposals. Critics argue that the legislation, as it stands, limits the potential benefits of stablecoins by restricting consumer access to interest. Those pushing for change believe that this missed opportunity may hinder the growth and development of the stablecoin market. Industry Advocacy for Interest-Bearing Stablecoins Subsequently, the debate over stablecoin interest is not limited to policymakers. Industry leaders and cryptocurrency advocates have voiced their concerns over the current legislative direction. For example, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, unlike French Hill has argued that stablecoins should be allowed to pay interest to their holders, similar to how savings accounts offer returns to consumers. Armstrong highlighted the potential benefits of allowing consumers to earn onchain interest, stating that it would democratize access to higher yields and provide more financial opportunities for the general public. “Consumers deserve a bigger piece of the pie. Opening the door for onchain interest will force us all to up our game for the ultimate benefit of consumers,” Armstrong said in a recent statement. He additionally emphasized that by enabling interest-bearing stablecoins, both the U.S. economy and global consumers would benefit from increased access to financial resources.

Each of these three projects has been building momentum for years, and now, they are primed to offer some of the best opportunities in the crypto space. But which one stands out as the best cheap crypto to buy now? Let’s take a closer look. Qubetics: The Making Major Moves in the Crypto Space Qubetics is quickly becoming a standout in the world of blockchain and decentralized technologies.

Even though the recent price weakness is often linked to the escalating US-led global trade war, several factors had already been weighing on investor sentiment long before President Donald Trump announced the tariffs. Some market participants claimed that Strategy’s $5.25 billion worth of Bitcoin purchases since February is the primary reason BTC has held above the $80,000 support. But, regardless of who has been buying, the reality is that Bitcoin was already showing limited upside before President Trump announced the 10% Chinese import tariffs on Jan. 21. Gold/USD (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph The S&P 500 index hit an all-time high on Feb. 19, exactly 30 days after the trade war began, while Bitcoin had repeatedly failed to hold above $100,000 for the previous three months. Although the trade war certainly affected investor risk appetite, strong evidence suggests Bitcoin's price weakness started well before President Trump took office on Jan. 20. Spot Bitcoin ETFs inflows, strategic Bitcoin reserve expectations and inflationary trends Another data point that weakens the relation with tariffs is the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw $2.75 billion in net inflows during the three weeks following Jan. 21. By Feb. 18, the US had announced plans to impose tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, while the European Union and China had already retaliated. In essence, institutional demand for Bitcoin persisted even as the trade war escalated. Part of Bitcoin traders’ disappointment after Jan. 21 stems from excessive expectations surrounding President Trump’s campaign promise of a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile,” mentioned at the Bitcoin Conference in July 2024. As investors grew impatient, their frustration peaked when the actual executive order was issued on March 6. A key factor behind Bitcoin’s struggle to break above $89,000 is an inflationary trend, reflecting a relatively successful strategy by global central banks. In February, the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose 2.5% year-over-year, while the eurozone Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 2.2% in March. Investors turn more risk-averse following weak job market data In the second half of 2022, Bitcoin’s gains were driven by inflation soaring above 5%, suggesting that businesses and families turned to cryptocurrency as a hedge against monetary debasement. However, if inflation remains relatively under control in 2025, lower interest rates would favor real estate and stock markets more directly than Bitcoin, as reduced financing costs boost those sectors. US CPI inflation (left) vs. US 2-year Treasury yield (right). Source: TradingView Related: Coinbase sees worst quarter since FTX collapse amid industry bloodbath The weakening job market also dampens traders’ demand for risk-on assets, including Bitcoin. In February, the US Labor Department reported job openings near a four-year low. Similarly, yields on the US 2-year Treasury fell to a six-month low, with investors accepting a modest 3.88% return for the safety of government-backed instruments. This data suggests a rising choice for risk aversion, which is unfavorable for Bitcoin. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s price weakness stems from investors' unrealistic expectations of BTC acquisitions by the US Treasury, declining inflation supporting potential interest rate cuts, and a more risk-averse macroeconomic environment as investors turn to short-term government bonds. While the trade war has had negative effects, Bitcoin was already showing signs of weakness before it began.

A breakout from a falling wedge signals bullish momentum Ripple (XRP) Stabilises at $2 as US Congress Reviews Stablecoin Bill on April 2 The cryptocurrency market witnessed a significant recovery this week, with Ripple’s XRP rebounding 5% from a local bottom of $2 to a high of $2.20 on Tuesday. The sharp 5% XRP price recovery comes as investors anticipate regulatory developments that could boost Ripple’s ecosystem, particularly with the US Congress set to review a new stablecoin bill on April 2. Ripple (XRP) Price Action | XRPUSDT The bill, expected to provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins, could play a crucial role in the adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD, a stablecoin designed to enhance liquidity and efficiency in cross-border payments. In recent weeks, Ripple executives have consistently advocated for regulatory clarity in the stablecoin sector, arguing that well-defined rules will drive institutional adoption of digital assets. Industry experts suggest that the official US stablecoin regulation bill could be pivotal growth driver for XRP price action in April 2025, with RLUSD positioned as a viable option for compliant on-chain settlements. Can Regulatory Clarity Drive XRP Price Rally? If outcome of the US Congress’ Stablecoin bill favors Ripple’s approach, XRP could experience a parabolic price surge, with some analysts predicting a climb toward the $10 mark in April. US Congress’ Financial Services Committee publishes draft version of US Stablecoin bill on Feb 6, 2025 | Source: Financialservices.house.gov Validating this narrative, analysts believe that XRP’s bullish momentum could intensify if the stablecoin bill provides a favorable regulatory environment for RLUSD and other crypto assets tied to Ripple’s payment solutions. Historically, regulatory clarity has been a key driver of price surges for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum , and a similar impact could be seen for XRP. Another major catalyst for XRP price action it the recent closure of its long-standing legal battle with the SEC, which had hindered broader institutional adoption in previous year. However, a pro-crypto stance from Trump’s administration, Ripple is poised to gain further traction in the payment and remittance sectors fruther expanding utility and adoption of the XRP native coin. Meanwhile, macroeconomic factors such as increased institutional interest in digital assets and a growing demand for stablecoin-backed payments could further support XRP’s upward trajectory. As US lawmakers finalize discussions on stablecoin regulations, Ripple’s strategic positioning in the sector could prove instrumental in driving substantial price gains for XRP in April. XRP Price Forecast for April 2025 XRP’s recent price recovery to $2.20 on Tuesday reflects growing optimism surrounding the stablecoin bill review set for April 2. If US Congress establishes clear regulations that favor Ripple’s RLUSD, the resulting institutional confidence and adoption could propel XRP toward the $10 mark in the coming weeks. With regulatory clarity acting as a potential catalyst, investors will be closely monitoring the developments in Washington to gauge XRP’s next big move. Technical indicators also align with a bullish outlook, with XRP’s price recovery to $2.20 signaling renewed buying momentum as traders anticipate regulatory clarity from the upcoming U.S. stablecoin bill review. The chart below shows XRP price recently bounced off the lower Donchian Channel band near $2.02, confirming a strong buying support at that level. XRP Price Forecast The falling wedge pattern, a bullish reversal structure, formed over several days before XRP decisively broke above the upper trendline. This breakout, supported by increased trading volume, indicates a shift in momentum. XRP now targets the $2.21 resistance, with a measured move from the wedge suggesting a rally toward $2.50. The Donchian Channel’s upper boundary at $2.21 aligns with immediate resistance, while the lower boundary at $2.02 marks key support. The RSI at 46.74 shows improving bullish momentum, recovering from oversold conditions. A move above 50 would reinforce upside strength. If XRP sustains momentum above $2.14, the next major target is $2.50. However, failure to hold this level could see a retest of $2.02 support before another breakout attempt.

Rather than immediate selling pressure, these moves could indicate a strategy to consolidate holdings during volatile times. The concentration of tokens in fewer hands may alter future network governance and influence. Improved tracking and clearer communication of such movements could help restore investor trust. The Neo Foundation denied involvement in recent NEO token sales following a 35.85% drop in price between March 24 and April 1, prompting concern across the crypto community. In a statement released after the sharp downturn, the foundation clarified that neither it nor its development arm, Neo Global Development (NGD), had sold any NEO tokens. It also ruled out any transactions by founders or core team members. The group has since begun tracking the origins of large transactions that coincided with the decline. Neo Foundation Investigates Mystery Wallet After NEO Transfer to Binance Between March 24 and April 1, the price of NEO fell from roughly $8 to $5, alarming many long-time holders. In response, the Neo Foundation and NGD launched an internal investigation to uncover the source of the volatility. Their analysis revealed significant activity tied to a Neo Legacy address that had accumulated approximately 11.8 million NEO between 2017 and 2021. The address reportedly moved over 11.1 million NEO to the Neo N3 blockchain in 2021. From there, the tokens were distributed through various wallets across several years before ending up at a Binance deposit address. We’d like to address the recent $NEO price volatility and share our investigation results. Neither Neo Foundation, Neo Global Development, Neo Founders, nor any team members were involved. We deeply value the trust and support of our community, and we’re here to navigate… https://t.co/fskCRKhezK — Neo Smart Economy (@Neo_Blockchain) April 1, 2025 Starting on March 24, 2025, around 9.25 million NEO — about 13.2% of the total circulating supply — began moving through intermediary wallets to Binance. These transfers were estimated at approximately $60 million, based on an average price of $6.50 per token. Although the timing matches the price decline, the foundation stated that the connection remains speculative. “It’s important to note that the activity of this address and the price changes are merely a correlation-based speculation,” the Neo Foundation stated. It added, “While the timing of these transfers aligns with the observed price drop, we cannot confirm a direct causal relationship at this stage.” The wallet in question still holds 2 million NEO. The Neo Foundation is now working with blockchain analytics firms and exchanges to trace the tokens further. “We understand the concerns this volatility and these large-scale transfers have caused within the Neo community, and we share your desire for clarity and stability,” the foundation stated. As the Neo Foundation continues its probe, it has pledged to keep the public informed and to maintain its commitment to the long-term stability of the ecosystem. Neo Foundation Responds as Crypto Market Volatility Intensifies NEO’s decline unfolded during a wider crypto sell-off, where altcoins and memecoins were hit by sudden liquidations on April 1. Act I The AI Prophecy (ACT) dropped nearly 60%, wiping out $96 million in value. Several meme tokens, such as HIPPO, BROCCOLI, and KISHU, followed suit with double-digit losses. Binance updated leverage & margin tiers on tokens like $ACT — and a whale got liquidated for $3.79M at $0.1877. Since then, the price of $ACT has plunged more than 50%. https://t.co/MT0EgNW8ib pic.twitter.com/CRuTR9bwSh — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 1, 2025 According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, Binance’s adjustments to its leverage and margin tiers triggered a wave of liquidations that contributed to the crash. NEO, sometimes referred to as the “Ethereum of China,” recorded a 30.8% weekly loss before recovering slightly with a 6.7% bounce. Coingecko data shows its daily trading volume has fallen 28.4% to $131 million. Once a dominant player in the blockchain sector, NEO’s market capitalization now sits at $390 million — a long way from its all-time high of $198. As the Neo Foundation continues investigating large NEO transfers to Binance, market watchers are eyeing the next developments closely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could these token movements be part of routine portfolio rebalancing rather than panic selling? Whales often shift tokens as a way to secure assets during turbulence. Such reallocation can be a precaution to manage risk, not necessarily a sign of forced liquidation. What might concentrated token flows to a centralized exchange imply for the network’s governance? When a few holders amass a larger share of tokens, it can shift voting power and decision-making influence—potentially prompting future changes in how the network is managed. How can a clearer view of these large-scale movements impact long-term investor confidence? Transparency in tracking whale activities can demystify market behavior, enabling better-informed investment decisions and ultimately reinforcing trust in the ecosystem.

With major stablecoin bills moving through Congress and a pro-crypto administration in place, Armstrong sees this as a crucial moment to shape consumer-friendly policies in the U.S. The discussion comes as World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform tied to Donald Trump’s family, prepares to launch its own stablecoin. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to X on Monday to make a case for why the U.S. should allow stablecoin holders to earn interest similar to a traditional savings account, generating widespread debate on social media. Brian Armstrong Advocates For Stablecoin Onchain Interest According to Armstrong’s March 31 X post, the crypto executive believes that onchain interest would grant stablecoins the opportunity to “function as a form of payment” while offering consumers the ability to directly garner interest themselves. https://t.co/Y7JDtkRK1R — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 31, 2025 Armstrong argues that legislation allowing stablecoin holders to earn interest on stablecoins would democratize “access to the market yield rate” and give “regular people a fair shot at growing and maintaining their wealth.” “Opening the door for onchain interest will force us all to up our game for the ultimate benefit of consumers, and will keep this innovation onshore,” Armstrong continued. “Competition breeds strength and those who innovate will win, as they should.” Critics Push Back On Coinbase CEO’s Policy Proposal Despite the digital asset entrepreneur’s enthusiasm, not everyone in the crypto community was as receptive to his policy ideas. “Why wouldn’t these be tokenized shares in money market funds subject to the securities laws ?” said one user. “Doesn’t this ultimately ask the U.S. government to pay crypto users—in dollars—for making their dollars digital?” asked another. These criticisms have emerged at a time when stablecoins are gaining political attention. World Liberty Financial Announces Stablecoin Venture While the debate over interest-bearing stablecoin continues, the broader stablecoin landscape is evolving rapidly. Armstrong’s arguments come amid news that World Liberty Financial , the crypto platform affiliated with U.S. President Donald Trump and his family, has plans to launch its own stablecoin known as USD1. The timing is noteworthy. With major stablecoin legislation currently moving through the U.S. Congress, critics of the move claim it could potentially affect political decision-making. However, Armstrong indicated that upcoming congressional discussions could serve as a key platform for advancing consumer-friendly stablecoin policy. “We have a huge opportunity in front of us right now with a pro-crypto administration and Congress actively working on new stablecoin legislation,” he said. “We can choose to level the playing field and ensure these laws pave a way for all regulated stablecoins to deliver interest directly to consumers, the same way a savings or checking account can.” As stablecoin legislation advances through Congress and prominent figures like Armstrong advocate for specific features, the debate highlights the growing intersection between traditional finance, digital assets, and public policy. The outcome of these discussions could fundamentally reshape how Americans interact with digital dollars and potentially influence global cryptocurrency adoption patterns. Whether lawmakers will incorporate interest-bearing capabilities into forthcoming regulations remains a pivotal question for the industry’s development in the United States. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What would be the benefits of onchain interest? Allowing stablecoins to pay interest could give consumers access to higher returns than traditional bank savings accounts, expand financial inclusion worldwide, and encourage global adoption of USD-backed assets. What role does Congress play in this? With stablecoin legislation currently being debated in Congress, Armstrong sees this as a key opportunity to shape policies that support onchain interest while keeping financial innovation within the U.S. How is the crypto community reacting? While some support Armstrong’s push for more financial freedom, others question whether stablecoins should be treated differently from other interest-bearing assets regulated under securities laws.

In a new interview on the Wolf of all Streets YouTube channel, Hoskinson says memecoins need to evolve and develop use cases and user bases to avoid going through a ‘dumpening’ – the practice of launching tokens with the sole aim of enriching insiders. “So a memecoin is just like the ascendancy of a celebrity that has 15 minutes of fame. It doesn’t necessarily mean that that celebrity is going to disappear forever, but they’re in a temporary state of popularity. They have to find a way to become sustainable quickly or otherwise the people stop paying attention and they die out. It’s why the 99% of the memecoins will fail, and the ones that succeed, they pivot into ecosystem-building… They have to. It’s the only way they can survive. So typically, you have to build community, you have to start doing things with that community, you have to have a reason for people to be there and continue investing. And it’s really hard because, almost always, the distributions of memecoins are built for insider dump. So the person who issues it, and the insiders who issue it, their only incentive is to pump the price to dump the price. So they have to survive the dumpening.” Hoskinson also warns that memecoins are hurting the crypto industry, as issuers tend to drain capital from market participants instead of helping boost digital asset adoption “What’s happening is you’re moving water from one side of the bathtub to the other side of the bathtub… [and] the drain is open, it goes into the founder’s pocket. So basically, you’re not adding water to the tub, you’re losing water over time… It’s net-net neutral or negative.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While meme coins like Pepe and Official Trump have captured the spotlight with sharp rises and rapid declines, BlockDAG (BDAG) is steadily progressing under real-world conditions. Pepe achieved significant early success fueled by social media, and $TRUMP rose sharply with its political timing—only to encounter issues with volatility and longevity. In contrast, BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet “Primordial” is testing economic scenarios, mining capacity, and user interaction to affirm its network’s scalability. Having accumulated over $210 million and distributed 19 billion coins, it demonstrates potential for lasting stability in a market often swayed by fleeting hype. Pepe Coin Journey: How it Excels Pepe Coin (PEPE), introduced in 2023 as a meme-inspired digital currency, has become a top-performing meme token. Initially fueled by social media excitement and strong community support, PEPE has yielded significant returns for early participants. As of March 29, 2025, the coin has increased more than 300% since its launch. Forecasts indicate it might rise between 450% and 1500% throughout 2025, depending on how the market behaves. For example, a $1,000 early stake in 2024 might now be valued at over $4,000. At present, the coin’s value is approximately $0.00001226, with potential growth expected to reach $0.0000413 by year-end. Moreover, its deflationary mechanism—automatically burning a part of each transaction—plays a crucial role in enhancing its market value. Trump Coin: Political Impact on Crypto Market Launched on January 17, 2025, just before Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration, the $TRUMP meme coin quickly became a major topic of discussion. Within just two days, its market valuation rocketed from $600 million to over $13 billion, and its price surged from $7 to a high of $75 per token—an increase of over 900%. Consequently, early backers saw returns from 300% to 19,000%, with some transforming small bets into fortunes. However, the token’s value has significantly dropped by over 50% from its highest point, currently trading between $12.50 and $14. Future predictions remain hopeful, with potential growth of 289% by the end of 2025, possibly hitting €62.97. Moreover, the Trump Organization holds 80% of the token supply, which stirs concerns about centralization and conflicts of interest. Despite generating more than $350 million through token sales and fees, the coin has faced criticisms over ethical issues and financial losses to the community. Ultimately, the $TRUMP coin illustrates both the immense possibilities and the typical risks associated with politically associated cryptocurrencies. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Evaluates Performance Under Real Conditions BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet “Primordial” serves as a realistic testing environment, mimicking the actual conditions that the mainnet will encounter once operational. It is designed to evaluate the network’s performance including transaction speeds, miner activity, and wallet interactions under genuine economic pressures. The focus extends beyond merely spotting flaws; it’s about assessing the network’s resilience in real operational scenarios. The testnet achieves this through supporting more than 2,000 transactions per second with a DAG-based Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism (GHOSTDAG) that allows for simultaneous block processing, offering a significant edge over conventional blockchain systems. With plans to integrate over 200 mining nodes and tens of thousands of wallets, the testnet is currently verifying large-scale transaction handling, precise token distribution, and the execution of EVM-compatible smart contracts. Additionally, providing incentives for leading miners and active wallets ensures that participation mirrors genuine user interactions. For early participants, the numbers provide reassurance. BlockDAG’s crypto presale has successfully gathered $210 million, with more than 19 billion coins distributed thus far. Now in its 27th batch, the price of BDAG stands at $0.0248 each, showing a 2,380% increase in value from the initial batch. These figures not only indicate a growing interest but also confirm a robust confidence in the network’s scalability. Distinguishing Genuine Progress from Mere Speculation While hype can drive quick spikes in interest and potential short-term gains, it’s the robust infrastructure that maintains lasting appeal. Pepe and Official Trump have demonstrated the effects of hype with rapid increases and sudden drops. In contrast, BlockDAG is validating its technology in a different manner. By rigorously testing its Beta Testnet in scenarios that mirror actual usage, it transcends simple market buzz to prove its technical viability. With solid presale support and observable chain activity, BlockDAG is not just chasing fleeting headlines but is establishing a foundation for sustained operation. In a market filled with transient excitement, BlockDAG emphasizes the importance of building systems that are designed to last rather than merely to impress.

CRO Rises 40%, While ZEC Targets Breakout",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-shakes-the-crypto-market-5m-in-48-hours-cro-rises-40-while-zec-targets-breakout/,"Cronos (CRO) is on the upswing as the SEC concludes its investigation into Crypto.com without charges, resulting in a 40% increase over the week. This development reflects a more supportive regulatory environment, enhanced by Crypto.com’s exploratory deal with Trump Media regarding crypto ETFs. However, despite positive news, there’s ongoing speculation about a potential reintroduction of 70 billion CRO, which could impact the token’s supply stability. Simultaneously, Zcash (ZEC) has risen by 12% in 24 hours, surpassing the crucial $33 support level, and now aims for the $45.63 resistance, signaling potential for a significant reversal after a period of low performance. While CRO and ZEC are finding their footing, BlockDAG (BDAG) has surged ahead with a $5 million increase in just 48 hours following Keynote 3, taking its presale to over $210 million. With a functioning beta testnet and substantial user engagement evidenced by over 800,000 app users, BlockDAG demonstrates effective execution beyond mere planning. CRO Climbs 40% This Week Cronos (CRO) is capturing attention again with a 40% rise this week, following the SEC’s decision to end its inquiry into Crypto.com without penalties. This marks a significant positive shift for the crypto landscape under the new SEC leadership, signaling a more lenient approach to digital assets. The enthusiasm is bolstered by Crypto.com’s tentative agreement with Trump Media to introduce crypto-backed ETFs, which propelled CRO by an additional 10% in just a day. Yet, the excitement is tempered by warnings from on-chain analyst ZachXBT about the possible return of 70 billion CRO tokens to circulation, which raises market integrity concerns. Zcash (ZEC) Surges 12% in a Day—Could This Signal a Major Market Shift? Zcash (ZEC) is regaining momentum with a 12% increase, pushing it back into the top 100 cryptocurrencies. After rallying from a low of $25 to regain the critical $33 support, this could be the start of a new upward trend after extended declines. While the immediate outlook shows mixed signals, the successful breach of a long-term downtrend and positive indicators on the RSI and MACD suggest increasing momentum. Potential buyers should monitor the $45.63 resistance closely. A breakthrough could initiate a wider rally. As one of the foundational privacy-focused coins, ZEC maintains enduring relevance, and current low prices might offer a significant entry point with substantial growth prospects. BlockDAG Secures $5M Rapidly Following Keynote 3 In a remarkable 48-hour period post-Keynote 3, BlockDAG has garnered an impressive $5 million, pushing its presale total beyond $210 million. This significant increase occurred shortly after demonstrating substantial advancements, including a live Beta Testnet with over 1.2 million transactions, robust block explorer capabilities, and comprehensive tools for token and NFT creation, alongside the operation of more than 100 active nodes. Unlike some Layer 1 projects that are still in the planning phase, BlockDAG is actively delivering results, which is catalyzing a strong response from the market. Currently, during Batch 27 of sales, BDAG is priced at $0.0248, with more than 19 billion coins already sold. Complemented by a vibrant community of over 800,000 X1 App users and 16,700+ units sold to miners, along with high-profile partnerships like those with Inter Milan and UFC, it’s clear why analysts are optimistic about BDAG reaching $1 post-listing. With the crypto presale accelerating following Keynote 3, the impending launch of mainnet features, DeFi tools, and new exchange listings is highly anticipated. The recent $5 million raised in just two days is a strong indicator of the potential excitement surrounding BDAG’s official release. This could be an opportunity many will wish they hadn’t missed. Critical Insights While CRO’s recent price jump might look attractive for quick gains, ongoing uncertainties about its token supply and overall market trust could dampen its growth. Meanwhile, Zcash faces its own challenges in sustaining momentum after its initial market recovery, with its long-term viability still to be proven. The future of both projects hinges on upcoming developments, including market sentiment shifts, new partnerships, and their ability to overcome technical resistance levels. In contrast, BlockDAG is turning potential into tangible success. The latest Keynote didn’t just serve as a promotional event but highlighted a project that is already in full swing, with over 1.2 million transactions on its testnet and effective smart contract functionalities, backed by a community that’s actively engaging with its tools. The swift $5 million raised post-Keynote isn’t just excitement; it’s a strong endorsement from both retail and institutional participants.

Elon brought charts, handed out $1 million checks, and used a packed town hall to accuse Biden of funneling taxpayer funds into what he called a broken system. The rally happened just a day and a half before polls opened in a high-stakes state judicial election. The event grabbed national attention after Elon gave the money to two Wisconsin voters who signed a petition against “activist judges.” That petition followed a ruling from the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which refused to hear a case saying the giveaway was illegal. After the checks, Elon brought up his DOGE associate Antonio Gracias to talk about what they uncovered inside the Social Security Administration. Behind them, a large slide appeared with the words “New Non-Citizen Social Security Numbers Issued.” Antonio explained what it meant. Elon Musk at the rally event. Source: Fox News/Getty Images “We started at the top of the system, mapping the whole system of Social Security to understand where all the fraud was,” Antonio said during the event. “But this is what jumped out at us. When we saw these numbers, we were like, ‘What is this?’” Antonio said that between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2025, noncitizens were issued Social Security numbers in growing numbers. In fiscal year 2024 alone, more than 2 million received them. The year before that, and even in fiscal year 2025 which began in October and runs through this September, the number was around 1 million each year. “This literally blew us away,” Antonio said. “We went there to find fraud and we found this by accident.” Elon’s Social Security overhaul may slow checks and support Jason Fichtner, who served as deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration under President George W. Bush, said things are getting risky. “Now I’m concerned that benefits could get disrupted,” he said. Jason said these new updates aren’t small tweaks—they could block people from getting help at all. Jason joined Kathleen Romig, another former SSA official and now director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in a public op-ed. They wrote that 7,000 workers have been removed from the SSA, and six regional offices have been shut down. That means fewer people to help, longer lines at field offices, and more bugs on the official SSA website. The phone line? It already had long waits before the layoffs. Now it’s worse. Kathleen and Jason said this mess could hit people with disabilities hardest. Delays could leave them waiting so long they die before getting the money they’re owed. “The Social Security Administration is in crisis, and people’s benefits are at risk,” they wrote. Jason also spoke about DOGE’s plan to wipe out COBOL, the old programming language that runs millions of lines of SSA code. DOGE wants to rebuild the entire system in a few months. Jason said that’s reckless. “If you start messing with the system’s code, that could impact those who are currently getting benefits now,” he said. Normally, a change like that would take years. It would start with one state, then move out slowly to other regions. Jason said DOGE isn’t doing that. Instead, they’re forcing everything through in a tight window, with no time for test runs or slow rollouts. Jason said he wasn’t too worried at first. He knew there were service delays, but he didn’t think people’s monthly checks were at risk. But now, with this COBOL plan moving full speed, he said it’s a whole new problem. The Social Security Administration responded by email saying, “There is no validity to these reports.” The White House used the same exact words too, oddly enough.

The company launched a claims process on April 1, 2025, to help return assets to affected users. The firm posted a link on X that former FTX EU customers can use to identify themselves. Former customers must complete a know-your-customer (KYC) to initiate the process of recovering any lost funds. Backpack Exchange rescues FTX EU, aims to expedite customer payouts Once one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, FTX collapsed in November 2022, leaving millions of users unable to access their funds . The company collapsed amid a liquidity crisis and fraud allegations. The news uncovered that Alameda Research, a closely related trading company to FTX, had invested billions of dollars of client funds in dubious investments. As clients flocked to withdraw their cash, FTX had insufficient funds to accommodate the demands, sending investors into chaos and the company’s swift downfall. FTX and Alameda Research collapsed on November 11, 2022. Further investigations indicated that FTX’s founder and chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, had diverted customer deposits. He was charged and convicted of fraud and conspiracy. The European subsidiary, FTX EU, was also impacted. Even with the stricter European oversight, customer assets in the broader FTX bankruptcy were trapped. FTX EU was purchased in January 2025 by Backpack Exchange, a regulated global cryptocurrency platform founded by ex-FTX and Alameda Research staff. The FTX bankruptcy court and the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) gave the acquisition the green light, allowing Backpack to scale its services throughout Europe. As part of the acquisition, Backpack would have handled the distribution of court-eventually approved bankruptcy claims to FTX EU customers, with a target to speed up the restitution process. Backpack Exchange has structured a claims process to facilitate customer restitution Backpack Exchange has created a simple process to recover funds for the affected FTX EU clients. The process starts with identity verification, requiring users to utilize a responsive verification system. The step is live and can be accessed via Backpack’s official claims page. Users who have successfully passed the verification process can then withdraw their funds. Backpack will share instructions as soon as the withdrawal phase goes live CEO Armani Ferrante stated that this is a significant effort and reaffirmed restitution to customers as a central element of building trust and confidence across the industry. Backpack Exchange has also made extensive support accessible across supported channels to assist users in recovery. The community is reacting and sharing feedback on social media The request for the asset recovery process brought different views within the crypto ecosystem. Responses from users on the social media platform have been optimistic and sceptical. “It’s been a really long road for us,” one user posted . Another said, “This is the minimum they could do after all of this time. I hope it will not take long.” Another one stated. The structured claims process is a great step in the right direction to re-attach FTX EU customers’ funds to the company while the company is now where it needed to be from the beginning, in the customer’s hands. As the Backpack Exchange aims to rebalance, however, the gaze of the cryptocurrency community will fall on them to secure their trust for good. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Despite the current rally, it remains unknown how the BTC price will react to the tariffs in the long term. Bitcoin is known to exhibit short-term reversal to macroeconomic uncertainties, a trend many believe may play out again. State of the Donald Trump Reciprocal Tariff One of the most crucial policies in the Donald Trump administration is levying tariffs on key trade partners. While this move is considered a commensurate measure to match what other trade partners are levying on US goods, the aftermath has toppled the market. Almost all big economies, including Russia have received Tariff threat from the US government. This threat is bound to be matched by the countries involved, including Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union. With Trump’s tariff kickstarting on April 2, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has revealed that reciprocal measures will be announced on April 3. This tariff war is poised to offset the mainstream stock market. The signs are already visible in the S&P 500, which has dropped by over 2% in the past five trading days. Similar negative sentiment is seen for the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones. The correlation between Bitcoin price and the mainstream financial market remains a fueling factor behind potential negative shifts in the market moving forward. Bitcoin Price is Yet to Adjust As of writing, the price of Bitcoin has rallied 3.44% in 24 hours to $85,186.47, according to CoinMarketCap data . However, the coin’s price has experienced a unique drawdown over the past week, dropping 2.79%. Since President Trump took office, the price of Bitcoin has experienced a mix of positive and negative sentiments. Amid the positive shifts, the BTC price hit $109,114 ATH on January 20, corresponding with President Trump’s inauguration. Since the all-time high milestone, Bitcoin price has fallen by over 20% to date. With the trade wars forming a headwind for the coin, more volatility is expected in the short term. With the trade war and reciprocal tariffs, inflation will soar again, forcing the Federal Reserve to adjust its interest rate policy. Should rates be slashed to boost the monetary landscape, it can set a basis for more BTC adoption, leading to a price surge in the long term. BTC Price and Key Tailwinds to Watch While April started positively for the top coin, the month still holds uncertainties per the trade war. However, some important tailwinds are at play that may influence market valuation moving forward. The US government’s strategic Bitcoin reserve might serve as a basis for more nation-state adoption in the long term. Institutional investors are also betting on BTC, creating a high demand for the coin. Despite the current volatility, top advocates advise buying now with hopes of a rebound soon.

The analyst warns that this technical formation could trigger a significant price correction for XRP, describing this downturn as the worst-case scenario. Analyst Predicts XRP Price Crash To $1.15 The ‘Charting Guy,’ a pseudonymous crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has unveiled a potential Head and Shoulder pattern formation on the XRP price chart. The analyst has shared insights into the implications of this technical pattern, projecting a potential crash in the XRP price. Related Reading: XRP Price Breakdown below $2: Analyst Reveals Next Major Support As a well-known bearish reversal pattern, the formation of a Head and Shoulder in the XRP price chart suggests a potential shift from an uptrend to a downtrend. Typically, a Head and Shoulder pattern consists of three peaks: the Left Shoulder, Head, and Right Shoulder. However, the Charting Guy has confirmed that XRP’s current pattern formation consists of two right shoulders and one head. Due to this irregularity, the analyst has expressed doubt about the possibility of the pattern playing out. If the Head and Shoulder pattern eventually takes shape, it could lead to a significant drop in the XRP price, potentially bringing it down to as low as $1.15. This price level aligns with a key Fibonacci Golden Pocket retracement zone between 0.618 – 0.786. Notably, the analyst has described this projected price crash as the worst-case scenario for XRP. While he believes a bearish move is possible, the analyst is confident that XRP’s broader market structure is bullish. Moreover, the Charting Guy argues that if XRP does decline to $1.15, it would likely serve as a healthy retracement in an overall bullish trend. He noted that XRP’s price has been holding the $2 level on daily closes, meaning its price action remains strong above support levels. This also indicates the possibility of an uptrend resumption that could yield higher highs and higher lows for XRP. Key Support And Resistance Levels To Watch The Charting Guy’s analysis of XRP’s potential Head and Shoulder pattern formation highlights several critical price levels to watch. Since XRP has consistently closed daily candles above $2, the analyst has determined this level as short-term support. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Begin Part 2 Of Bullish Wave 5 Movement, Here Are The Targets XRP has also been wicking during recent pullbacks in a crucial range between $1.7 and $1.9. As a result, the crypto analyst has revealed that he will be watching this area closely for a potential price bounce. The Golden Pocket retracement zone, which represents the worst-case scenario for the XRP price, is between $1.15 and $1.30. If XRP experiences a deeper price correction, lower support levels have been marked from $1.19 to $0.91. For its resistance levels, the Charting Guy has pinpointed $2.27 as a key price point. Additionally, $3.14 – $3.32 has been identified as an upper resistance range where XRP could rally if bullish momentum resumes.
