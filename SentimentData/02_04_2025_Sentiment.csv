Just a year after sparking excitement and raising funds through a community-driven crowdfunding initiative, the project has announced a complete reversal, leaving many wondering what went wrong. Are you curious to know the inside scoop on why the Dogwifhat logo won’t be lighting up the Vegas skyline after all? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story. What Happened to the Dogwifhat Las Vegas Sphere Dream? The ambitious plan to project the Dogwifhat logo onto the Las Vegas Sphere was initially met with enthusiastic support from the memecoin community. Spearheaded by the pseudonymous organizer @GamesMasterFlex, the project aimed to take crypto advertising to new heights, leveraging the Sphere’s unparalleled visual impact. However, recent updates indicate a significant change of direction. According to a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), @GamesMasterFlex announced the shelving of the Sphere advertising project. This news has been confirmed by Decrypt and has sent ripples through the Dogwifhat community and the broader crypto space. But what exactly led to this sudden change of heart? Unpacking the WIF Refund and Project Shelving The announcement of the project’s cancellation was coupled with the promise of a full WIF refund to contributors. This move, while likely disappointing for those who were excited about the Sphere campaign, is being seen by many as a responsible and community-centric approach. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: Project Shelved: The Las Vegas Sphere advertising campaign for Dogwifhat is officially off the table. Full Refunds: Contributions made to the crowdfunding campaign will be returned to donors. Reason Unclear: As of now, the specific reasons behind the decision to abandon the project remain somewhat vague. The announcement from @GamesMasterFlex provided limited details beyond the project being shelved. Community Reaction: The community’s reaction is mixed, with some expressing disappointment but largely appreciating the transparency and commitment to refunding contributions. The lack of a detailed explanation for the cancellation has naturally fueled speculation within the crypto community. Was it logistical challenges, financial hurdles, or perhaps a strategic shift in marketing focus for Dogwifhat ? As we await further clarification, it’s worth considering the potential factors that might have played a role. Potential Challenges in Crypto Advertising on the Las Vegas Sphere While the idea of showcasing a memecoin like Dogwifhat on the Las Vegas Sphere is undeniably attention-grabbing, executing such a campaign comes with its own set of challenges. Let’s explore some potential hurdles that might have contributed to the project being shelved: Challenge Description Potential Impact on Dogwifhat Project Cost Advertising on the Las Vegas Sphere is known to be exceptionally expensive. Budget constraints or unexpected cost increases could have made the project financially unviable. Logistics and Regulations Coordinating advertising on a venue like the Sphere involves complex logistics and regulatory approvals. Potential bureaucratic delays or unforeseen regulatory hurdles could have stalled the project. Market Volatility The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. Fluctuations in the value of Dogwifhat or SOL could have impacted the project’s funding and feasibility over the past year. Shifting Priorities Project priorities and marketing strategies can evolve in the fast-paced crypto world. Dogwifhat team might have decided to reallocate resources to other marketing initiatives or project developments. It’s important to note that these are just potential challenges. The official reason for shelving the Las Vegas Sphere campaign and issuing the WIF refund is yet to be fully disclosed by the project organizers. Memecoin Marketing and the Power of Community The Dogwifhat Sphere campaign, even in its cancellation, highlights the unique and often unconventional marketing strategies employed in the memecoin space. These projects often thrive on community engagement and virality, and the initial enthusiasm for the Sphere idea is a testament to this. While the crypto advertising landscape is still evolving, memecoins like Dogwifhat demonstrate the power of grassroots movements and community-driven initiatives to generate buzz and attention. Here are some key takeaways about memecoin marketing: Community Focus: Memecoin marketing heavily relies on building and engaging a strong online community. Viral Potential: The goal is often to create viral moments and trends that spread rapidly across social media. Unconventional Approaches: Memecoins are known for embracing unconventional and often humorous marketing tactics. Risk and Reward: Memecoin marketing can be highly effective in gaining attention quickly but also carries inherent risks due to market volatility and project lifecycles. What’s Next for Dogwifhat and Crypto Advertising? While the Las Vegas Sphere dream might be on hold, the Dogwifhat story is far from over. The project still boasts a vibrant community and continues to be a prominent player in the memecoin arena. The decision to issue a WIF refund and shelve the Sphere campaign could even be seen as a strategic move to re-evaluate and potentially pivot towards new marketing avenues. As for crypto advertising in general, the industry is constantly experimenting with new and innovative ways to reach audiences. From social media campaigns to partnerships and sponsorships, the strategies are diverse and ever-evolving. The Dogwifhat Sphere saga serves as a reminder of both the ambitious spirit and the inherent uncertainties within the crypto space. Conclusion: Lessons from the Dogwifhat Sphere Setback The cancellation of Dogwifhat’s Las Vegas Sphere advertising campaign is undoubtedly a setback for those who were eagerly anticipating it. However, it also offers valuable lessons about the realities of ambitious projects in the fast-paced and unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. The commitment to a WIF refund demonstrates a level of responsibility and community focus that is commendable. As Dogwifhat moves forward, it will be interesting to see what new strategies and initiatives they pursue to maintain their momentum and engage their dedicated community. The world of memecoin marketing continues to be a fascinating space to watch, full of surprises and unexpected turns.

42772663,https://timestabloid.com/?p=62545,1743546536,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"ChatGPT Explains Why XRP Price Has Fallen, Despite Multiple Positive Announcements",https://timestabloid.com/chatgpt-explains-why-xrp-price-has-fallen-despite-multiple-positive-announcements/,"Software engineer and crypto enthusiast Vincent Van Code recently shared a tweet analyzing why XRP’s price declined despite multiple positive developments. His post included a conversation with ChatGPT. He asked why XRP’s price fell from $2.50 to $2 before recovering slightly to $2.16, despite major bullish announcements. The AI’s response covered several factors, with Van Code emphasizing point three, which referenced market manipulation. I asked ChatGPT why price of XRP has fallen, despite multiple positive announcements.. no 3 was the kicker, even it knows the price is manipulated, to SHAKE OUT RETAIL. Must read Prompt: There have been dozens of XRP pro announcements from FDIC. to case settlement, you name… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) March 30, 2025 The tweet suggests that XRP’s price action does not align with expectations, given the stream of favorable news, including FDIC-related announcements and the resolution of legal matters. ChatGPT outlined six primary reasons for this disconnect. Market Dynamics and Sentiment One explanation given was the common market phenomenon of “buy the rumor, sell the news.” This occurs when investors anticipate good news and price it in beforehand. Once the news becomes official, traders may take profits, leading to a selloff instead of further gains. This behavior is common in both traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets. The second factor was the broader market sentiment. Even when XRP has positive news, overall market conditions influence its ability to gain traction. Bitcoin’s price movements, macroeconomic factors like inflation concerns, and regulatory uncertainty can weigh down altcoins, including XRP. Even strong developments may not drive price increases if the general market environment is unstable. Influence of Whales and Liquidity Strategies Van Code highlighted ChatGPT’s mention of price manipulation as a significant takeaway. The AI pointed out that XRP has a history of being influenced by large holders and institutions who may intentionally push the price lower to shake out retail investors. These liquidity strategies, often employed by market makers and institutional traders, create psychological pressure on smaller investors. The suggestion that price movements may not always be driven by logical fundamentals but rather by deliberate strategies is the key focus of the tweet. Another factor mentioned was the lack of new retail money entering the market. Even with positive announcements, its price may struggle to rise if no fresh capital flows into XRP. A significant increase requires not just existing traders cycling through positions but new participants willing to buy at higher prices. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Lingering Effects of Legal Issues and Supply Considerations The AI also pointed to the residual effects of the SEC lawsuit. While the case was largely resolved in Ripple’s favor, regulatory uncertainty has left a lasting impact. Institutional investors remain cautious, while some exchanges have yet to integrate XRP trading without restrictions. These factors contribute to sentiment issues that can suppress price growth. Finally, token supply dynamics were identified as another potential reason. Ripple holds a substantial amount of XRP and distributes tokens through monthly unlocks and over-the-counter (OTC) sales. While these distributions are part of a structured plan, they can introduce selling pressure, affecting price stability. Van Code’s tweet highlights the frustration within the XRP community regarding price movements that do not seem to reflect ongoing positive developments. The response from ChatGPT outlined multiple reasons why the price may not have reacted as anticipated, with market dynamics, sentiment, liquidity strategies, and supply considerations all playing a role. The emphasis on whale manipulation as a possible factor underscores concerns that price movements in the crypto market are not always organic. Whether this is a temporary consolidation phase before a larger breakout remains uncertain. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

42772458,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145380,1743546620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Claim: Researchers Expose OpenAI’s GPT-4o Training on Paywalled Books,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-gpt4o-paywalled-books-claim/,"Is OpenAI, the giant behind ChatGPT, embroiled in another data sourcing controversy? A new report from the AI Disclosures Project is making waves with a serious accusation : OpenAI may have trained its advanced GPT-4o model using copyrighted, paywalled books from O’Reilly Media without permission. This revelation intensifies the ongoing debate about AI training data ethics and the boundaries of copyright in the age of artificial intelligence. For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals following the AI revolution, this news raises critical questions about data transparency and the future of content creation. Unpacking the Copyright Infringement Claim Against OpenAI The core of the accusation revolves around the source of data used to train sophisticated AI models like GPT-4o. Think of AI models as incredibly complex learning machines. They digest massive amounts of information – text, images, code – to identify patterns and generate outputs based on prompts. When you ask ChatGPT to write a poem or create an image, it’s drawing upon this vast knowledge base to produce its response. It’s not creating something entirely new, but rather intelligently remixing and extrapolating from what it has learned. While many AI labs, including OpenAI, are exploring AI-generated synthetic data to augment their training datasets, relying solely on synthetic data presents challenges. Performance can degrade, and the models may lose touch with the nuances of real-world data. This is where the controversy around AI training data sourcing becomes critical. The AI Disclosures Project, spearheaded by Tim O’Reilly and Ilan Strauss, suggests that OpenAI’s latest model, GPT-4o , exhibits a strong understanding of content from paywalled O’Reilly books. This is particularly concerning because O’Reilly Media, a prominent publisher of technical and business books, does not have a licensing agreement with OpenAI. Key findings from the AI Disclosures Project paper: GPT-4o’s Superior Recognition: The research indicates that GPT-4o demonstrates a significantly higher recognition of paywalled O’Reilly book content compared to OpenAI’s earlier model, GPT-3.5 Turbo. DE-COP Method: The researchers employed a technique called DE-COP, a “membership inference attack,” to assess whether AI models have prior knowledge of specific texts from their training data. This method tests if a model can distinguish between original human-written text and AI-paraphrased versions. Extensive Testing: Over 13,000 paragraph excerpts from 34 O’Reilly books were used to probe the knowledge of GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and other OpenAI models. Paywalled Content Recognition: The results strongly suggest that GPT-4o “recognized” a far greater amount of paywalled O’Reilly book content than its predecessors. GPT-4o and the Mystery of Paywalled Books: What Does It Mean for Copyright? The paper highlights a stark contrast between GPT-4o and older models like GPT-3.5 Turbo. While GPT-3.5 Turbo showed more familiarity with publicly accessible O’Reilly book samples, GPT-4o excelled in recognizing content behind paywalls. This raises serious questions about how OpenAI sourced its AI training data for its most advanced model. According to the research, “GPT-4o [likely] recognizes, and so has prior knowledge of, many non-public O’Reilly books published prior to its training cutoff date.” However, the researchers acknowledge that this isn’t definitive proof of copyright infringement . They concede that their method isn’t foolproof and that OpenAI could have indirectly accessed the book excerpts through user interactions with ChatGPT – users might have copied and pasted snippets of paywalled content into the platform. Furthermore, the study didn’t analyze OpenAI’s newest models, leaving open the possibility that data sourcing practices may have evolved. Why Does AI Training Data Matter in the Crypto and Tech World? For those in the cryptocurrency and broader tech space, the implications of this copyright infringement claim are significant: Data Ethics and Transparency: The crypto world champions decentralization and transparency. Questions around AI data sourcing mirror these concerns. Where AI models get their data and how ethically it’s obtained are crucial for building trustworthy AI systems. Impact on Content Creators: If AI models are trained on copyrighted material without proper licensing, it undermines the rights of content creators – authors, artists, musicians, and more. This could stifle creativity and innovation in the long run. Legal Battles and Regulatory Scrutiny: OpenAI is already facing multiple lawsuits regarding its data practices. This new report will likely add fuel to the fire, potentially leading to stricter regulations around AI training data and copyright . Future of AI Development: The search for high-quality AI training data is intensifying. AI companies are exploring various avenues, including licensing deals, synthetic data generation, and even hiring domain experts to inject knowledge directly into AI systems. The resolution of the copyright infringement debate will significantly shape the future landscape of AI development. OpenAI’s Stance and the Broader Industry Trend OpenAI has publicly advocated for more flexible rules regarding the use of copyrighted data for AI training . They argue that access to a wide range of data, including copyrighted material, is essential for developing powerful and beneficial AI models. The company does have licensing agreements with some publishers and offers opt-out mechanisms for copyright holders, though these are often criticized as insufficient. The trend of AI companies seeking higher-quality AI training data is undeniable. OpenAI has even hired journalists to refine its models’ output, and the industry is seeing a rise in AI firms recruiting experts across various fields to infuse specialized knowledge into AI systems. While OpenAI does pay for some training data through licensing deals, the O’Reilly paper underscores the ongoing tension between AI development and copyright law. As OpenAI navigates multiple lawsuits and increasing scrutiny, this new report from the AI Disclosures Project adds another layer of complexity to the copyright infringement debate. OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment, leaving the allegations unanswered for now.

The case challenges our assumptions about wealth and exposes risky behavior behind online allure. It sparks debate on how financial pressures can distort personal values and family ties. Andre Rebelo, an Australian crypto investor and former partner of Instagram influencer Grace Piscopo, was sentenced to 25 years in prison on April 1 in Perth after being found guilty of murdering his mother in 2020. Andre Rebelo Sentenced for Killing Mother in High-Profile Case Rebelo was convicted of murdering his mother, Colleen, after an eight-week trial where his siblings and ex-girlfriend testified. Colleen Rebelo was found dead in the shower of her suburban home in Perth on May 25, 2020, by her son. Authorities did not determine an exact cause of death, though some reports suggested possible asphyxiation. Andre Rebelo — the ex-partner of social media influencer Grace Piscopo — must have carried out some form of violent act against his mother when he killed her but exactly what he did may never be known. https://t.co/LrhqdfCWEB — The West Australian (@westaustralian) March 31, 2025 “You killed your own mother, in a particularly egregious and shocking nature,” Justice Bruno Fiannaca said. “This is a crime that right minded people would regard with horror, murdering your mother was the ultimate betrayal of her trust and everything she gave,” he added. Debt and Financial Motives Behind Andre Rebelo’s Crime According to The Sydney Morning Herald , Colleen’s therapist, Narina Sidhu, alerted police shortly following her client’s death that Rebelo had repeatedly contacted her about signing a life insurance claim in his mother’s name. Authorities found that Rebelo had created the policies himself and forged documents to claim up to AUD $1 million (around USD $627,000). Prosecutors said Rebelo and Piscopo had accumulated nearly AUD $100,000 (about USD $62,000) in debt due to their spending habits, which may have influenced Rebelo’s actions. The investigation did not uncover clear details about Rebelo’s cryptocurrency investments , but prosecutors focused instead on his financial struggles and motive. Social Media Activity and Final Sentencing Piscopo, who shares a child with Rebelo and has since separated from him, did not attend the sentencing. Two days before the sentencing, Piscopo shared a beach photo from Bali on Instagram, captioned “paradise.” Rebelo will be eligible for parole in 2047, after serving at least 25 years.

42772743,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145381,1743547216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark STABLES Act: Coinbase CEO’s Urgent Plea for Crypto Regulation Support,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stables-act-crypto-regulation-coinbase/,"Is the U.S. finally on the verge of establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets? Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes we might be. In a significant move, Armstrong has publicly urged bipartisan support for the STABLES Act, labeling its upcoming markup by the House Financial Services Committee as a potentially “historic moment” for the crypto industry. Let’s dive into why this act is so crucial and what it could mean for the future of crypto in the United States. Why is the STABLES Act a Landmark for Crypto Regulation? The STABLES Act , or the “Eliminating Backlogs Act of 2023”, is not new, but its renewed momentum is capturing significant attention. Brian Armstrong’s vocal support amplifies its importance, especially as the crypto industry navigates a complex and often unclear regulatory landscape. But what exactly makes this act so pivotal? Clarity for Stablecoins: The core focus of the STABLES Act is to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reserve asset like the U.S. dollar, are crucial for everyday crypto transactions and the broader DeFi ecosystem. Current regulations are fragmented, creating uncertainty for businesses operating with stablecoins. Federal Oversight: The act proposes to bring stablecoin issuers under federal oversight, potentially treating them more like traditional financial institutions. This could involve stricter requirements for reserves, audits, and consumer protection, aiming to build trust and stability in the stablecoin market. National Framework: A federal framework could preempt state-level regulations, creating a more unified and less burdensome environment for stablecoin issuers to operate across the U.S. This national approach is highly desired by industry leaders who seek consistent rules rather than a patchwork of state laws. Brian Armstrong’s Urgent Call for Support: A Pivotal Moment Brian Armstrong’s engagement is not just a casual endorsement; it’s an urgent call to action. His recent activity on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting both the STABLES Act and the Senate’s progress on the GENIUS Act, underscores the industry’s push for comprehensive crypto regulation . Why is his voice so important right now? Industry Leadership: As the CEO of Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., Armstrong’s opinion carries significant weight. His advocacy can influence both lawmakers and the broader public perception of crypto regulation. Timing is Critical: With the House Financial Services Committee markup approaching, Armstrong’s public appeal is strategically timed to maximize pressure on lawmakers to consider and support the STABLES Act. This is a crucial window of opportunity to shape the future of digital assets regulation. Bipartisan Push: Armstrong specifically called for bipartisan support, recognizing that for any legislation to pass and be effective, it needs to transcend partisan divides. Crypto regulation is not a Republican or Democrat issue; it’s an issue of innovation and economic competitiveness for the U.S. Beyond STABLES: The GENIUS Act and a Broader Vision for Digital Assets Armstrong also mentioned the Senate’s progress on the GENIUS Act. While the STABLES Act focuses on stablecoins, the GENIUS Act represents a broader effort to establish a comprehensive digital asset framework . How do these pieces fit together? Act Focus Significance STABLES Act Stablecoin regulation, federal oversight of issuers. Provides immediate clarity and stability to a critical segment of the crypto market. GENIUS Act Broader digital asset regulatory framework, potentially covering various types of cryptocurrencies and crypto activities. Aims to create a more comprehensive and future-proof regulatory environment for the entire digital asset ecosystem in the U.S. Both acts are vital components of building a robust and innovation-friendly regulatory landscape for crypto in the U.S. Armstrong’s mention of both signals a holistic approach, advocating for both immediate needs (stablecoin clarity) and long-term vision (comprehensive framework). What are the Potential Benefits of Clear Crypto Regulation? Why is this regulatory push so important for the future? Clear crypto regulation offers numerous benefits, not just for crypto companies but for the entire U.S. economy: Increased Investment and Innovation: Regulatory clarity reduces uncertainty, making it more attractive for institutional investors and traditional businesses to enter the crypto space. This influx of capital and talent can fuel innovation and growth. Consumer Protection: Robust regulations can protect consumers from fraud and scams, fostering greater trust in digital assets and encouraging wider adoption. Economic Competitiveness: A clear and sensible regulatory framework can position the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset space, attracting businesses and talent while preventing innovation from moving overseas. Mainstream Adoption: As regulations become clearer and more established, cryptocurrencies and digital assets can move closer to mainstream adoption, integrating further into the traditional financial system. Armstrong in D.C.: Actionable Insights and What’s Next Brian Armstrong’s presence in Washington, D.C., this week is not merely symbolic. It represents direct engagement and lobbying efforts ahead of the crucial August recess. What actionable insights can we glean from this situation? Direct Engagement Matters: Armstrong’s meetings with lawmakers demonstrate the importance of direct industry engagement in shaping policy. Crypto leaders need to be actively involved in discussions and negotiations. Education is Key: Part of Armstrong’s mission is likely to educate lawmakers about the nuances of crypto and the potential benefits of well-crafted regulation. Bridging the knowledge gap between the tech industry and policymakers is crucial. Momentum Building: The simultaneous progress on the STABLES Act and the GENIUS Act, coupled with industry advocacy, suggests a growing momentum towards comprehensive crypto regulation in the U.S. This is a space to watch closely. Conclusion: A Historic Opportunity for Digital Assets? The upcoming House Financial Services Committee markup of the STABLES Act, combined with the ongoing Senate discussions on the GENIUS Act, truly represents a historic opportunity for the United States to define its stance on digital assets . Brian Armstrong’s urgent appeal for bipartisan support is a powerful reminder that the time for decisive action is now. Whether this moment will indeed be “historic” depends on the choices lawmakers make in the coming weeks and months. The crypto community, and indeed anyone interested in the future of finance and technology, will be watching closely.

The establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as a “digital Fort Knox” is part of Bitcoin’s growing role as a long-term store of value in federal financial strategy. This transparency may influence global crypto adoption and market dynamics, as this marks a turning point for both regulation and institutional confidence in digital assets. Following President Donald Trump’s recent executive order, the US Department of the Treasury and federal agencies are expected to disclose their Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency holdings on April 5. The announcement is anticipated to reveal whether assets such as XRP, Solana, and Cardano, previously mentioned by Trump, are included in the government’s digital asset reserves. How Much Crypto Does the U.S. Really Own? Treasury Set to Reveal Holdings President Trump signs executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. White House crypto czar David Sacks says the reserve will start with 200K BTC already owned by the gov, with plans for budget-neutral accumulation. BTC price dips 3%… https://t.co/4e2bJH7c72 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 7, 2025 Trump’s executive order issued on March 6 mandated the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile. According to a presidential document published on March 11, all federal agencies were given 30 days to report their digital asset holdings to the Treasury Secretary. The directive also requires the establishment of two new offices to oversee these assets, with the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve specifically designated for Bitcoin acquired through civil or criminal forfeiture. Unlike other holdings, Bitcoin in this reserve will not be sold, positioning it as a long-term store of value akin to a “digital Fort Knox.” April 5th (this Saturday) the USA must complete a full audit of the nation’s bitcoin holdings. Depending on what we learn, might answer many of the open questions about the recent price action. — David Bailey $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) March 31, 2025 The forthcoming disclosure is expected to clarify the scope of the government’s crypto holdings, which could have broader implications for the market. David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc, noted that the audit results might help explain Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations. “Depending on what we learn, it might answer many of the open questions about the recent price action,” Bailey said. Bitcoin’s price has been highly volatile since the announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Concerns over trade tensions and recession risks have contributed to a 10% decline, with Bitcoin dropping from over $92,000 to around $82,000. According to data from Arkham Intelligence , the US government currently holds approximately 198,012 BTC, valued at around $16 billion. White House crypto czar David Sacks stated that the government has accumulated roughly 400,000 BTC through asset forfeitures over the past decade. However, about half of that (195,000 BTC) was sold, generating $366 million. If those holdings had been retained, their value today would exceed $17 billion. U.S. States Push Bitcoin Legislation Amid Federal Crypto Transparency Efforts As federal agencies prepare to disclose their crypto holdings, U.S. states are making aggressive moves to integrate Bitcoin into their financial systems. While this federal transparency initiative unfolds, individual states aren’t waiting to forge their own paths forward. According to Bitcoin Laws, at least 23 states have introduced Bitcoin reserve bills, with 35 proposals still under consideration. Kentucky recently took a big step, with Governor Andy Beshear signing the “Bitcoin Rights” bill (HB 701) into law . This legislation grants residents the right to self-custody Bitcoin and supports crypto mining, reinforcing Kentucky’s position as a major mining hub. Kentucky is currently responsible for 11% of the U.S. Bitcoin hash rate. NEW: North Carolina Bitcoin Investment Bill House Bill 506 would create a new independent NC Investment Authority headed by the Treasurer. The NCIA would have authority to invest 5% of various state funds in digital assets. pic.twitter.com/YuYmI8YyY2 — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) March 25, 2025 Other states are following suit. Oklahoma’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB 1203) cleared the House with a 77-15 vote and is now awaiting Senate approval. If passed, it would allow state funds to be allocated to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Meanwhile, Arizona lawmakers advanced two key bills, SB 1373 and SB 1025, permitting the state treasurer to invest up to 10% of reserve and pension funds into Bitcoin. North Carolina is also exploring crypto investments, with multiple bills proposing to allocate up to 10% of state funds to digital assets. If enacted, these measures could provide long-term financial protection against inflation while reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in public finance. According to Bitcoin Laws, if these state initiatives proceed, they could result in up to $23 billion in Bitcoin purchases, potentially adding 247,000 BTC to government reserves. The upcoming federal crypto disclosure represents an interesting moment in US financial policy. As federal agencies prepare to reveal their holdings while states increasingly incorporate Bitcoin into their financial frameworks, the nation appears to be at a crossroads. The transparency initiative could legitimize cryptocurrencies as a mainstream asset class and potentially influence global adoption patterns. Regardless of whether this signals the beginning of a new era where digital assets become integral to national financial strategy, the April 5 disclosure will undoubtedly provide crucial insights into the government’s long-term vision for cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How could the U.S. Treasury’s crypto holdings transform global perceptions of Bitcoin? The U.S. could legitimize Bitcoin as a strategic asset by publicly holding it, potentially influencing other nations to adopt similar reserves and accelerating Bitcoin’s mainstream acceptance. What does this disclosure mean for state-level Bitcoin reserve initiatives? Federal transparency might encourage states to expand their Bitcoin legislation, which could directly create a unified national approach to integrating digital assets into public finance. How might this influence institutional investment in cryptocurrencies? A federal endorsement of crypto holdings could ignite institutional confidence, drive inflows into digital assets, and foster broader market participation. Of course, this all depends on broader macroeconomic forces and other factors.

The first quarter of this year has witnessed an unprecedented surge in crypto-related mergers and acquisitions (M&A), signaling a major evolution within the digital asset space. Buckle up as we delve into the details of this explosive growth and explore what it means for investors, businesses, and the future of cryptocurrency. Crypto M&A Transactions Reach Unprecedented Heights The numbers are in, and they’re staggering. According to a recent report from M&A consulting firm Architect Partners, as highlighted by Blockworks, the world of Crypto M&A has just experienced its most active quarter ever. We’re talking about a whopping 62 deals finalized in just the first three months of the year! To put this into perspective, this figure nearly doubles the 33 transactions recorded in Q3 of last year. This dramatic increase underscores a significant acceleration in consolidation and strategic partnerships within the crypto industry. What’s Fueling this Cryptocurrency Acquisitions Frenzy? So, what’s behind this dramatic uptick in Cryptocurrency Acquisitions ? Several factors are likely contributing to this surge: Market Maturation: The crypto market is maturing. Early-stage projects are evolving, and established companies are looking to expand their reach and capabilities. M&A provides a faster route to growth than organic expansion. Strategic Consolidation: In a competitive market, companies are merging to gain a competitive edge, consolidate market share, and eliminate redundancies. This is a natural progression as the industry matures. Access to Talent and Technology: Acquiring companies can provide access to valuable talent, cutting-edge technology, and intellectual property that would be costly and time-consuming to develop in-house. Bull Market Confidence: Optimism surrounding the future of crypto, fueled by recent market uptrends and institutional adoption, is likely encouraging companies to make strategic moves and invest in growth through acquisitions. Preparation for the Next Bull Run: Companies are positioning themselves for the anticipated next bull run. Expanding through Crypto Mergers and acquisitions now allows them to capitalize on future market growth. The Prediction: An M&A Boom Alongside Crypto IPOs Adding further credence to this trend, Dan Tapiero, founder of cryptocurrency investment firm 10T Holdings, anticipated this very scenario. Speaking at Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit last month, Tapiero predicted an imminent M&A Boom Crypto wave, coinciding with the activation of crypto-related initial public offerings (IPOs). This prediction appears to be materializing even sooner than some might have expected, given the Q1 figures. Tapiero’s insight highlights a crucial point: the crypto industry is moving towards greater institutionalization and integration with traditional financial markets. M&A activity is a key indicator of this evolution, paving the way for a more structured and mature crypto ecosystem. Benefits of Crypto Mergers and Acquisitions: Why It Matters The surge in Crypto Investment Boom through M&A isn’t just about numbers; it has tangible benefits for the entire crypto ecosystem: Benefit Description Increased Innovation Mergers can combine complementary technologies and talent, fostering innovation and accelerating the development of new crypto products and services. Enhanced Market Stability Consolidation can lead to stronger, more resilient companies, reducing market fragmentation and potentially contributing to greater market stability in the long run. Wider User Adoption Larger, more established entities resulting from mergers can have greater resources for marketing and user acquisition, potentially driving wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. Improved Regulatory Compliance Larger companies often have more resources to navigate the complex regulatory landscape, leading to better compliance and increased investor confidence. Investor Confidence Boost Increased M&A activity signals a maturing market, attracting more institutional and traditional investors who see crypto as a viable and evolving asset class. Navigating the Challenges of Crypto Acquisitions While the outlook for crypto M&A is bright, it’s important to acknowledge the potential challenges: Valuation Complexity: Valuing crypto companies can be complex due to the nascent nature of the industry, fluctuating token prices, and varying business models. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape in different jurisdictions adds complexity to cross-border M&A deals. Integration Hurdles: Integrating different company cultures, technologies, and teams can present significant challenges post-acquisition. Talent Retention: Retaining key talent from acquired companies is crucial for successful integration and value realization. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market can impact deal valuations and post-acquisition performance. Examples of Crypto M&A in Action While specific details of the 62 Q1 deals are still emerging, we can look at past examples to understand the types of Cryptocurrency Acquisitions happening in the space. These include: Exchanges Acquiring Infrastructure Providers: Major exchanges might acquire custody solutions or blockchain analytics firms to enhance their service offerings and security. NFT Marketplaces Merging: Consolidation in the NFT space could see larger marketplaces acquiring smaller, niche platforms to expand their reach and NFT categories. DeFi Protocols Combining Forces: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols might merge to create more comprehensive and robust financial ecosystems. Traditional Finance Entering Crypto: We could see traditional financial institutions acquiring crypto firms to gain a foothold in the digital asset market and offer crypto-related services to their clients. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors So, what does this Record Crypto M&A activity mean for you? Keep an Eye on M&A News: Stay informed about merger and acquisition announcements in the crypto space. These deals can signal shifts in market dynamics and identify emerging leaders. Research Acquired Companies: Pay attention to companies being acquired. Their technologies and teams might become integral to larger crypto ecosystems. Consider Investing in Consolidating Sectors: Sectors experiencing consolidation through M&A could present investment opportunities as stronger, more competitive entities emerge. Understand the Long-Term Implications: M&A activity points towards the long-term maturation and institutionalization of the crypto market. This trend could lead to greater stability and broader adoption. Conclusion: A New Era of Crypto Evolution The explosive growth in crypto M&A during Q1 is not just a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful indicator of the crypto industry’s evolution. As the market matures, strategic consolidation and acquisitions will likely become even more prevalent. This wave of mergers and acquisitions promises to reshape the crypto landscape, fostering innovation, enhancing market stability, and paving the way for wider adoption. The future of crypto is being built through strategic alliances and powerful combinations, and the Q1 M&A figures are just the beginning of this exciting new chapter.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-projects-xrp-price-to-702-heres-the-timeline/,"Crypto analyst and social media figure CryptoSensei posted a tweet that presented a speculative future price trajectory for XRP. The tweet included a video in which an individual used a pen to tap on various projected price levels, outlining what appeared to be a trading strategy from the present time into 2026. WATCH THE PEN MOVE! $2.13 $3.40 → $7.60 $29.50 → $702.50 $XRP #XRP #Ripple pic.twitter.com/nAJwkzWe7x — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) March 30, 2025 Breakdown of CryptoSensei’s Price Projection The video began by showing XRP’s current price at €2.40 before moving to three days later, where the asset was depicted at €2.13 with a signal to buy. One week later, XRP was projected at €7.60 with an indication to sell. Two weeks into the future, the price was marked at €3.40, with another buy signal. The next target was set at €29.50 in seven months, again with a recommendation to buy. The final projection is extended to 2026, displaying a price of €705.50 with the word “Rich” written alongside it. The numbers in the caption, although in a different currency, reflected the price points highlighted in the video, reinforcing the suggested pattern of accumulation and selling. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reaction The post attracted responses from XRP holders and cryptocurrency traders. Some showed enthusiasm, and others expressed skepticism. One response from a user named The Real Sazkuach stated: “So if I draw some lines and tap my pen real hard, then this lends credence to my guess of future value? Fucking ridiculous.” This comment conveyed criticism of the methodology presented in the video, questioning the legitimacy of the predictions based on visual cues rather than technical analysis or fundamental factors. Broader Context XRP has been a focal point in the cryptocurrency space due to its association with cross-border payments and ongoing regulatory discussions. Price predictions for the asset have varied widely, with some analysts forecasting significant long-term appreciation and others remaining cautious. CryptoSensei’s projection aligns with a more optimistic outlook, but its validity remains uncertain. Market participants have historically been drawn to speculative forecasts, particularly in the volatile cryptocurrency sector. While some traders may interpret such projections as potential scenarios, others emphasize the importance of research, historical trends, and external market influences when considering future price movements.

The buzz is building as Hut 8 Mining, a prominent name in the Bitcoin mining arena, has teamed up with an investment group boasting ties to the Trump family. Together, they’re charting a course to launch American Bitcoin Corp. onto the public market through an Initial Public Offering (IPO). This bold move is not just about raising capital; it’s a strategic play to redefine the future of Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure. Are you prepared to witness the dawn of a new era in crypto? What’s the Buzz Around this Bitcoin IPO? The news, initially reported by Bloomberg, details the ambitious plan for American Bitcoin Corp. to go public. This isn’t just another company entering the market; it’s a venture born from the collaboration of Hut 8 Mining and a significant investment group linked to Donald Trump’s sons. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot has articulated a vision of synergy, aiming to forge two distinct yet interconnected public entities. One will concentrate on the bedrock of energy and infrastructure, while the other will laser-focus on Bitcoin mining operations and reserve management. The ultimate goal? A vertically integrated powerhouse poised to dominate the Bitcoin space. Let’s break down what makes this Bitcoin IPO so noteworthy: Strategic Separation: Hut 8 is aiming to split its operations into two publicly traded companies. This allows for focused management and potentially unlocks greater value in each sector. Vertical Integration: By controlling both energy/infrastructure and Bitcoin mining, American Bitcoin Corp. aims for greater efficiency, cost savings, and resilience. Trump-Linked Investment: The involvement of a group connected to the Trump family adds a layer of political and potentially influential backing to the venture. Capital Raise: The IPO is designed to inject significant private capital into American Bitcoin Corp., fueling its growth and expansion plans. Hut 8 Mining: A Strategic Power Play? For Hut 8 Mining, this move appears to be a calculated step towards optimizing its business structure and capitalizing on the burgeoning Bitcoin mining industry. Splitting into two specialized companies could offer several advantages: Aspect Energy & Infrastructure Company Bitcoin Mining & Reserves Company Focus Developing and managing energy resources and infrastructure crucial for Bitcoin mining. Operating Bitcoin mining facilities and managing Bitcoin reserves. Potential Benefits Attract investors interested in energy and infrastructure assets; potentially more stable revenue streams. Attract investors focused on Bitcoin and crypto assets; direct exposure to Bitcoin price movements. Synergy Provides stable, cost-effective energy for the mining company. Guaranteed demand for energy and infrastructure services. This strategic separation allows each entity to pursue its specific goals more effectively and attract different types of investors. The energy and infrastructure arm can focus on innovation in sustainable energy solutions for mining, while the Bitcoin mining company can concentrate on maximizing hash rate and Bitcoin accumulation. Why is Trump Crypto Group’s Involvement Significant? The involvement of an investment group with ties to the Trump family injects a unique dimension into this Cryptocurrency IPO. While the specifics of the group and their exact roles are still unfolding, the Trump name carries significant weight, particularly within certain political and economic circles. Here’s why their participation is generating considerable interest: Brand Recognition: The Trump name is globally recognized and can attract media attention and investor interest. Political Influence: Depending on the level of involvement and future political endeavors, this could signal a growing acceptance or even advocacy for Bitcoin within certain political spheres. Investor Network: The Trump network could bring in a new wave of investors who might not have previously considered Bitcoin ventures. Potential for Controversy: The Trump association could also attract controversy and scrutiny, both positive and negative, impacting public perception and market sentiment. It remains to be seen how deeply the Trump-linked group will be involved and what long-term implications their participation will have on American Bitcoin Corp. and the broader crypto industry. However, it undeniably adds a layer of intrigue and complexity to this IPO. Benefits of Investing in a Bitcoin Venture IPO Considering an investment in a Bitcoin Venture IPO like American Bitcoin Corp. presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. Let’s explore some potential benefits: Early Access: IPOs offer the chance to invest in a company at its initial public offering price, potentially before broader market awareness drives up valuation. Growth Potential: Bitcoin mining and related infrastructure are growth sectors, and a vertically integrated company like American Bitcoin Corp. could be well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. Diversification: Investing in a Bitcoin-focused company can provide portfolio diversification, especially for those seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency market without directly holding Bitcoin. Transparency of Public Markets: Publicly traded companies are subject to regulatory scrutiny and reporting requirements, potentially offering greater transparency compared to private crypto ventures. However, it’s crucial to remember that IPOs and crypto investments are inherently risky. Thorough due diligence and understanding your risk tolerance are paramount before making any investment decisions. Challenges and Considerations for American Bitcoin Corp. While the Bitcoin IPO of American Bitcoin Corp. is generating excitement, it’s essential to acknowledge the potential challenges and considerations: Bitcoin Price Volatility: The profitability of Bitcoin mining is heavily dependent on Bitcoin’s price, which is known for its volatility. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving and can pose risks to mining operations. Competition: The Bitcoin mining industry is competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Energy Costs: Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive, and fluctuating energy prices can impact profitability. Execution Risk: Successfully splitting into two companies and achieving vertical integration is a complex undertaking with execution risks. Investors should carefully assess these challenges and conduct thorough research into American Bitcoin Corp.’s business plan, management team, and financial projections before considering an investment. Actionable Insights: Is this Bitcoin IPO for You? The American Bitcoin Corp. IPO represents a fascinating development in the crypto space, merging established Bitcoin mining expertise with potentially influential backing. For investors considering this opportunity, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research: Thoroughly investigate Hut 8 Mining, the Trump-linked investment group, and the details of American Bitcoin Corp.’s business plan and IPO prospectus. Assess Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Understand your own risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Consider Long-Term Potential: Evaluate the long-term prospects of Bitcoin mining and the potential for vertical integration to create a sustainable competitive advantage. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Stay informed about evolving cryptocurrency regulations, which could impact the industry and American Bitcoin Corp.’s operations. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a financial advisor to determine if this IPO aligns with your investment goals and risk profile. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin Ventures? The planned IPO of American Bitcoin Corp. by Hut 8 Mining and a Trump-linked group marks a potentially groundbreaking moment for the Bitcoin industry. This venture embodies a strategic vision of vertical integration and specialized focus, aiming to create a robust and resilient Bitcoin mining operation. The involvement of the Trump network adds an intriguing layer of political and economic dynamics. While challenges and risks remain inherent in the crypto space, this IPO signals a maturing market and the increasing sophistication of Bitcoin ventures.

The significant milestone attained by Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain of Shiba Inu, could be an indication of the growing adoption of the token within the cryptocurrency space. Related Reading: Could XRP Actually Reach $10,000? Expert Weighs In Shiba Inu Milestone: 1 Billion Transactions Reports disclosed that in less than two years, Layer-2 blockchain Shibarium has already made a mark in the crypto space after the token has processed its 1 billionth transaction. Meme coin Shiba Inu only introduced Shibarium in August 2023 and four months before celebrating its second anniversary, its transaction volume has surpassed the 1 billion mark. Analysts said that Shibarium achieved the incredible feat of 1 billion transactions yesterday, March 31, noting that the Layer-2 blockchain was able to reach that level after recording four million transactions daily. As of writing, Shiba Inu’s blockchain has reached the record level with a current transaction volume of over 1.001 billion. Market observers believed that Shibarium’s achievement suggested that the blockchain can handle high transaction volumes, which they attributed to the token’s robustness and the active participation of the blockchain community. Faster Than Bitcoin Crypto analysts said that other blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have already processed more than a billion transactions. However, they noted that what makes Shibarium’s achievement stand out is the speed at which it reached that remarkable feat. Market observers compared Shibarium with other established blockchains that attained the same mark. They explained that Shibarium’s journey to attain 1 billion transactions is unique because the Layer-2 blockchain achieved it faster than the other blockchains. For example, Bitcoin needed 15 years to reach 1 billion transactions, while Shibarium did it in less than two years. Over 193 Milion Addresses Aside from the milestone in transactions, the popular L2 blockchain also has more than 193.93 million blockchain addresses that have interacted with Shibarium since it was introduced in 2023. According to Shibariumscan, Shiba Inu’s blockchain network boasted a total of 10.23 million mined blocks, with an average block time of 5.0 seconds.

42773531,https://coingape.com/?p=246937,1743548485,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Rep French Hill Rejects Proposal for Interest on Stablecoin Holdings,https://coingape.com/rep-french-hill-rejects-proposal-for-interest-on-stablecoin-holdings/,"During a briefing on April 1, Representative French Hill addressed the ongoing discussions surrounding the regulation of stablecoins. One key aspect that has garnered attention is the proposal to allow consumers to earn interest on their stablecoin holdings. However, Hill rejected this proposal, stating that there is no consensus among lawmakers to support it. The debate has become a point of focus as the U.S. Congress moves closer to passing new legislation for stablecoins. French Hill Points Lack of Consensus Among Lawmakers Rep. French Hill, who represents Arkansas, made it clear that there is currently no agreement on the proposal for consumers to earn interest on stablecoins. In his remarks, Hill acknowledged the concerns of those advocating for this change but emphasized the lack of consensus among both the House and Senate. “I hear the point of view but I don’t think that there’s consensus among the parties or the houses on having a dollar-backed payment stablecoin pay interest to the holder of that stablecoin,” Hill stated during the briefing. French Hill comments come as part of ongoing discussions on the “STABLE Act” (H.R. 2392), which seeks to regulate stablecoins in the U.S. The legislation, in addition, aims to provide clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers and establish a framework for how these digital assets can be used in financial transactions. However, the bill, as it stands, does not include provisions for stablecoin holders to earn interest. The STABLE Act and Recent Amendments The latest version of the STABLE Act, referred to as the Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute (ANS), was made available on the Financial Committee’s website on the morning of April 2, 2025. This updated version of the bill includes recent amendments and additions. The ANS will serve as the basis for the upcoming markup session set for April 3, 2025. Despite calls from industry advocates for a more modern approach that includes interest-bearing stablecoins, the STABLE Act does not appear to have embraced these proposals. Critics argue that the legislation, as it stands, limits the potential benefits of stablecoins by restricting consumer access to interest. Those pushing for change believe that this missed opportunity may hinder the growth and development of the stablecoin market. Industry Advocacy for Interest-Bearing Stablecoins Subsequently, the debate over stablecoin interest is not limited to policymakers. Industry leaders and cryptocurrency advocates have voiced their concerns over the current legislative direction. For example, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, unlike French Hill has argued that stablecoins should be allowed to pay interest to their holders, similar to how savings accounts offer returns to consumers. Armstrong highlighted the potential benefits of allowing consumers to earn onchain interest, stating that it would democratize access to higher yields and provide more financial opportunities for the general public. “Consumers deserve a bigger piece of the pie. Opening the door for onchain interest will force us all to up our game for the ultimate benefit of consumers,” Armstrong said in a recent statement. He additionally emphasized that by enabling interest-bearing stablecoins, both the U.S. economy and global consumers would benefit from increased access to financial resources.

Even though the recent price weakness is often linked to the escalating US-led global trade war, several factors had already been weighing on investor sentiment long before President Donald Trump announced the tariffs. Some market participants claimed that Strategy’s $5.25 billion worth of Bitcoin purchases since February is the primary reason BTC has held above the $80,000 support. But, regardless of who has been buying, the reality is that Bitcoin was already showing limited upside before President Trump announced the 10% Chinese import tariffs on Jan. 21. Gold/USD (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph The S&P 500 index hit an all-time high on Feb. 19, exactly 30 days after the trade war began, while Bitcoin had repeatedly failed to hold above $100,000 for the previous three months. Although the trade war certainly affected investor risk appetite, strong evidence suggests Bitcoin's price weakness started well before President Trump took office on Jan. 20. Spot Bitcoin ETFs inflows, strategic Bitcoin reserve expectations and inflationary trends Another data point that weakens the relation with tariffs is the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw $2.75 billion in net inflows during the three weeks following Jan. 21. By Feb. 18, the US had announced plans to impose tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, while the European Union and China had already retaliated. In essence, institutional demand for Bitcoin persisted even as the trade war escalated. Part of Bitcoin traders’ disappointment after Jan. 21 stems from excessive expectations surrounding President Trump’s campaign promise of a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile,” mentioned at the Bitcoin Conference in July 2024. As investors grew impatient, their frustration peaked when the actual executive order was issued on March 6. A key factor behind Bitcoin’s struggle to break above $89,000 is an inflationary trend, reflecting a relatively successful strategy by global central banks. In February, the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose 2.5% year-over-year, while the eurozone Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 2.2% in March. Investors turn more risk-averse following weak job market data In the second half of 2022, Bitcoin’s gains were driven by inflation soaring above 5%, suggesting that businesses and families turned to cryptocurrency as a hedge against monetary debasement. However, if inflation remains relatively under control in 2025, lower interest rates would favor real estate and stock markets more directly than Bitcoin, as reduced financing costs boost those sectors. US CPI inflation (left) vs. US 2-year Treasury yield (right). Source: TradingView Related: Coinbase sees worst quarter since FTX collapse amid industry bloodbath The weakening job market also dampens traders’ demand for risk-on assets, including Bitcoin. In February, the US Labor Department reported job openings near a four-year low. Similarly, yields on the US 2-year Treasury fell to a six-month low, with investors accepting a modest 3.88% return for the safety of government-backed instruments. This data suggests a rising choice for risk aversion, which is unfavorable for Bitcoin. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s price weakness stems from investors' unrealistic expectations of BTC acquisitions by the US Treasury, declining inflation supporting potential interest rate cuts, and a more risk-averse macroeconomic environment as investors turn to short-term government bonds. While the trade war has had negative effects, Bitcoin was already showing signs of weakness before it began.

A breakout from a falling wedge signals bullish momentum Ripple (XRP) Stabilises at $2 as US Congress Reviews Stablecoin Bill on April 2 The cryptocurrency market witnessed a significant recovery this week, with Ripple’s XRP rebounding 5% from a local bottom of $2 to a high of $2.20 on Tuesday. The sharp 5% XRP price recovery comes as investors anticipate regulatory developments that could boost Ripple’s ecosystem, particularly with the US Congress set to review a new stablecoin bill on April 2. Ripple (XRP) Price Action | XRPUSDT The bill, expected to provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins, could play a crucial role in the adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD, a stablecoin designed to enhance liquidity and efficiency in cross-border payments. In recent weeks, Ripple executives have consistently advocated for regulatory clarity in the stablecoin sector, arguing that well-defined rules will drive institutional adoption of digital assets. Industry experts suggest that the official US stablecoin regulation bill could be pivotal growth driver for XRP price action in April 2025, with RLUSD positioned as a viable option for compliant on-chain settlements. Can Regulatory Clarity Drive XRP Price Rally? If outcome of the US Congress’ Stablecoin bill favors Ripple’s approach, XRP could experience a parabolic price surge, with some analysts predicting a climb toward the $10 mark in April. US Congress’ Financial Services Committee publishes draft version of US Stablecoin bill on Feb 6, 2025 | Source: Financialservices.house.gov Validating this narrative, analysts believe that XRP’s bullish momentum could intensify if the stablecoin bill provides a favorable regulatory environment for RLUSD and other crypto assets tied to Ripple’s payment solutions. Historically, regulatory clarity has been a key driver of price surges for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum , and a similar impact could be seen for XRP. Another major catalyst for XRP price action it the recent closure of its long-standing legal battle with the SEC, which had hindered broader institutional adoption in previous year. However, a pro-crypto stance from Trump’s administration, Ripple is poised to gain further traction in the payment and remittance sectors fruther expanding utility and adoption of the XRP native coin. Meanwhile, macroeconomic factors such as increased institutional interest in digital assets and a growing demand for stablecoin-backed payments could further support XRP’s upward trajectory. As US lawmakers finalize discussions on stablecoin regulations, Ripple’s strategic positioning in the sector could prove instrumental in driving substantial price gains for XRP in April. XRP Price Forecast for April 2025 XRP’s recent price recovery to $2.20 on Tuesday reflects growing optimism surrounding the stablecoin bill review set for April 2. If US Congress establishes clear regulations that favor Ripple’s RLUSD, the resulting institutional confidence and adoption could propel XRP toward the $10 mark in the coming weeks. With regulatory clarity acting as a potential catalyst, investors will be closely monitoring the developments in Washington to gauge XRP’s next big move. Technical indicators also align with a bullish outlook, with XRP’s price recovery to $2.20 signaling renewed buying momentum as traders anticipate regulatory clarity from the upcoming U.S. stablecoin bill review. The chart below shows XRP price recently bounced off the lower Donchian Channel band near $2.02, confirming a strong buying support at that level. XRP Price Forecast The falling wedge pattern, a bullish reversal structure, formed over several days before XRP decisively broke above the upper trendline. This breakout, supported by increased trading volume, indicates a shift in momentum. XRP now targets the $2.21 resistance, with a measured move from the wedge suggesting a rally toward $2.50. The Donchian Channel’s upper boundary at $2.21 aligns with immediate resistance, while the lower boundary at $2.02 marks key support. The RSI at 46.74 shows improving bullish momentum, recovering from oversold conditions. A move above 50 would reinforce upside strength. If XRP sustains momentum above $2.14, the next major target is $2.50. However, failure to hold this level could see a retest of $2.02 support before another breakout attempt.

Rather than immediate selling pressure, these moves could indicate a strategy to consolidate holdings during volatile times. The concentration of tokens in fewer hands may alter future network governance and influence. Improved tracking and clearer communication of such movements could help restore investor trust. The Neo Foundation denied involvement in recent NEO token sales following a 35.85% drop in price between March 24 and April 1, prompting concern across the crypto community. In a statement released after the sharp downturn, the foundation clarified that neither it nor its development arm, Neo Global Development (NGD), had sold any NEO tokens. It also ruled out any transactions by founders or core team members. The group has since begun tracking the origins of large transactions that coincided with the decline. Neo Foundation Investigates Mystery Wallet After NEO Transfer to Binance Between March 24 and April 1, the price of NEO fell from roughly $8 to $5, alarming many long-time holders. In response, the Neo Foundation and NGD launched an internal investigation to uncover the source of the volatility. Their analysis revealed significant activity tied to a Neo Legacy address that had accumulated approximately 11.8 million NEO between 2017 and 2021. The address reportedly moved over 11.1 million NEO to the Neo N3 blockchain in 2021. From there, the tokens were distributed through various wallets across several years before ending up at a Binance deposit address. We’d like to address the recent $NEO price volatility and share our investigation results. Neither Neo Foundation, Neo Global Development, Neo Founders, nor any team members were involved. We deeply value the trust and support of our community, and we’re here to navigate… https://t.co/fskCRKhezK — Neo Smart Economy (@Neo_Blockchain) April 1, 2025 Starting on March 24, 2025, around 9.25 million NEO — about 13.2% of the total circulating supply — began moving through intermediary wallets to Binance. These transfers were estimated at approximately $60 million, based on an average price of $6.50 per token. Although the timing matches the price decline, the foundation stated that the connection remains speculative. “It’s important to note that the activity of this address and the price changes are merely a correlation-based speculation,” the Neo Foundation stated. It added, “While the timing of these transfers aligns with the observed price drop, we cannot confirm a direct causal relationship at this stage.” The wallet in question still holds 2 million NEO. The Neo Foundation is now working with blockchain analytics firms and exchanges to trace the tokens further. “We understand the concerns this volatility and these large-scale transfers have caused within the Neo community, and we share your desire for clarity and stability,” the foundation stated. As the Neo Foundation continues its probe, it has pledged to keep the public informed and to maintain its commitment to the long-term stability of the ecosystem. Neo Foundation Responds as Crypto Market Volatility Intensifies NEO’s decline unfolded during a wider crypto sell-off, where altcoins and memecoins were hit by sudden liquidations on April 1. Act I The AI Prophecy (ACT) dropped nearly 60%, wiping out $96 million in value. Several meme tokens, such as HIPPO, BROCCOLI, and KISHU, followed suit with double-digit losses. Binance updated leverage & margin tiers on tokens like $ACT — and a whale got liquidated for $3.79M at $0.1877. Since then, the price of $ACT has plunged more than 50%. https://t.co/MT0EgNW8ib pic.twitter.com/CRuTR9bwSh — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 1, 2025 According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, Binance’s adjustments to its leverage and margin tiers triggered a wave of liquidations that contributed to the crash. NEO, sometimes referred to as the “Ethereum of China,” recorded a 30.8% weekly loss before recovering slightly with a 6.7% bounce. Coingecko data shows its daily trading volume has fallen 28.4% to $131 million. Once a dominant player in the blockchain sector, NEO’s market capitalization now sits at $390 million — a long way from its all-time high of $198. As the Neo Foundation continues investigating large NEO transfers to Binance, market watchers are eyeing the next developments closely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could these token movements be part of routine portfolio rebalancing rather than panic selling? Whales often shift tokens as a way to secure assets during turbulence. Such reallocation can be a precaution to manage risk, not necessarily a sign of forced liquidation. What might concentrated token flows to a centralized exchange imply for the network’s governance? When a few holders amass a larger share of tokens, it can shift voting power and decision-making influence—potentially prompting future changes in how the network is managed.

With major stablecoin bills moving through Congress and a pro-crypto administration in place, Armstrong sees this as a crucial moment to shape consumer-friendly policies in the U.S. The discussion comes as World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform tied to Donald Trump’s family, prepares to launch its own stablecoin. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to X on Monday to make a case for why the U.S. should allow stablecoin holders to earn interest similar to a traditional savings account, generating widespread debate on social media. Brian Armstrong Advocates For Stablecoin Onchain Interest According to Armstrong’s March 31 X post, the crypto executive believes that onchain interest would grant stablecoins the opportunity to “function as a form of payment” while offering consumers the ability to directly garner interest themselves. https://t.co/Y7JDtkRK1R — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 31, 2025 Armstrong argues that legislation allowing stablecoin holders to earn interest on stablecoins would democratize “access to the market yield rate” and give “regular people a fair shot at growing and maintaining their wealth.” “Opening the door for onchain interest will force us all to up our game for the ultimate benefit of consumers, and will keep this innovation onshore,” Armstrong continued. “Competition breeds strength and those who innovate will win, as they should.” Critics Push Back On Coinbase CEO’s Policy Proposal Despite the digital asset entrepreneur’s enthusiasm, not everyone in the crypto community was as receptive to his policy ideas. “Why wouldn’t these be tokenized shares in money market funds subject to the securities laws ?” said one user. “Doesn’t this ultimately ask the U.S. government to pay crypto users—in dollars—for making their dollars digital?” asked another. These criticisms have emerged at a time when stablecoins are gaining political attention. World Liberty Financial Announces Stablecoin Venture While the debate over interest-bearing stablecoin continues, the broader stablecoin landscape is evolving rapidly. Armstrong’s arguments come amid news that World Liberty Financial , the crypto platform affiliated with U.S. President Donald Trump and his family, has plans to launch its own stablecoin known as USD1. The timing is noteworthy. With major stablecoin legislation currently moving through the U.S. Congress, critics of the move claim it could potentially affect political decision-making. However, Armstrong indicated that upcoming congressional discussions could serve as a key platform for advancing consumer-friendly stablecoin policy. “We have a huge opportunity in front of us right now with a pro-crypto administration and Congress actively working on new stablecoin legislation,” he said. “We can choose to level the playing field and ensure these laws pave a way for all regulated stablecoins to deliver interest directly to consumers, the same way a savings or checking account can.” As stablecoin legislation advances through Congress and prominent figures like Armstrong advocate for specific features, the debate highlights the growing intersection between traditional finance, digital assets, and public policy. The outcome of these discussions could fundamentally reshape how Americans interact with digital dollars and potentially influence global cryptocurrency adoption patterns. Whether lawmakers will incorporate interest-bearing capabilities into forthcoming regulations remains a pivotal question for the industry’s development in the United States. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What would be the benefits of onchain interest? Allowing stablecoins to pay interest could give consumers access to higher returns than traditional bank savings accounts, expand financial inclusion worldwide, and encourage global adoption of USD-backed assets. What role does Congress play in this? With stablecoin legislation currently being debated in Congress, Armstrong sees this as a key opportunity to shape policies that support onchain interest while keeping financial innovation within the U.S. How is the crypto community reacting? While some support Armstrong’s push for more financial freedom, others question whether stablecoins should be treated differently from other interest-bearing assets regulated under securities laws.

In a new interview on the Wolf of all Streets YouTube channel, Hoskinson says memecoins need to evolve and develop use cases and user bases to avoid going through a ‘dumpening’ – the practice of launching tokens with the sole aim of enriching insiders. “So a memecoin is just like the ascendancy of a celebrity that has 15 minutes of fame. It doesn’t necessarily mean that that celebrity is going to disappear forever, but they’re in a temporary state of popularity. They have to find a way to become sustainable quickly or otherwise the people stop paying attention and they die out. It’s why the 99% of the memecoins will fail, and the ones that succeed, they pivot into ecosystem-building… They have to. It’s the only way they can survive. So typically, you have to build community, you have to start doing things with that community, you have to have a reason for people to be there and continue investing. And it’s really hard because, almost always, the distributions of memecoins are built for insider dump. So the person who issues it, and the insiders who issue it, their only incentive is to pump the price to dump the price. So they have to survive the dumpening.” Hoskinson also warns that memecoins are hurting the crypto industry, as issuers tend to drain capital from market participants instead of helping boost digital asset adoption “What’s happening is you’re moving water from one side of the bathtub to the other side of the bathtub… [and] the drain is open, it goes into the founder’s pocket. So basically, you’re not adding water to the tub, you’re losing water over time… It’s net-net neutral or negative.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While meme coins like Pepe and Official Trump have captured the spotlight with sharp rises and rapid declines, BlockDAG (BDAG) is steadily progressing under real-world conditions. Pepe achieved significant early success fueled by social media, and $TRUMP rose sharply with its political timing—only to encounter issues with volatility and longevity. In contrast, BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet “Primordial” is testing economic scenarios, mining capacity, and user interaction to affirm its network’s scalability. Having accumulated over $210 million and distributed 19 billion coins, it demonstrates potential for lasting stability in a market often swayed by fleeting hype. Pepe Coin Journey: How it Excels Pepe Coin (PEPE), introduced in 2023 as a meme-inspired digital currency, has become a top-performing meme token. Initially fueled by social media excitement and strong community support, PEPE has yielded significant returns for early participants. As of March 29, 2025, the coin has increased more than 300% since its launch. Forecasts indicate it might rise between 450% and 1500% throughout 2025, depending on how the market behaves. For example, a $1,000 early stake in 2024 might now be valued at over $4,000. At present, the coin’s value is approximately $0.00001226, with potential growth expected to reach $0.0000413 by year-end. Moreover, its deflationary mechanism—automatically burning a part of each transaction—plays a crucial role in enhancing its market value. Trump Coin: Political Impact on Crypto Market Launched on January 17, 2025, just before Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration, the $TRUMP meme coin quickly became a major topic of discussion. Within just two days, its market valuation rocketed from $600 million to over $13 billion, and its price surged from $7 to a high of $75 per token—an increase of over 900%. Consequently, early backers saw returns from 300% to 19,000%, with some transforming small bets into fortunes. However, the token’s value has significantly dropped by over 50% from its highest point, currently trading between $12.50 and $14. Future predictions remain hopeful, with potential growth of 289% by the end of 2025, possibly hitting €62.97. Moreover, the Trump Organization holds 80% of the token supply, which stirs concerns about centralization and conflicts of interest. Despite generating more than $350 million through token sales and fees, the coin has faced criticisms over ethical issues and financial losses to the community. Ultimately, the $TRUMP coin illustrates both the immense possibilities and the typical risks associated with politically associated cryptocurrencies. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Evaluates Performance Under Real Conditions BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet “Primordial” serves as a realistic testing environment, mimicking the actual conditions that the mainnet will encounter once operational. It is designed to evaluate the network’s performance including transaction speeds, miner activity, and wallet interactions under genuine economic pressures. The focus extends beyond merely spotting flaws; it’s about assessing the network’s resilience in real operational scenarios. The testnet achieves this through supporting more than 2,000 transactions per second with a DAG-based Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism (GHOSTDAG) that allows for simultaneous block processing, offering a significant edge over conventional blockchain systems. With plans to integrate over 200 mining nodes and tens of thousands of wallets, the testnet is currently verifying large-scale transaction handling, precise token distribution, and the execution of EVM-compatible smart contracts. Additionally, providing incentives for leading miners and active wallets ensures that participation mirrors genuine user interactions. For early participants, the numbers provide reassurance. BlockDAG’s crypto presale has successfully gathered $210 million, with more than 19 billion coins distributed thus far. Now in its 27th batch, the price of BDAG stands at $0.0248 each, showing a 2,380% increase in value from the initial batch. These figures not only indicate a growing interest but also confirm a robust confidence in the network’s scalability. Distinguishing Genuine Progress from Mere Speculation While hype can drive quick spikes in interest and potential short-term gains, it’s the robust infrastructure that maintains lasting appeal. Pepe and Official Trump have demonstrated the effects of hype with rapid increases and sudden drops. In contrast, BlockDAG is validating its technology in a different manner. By rigorously testing its Beta Testnet in scenarios that mirror actual usage, it transcends simple market buzz to prove its technical viability. With solid presale support and observable chain activity, BlockDAG is not just chasing fleeting headlines but is establishing a foundation for sustained operation. In a market filled with transient excitement, BlockDAG emphasizes the importance of building systems that are designed to last rather than merely to impress.

CRO Rises 40%, While ZEC Targets Breakout",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-shakes-the-crypto-market-5m-in-48-hours-cro-rises-40-while-zec-targets-breakout/,"Cronos (CRO) is on the upswing as the SEC concludes its investigation into Crypto.com without charges, resulting in a 40% increase over the week. This development reflects a more supportive regulatory environment, enhanced by Crypto.com’s exploratory deal with Trump Media regarding crypto ETFs. However, despite positive news, there’s ongoing speculation about a potential reintroduction of 70 billion CRO, which could impact the token’s supply stability. Simultaneously, Zcash (ZEC) has risen by 12% in 24 hours, surpassing the crucial $33 support level, and now aims for the $45.63 resistance, signaling potential for a significant reversal after a period of low performance. While CRO and ZEC are finding their footing, BlockDAG (BDAG) has surged ahead with a $5 million increase in just 48 hours following Keynote 3, taking its presale to over $210 million. With a functioning beta testnet and substantial user engagement evidenced by over 800,000 app users, BlockDAG demonstrates effective execution beyond mere planning. CRO Climbs 40% This Week Cronos (CRO) is capturing attention again with a 40% rise this week, following the SEC’s decision to end its inquiry into Crypto.com without penalties. This marks a significant positive shift for the crypto landscape under the new SEC leadership, signaling a more lenient approach to digital assets. The enthusiasm is bolstered by Crypto.com’s tentative agreement with Trump Media to introduce crypto-backed ETFs, which propelled CRO by an additional 10% in just a day. Yet, the excitement is tempered by warnings from on-chain analyst ZachXBT about the possible return of 70 billion CRO tokens to circulation, which raises market integrity concerns. Zcash (ZEC) Surges 12% in a Day—Could This Signal a Major Market Shift? Zcash (ZEC) is regaining momentum with a 12% increase, pushing it back into the top 100 cryptocurrencies. After rallying from a low of $25 to regain the critical $33 support, this could be the start of a new upward trend after extended declines. While the immediate outlook shows mixed signals, the successful breach of a long-term downtrend and positive indicators on the RSI and MACD suggest increasing momentum. Potential buyers should monitor the $45.63 resistance closely. A breakthrough could initiate a wider rally. As one of the foundational privacy-focused coins, ZEC maintains enduring relevance, and current low prices might offer a significant entry point with substantial growth prospects. BlockDAG Secures $5M Rapidly Following Keynote 3 In a remarkable 48-hour period post-Keynote 3, BlockDAG has garnered an impressive $5 million, pushing its presale total beyond $210 million. This significant increase occurred shortly after demonstrating substantial advancements, including a live Beta Testnet with over 1.2 million transactions, robust block explorer capabilities, and comprehensive tools for token and NFT creation, alongside the operation of more than 100 active nodes. Unlike some Layer 1 projects that are still in the planning phase, BlockDAG is actively delivering results, which is catalyzing a strong response from the market. Currently, during Batch 27 of sales, BDAG is priced at $0.0248, with more than 19 billion coins already sold. Complemented by a vibrant community of over 800,000 X1 App users and 16,700+ units sold to miners, along with high-profile partnerships like those with Inter Milan and UFC, it’s clear why analysts are optimistic about BDAG reaching $1 post-listing. With the crypto presale accelerating following Keynote 3, the impending launch of mainnet features, DeFi tools, and new exchange listings is highly anticipated. The recent $5 million raised in just two days is a strong indicator of the potential excitement surrounding BDAG’s official release. This could be an opportunity many will wish they hadn’t missed. Critical Insights While CRO’s recent price jump might look attractive for quick gains, ongoing uncertainties about its token supply and overall market trust could dampen its growth. Meanwhile, Zcash faces its own challenges in sustaining momentum after its initial market recovery, with its long-term viability still to be proven. The future of both projects hinges on upcoming developments, including market sentiment shifts, new partnerships, and their ability to overcome technical resistance levels. In contrast, BlockDAG is turning potential into tangible success. The latest Keynote didn’t just serve as a promotional event but highlighted a project that is already in full swing, with over 1.2 million transactions on its testnet and effective smart contract functionalities, backed by a community that’s actively engaging with its tools. The swift $5 million raised post-Keynote isn’t just excitement; it’s a strong endorsement from both retail and institutional participants. Unlike its peers, BlockDAG isn’t merely waiting for external factors to boost its profile; it’s actively creating its momentum.

Elon brought charts, handed out $1 million checks, and used a packed town hall to accuse Biden of funneling taxpayer funds into what he called a broken system. The rally happened just a day and a half before polls opened in a high-stakes state judicial election. The event grabbed national attention after Elon gave the money to two Wisconsin voters who signed a petition against “activist judges.” That petition followed a ruling from the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which refused to hear a case saying the giveaway was illegal. After the checks, Elon brought up his DOGE associate Antonio Gracias to talk about what they uncovered inside the Social Security Administration. Behind them, a large slide appeared with the words “New Non-Citizen Social Security Numbers Issued.” Antonio explained what it meant. Elon Musk at the rally event. Source: Fox News/Getty Images “We started at the top of the system, mapping the whole system of Social Security to understand where all the fraud was,” Antonio said during the event. “But this is what jumped out at us. When we saw these numbers, we were like, ‘What is this?’” Antonio said that between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2025, noncitizens were issued Social Security numbers in growing numbers. In fiscal year 2024 alone, more than 2 million received them. The year before that, and even in fiscal year 2025 which began in October and runs through this September, the number was around 1 million each year. “This literally blew us away,” Antonio said. “We went there to find fraud and we found this by accident.” Elon’s Social Security overhaul may slow checks and support Jason Fichtner, who served as deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration under President George W. Bush, said things are getting risky. “Now I’m concerned that benefits could get disrupted,” he said. Jason said these new updates aren’t small tweaks—they could block people from getting help at all. Jason joined Kathleen Romig, another former SSA official and now director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in a public op-ed. They wrote that 7,000 workers have been removed from the SSA, and six regional offices have been shut down. That means fewer people to help, longer lines at field offices, and more bugs on the official SSA website. The phone line? It already had long waits before the layoffs. Now it’s worse. Kathleen and Jason said this mess could hit people with disabilities hardest. Delays could leave them waiting so long they die before getting the money they’re owed. “The Social Security Administration is in crisis, and people’s benefits are at risk,” they wrote. Jason also spoke about DOGE’s plan to wipe out COBOL, the old programming language that runs millions of lines of SSA code. DOGE wants to rebuild the entire system in a few months. Jason said that’s reckless. “If you start messing with the system’s code, that could impact those who are currently getting benefits now,” he said. Normally, a change like that would take years. It would start with one state, then move out slowly to other regions. Jason said DOGE isn’t doing that. Instead, they’re forcing everything through in a tight window, with no time for test runs or slow rollouts. Jason said he wasn’t too worried at first. He knew there were service delays, but he didn’t think people’s monthly checks were at risk. But now, with this COBOL plan moving full speed, he said it’s a whole new problem. The Social Security Administration responded by email saying, “There is no validity to these reports.” The White House used the same exact words too, oddly enough.

The company collapsed amid a liquidity crisis and fraud allegations. The news uncovered that Alameda Research, a closely related trading company to FTX, had invested billions of dollars of client funds in dubious investments. As clients flocked to withdraw their cash, FTX had insufficient funds to accommodate the demands, sending investors into chaos and the company’s swift downfall. FTX and Alameda Research collapsed on November 11, 2022. Further investigations indicated that FTX’s founder and chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, had diverted customer deposits. He was charged and convicted of fraud and conspiracy. The European subsidiary, FTX EU, was also impacted. Even with the stricter European oversight, customer assets in the broader FTX bankruptcy were trapped. FTX EU was purchased in January 2025 by Backpack Exchange, a regulated global cryptocurrency platform founded by ex-FTX and Alameda Research staff. The FTX bankruptcy court and the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) gave the acquisition the green light, allowing Backpack to scale its services throughout Europe. As part of the acquisition, Backpack would have handled the distribution of court-eventually approved bankruptcy claims to FTX EU customers, with a target to speed up the restitution process. Backpack Exchange has structured a claims process to facilitate customer restitution Backpack Exchange has created a simple process to recover funds for the affected FTX EU clients. The process starts with identity verification, requiring users to utilize a responsive verification system. The step is live and can be accessed via Backpack’s official claims page. Users who have successfully passed the verification process can then withdraw their funds. Backpack will share instructions as soon as the withdrawal phase goes live CEO Armani Ferrante stated that this is a significant effort and reaffirmed restitution to customers as a central element of building trust and confidence across the industry. Backpack Exchange has also made extensive support accessible across supported channels to assist users in recovery. The community is reacting and sharing feedback on social media The request for the asset recovery process brought different views within the crypto ecosystem. Responses from users on the social media platform have been optimistic and sceptical. “It’s been a really long road for us,” one user posted . Another said, “This is the minimum they could do after all of this time. I hope it will not take long.” Another one stated. The structured claims process is a great step in the right direction to re-attach FTX EU customers’ funds to the company while the company is now where it needed to be from the beginning, in the customer’s hands. As the Backpack Exchange aims to rebalance, however, the gaze of the cryptocurrency community will fall on them to secure their trust for good. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Despite the current rally, it remains unknown how the BTC price will react to the tariffs in the long term. Bitcoin is known to exhibit short-term reversal to macroeconomic uncertainties, a trend many believe may play out again. State of the Donald Trump Reciprocal Tariff One of the most crucial policies in the Donald Trump administration is levying tariffs on key trade partners. While this move is considered a commensurate measure to match what other trade partners are levying on US goods, the aftermath has toppled the market. Almost all big economies, including Russia have received Tariff threat from the US government. This threat is bound to be matched by the countries involved, including Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union. With Trump’s tariff kickstarting on April 2, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has revealed that reciprocal measures will be announced on April 3. This tariff war is poised to offset the mainstream stock market. The signs are already visible in the S&P 500, which has dropped by over 2% in the past five trading days. Similar negative sentiment is seen for the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones. The correlation between Bitcoin price and the mainstream financial market remains a fueling factor behind potential negative shifts in the market moving forward. Bitcoin Price is Yet to Adjust As of writing, the price of Bitcoin has rallied 3.44% in 24 hours to $85,186.47, according to CoinMarketCap data . However, the coin’s price has experienced a unique drawdown over the past week, dropping 2.79%. Since President Trump took office, the price of Bitcoin has experienced a mix of positive and negative sentiments. Amid the positive shifts, the BTC price hit $109,114 ATH on January 20, corresponding with President Trump’s inauguration. Since the all-time high milestone, Bitcoin price has fallen by over 20% to date. With the trade wars forming a headwind for the coin, more volatility is expected in the short term. With the trade war and reciprocal tariffs, inflation will soar again, forcing the Federal Reserve to adjust its interest rate policy. Should rates be slashed to boost the monetary landscape, it can set a basis for more BTC adoption, leading to a price surge in the long term. BTC Price and Key Tailwinds to Watch While April started positively for the top coin, the month still holds uncertainties per the trade war. However, some important tailwinds are at play that may influence market valuation moving forward. The US government’s strategic Bitcoin reserve might serve as a basis for more nation-state adoption in the long term. Institutional investors are also betting on BTC, creating a high demand for the coin. Despite the current volatility, top advocates advise buying now with hopes of a rebound soon.

The analyst warns that this technical formation could trigger a significant price correction for XRP, describing this downturn as the worst-case scenario. Analyst Predicts XRP Price Crash To $1.15 The ‘Charting Guy,’ a pseudonymous crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has unveiled a potential Head and Shoulder pattern formation on the XRP price chart. The analyst has shared insights into the implications of this technical pattern, projecting a potential crash in the XRP price. Related Reading: XRP Price Breakdown below $2: Analyst Reveals Next Major Support As a well-known bearish reversal pattern, the formation of a Head and Shoulder in the XRP price chart suggests a potential shift from an uptrend to a downtrend. Typically, a Head and Shoulder pattern consists of three peaks: the Left Shoulder, Head, and Right Shoulder. However, the Charting Guy has confirmed that XRP’s current pattern formation consists of two right shoulders and one head. Due to this irregularity, the analyst has expressed doubt about the possibility of the pattern playing out. If the Head and Shoulder pattern eventually takes shape, it could lead to a significant drop in the XRP price, potentially bringing it down to as low as $1.15. This price level aligns with a key Fibonacci Golden Pocket retracement zone between 0.618 – 0.786. Notably, the analyst has described this projected price crash as the worst-case scenario for XRP. While he believes a bearish move is possible, the analyst is confident that XRP’s broader market structure is bullish. Moreover, the Charting Guy argues that if XRP does decline to $1.15, it would likely serve as a healthy retracement in an overall bullish trend. He noted that XRP’s price has been holding the $2 level on daily closes, meaning its price action remains strong above support levels. This also indicates the possibility of an uptrend resumption that could yield higher highs and higher lows for XRP. Key Support And Resistance Levels To Watch The Charting Guy’s analysis of XRP’s potential Head and Shoulder pattern formation highlights several critical price levels to watch. Since XRP has consistently closed daily candles above $2, the analyst has determined this level as short-term support. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Begin Part 2 Of Bullish Wave 5 Movement, Here Are The Targets XRP has also been wicking during recent pullbacks in a crucial range between $1.7 and $1.9. As a result, the crypto analyst has revealed that he will be watching this area closely for a potential price bounce. The Golden Pocket retracement zone, which represents the worst-case scenario for the XRP price, is between $1.15 and $1.30. If XRP experiences a deeper price correction, lower support levels have been marked from $1.19 to $0.91. For its resistance levels, the Charting Guy has pinpointed $2.27 as a key price point. Additionally, $3.14 – $3.32 has been identified as an upper resistance range where XRP could rally if bullish momentum resumes.

Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), once the undisputed performers of the blockchain world, are seeing investors turn their attention elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an emerging player in decentralized finance that is capturing market interest at an unprecedented pace. With ETH currently trading at $1,814 and SOL at $126, their growth appears to be tapering, MUTM tokens are available during their Phase 4 presale which are priced at $0.025. A strong investor backing emerged through the acquisition of more than 7700 buyers who have raised $6 million during the presale process. Investors participating in Mutuum Finance Phase 4 token purchase earn 140% profit at $0.06 at exchange launch. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates in Phase 4 The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale is in progress while the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of hyper-inflated meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 4 of the presale has surpassed $5.9 million total shares and attracted more than 7600 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.025 during Phase 4 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Investors who bought in Phase 4 obtained 140% growth from their investment once MUTM launches. The current cost of MUTM attracts investors to buy during Phase 5 since it will undergo another pricing increase to 0.03. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders receive dependable income while borrowers get secure financing opportunities through this system. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Security takes precedence in this ecosystem through combination with open-source smart contracts along with third-party audits to establish complete transparency. The MUTM token holders benefit from both price growth potential and earn passive income while receiving investments through a strategic buyback system that strengthens long-term token value. Mutuum Finance aims to increase accessibility and liquidity by implementing multi-chain expansion which will include EVM and non-EVM blockchain support. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining decentralized lending with its innovative dual-model system, attracting thousands of investors seeking sustainable DeFi solutions. The Phase 4 presale has already raised over $6 million from more than 7,700 buyers, with the token price set to surge from $0.025 to $0.06 at launch, delivering an impressive 140% profit potential. As traditional blockchain giants like Ethereum and Solana experience slowed momentum, savvy investors are securing their positions in MUTM before the next price increase in Phase 5. With its cutting-edge security, automated interest rate adjustments, and multi-chain expansion, Mutuum Finance is primed for long-term success. Don’t miss out on this opportunity and join the presale today and be part of the future of DeFi.

Pineau’s announcement comes just weeks before Meta’s LlamaCon AI conference on April 29, where the company is set to unveil the latest version of Llama. Pineau departs Meta as AI race intensifies under Zuckerberg’s vision In a LinkedIn post, Pineau, who serves as Meta’s Vice President of AI Research, revealed that her last day at the company will be May 30. Her departure comes at a crucial moment for Meta, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made AI a top priority, committing billions of dollars to position the company as a leader in the field, ahead of competitors like OpenAI and Google. According to Zuckerberg, his goal for Meta is to build an AI assistant with more than 1 billion users and artificial general intelligence, which is a term used to describe computers that can think and take actions comparable to humans. “As the world undergoes significant change, as the race for AI accelerates, and as Meta prepares for its next chapter, it is time to create space for others to pursue the work,” Pineau wrote. She noted that she would be cheering from the sidelines, knowing that the firm has all the ingredients needed to build the best AI systems in the world and responsibly bring them into the lives of billions of people. Pineau was one of Meta’s leading AI researchers, having headed the company’s fundamental AI research division, FAIR, since 2023. In this role, she guided the company’s advanced computer science research, much of which has been integrated into its core applications. Pineau reflects on legacy at Meta ahead of key AI milestones and LlamaCon event Pineau began her tenure at Meta in 2017 to lead Meta’s Montreal AI research lab . In addition to her role at Meta, she is a computer science professor at McGill University, where she is a co-director of its reasoning and learning lab. She helped oversee some of the projects, including Meta’s open-source Llama family of AI models and other technologies, such as the PyTorch software for AI developers. Her departure announcement comes a few weeks ahead of Meta’s LlamaCon AI conference at the end of this month. In this event, Meta is expected to provide details on its latest version of Llama. Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, to whom Pineau reported had earlier, noted that Llama 4 will help power AI agents, the latest craze in generative AI. The firm is also expected to announce a standalone app for its Meta AI chatbot. A Meta spokesperson expressed gratitude for Joelle Pineau’s leadership of FAIR and acknowledged her significant contributions as an important advocate for Open Source. They highlighted her role in driving breakthroughs that have advanced both the company’s products and the science behind them. Pineau has not revealed her next role but said she “will be taking some time to observe and to reflect before jumping into a new adventure.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Investors hoped that regulatory reform and policies like a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve would drive prices appreciably higher. But it’s been the opposite. Bitcoin has fallen from highs well above $100,000 at the beginning of the year to a trough in the mid-80,000s for most of March. Crypto prices have suffered from being increasingly correlated with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, which have been hit by macroeconomic uncertainty. Tariffs — surcharges the U.S. places on imports from other countries — have Wall Street worried about a global recession. Crypto investors have been steering clear of crypto assets, which are seen as relatively risky. “This is all about markets’ ‘risk appetite’ which continues to deteriorate, and for the time being drives a wedge between crypto assets and gold, which continues to be the ‘safe haven’ of choice,” said Marc Ostwald, Chief Economist & Global Strategist at ADM Investor Services International. “[That’s] in no small part driven by central bank FX reserve managers, who are seeking to reduce USD exposure, which has long been a source of concern to them.” As the global financial and trade system becomes more fragmented, investors are seeking alternatives to riskier assets, including dollars. For now, that means turning to gold, which is up 18% year-to-date. But that could change, said Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and author of ""The Story of the Blockchain: A Beginner's Guide to the Technology That Nobody Understands."" Bitcoin could be the new gold soon enough. “I think the entire [future] is uncertain and in some ways unknowable, because there are many crosscurrents and both crypto and tariffs are new. Some people argue that crypto is just a risk-on tech asset and would sell off due to tariffs. But bitcoin has found footing in some circles as ‘digital gold’ and the physical variety is soaring on the tariff news. So which will it be?” In other words, economic uncertainty could lead investors to seek out bitcoin just as they have sought out gold in recent months. Another note of positivity: the impact of tariffs on crypto could be “priced in” and the worst might be over already, said Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale, a leading crypto asset management firm. President Trump is due to announce U.S. tariffs on Wednesday, April 2, at 4 p.m. ET—what’s known as “Liberation Day.” According to reports, he’ll lay out “reciprocal tariffs” against 15 countries that have levied tariffs against the U.S., including China, Canada and Mexico. Pandl estimates tariffs have so far taken 2% off economic growth this year. But Liberation Day might actually stop the worst of the pain felt in financial markets. “If we see an announcement [on Wednesday] that is tough but phased, and focused on the 15 countries they seem to be targeting, my expectation is that markets will rally on that news,” Pandl told CoinDesk. “Potentially once we get through this announcement, crypto markets can focus back on the fundamentals which are very positive.” Pandl said announcements like Circle’s IPO wouldn’t be happening if institutions didn’t have a high degree of confidence in the digital assets sector and the policies around it. Moreover, Pandl, a former macro-economist at Goldman Sachs, believes that tariffs will increase the appetite for currencies that aren’t dollars. “I think tariffs will weaken the dominant role of the dollar and create space for competitors including bitcoin. Prices have gone down in the short run. But the first few months of the Trump Administration have raised my conviction in the longer term for bitcoin as a global monetary asset.” Pendl still believes that bitcoin will hit new all-time highs this year, despite current pessimism around prices. “I wouldn’t have quit my Wall Street job if I didn’t think bitcoin will be the winner in the long term,” he said.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 01:28:58

Genesis Global Capital LLC, 23-cv-00287 , filed in the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). This lawsuit alleges that Gemini failed to register its cryptocurrency asset lending program, Gemini Earn, before offering it to retail investors. Gemini and SEC seek 60-day pause in legal battle over Gemini Earn In a joint letter filed on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court, the twins’ Gemini Trust and the SEC asked to hold all deadlines in the civil case over Gemini Earn for 60 days to allow the parties to explore a potential resolution. The letter did not say whether this might entail a settlement, the government agency dropping its case, or some other outcome. Neither Gemini’s nor the SEC’s lawyers immediately responded to requests for comment. In 2023, the regulatory body filed a lawsuit against Gemini, alleging that the exchange and Genesis Global Capital unlawfully raised billions of dollars in cryptocurrency through the Gemini Earn program. The program allowed customers to lend crypto assets, including Bitcoin, to Genesis in exchange for interest payments, with Gemini taking a fee as high as 4.29%. Genesis halted withdrawals in November 2022, the same month Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX cryptocurrency exchange collapsed. Two months later, it filed for bankruptcy. At the time, it held $900 million of assets from about 340,000 Gemini Earn customers. According to the SEC, Genesis and Gemini bypassed disclosure requirements meant to protect investors in creating Gemini Earn. Genesis agreed in March 2024 to pay a $21 million fine to settle, pending the resolution of claims in its Chapter 11 case, without admitting wrongdoing. On the other hand, Gemini continues to deny any wrongdoing in relation to the allegations. SEC shifts crypto regulatory stance under Trump, easing oversight and settling key cases The SEC has eased oversight of the cryptocurrency industry since Donald Trump became president in January. It is widely expected to remain more supportive of it than under the Biden administration. In recent weeks, the watchdog has ended civil lawsuits against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and agreed to settle a case against cryptocurrency company Ripple Labs over the unregistered sale of securities. Many crypto advocates hailed Trump’s election, hoping for more industry-friendly regulation and less regulatory enforcement. The billionaire Winklevoss brothers, Tyler and Cameron, each donated $844,600 to Trump’s 2024 campaign, the maximum allowed under federal law. According to Forbes, the brothers are each worth $3 billion. In a separate matter, Gemini reached a settlement with New York regulators, agreeing to return at least $1.1 billion to its customers.

This decision follows several days of controversy over the building’s status. Although the formal dispute continues in court, the judge stated that the building transfer has already taken place and thus cannot be undone at this time. On Saturday, officials associated with DOGE transferred the USIP headquarters, located in Washington, DC, to the General Services Administration (GSA). Judge Howell wrote that the transfer is “no longer merely ‘proposed’ but done,” which, in her view, made the plaintiffs’ request to block it moot for now. The building also contains office property and fixtures whose ownership the former USIP staff hoped to protect through the legal process. USIP building in Washington, DC. Source: Wikipedia George Foote, a longtime outside general counsel to the institute, has voiced frustration with the situation. In his words, “That’s like letting a burglar break into your house, steal your TV, and have the court say well, there’s no TV to adjudicate, so I can’t do anything about it.” This building has become a focal point of a dispute between the USIP’s former board and staff and members of DOGE. On March 14, the Trump administration dismissed the institute’s 10 voting board members. When USIP staff refused to allow DOGE employees to enter the headquarters, the DOGE group returned with a physical key that a former security contractor had given them. That action allowed DOGE to take physical control of the premises. After that, a series of personnel changes occurred within the institute itself. First, former State Department official Kenneth Jackson was put in place as USIP president. Then, on March 25, DOGE staffer Nate Cavanaugh replaced him. Before that, Cavanaugh had been assigned to the GSA. By last Friday evening, the majority of USIP employees received termination notices, effectively bringing the agency’s work to a standstill. Details from a lawsuit filed on Monday by former USIP staffers against Cavanaugh, DOGE, Donald Trump, and others in the administration show that Cavanaugh sought to transfer the headquarters to the GSA without asking the government to pay anything. In a letter, he told GSA Acting Administrator Stephen Ehikian that the transfer “is in the best interest of USIP, the federal government, and the United States.” In a different letter dated March 29, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought agreed to Ehikian’s request to “set the amount of reimbursement at no cost” for the facility. A court filing from Monday also lays out the Trump administration’s reasoning. Michael Peters, who leads the Public Buildings Service at the GSA, wrote in a transfer request form that “The transfer of the U.S. Institutes [sic] of Peace (USIP) headquarters facility … is a priority of the Trump-Vance administration.” The building’s transfer may not be permanent, at least for now Under the arrangement just approved by Howell, the federal government obtains the USIP building at no cost, even though the structure itself is valued at around $500 million. The institute’s endowment, worth more than $20 million across various bank accounts, still belongs to USIP for the moment. However, that endowment might also face uncertainty later. Judge Howell said there is no immediate need to stop any transfer of funds and that she did not view blocking it as essential to the broader case right now. One major issue is whether the USIP belongs fully to the federal government or operates as an independent agency outside of the executive branch. Lawyers for DOGE have argued in court that the USIP is a “wholly owned government corporation,” giving the GSA permission to take its property. On the other side, attorneys for USIP point to the 1984 United States Institute of Peace Act, which established the institute as an “independent, nonprofit, national institute.” That legislation, in their view, clearly separates USIP from typical federal agencies. They also contend that the headquarters building resulted from extensive private donations, which means it should not be seized as a public asset. Judge Howell has acknowledged that both sides have introduced conflicting arguments and says that “ambiguity persists” because there is very little law on point about how exactly to classify the USIP. Previously, she declined the institute’s request for a temporary restraining order that would have allowed the original board to return to their positions. That denial left the institute under DOGE’s control, at least for the time being. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

You should not overlook this. BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly gaining attention as a high-speed Layer 1 platform backed by a hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work model. With its expanding use cases and appeal to meme coin creators, it’s earning a reputation as the potential “Solana alternative” for 2025. However, what’s pushing it to the forefront isn’t just the technology—it’s the growing trend of meme coin adoption. The numbers highlight the momentum. BlockDAG has already raised over $210 million in its presale, with $5 million collected within just two days after Keynote 3. Now in Batch 27, BDAG is selling at $0.0248, with more than 19 billion coins distributed—showing no signs of slowing. Why Meme Coins Flourish on Layer 1 Chains with the Right Setup Solana’s growth wasn’t only because of its speed. It became a base for meme tokens like BONK, WIF, and SAMO due to cheap fees and quick transactions. But Solana has had issues like network disruptions and weak EVM integration, making DeFi expansion harder. BlockDAG takes these problems into account and brings added functionality. Keynote 3 revealed that BlockDAG’s mainnet will launch with full DeFi capabilities: Swaps: Allowing instant trading of meme coins. Lending & Staking: Letting users earn on idle assets. Bridges: Making it easier to move coins between chains. Governance Modules: Letting communities participate in project direction. Token & NFT Creation Wizard: Helping users launch meme coins quickly without needing to write any code. What sets BlockDAG apart is that it’s compatible with both EVM and WASM. That allows builders from Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems to easily bring their projects over. Meme coins thrive on fast execution, strong community support, and liquidity. BlockDAG brings all three to the table. User Growth Shows Meme Ecosystem Is Already Taking Shape on BlockDAG The base of a meme coin economy is user energy—memes, activities, and online participation. BlockDAG’s network shows strong signs: Over 800,000 users mining BDAG on the X1 Miner App More than 400,000 have joined the Tap Miner game Around 170,000 users have taken part in the presale These aren’t inflated numbers or inactive accounts. They’re real people interacting with the ecosystem and mining BDAG before it reaches centralized platforms. That kind of early activity helped push Solana into the meme coin spotlight. BlockDAG appears to be building similar momentum, with more structure behind it. Meme Coins Need DeFi Tools—BlockDAG Makes Them Accessible For meme coins to last, they must go beyond just hype. With BlockDAG’s tools, meme tokens can function within a full ecosystem. Users can launch a community token, list it on a BDAG-powered DEX, activate staking features, and set up bridges—all without coding. These tools were already shown in action during the Beta Testnet in Keynote 3. This early exposure is drawing attention from outside players, too. BlockDAG has over 10 confirmed exchange listings coming after the mainnet, and there are talks about large-scale backing preparing to enter. At the current price of $0.0248, there’s rising anticipation around BDAG touching the $1 mark. The combined effect of liquidity, staking activity, and listings creates a strong path for price growth. BlockDAG Sets the Stage for Meme Coin Breakouts With more than $210 million already secured during the crypto presale , BlockDAG’s structure is turning heads. Its combination of fast processing, EVM/WASM compatibility, and active participation makes it more than just a tech solution. “It’s about the next phase,” shared CEO Antony Turner during Keynote 3, hinting at the project’s roadmap. What lies ahead could set off a new era of meme coins—this time on a foundation built for performance and community strength. Solana began the trend. BlockDAG is ready to scale it. With high-speed architecture and tools that simplify meme coin development, the potential is growing. At the current price point, the entry looks promising.

However, the price remains confined within specific ranges, and tools like RSI and MACD suggest declining strength. Concurrently, Tether is evolving past its stablecoin persona by buying a 30% share in Be Water Media for $10.8 million. This strategy leans more towards influence than just infrastructure. On another front, BlockDAG (BDAG) is playing a whole new game. With a $210 million fund, over 800,000 miners, and an active hybrid DAG + PoW testnet, BlockDAG isn’t just in the news—it’s creating history. From enhancing smart contract safety to achieving 2,000 transactions per second, it”‘ putting into action what others merely discuss. While ETH and USDT are repositioning themselves, BlockDAG is precisely advancing towards a full Layer-1 debut, potentially transforming the crypto architecture completely. Ethereum Whales Build Up Pre-Pectra—Yet Risks of Breakdown Persist Ethereum whales are intensifying their purchases as the Pectra mainnet upgrade nears, scheduled for April 30. Lookonchain data indicates substantial acquisitions, including a whale who bought over $103 million worth of ETH. Additionally, exchange reserves have diminished by close to one million ETH since early March, suggesting increased accumulation. Despite this positive sentiment, ETH’s price remains subdued. It recently fell below a crucial trendline after failing at $2,069, which heightens the risk of a significant drop towards $1,800 or even $1,200 if a bearish pattern holds. Early indicators from RSI and MACD point to growing weaknesses. While the Pectra upgrade could stimulate network activities, wider economic uncertainties and ETF withdrawals are tempering the momentum. Market watchers should keep an eye on $2,069 and $1,800; the first level to give could dictate Ethereum’s next significant direction. Tether Secures 30% of Be Water Media in $10.8M Transaction Tether has boldly stepped outside the cryptocurrency sphere by securing a 30.4% interest in the Italian media company Be Water for €10 million ($10.8 million). With CEO Paolo Ardoino joining Be Water’s board, Tether is positioning itself to impact the media through storytelling and advanced technology content. This strategic pivot marks Tether’s transition from focusing solely on stablecoins to engaging in film, podcasts, and live media production. While Guido Maria Brera continues to hold the majority stake, Tether’s involvement could redefine how content is produced and distributed across different platforms. As the lines between cryptocurrency and mainstream media continue to merge, this investment places Tether at the forefront of influencing digital narratives. This move is viewed by analysts as part of a broader strategy where crypto entities penetrate traditional sectors to broaden their influence and lessen their dependency on primary offerings. Upcoming regulatory discussions might ensue as the crypto industry further integrates with mainstream sectors. BlockDAG Raises $210M—Could This Redefine Layer-1 Technologies? BlockDAG has successfully raised $210 million through its presale, showcasing its strength in smart Layer-1 design, eclipsing many trend-based crypto initiatives. This platform is engineered for scalability, security, and decentralization from the ground up, steering clear of reliance on secondary patches and Layer-2 solutions. During Keynote 3, the team unveiled modern hybrid architecture combining Proof-of-Work with DAG, allowing simultaneous transaction processing. This framework not only runs a beta testnet but is also geared up for 2,000 transactions per second at launch, with aspirations to expand to 15,000 TPS in the next two years. Security is a paramount feature, with each smart contract rigorously audited by Certik and Halborn, and the treasury safeguarded through multi-party computation, eliminating any single failure points. The system’s inherent real-time threat monitoring and network defenses negate the necessity for supplementary security layers. Already supported by over 800,000 X1 miners and 170,000 holders, and enhanced by an accessible no-code token creation tool, BlockDAG is a testament to robust, integral infrastructure. It integrates functionalities ranging from DeFi to governance seamlessly within a secure Layer-1 environment. As other networks add layers of complexity, BlockDAG demonstrates that a strong foundational build is superior to makeshift solutions. With the mainnet launch imminent, the focus shifts from potential to actual implementation. Key Insights The upcoming reaction to Ethereum’s Pectra mainnet could swing ETH’s value significantly. Tether’s venture into media is bold and shows long-term ambition but lacks immediate benefits to its network, presenting both opportunities and risks. These moves are crucial yet speculative. Keynote 3 introduced a dynamic ecosystem actively developing—featuring DeFi innovations, a treasury secured by MPC, and tools for creating no-code NFTs and tokens, with global hackathons in progress. BlockDAG’s approach eschews dependence on Layer-2 adjustments or external narrative shifts, focusing instead on direct scalability, security, and market adoption. The $210 million milestone in the crypto presale signals robust confidence from over 170,000 holders, distinguishing BlockDAG in a market saturated with transient trends. While Ethereum and Tether are planning their future moves, BlockDAG is already delivering tangible results, establishing its platform one block at a time. The vision for the future of crypto isn’t layered—it’s built on a solid foundation, and BlockDAG’s foundation is firmly in place.

However, as the market evolves, Ethereum is facing a slowdown, leading smart investors to seek higher-growth alternatives. With scalability concerns, high gas fees, and slowing institutional interest, Ethereum’s dominance is being challenged. This has opened the door for new projects with better efficiency, lower costs, and stronger upside potential. One hidden crypto gaining traction among early adopters and institutional investors is RCO Finance (RCOF) , a next-generation crypto designed to deliver explosive returns and real-world utility. Why Ethereum’s (ETH) Growth Is Slowing Ethereum (ETH), once hailed as the backbone of decentralized finance and blockchain innovation, has faced significant challenges recently. Now trading at $1,837, ETH has dropped by over 55% since November, when it rose to $4,106, the closest it has been to its all-time high since 2021. Here’s what is causing this declining performance. Despite hosting over 60% of all DeFi projects, Ethereum is no longer the only major player in the blockchain space. Competitors like Solana , Cardano , and Avalanche have gained traction by offering faster transaction speeds and lower costs. They are increasingly attracting developers and projects that might have otherwise chosen Ethereum. Ethereum’s transaction fees have remained a major pain point for users. Despite layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, the cost of interacting with the Ethereum network remains significantly higher than newer blockchain solutions. This has pushed many developers and users toward more affordable platforms. While Ethereum was once the go-to blockchain for institutional adoption, many investment firms and hedge funds are now exploring newer blockchain ecosystems that offer better speed, lower costs, and advanced financial tools. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Hidden Crypto Smart Money Is Migrating To As Ethereum’s growth slows, smart investors are rotating into undervalued cryptos with stronger short-term potential. RCOF has emerged as one of the top picks for high-growth opportunities, offering a scalable, AI-powered ecosystem with real-world financial integrations. RCO Finance’s core offering is its groundbreaking robo-advisor , an AI-powered trading assistant that is transforming how we interact with the crypto world. Think of it as your personal financial advisor, available 24/7. This tool offers real-time market insights, portfolio management, automated trade execution and tailored investment guidance. The robo-advisor uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical and real-time market data to create personalized investment and trading plans based on a user’s references. This can include your financial goals, risk tolerance, how long you want to invest, and other market preferences. This customization enables you to easily create a profitable portfolio without prior experience. What’s better, the robo-advisor can adjust things should market conditions or your preferences change. Let’s say you initially adopt a conservative investment strategy, focusing on low-risk assets like government bonds, but as you gain confidence and explore opportunities for higher returns, your risk appetite might increase. The robo-advisor can easily adjust your strategy, diversifying your portfolio to include high-performing altcoins like FUNToken (FUN), which has grown by over 185% in the last week. This adaptive framework ensures your investments remain aligned with your evolving goals, offering you the flexibility to capitalize on lucrative opportunities without compromising your financial stability. This crypto is breaking new ground with its real-world asset (RWA) integration. This feature allows investors to access diverse investment options that include digital assets and RWAs like ETFs, commodities, real estate, bonds and more. This ingenious initiative democratizes access to these high-value assets once reserved for a select few. It also bridges the gap between crypto and traditional finance, providing stability to counter the volatility of crypto investments. Many platforms require users to fulfil Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements before they can participate. This approach often forces users to submit sensitive personal documents, undergo identity checks, and navigate tedious approval processes. This can be off-putting for those who value their anonymity and lock out users in restricted regions. RCOF’s KYC-free ecosystem eliminates this burden, allowing users from anywhere worldwide to participate without compromising their personal data. Given the market’s vulnerability to scams and rug pulls, RCOF has taken a proactive approach to ensuring the security and reliability of its platform by undergoing a rigorous SolidProof audit . This meticulous audit shows its smart contracts and codebase are free of vulnerabilities, reassuring users of its trustworthiness and security. Unlike many DeFi projects that hold back their features until after launch, RCOF has boldly unveiled its beta platform during the presale stage, a rarity in the crypto world. This move showcases the platform’s confidence in its technology and allows you to test its cutting-edge features first-hand. This fully functional version has already attracted over 10,000 active users exploring the platform and providing valuable feedback to refine and enhance its features. Want to see the robo-advisor in action? Access the beta platform here . Capitalize on This Opportunity: Invest in RCOF While Ethereum remains a powerful crypto, multiple challenges have caused investor confidence to wane, pushing them to RCO Finance. The combination of AI-driven tools, real-world asset integration, and early-stage growth potential makes it a prime target for those looking for exponential gains. Priced at $0.100 in the 5th stage of the presale , this is your chance to get in on the action while the price is still low. With an estimated launch price between $0.40 and $0.60, your investment could grow by between 300% and 500%. Smart investors are already jumping on this opportunity, with over half of the tokens allocated for this stage already gone. Your window of opportunity is closing fast. Act now, make smart money moves by joining RCOF and position yourself for massive returns.

42779954,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=722182,1743559259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42779954.jpeg,Shifting Sentiment? Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Stay Put Despite Losses,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/shifting-sentiment-short-term-bitcoin-holders-stay-put-despite-losses/,"According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, short-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders are choosing to retain their digital assets despite incurring unrealized losses. CryptoQuant contributor Onchained explained that short-term BTC holders have recorded significantly lower realized losses compared to their unrealized losses. Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Expecting A Price Rally? The first quarter of 2025 has been marked by high price volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin. BTC has dropped from approximately $97,000 on January 1 to around $83,000 at the time of writing, reflecting a decline of more than 15%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Make Big Moves As Bullish Momentum Resurfaces Despite this price pullback, short-term BTC holders continue to hold onto their assets instead of selling at a loss. CryptoQuant contributor Onchained analyzed the Short-Term Holder Net Realized PNL to Exchanges, highlighting a shift in selling behavior. According to the analyst, BTC holders who have owned their coins for one to three months have been the most active sellers in recent days, even at the cost of realizing losses. This is unusual, as short-term investors holding BTC for less than a week are typically the most reactive sellers. However, recent data shows a significant decline in selling pressure to cryptocurrency exchanges. This suggests that BTC holders who purchased their coins in the last six months are opting to hold onto their assets rather than panic sell. This shift in selling behavior among short-term holders could have multiple implications. A decline in selling pressure may indicate a change in investor sentiment, with holders willing to endure short-term losses in anticipation of long-term gains. While the analyst cautioned that this data does not predict future price movements, it does provide valuable insights into market psychology. The analysis states: Are short-term holders finally holding the line? If so, this could reduce downside volatility and set the stage for stabilization, or even a reversal. Onchained concluded that short-term holders currently control 28% of BTC’s circulating supply. If a significant portion of these holdings transitions to long-term holders, it could pave the way for Bitcoin’s price to surge beyond $150,000. Is BTC About To Stage A Comeback? Alongside the decline in short-term BTC selling pressure, several other exchange-related metrics suggest the possibility of an upcoming price surge for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Daily RSI Downtrend, But Analyst Warns Of Strong Resistance Ahead Recently, crypto entrepreneur and market commentator Arthur Hayes claimed that BTC “probably” hit this market cycle’s bottom during its plunge to $77,000 on March 10. However, Hayes noted that the stock market could still experience further pullbacks. While Bitcoin has been in a downtrend for the past few months, gold has surged to multiple new all-time highs (ATHs) due to ongoing global macroeconomic uncertainty. BTC’s poor performance against the precious metal is likely to continue as the US trade tariff threat looms. At press time, BTC trades at $83,953, up 2.2% in the past 24 hours.

Gala Price Prediction and Algorand Rank Among Top Cryptos for Massive Growth,https://thecoinrise.com/qubetics-tics-to-hit-10-gala-price-prediction-and-algorand-rank-among-top-cryptos-for-massive-growth/,"Is crypto still the wild west of finance, or has it evolved into the future of investment? While traditional markets continue to move at a snail’s pace, the crypto world is buzzing with action, shaking up the financial industry with alternative investment opportunities. In this chaotic yet lucrative landscape, three names are turning heads— Qubetics ($TICS), Gala ($GALA), and Algorand ($ALGO). These cryptos have not only captured the attention of serious market players but have also solidified themselves as powerful instruments for wealth generation. Amid the crypto storm, Qubetics is carving its path as the next big thing, with mind-blowing adoption, a red-hot presale, and a utility-focused ecosystem that could redefine cross-border transactions. As Gala strengthens its dominance in blockchain gaming and Algorand continues its mission of high-performance finance, each of these cryptos presents a unique opportunity for top cryptos for massive growth. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics isn’t just a typical digital asset; it’s redefining cross-border transactions with seamless global payments. Imagine sending money to a friend overseas without outrageous fees, slow processing times, or annoying red tape. That’s the power Qubetics ($TICS) brings to the table. At its core, Qubetics is engineered to bridge the gap in international finance, eliminating inefficiencies that have plagued traditional banking systems for decades. Whether it’s businesses paying suppliers across borders, remote freelancers receiving their salaries, or families supporting loved ones in another country, Qubetics is revolutionizing cross-border transactions, making them faster, cheaper, and more accessible. Currently, Qubetics is in its 28th crypto presale stage, having already sold over 504 million $TICS tokens to more than 23,900 holders, raking in a jaw-dropping $15.5 million. Right now, the price of $TICS stands at $0.1430, but analysts are extremely bullish, projecting it to hit $1 (599% ROI), $5 (3,396% ROI), and even $10 (6,892% ROI). Some ultra-bullish estimates even push the price up to $15 post-mainnet launch, delivering an eye-watering 10,388% ROI. Taking it up a notch, a $2,500 investment could yield $17,482 at $1, $87,412 at $5, $174,825 at $10, and a life-changing $262,237 if $TICS reaches $15. These scenarios show why many are calling $TICS one of the most exciting crypto opportunities on the market today. With real-world usability, growing demand, and aggressive expansion, Qubetics positioning itself as the top cryptos for massive growth. Gala ($GALA): Leading the Blockchain Gaming Revolution Gala Games has been the undisputed champion in the blockchain gaming world, delivering a decentralized ecosystem where players own their in-game assets and shape the future of gaming. Unlike traditional gaming platforms where developers hold all the power, Gala flips the script—giving gamers the ability to earn, trade, and fully control their digital items. Since its inception, Gala ($GALA) has amassed a die-hard community and partnerships with major gaming studios, reinforcing its status as the go-to platform for Web3 gaming. Analysts remain bullish on Gala price prediction, expecting significant growth as blockchain gaming adoption accelerates in 2025. While $GALA saw explosive growth during the last bull run, it has proven its resilience, bouncing back stronger with new developments, partnerships, and an ever-expanding metaverse vision. Analysts predict that as more traditional gamers enter the blockchain space, demand for $GALA will surge, making it one of the top cryptos for massive growth in 2025 and beyond. Algorand ($ALGO): The Green Blockchain Powering High-Performance Finance When it comes to scalability, security, and sustainability, few blockchains hold a candle to Algorand ($ALGO). Designed by MIT professor Silvio Micali, Algorand is one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains in existence, making it a prime candidate for global finance applications. What sets Algorand apart is its Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, which eliminates the energy-intensive mining process found in traditional Proof-of-Work blockchains. This makes $ALGO one of the most eco-friendly cryptos, a huge selling point for institutions and businesses looking to adopt blockchain technology without the environmental backlash. With rising adoption, strategic partnerships, and institutional interest, Algorand remains one of the top cryptos for massive growth, ready to explode as global markets shift towards blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Conclusion: Which Crypto Holds the Key to the Future? Qubetics, Gala, and Algorand have all carved out unique niches in the crypto world, offering immense potential for those looking for the top cryptos for massive growth . Whether it’s Qubetics’ mission to revolutionize cross-border transactions, Gala’s dominance in blockchain gaming, or Algorand’s role in high-performance finance, these cryptos are reshaping digital investments. If you’re looking to get in early on a project with sky-high potential, Qubetics stands out as the ultimate frontrunner. With its presale numbers already turning heads and price predictions pointing to a jaw-dropping ROI, now is the time to make a move before $TICS becomes the next big name in crypto.

Kentucky’s Department of Financial Institutions filed the stipulation to dismiss jointly with Coinbase on April 1, ending the state’s legal action against the exchange first filed along with 10 other state regulators in June 2023. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal posted to X on April 1, calling for Congress “to end this litigation-driven, state-by-state approach with a federal market structure law.” Source: Paul Grewal Financial regulators from 10 states launched similar suits against Coinbase in June 2023, on the same day the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the exchange — a lawsuit the SEC dropped last month. Seven suits against Coinbase still active Alabama, California, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington and Wisconsin are the seven states that are still continuing with their lawsuits, which all allege Coinbase breached securities laws with its staking rewards program. Vermont was the first state to end its suit against Coinbase, with its Department of Financial Regulation filing an order to rescind the action on March 13, noting the SEC’s Feb. 27 decision to drop its action against the exchange and the likelihood of changes in the federal regulator’s guidance. The South Carolina Attorney General’s securities division followed Vermont days later, dismissing its lawsuit in a joint stipulation with Coinbase on March 27. Related: South Carolina dismisses its staking lawsuit against Coinbase, joining Vermont Kentucky’s decision to drop its case against Coinbase follows just days after the state’s governor, Andy Beshear, signed a “Bitcoin Rights” bill into law on March 24 that establishes protections for crypto self-custody and exempts crypto mining from money transmitting and securities laws. The axed state-level lawsuits come amid a stark policy change at the SEC, which has dropped or delayed multiple lawsuits against crypto companies that it filed under the Biden administration.

Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) adviser Jamie Collier said in an April 2 report that while the US is still a key target, increased awareness and right-to-work verification challenges have forced North Korean IT workers to find roles at non-US companies. “In response to heightened awareness of the threat within the United States, they’ve established a global ecosystem of fraudulent personas to enhance operational agility,” Collier said. “Coupled with the discovery of facilitators in the UK, this suggests the rapid formation of a global infrastructure and support network that empowers their continued operations,” he added. Google's Threat Intelligence Group says North Korea's tech workers expanded their reach amid a US crackdown. Source: Google The North Korea-linked workers are infiltrating projects spanning traditional web development and advanced blockchain applications, such as projects involving Solana and Anchor smart contract development , according to Collier. Another project building a blockchain job marketplace and an artificial intelligence web application leveraging blockchain technologies was also found to have North Korean workers. “These individuals pose as legitimate remote workers to infiltrate companies and generate revenue for the regime,” Collier said. “This places organizations that hire DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] IT workers at risk of espionage, data theft, and disruption.” North Korea looking to Europe for tech jobs Along with the UK, Collier says the GTIG identified a notable focus on Europe, with one worker using at least 12 personas across Europe and others using resumes listing degrees from Belgrade University in Serbia and residences in Slovakia. Separate GTIG investigations found personas seeking employment in Germany and Portugal, login credentials for user accounts of European job websites, instructions for navigating European job sites, and a broker specializing in false passports. At the same time, since late October, the North Korean workers have increased the volume of extortion attempts and gone after larger organizations, which the GTIG speculates is the workers feeling pressure to maintain revenue streams amid a crackdown in the US. “In these incidents, recently fired IT workers threatened to release their former employers’ sensitive data or to provide it to a competitor. This data included proprietary data and source code for internal projects,” Collier said. Related: North Korean crypto attacks rising in sophistication, actors — Paradigm In January, the US Justice Department indicted two North Korean nationals for their involvement in a fraudulent IT work scheme involving at least 64 US companies from April 2018 to August 2024. The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control also sanctioned companies it accused of being fronts for North Korea that generated revenue via remote IT work schemes.

The motion , which was submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 1, requests that the court postpone all deadlines while further discussions occur. In January 2023, the SEC filed its first lawsuit against Gemini Trust and Genesis Global Capital, claiming they had unlawfully raised billions of dollars through the Gemini Earn program without registering it as a securities offering. The lawsuit was part of the SEC’s broader crackdown on crypto firms under the Biden administration’s regulatory push. Gemini had previously agreed to return $2.18 billion to affected customers as part of a separate settlement with New York regulators. The motion did not specify whether discussions could lead to a settlement, dismissal, or another resolution, but both parties argue that pausing the case serves the public interest and conserves judicial resources. The SEC and Gemini will provide a joint status update within 60 days of the request being approved.

The change in approach has been welcomed by crypto industry players who previously faced strict enforcement under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The Winklevoss twins, founders of Gemini, have also been active supporters of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. They each donated the maximum allowed $844,600 to Trump’s 2024 campaign. Genesis, which managed $900 million from 340,000 Gemini Earn customers before halting withdrawals in November 2022, settled its part of the case in February 2024 by agreeing to a $21 million fine.

According to the April 1 filing , Circle ( USDC ) intends to list its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker “CRCL.” The company’s filing indicates that some current shareholders will also sell shares, even though the quantity and price range of shares have not yet been made public. While sales from current holders will not benefit the business, Circle will profit from shares it sells directly. Major banks like JPMorgan and Citigroup will underwrite the IPO, and there will be a 30-day window for additional share purchases. Information about Circle’s performance can be found in its financial disclosures. The company’s reserve income and total revenue climbed from $1.45 billion in 2023 to $1.68 billion in 2024. Interest on reserves backing USDC accounted for a sizable amount of its profits.

Additionally, the business reported $54.4 million in other income and $4.3 million in losses on digital assets. The money raised from the IPO will go toward possible acquisitions , operational growth, and product development. A three-tiered share structure will be introduced by Circle’s IPO. Each Class A share, which will be offered for sale, has one vote. Co-founders Jeremy Allaire and Patrick Sean Neville own Class B shares, which are limited to 30% of the total voting power but have five votes each. Class C shares are convertible under specific circumstances, but they do not have voting rights. Following the cancellation of a $9 billion SPAC merger in 2021, this IPO marks Circle’s first attempt at a traditional public listing. Circle’s public debut signals its plan to further integrate into the financial sector as stablecoin adoption continues to grow.

The firm has submitted its prospectus to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aiming to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” This move comes at a time when the U.S. government appears to be becoming more favorable toward cryptocurrency and blockchain-based technologies. USDC Issuer Circle Files for IPO Circle’s decision to go public follows years of anticipation. The company first attempted to enter the public markets via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2021. However, this effort was halted due to regulatory concerns and timing issues with the SEC. Since then, Circle has worked to position itself as a more integral player in global finance, including relocating its headquarters from Boston to New York’s One World Trade Center. In 2024, Circle submitted a draft registration statement for its IPO with the SEC, move that has been made in light of the growing influence of stablecoins in the crypto-market. In the case of IPO, it will give Circle access to public funds, and investors a chance to invest in a company that has been active in cryptocurrency for several years now. Financial Performance and IPO Valuation Circle reported a significant increase in its revenue for 2024, with its total revenue reaching $1.68 billion, up from $1.45 billion in 2023. A large portion of this income came from reserve income related to its stablecoin operations. The company’s net income for the year stood at approximately $156 million, though this was a decrease from $268 million in 2023. The IPO is expected to value Circle at between $4 billion and $5 billion, with JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup acting as the lead underwriters. The company’s created stablecoin USDC is now among the biggest and most popular stablecoins available in the cryptocurrency market having a market capitalization of around $60 billion. Regulatory Climate and Crypto-Friendly Shift Circle’s decision to go for the IPO can also be seen as a signal of a change in the regulatory outlook of cryptocurrencies in the US. The current government under the presidency of Donald Trump is more receptive and inclined towards formulating favorable crypto laws. This is a change that has given more assurance to firms in the crypto space such as Circle, which now has a chance to conduct its operations under a friendly regulatory environment. Analysts have noted that the US authorities may introduce legislation regulating stablecoins this year, which will allow Circle to strengthen its position in the market. Such moves also show the increasing role of stablecoins in the context of the company’s cooperation with exchanges like Coinbase that have committed to sharing revenues generated by USDC. But, Circle is not alone in the crypto-related firm trying to list it on the stock exchange. Another big player in the sphere of blockchain, Ripple, is also believed to be considering going public . Although facing continued regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, Ripple has obtained a strong standing in the cryptocurrency market, especially in cross-border payments, which puts the company in the position to possibly mimic Circle.

However, due to market uncertainty, the asset is facing difficulties and struggling to gain momentum. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.67 and has experienced a modest price surge of over 0.50%, which was previously 4.5%. However, due to uncertainty, the token lost its gains. Meanwhile, during the same period, the asset’s trading volume dropped by 20%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Price Prediction According to expert technical analysis, ADA recently visited a key support level of $0.63, which has a history of strong price reversals or rebounds. ADA has always seen strong buying pressure at this level, leading to an upside rally. This time, the asset has formed a Doji candle at the support level on the daily timeframe, hinting at potential upside momentum. Based on recent price action, if ADA remains above the $0.63 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 25% to reach $0.85. However, since the current market isn’t bullish, it would be difficult to see such an upward move. Instead, we may see price consolidation between the $0.63 and $0.70 levels over the next few days. Source: Trading View In addition to this, ADA’s 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is above its current price, indicating that the asset is in a bearish trend and has weak price action. Key Liquidation Levels This bearish trend explains why traders are strongly betting on short positions, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass Data revealed that $0.662 and $0.70 are the levels where intraday traders are highly over-leveraged, having built $5.50 million and $13.60 million worth of long and short positions, respectively, in the past 24 hours.

ETH is now consolidating and facing key hurdles near the $1,920 level. Ethereum started a recovery wave above $1,820 and $1,850 levels. The price is trading above $1,860 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $1,860 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $1,900 and $1,920 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Starts Recovery Ethereum price managed to stay above the $1,750 support zone and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH was able to climb above the $1,820 and $1,850 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $1,880 resistance zone. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,032 swing high to the $1,767 low. However, the bears are active near the $1,920 zone. Ethereum price is now trading above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $1,860 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

The next key resistance is near the $1,920 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,032 swing high to the $1,767 low. The first major resistance is near the $1,970 level. A clear move above the $1,970 resistance might send the price toward the $2,020 resistance. An upside break above the $2,020 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,050 resistance zone or even $2,120 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,920 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,860 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $1,845 zone. A clear move below the $1,845 support might push the price toward the $1,800 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,765 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,710.

Here’s What Experts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-the-xrp-bottom-finally-in/,"The XRP price fell as low as $2.0238 on Monday, potentially forming a local bottom. Since then, the XRP price is up almost 6%, however, the possibility of a deeper retracement remains. Two prominent chartists—CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) and Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy)—have shared their perspectives on whether the token has found its local bottom or if further downside might still be on the table. Is The XRP Price Bottom In? According to CasiTrades’ newly published chart, XRP appears to have tested the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement at $2.05 and is now showing bullish divergences across multiple timeframes—from the 15-minute all the way to the 4-hour chart. CasiTrades notes that these signals are a positive indicator both for short-term bounces and a potential macro recovery. “Was that the bottom for XRP? After reaching the .786 retrace at $2.05, #XRP is printing bullish divergences from the 15min all the way up to the 4hr chart. That’s the kind of signal we want to see for both short-term bottom and macro! The bounce is holding so far! CasiTrades notes. Related Reading: XRP Bull Cycle Could End If This Happens: Analyst The analyst also points to key resistance at $2.25, suggesting that a convincing break above this level with strong momentum would likely negate the need for another retest of support. “If we break above $2.25 with strong momentum, that would invalidate the need for another support retest—a very bullish sign, CasiTrades writes, adding “$2.00–2.01 remains a support if the $2.05 doesn’t hold.” Moreover, she highlights a Fib Time Zone 3 that could span the entire month of April, forecasting a “bullish window” for XRP. According to the chart, once price meets its target, a larger impulse to the upside may follow, with potential resistance lining up at $2.70 and $3.80+. Related Reading: XRP MVRV Ratio Dips Below The 200-Day MA – Trend Shift Underway? Meanwhile, Charting Guy addressed that market chatter has surfaced about a possible head and shoulders pattern on the XRP chart, with a projected breakdown target near $1.15. While acknowledging this bearish formation as a possibility, Charting Guy believes it is unlikely to play out, describing the pattern as “irregular and ugly.” He maintains that XRP’s overall trend is still biased to the upside, characterized by higher highs and higher lows.“ A lot of people are posting this possible head and shoulders that targets $1.15. I personally don’t think it plays out, but it’s a possibility. If it does happen, it’s just a golden pocket backtest and the chart remains bullish overall,” he says. Charting Guy draws attention to the $1.70–$1.90 zone that has repeatedly caught wicks in previous pullbacks, with daily closes managing to reclaim $2 or above. He believes that a final corrective dip to fill the March 11 wick lows—potentially down to around $1.90—could mark the end of the current retracement. Additional support levels are located at the weekly Ichimoku base line at $1.94, the Weekly Supertrend at $1.73 and at the Weekly EMA Ribbon between $1.46 – $1.93. At press time, XRP traded at $2.14.

In a March 31 letter , the coalition of six UK digital economy trade bodies urged Starmer’s special adviser on business and investment, Varun Chandra, for a “greater strategic focus and alignment to deliver investment, growth and jobs” for the crypto industry. The group, which consisted of the UK Cryptoasset Business Council, Global Digital Finance, The Payments Association, Digital Currencies Governance Group, the Crypto Council for Innovation and techUK, noted the US policy shift on crypto under President Donald Trump and his appointment of a crypto czar . Britain’s commitment to an economic trade deal focused on technological cooperation with the US “presents a significant opportunity to mirror the United States’ ambition in fostering leadership in blockchain, digital assets, and other emerging financial technologies,” the letter stated. The group recommended that the UK appoint a blockchain special envoy, similar to the US, to coordinate policy, foster innovation, and position the country competitively in global markets. The trade bodies also called for the development of a dedicated government action plan for crypto and blockchain technology, including a concierge service to attract high-potential firms. They added that the government should acknowledge and leverage the commonalities between blockchain, quantum computing and artificial intelligence technologies , including potential applications for government services. Another recommendation was to create a high-level industry-government-regulator engagement forum to ensure informed decision-making and cross-sector collaboration.

Tom Griffiths, the co-founder and managing partner of crypto compliance advisory firm BitCompli, said in response to the letter on LinkedIn that the Financial Conduct Authority “has a lot of talent and a good sight of future plans, but the UK is definitely losing pace with Dubai, Singapore, and other EU jurisdictions.” “Now is the time for the FCA to act, or the UK will lose out on this huge opportunity, which is digital assets and all the benefits this sector can bring, not only now but over the next 20 years,” he added.

42784165,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=390226,1743566136,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/42784165.jpeg,zkLend Hacker Loses $5.4M to Tornado Cash Scam,https://cryptopotato.com/zklend-hacker-loses-5-4m-to-tornado-cash-scam/,"In an ironic twist of fate, the hacker behind February’s $9.57 million exploit on zkLend has allegedly fallen victim to another scam. The suspected criminal claimed in an on-chain message that they lost 2,930 ETH, worth about $5.4 million, while trying to launder the stolen funds through Tornado Cash. The zkLend Hack zkLend also confirmed the bizarre turn of events in a post on X, stating that the attacker had interacted with a known phishing website, tornadoeth[.]cash, as they attempted to cover their tracks from pursuers. The scam site is said to have been in operation for the last five years, and it immediately drained the thief’s entire balance of 2,930 ETH. In an on-chain message to zkLend, the attacker appeared crestfallen, saying: “Hello, I tried to move funds to Tornado but I used a phishing website and all the funds have been lost. I am devastated. I am terribly sorry for all the havoc and losses caused. All the 2,930 ETH have been taken by that site’s owners… Please redirect your efforts towards those site owners to see if you can recover some of the money.” The saga began in February, a couple of days before Valentine’s, when the Starknet-based lending protocol was hacked for more than $9.5 million. The exploiter, only identified by the address 0x64…9109, reportedly took advantage of a decimal precision vulnerability on zkLend to manipulate rounding errors in its lending accumulator and artificially inflate its balance. As a result, they made off with about 3,700 ETH, forcing the platform to pause withdrawals temporarily. Following the theft, zkLend attempted to negotiate with the perpetrator, offering them a white hat bounty of 10% of the stolen funds in exchange for the return of the remaining 3,300 ETH. However, the hacker stayed silent, moving the crypto assets through various channels, including 706 ETH valued at $1.8 million sent through Railgun. Legitimacy Concerns: A Staged Disappearance? Not everyone has bought the phishing story, though. Many within the crypto community have questioned the hacker’s claim, with the most prevalent theory being that they made up the tale to fake a loss and avoid further scrutiny from blockchain investigators and law enforcement. Given that zkLend has been actively tracking the stolen funds and working with on-chain security firms and the police, some have argued that this could be a ploy to make the funds disappear without a trace. Reactions on X quickly flooded in, with some people pointing out the suspicious timing of the announcement. One user, @pvt.eth, sarcastically noted , “Right about time for April Fool.” Others speculated that the phisher and the hacker could be the same person. Another theory is that the attacker might have transferred the stolen ETH to an alternate address, using the phishing story as a cover-up. @0xGekko was among those unconvinced, stating: “Meh, screams more like the hacker is trying to avoid any heat from a possible investigation.” Nonetheless, zkLend is treating the phishing loss as a legitimate event, noting that there isn’t conclusive evidence yet that the phishing website and the exploiter are connected.

Within just two days of its third keynote going live, the project brought in another $5 million, pushing its presale total beyond $210 million. This sudden rise wasn’t fueled by noise but by solid results that speak for themselves. With its Beta Testnet already running, over 1.2 million transactions completed, and more than 100 active community nodes worldwide, BlockDAG is already delivering value before its mainnet even launches. Now in Batch 27, BDAG coins are available at $0.0248, with over 19 billion already sold. This has created a rush from both large-scale and everyday buyers, as chances to enter at such prices may soon disappear once exchange listings go live. Keynote 3 Rolled Out Real Progress, Not Just Talks Rather than being a marketing push, the third keynote laid out strong technical milestones and strategic moves. It included several vital updates that show why BlockDAG is gaining traction among top Layer 1 projects: Beta Testnet officially launched and is actively handling millions of actions. Tools like a user-friendly block explorer, a Token/NFT creation wizard, and early access dApps are now functional. Full DeFi functionality confirmed—staking, swaps, lending, and bridges—all part of the release plan. Vision to onboard 1,000+ dApps by 2026. Exchange listings set for over 10 major platforms once the mainnet is live. The presentation’s clarity and confidence stood out. As CEO Antony Turner stated, “We’re not cutting corners. Our goal is to raise the bar for blockchain technology.” That message hit home across crypto circles—and the fast influx of capital shows many agree. Partnerships Add Strength to BlockDAG’s Ecosystem Alongside its tech advances, BlockDAG is making waves through meaningful global collaborations. With high-visibility partnerships such as Inter Milan and UFC, BDAG is gaining exposure to millions of people in sports and entertainment. Instead of relying on short-term influencers, the project is becoming part of key cultural spaces, building trust with a visible presence. Tools like the X1 Miner App , now with over 800,000 downloads, and the TG Tap Miner game, with more than 400,000 users, are drawing in new users before the mainnet is even live. BlockDAG is already being used and experienced, something rare at this stage. BDAG’s Route to $1 Is Backed by Real Data What sets BlockDAG’s current growth apart is how it steadily builds a case for BDAG reaching $1. With the current presale rate at $0.0248, there’s a potential 40x return if it hits the $1 mark after listing. And that possibility isn’t built on hope. BlockDAG now features: A working, active testnet Confirmed DeFi features Major exchange listings locked in Global hardware miner rollout 16,600+ ASIC miners sold A growing base of 170,000+ holders These indicators point to a network built with readiness from the start, not one trying to figure things out later. As Turner wrapped up the keynote confidently: “This is about more than our progress—it’s about where we’re going next.” Its massive crypto presale performance supports that vision. After pulling in $5 million in just two days, BlockDAG is rapidly moving toward its $600 million goal—a figure that looks achievable, not imaginary. BlockDAG isn’t another tech idea waiting to be noticed. It’s a complete working system gaining traction—backed by people, tools, and funding. For those delaying, the message is clear: later batches will arrive, but likely at a much higher price.

BlockDAG’s Potential Growth Sets the Stage for a Huge 2030 Target,https://thecoinrise.com/from-just-0-001-to-30-blockdags-potential-growth-sets-the-stage-for-a-huge-2030-target/,"BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining traction like few other cryptos in recent years. Since launching its presale under a year ago, it has already delivered a stunning 2,380% return for its earliest backers. Starting at just $0.001 in Batch 1, BDAG now trades at $0.0248 in Batch 27, and interest continues to snowball. Analysts are buzzing with projections: $1 by 2025, $20 in 2027, and a jaw-dropping $30 by the end of 2030. With 10 exchange listings lined up, a mainnet ready to go live, and an expanding use case network, BDAG is creating serious momentum. So far, BlockDAG has attracted over $210 million in presale investments and pulled in a crowd of more than 170,000 individual buyers. Its mix of rising adoption, strong liquidity, and growing whale attention is positioning it as one of the most talked-about altcoins of the year—and possibly the top-performing crypto for long-term gains. How BlockDAG Pulled in $210M and Handed Out 2,380% Returns It started small—just $0.001 in Batch 1. Now at $0.0248 in Batch 27, BlockDAG has moved fast, and the gains are hard to ignore. Early participants have already seen their investments multiply by over 23 times, and it’s not slowing down. So far, BlockDAG has sold over 19 billion BDAG coins and raised $210 million. That kind of number gets attention, and with more price jumps on the way, buyers aren’t hesitating to lock in before the next batch goes live. The current holder base has already passed 170,000, showing not only excitement but growing long-term support. That kind of user growth helps build staying power—and keeps the conversation going. There’s also been major whale activity. A recent $3.6 million buy-in suggests large players are eyeing the next breakout. Combined with strong community demand, this mix of small and big buyers is fueling speculation that BDAG could become one of the most profitable altcoins by 2030. BlockDAG Price Outlook: $30 Target by 2030? It’s not just hype—BlockDAG’s growth is supported by several clear factors. Analysts expect BDAG to hit $1 next year, fueled by three major drivers. First, the 10 centralized exchanges preparing to list the coin will introduce massive liquidity. Second, the launch of the mainnet will expand access and real usage. And third, ongoing adoption from both users and developers keeps adding fuel to the fire. By 2027, the platform is projected to be more mature, with deeper liquidity and a solid base of users. That’s why the $20 price forecast is gaining support. As more tools and partnerships come online, BDAG could become one of the most widely used altcoins. Looking ahead to 2030, many see $30 as more than just possible—it’s within reach. As real-world adoption of blockchain tech grows, BlockDAG could ride that wave across industries, helping its coin value rise in step. With continued updates and use cases, BDAG has the tools to hit its long-term price targets. Missed Early Entry? There’s Still Time to Get In Before the Next Jump Yes, the earliest buyers are already sitting on 2,380% returns. But even now, BDAG offers plenty of room for upside. At just $0.0248, it’s still early compared to where analysts expect it to head next. Each new batch brings a higher price, so the window to enter before bigger jumps is closing fast. Between the upcoming exchange launches, the mainnet release, and a wave of features being added, BlockDAG has the roadmap in place to push forward. If the coin hits $1 by 2025, anyone getting in now could be looking at a 40x return. And if it does reach the long-term goal of $30, the gains would be massive. That’s why more people are rushing in now—because the next price move could come sooner than expected. Final Word: Why BlockDAG Is the Top Crypto to Watch Right Now BlockDAG’s numbers speak for themselves—$210 million raised, 19 billion coins sold, and more than 170,000 holders already in. With a 2,380% gain already delivered and a path laid out to reach $30 by 2030, it’s no surprise this project is getting so much attention. The mix of strong growth, real milestones, and wide interest from both new buyers and seasoned whales is driving momentum at every step. For those still on the sidelines, the current price could be the lowest they’ll ever see again. Whether for short-term returns or long-haul potential, BlockDAG is now being viewed by many as the top crypto to buy right now —and the clock is ticking on how long that window will stay open.

The price is now consolidating and might face hurdles near the $2.120 level. XRP price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $2.20 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.120 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might extend losses if it fails to clear the $2.20 resistance zone. XRP Price Faces Rejection XRP price failed to continue higher above the $2.20 resistance zone and reacted to the downside, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below the $2.150 and $2.120 levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $2.023 swing low to the $2.199 high. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.120 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. However, the bulls are now active near the $2.10 support level. They are protecting the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $2.023 swing low to the $2.199 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.120 level and the trend line zone. The first major resistance is near the $2.150 level. The next resistance is $2.20. A clear move above the $2.20 resistance might send the price toward the $2.240 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.2650 resistance or even $2.2880 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.320. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.150 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.10 level. The next major support is near the $2.0650 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.0650 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.020 support. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone.

According to an Apr. 1 report from DL News, the global investment giant managing around $12 trillion in assets will now be able offer its new European Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded product in the UK. With this approval, BlackRock joins companies like Coinbase, PayPal, and Revolut as the 51st company to be registered with the FCA. Only 14% of applications have been approved by the FCA, demonstrating its selectiveness. According to the agency, a large number of applications were turned down because of missing or poor-quality information. The iShares Bitcoin ETP, marketed under the ticker IB1T, started trading last week on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam. It launched with a temporary fee waiver, lowering its expense ratio to 0.15% until the end of 2024. After that, the fee will rise to 0.25%, aligning with CoinShares ’ $1.3 billion physical Bitcoin ETP, the largest in Europe. You might also like: BlackRock expands money market fund BUIDL to Solana With each share backed by real Bitcoin that Coinbase holds in custody, the product gives investors direct exposure to Bitcoin. BlackRock’s action follows the success of its iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, which is listed in the United States. IBIT has amassed more than $48 billion in assets since its inception, as per data from VettaFi. IB1T uses a similar structure to give European investors a regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually holding the currency. The ETP is issued through a Swiss-based special-purpose vehicle to ensure compliance with European financial regulations. The entry of BlackRock into Europe indicates that demand for Bitcoin investment products is rising outside of North America. CEO Larry Fink recently warned that rising U.S. debt could weaken the dollar’s dominance and possibly strengthen Bitcoin’s case as a store of value. As reported by Crypto.news on Mar 31, Fink pointed out in his annual letter that investors may turn to Bitcoin as a safer option as a result of excessive government expenditure.

Bitcoin Flows Reveal Key Market Shifts,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-binance-losing-its-grip-bitcoin-flows-reveal-key-market-shifts/,"After experiencing a bearish trend earlier in the week, Bitcoin (BTC) seems to have regained upward momentum. The asset started the day with a 2.1% rise. It is currently trading above the $84,000 mark, signaling a potential return to its previous price levels. Despite this positive movement, Bitcoin remains subject to fluctuating market conditions, influenced by external factors and internal metrics impacting its performance across different exchanges. Related Reading: Arthur Hayes Predicts $250,000 Bitcoin As Fed Caves To QE Pressure Shifting Trends in Bitcoin’s Exchange Flows As BTC continues to make strides above $84,000, an interesting trend has emerged in exchange flows signaling investor behavior. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant’s Joao Wedson provides a fascinating perspective on the current state of the Bitcoin market. According to Wedson, Bitcoin’s price action has been significantly impacted by lower selling pressure on certain exchanges, particularly Binance. In his report titled “Lower Selling Pressure: Binance and the BTC Flow Across Different Exchanges”, Wedson highlights that Short-Term Holders (STHs) are sending significantly fewer Bitcoin to Binance compared to other exchanges. The current amount of BTC being sent to Binance stands at 6,300 BTC, much lower than the average of 24,700 BTC transferred to other platforms. This suggests that many traders on Binance may be adopting a more neutral stance, potentially waiting for clearer signals before making further moves. On the other hand, Bitcoin inflows to other exchanges are increasing, indicating that investor behavior may vary based on the platform they use. Binance, despite having the highest trading volume, seems to be seeing less activity from short-term holders, whereas other exchanges are experiencing higher inflows. This shift could suggest that while Binance remains a trusted exchange, other platforms are beginning to see more action from BTC traders. Binance Dominates Spot Trading Volume In another analysis by CryptoQuant’s Maartunn, the focus shifted to spot trading volumes across various exchanges, with Binance taking the lead. In the year-to-date data for 2025, Binance has been the dominant player in spot trading volume, handling a cumulative total of $1.9 trillion. This is more than three times the volume of its closest competitor, Crypto.com, which stands at 12.12%. The dominance of Binance is significant, as higher trading volumes typically result in greater liquidity and tighter spreads, benefiting traders with better pricing and smoother entry and exit opportunities.

As a result, the trading volume for BNB Coin has shot up by 42% to more than $2.12 billion, as analysts are now closely watching for a BNB price rally to all-time highs. In BNB Price Ready for A Mega Rally? BNB Coin has performed relatively well over the past month compared to Bitcoin and other altcoins. While BTC and top altcoins like ETH, SOL, XRP saw double-digit losses in March, BNB Coin is down just 1% on the monthly chart. After a strong consolidation of around $610 levels, the BNB price could be eyeing a strong breakout to new all-time highs. BNB Burn and Pascal Hardfork Offer Support BNB Coin features a real-time burn mechanism that permanently removes a portion of gas fees from circulation. Over the past seven days, 951.85 BNB worth $571,747.74 was burned, contributing to a total burn value of nearly $160 million, as per data from BNBBurn . BNB’s price recently gained momentum following the implementation of the Pascal hard fork, which enhanced its compatibility with Ethereum. The network is preparing for additional hard forks this month and in June, aimed at further improving transaction speeds. Additionally, BNB Chain is gaining a lot of popularity among meme coins, adding support for Mubarak meme coin , CZ’s Dog BROCOLLI meme coin, and others. Looking at the technical setup, the BNB price chart shows that the altcoin is forming a cup-and-handle pattern, along with an ascending channel pattern formation, as shown in the image below. Source: TradingView On the other hand, BNB price is trading above the 50-day moving average, which is a positive indicator. But for the altcoin to kickstart a rally to its all-time high of $790, it must first complete the handle formation at $662, and give a breakout above that level. As of press time, BNB Coin is trading at $603 levels with its daily trading volume up by 42%, surging past $2.12 billion. Furthermore, the Coinglass data shows that the BNB options trading volume is also up by 46%. VanEck Files for Spot BNB ETF $115 billion asset manager VanEck filed for the spot BNB ETF in Delaware on Tuesday, April 1, which could serve as a major catalyst for the BNB Coin rally ahead. The proposed BNB ETF would follow the price of BNB, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Apart from BNB, VanEck has already submitted crypto ETF applications for Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and Avalanche. VanEck filed for SEC approval last month to launch the first AVAX ETF, building on its success with spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

Last week, the SEC officially dropped its appeal, and Ripple has agreed to pay a $50 million fine while also dropping its own cross-appeal. On top of that, the court’s injunction against Ripple has been lifted, which should’ve been great news. But here’s the twist—despite this huge win, XRP’s price didn’t skyrocket like many expected. In fact, it barely budged. That’s got XRP holders talking, and not in a good way. They’re heading to social media, demanding one thing: an official statement from the SEC confirming the case is really, truly over. “We want an announcement from the SEC just like they’ve done with other cases! ” has become the rallying cry of frustrated XRP fans. The SEC hasn’t said a word publicly since dropping the case, and that silence is driving people crazy. Some even wonder if the SEC is waiting for Paul Atkins to be confirmed as the new SEC Chair before making anything official. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse tried to calm things down during the Digital Assets Summit on March 19, 2025, saying the case’s dismissal is valid without an official SEC statement. But let’s be honest—when it comes to crypto, people love clear, official news. And right now, that’s missing. After the news broke, XRP’s price briefly jumped to $2.60, but it quickly settled back down. It’s like the market’s waiting for the SEC to give the green light before making any big moves. Until then, XRP holders will keep asking: “ Where’s the official statement?”",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 05:02:07

The price is now correcting gains and might struggle to stay above the $600 support. BNB price is attempting to recover above the $600 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $610 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $610 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $600 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Faces Resistance After forming a base above the $588 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $600 and $610 resistance levels. It even recovered above the $615 level before the bears appeared, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . A high was formed at $618 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $615 level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $587 swing low to the $618 high. There is also a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $610 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $610 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $610 level. The next resistance sits near the $612 level. A clear move above the $612 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $618. A close above the $620 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $626 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $635 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $610 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $600 level. The next major support is near the $598 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $587 swing low to the $618 high. The main support sits at $594. If there is a downside break below the $594 support, the price could drop toward the $585 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $565 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $600 and $598.

Republican Jimmy Patronis won the vacant seat in Florida’s 1st Congressional District to replace Matt Gaetz, taking 57% of the vote to defeat Democrat Gay Valimont, according to AP News data. Randy Fine also took Florida’s 6th Congressional District with 56.7% of the vote to beat his Democratic rival, public school teacher Josh Weil, and fill a seat left vacant by Mike Waltz, who took a job as White House national security adviser. Florida’s 1st and 6th Congressional Districts — located in Florida’s western panhandle and along the state’s northeast coast — have been controlled by Republicans for roughly 30 years, but their lead has narrowed in recent years. Fairshake, a PAC backed by crypto industry giants including Coinbase, Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz, gave Fine around $1.16 million in advertising spending and funneled $347,000 to Patronis to support his campaign. Both Republicans have expressed support for the crypto industry, with Fine stating in a Jan. 14 X post that “Floridians want crypto innovation!” Source: Randy Fine Fairshake and its affiliates poured around $170 million into the 2024 US presidential and congressional elections to back candidates who committed to supporting the crypto industry. The wins by Patronis and Fine increased Republican representation in the House to 220 seats, with the Democrats holding 213 seats. There are two vacant seats to be filled after Texas and Arizona Democrats Sylvester Turner and Raúl Grijalva died on March 5 and March 13, respectively. Florida can expect to see a crypto-friendly regulatory environment The victories for Patronis and Fine likely mean that crypto legislation will continue to see support in the US capital. The Republican Party would have maintained its House majority even if it lost both seats in Florida, but it would have made it more difficult for some of the recently introduced Republican-backed crypto bills to pass through the House and Senate.

It appears set to resume positive action as the bulls show signs of interest. Last week saw BNB through another downturn after rejecting the $640 level during March’s recovery. This caused a small panic as it shed loss, and the price slipped to a low of $587 yesterday. Reacting well to the drops, the price was sharply rejected as a result of bullish interception, and the price increased above the key $600 level. Currently, the price is slightly up as it shows signs of strength while taking a breath. A push back above the mentioned key level could trigger a new leg up to $700 and even above. Although, the buying volume is not enough at the time of writing. Looking at the daily chart, BNB is still trading far well above the $500 level that stood as support during last month’s crash. If, by any chance, the bears resume pressure, we can expect more bleeding in the next few days. Right now, trading looks calm with a lot of conflicting signals. Should the buying volume increase, we can anticipate another major buy until the price recovers fully to the top. But for now, BNB’s demand is low as it trades flat on the daily chart. BNB Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The $587.3 level is currently providing support. If it fails to hold, the next support to consider for drops would be $566 and the $544 level. For bullish, BNB must reclaim the recently marked $640 resistance. A push above $648.5 should facilitate more recovery to $686, $700 and $732 in the next few weeks.

A breakdown from this support could fuel a major price crash. Following past months of reductions, XRP recorded substantial losses but has managed to stay well above $2 – a holding crucial support level. After bouncing off the support level last month, XRP recovered but later failed to push above the $2.6 level due to a rejection. This led to a drop and the price rolled back to the mentioned crucial support yesterday. Looking at the setup, the bears are technically back in action. Though it is uncertain if they will overcome the support level this time as several attempts to scale through it have proven abortive over the past months. However, if they successfully scale through the support, we can expect a major crash to a new multi-month low. Such a crash will validate the new bearish pattern forming on the daily chart. Failure to overcome this crucial support might result in another bounce, which could bring small gains before resuming bearish at full speed. But if XRP sustains such a bounce, it must reclaim $3.4 before considering a trend shift. XRP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Crossing down $2, the potential support levels for drops would be $1.77 and $1.53. Apart from $1.28, the $1 level is considered the next key support to watch for a dip. If the price bounces back above the immediate support level, it must retake the recently rejected $2.64 resistance level before we can consider a bullish move to the $2.99 and $3.4 resistance levels in the future.

Speaking in an interview with the Wolf of All Streets channel on YouTube, he stated that 99% of memecoins cannot be sustainable for the long term and are created solely for a select group to make money from. He clarified that memecoins experience phenomenal growth and then experience a decline in demand if not supported by a solid ecosystem. If change is not made, the user moves on, and value is known to vanish. “It’s why 99% of memecoins will fail,” he said. “They have to build community and real engagement. Otherwise, people move on.” Hoskinson also lambasted the token distribution of memecoins, asserting that self-serving insiders inflate the value of tokens, promoting the project only to sell them at a hefty profit later. This insider-focused model does not provide much incentive to build and sustain the project after its implementation. Capital drain poses risk to broader crypto adoption Hoskinson stated that memecoins have a negative impact on the rest of the cryptocurrency market since they consume liquidity without adding value through actual application use cases. He compared it to “moving water from one side of the bathtub to the other,” stating that much of the capital goes directly into the pockets of the founders and does not aid in expanding networks. “There’s a drain at the bottom of the tub. You’re not adding liquidity—you’re losing it over time,” he said, calling the phenomenon a net negative for the space. While he did not write off memecoins, he noted that sustainable value creation would come from Bitcoin DeFi, real-world asset digitalization, and algorithmic stablecoins, not just from viral tokens without a clear roadmap. Cathie Wood adds institutional perspective to memecoin risks Cathie Wood, the head of ARK Invest, also recently stated similar things in an interview with Bloomberg , stating most memecoins will be “worthless.” She attributed the phenomenon of meme-based cryptocurrencies to blockchain integration with AI, which makes it possible for almost everyone to launch thousands of tokens without any actual value. “Our funds are staying out of memecoins,” Wood confirmed, adding millions of these assets appear with no sight of utility. She urged investors to be careful, especially given global regulators’ refusal to categorize memecoins as securities. “If I have one message for those buying memecoins: buyer beware,” she said. Source: Dune Analytics According to Dune Analytics, memecoin use rose to a daily average of over 71,000 on January 23 and fluctuated before declining to reach roughly 9,000 as of April 1. Solana’s top memecoins’ market capitalization has declined to more than 85% from its yearly high of more than $81.83 billion. Tokens such as Official Trump (TRUMP), Bonk (BONK), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Pengu (PENGU) have been dropped significantly due to low investor confidence.

In an April 1 letter to New York federal court judge Edgardo Ramos, lawyers representing the SEC and Genesis requested a 60-day hold on the case and that all deadlines be pulled “to allow the parties to explore a potential resolution.” “In this case, the parties submit that it is in each of their interests to stay this matter while they consider a potential resolution and agree that no party or non-party would be prejudiced by a stay,” the letter states. The lawyers added that a stay was in the court’s interest as “a resolution would conserve judicial resources” and proposed that a joint status report be submitted within 60 days after the entry of the stay. The SEC sued Gemini and crypto lending firm Genesis Global Capital in January 2023, alleging they offered unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program. In March 2024, Genesis agreed to pay $21 million to settle charges related to the lending program, but the enforcement case against Gemini remains outstanding.

In February, Gemini said the SEC closed a separate investigation into the firm as the regulator winds back its crypto enforcement under President Donald Trump. “The SEC cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal bills alone and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation. Of course, Gemini is not alone,” Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss said at the time.

Circle, the issuer of stablecoin USDC, filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, while American Bitcoin Corp.—a mining venture backed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump—is exploring an IPO following a strategic merger with Hut 8. Circle Files for NYSE Public Listing Amid Rising Revenues, Shrinking Profits Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of the world’s second-largest stablecoin USDC, has officially filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company disclosed its intentions in a Form S-1 registration statement submitted on April 1, confirming that it plans to list its Class A common stock under the ticker symbol ”CRCL.” While Circle has not yet disclosed the number of shares it plans to offer or its initial IPO target price, the filing marks a significant milestone in the company's long-standing ambition to become a publicly traded entity. This move comes after two previously abandoned attempts — a failed Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger in 2021 and a confidential filing made in January 2024. The financial details revealed in the S-1 filing present a mixed picture of Circle’s performance over the past three years. In 2024, the company reported revenue of $1.67 billion, reflecting a solid 16% year-on-year increase. However, despite this growth in top-line income, net profits declined sharply. Circle financials (Source: SEC ) Circle posted a net income of $155.6 million for 2024, representing a substantial 41.8% drop compared to the previous year. The filing highlighted that while revenues grew, higher operational costs, particularly distribution payments to key partners, heavily impacted profitability. Notably, Circle paid a staggering $908 million last year to its primary distribution partner, Coinbase, for the circulation of USDC on its platform — a cost that has surpassed Circle’s own earnings from its stablecoin business. The financial disclosure also sheds light on Circle's operational strategy, revealing that over 99% of its revenue stems from its stablecoin reserve holdings. Circle generates most of its income by investing USDC reserves in short-term, yield-bearing US Treasury bills — a common practice among stablecoin issuers to monetize deposited funds while maintaining the liquidity needed for redemptions. In addition to its reserve-based income, Circle's filing revealed the company's exposure to major cryptocurrencies. The firm holds approximately $6.2 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC), $5.6 million in Sui (SUI), and $3.3 million in Ether (ETH). It also has smaller holdings in Sei (SEI), Aptos (APT), and Optimism (OP). While these digital asset holdings represent only a fraction of Circle's total balance sheet, they suggest an effort by the company to maintain a diversified crypto portfolio alongside its core stablecoin business. If successful, Circle's public listing will mark one of the first IPOs by a stablecoin issuer on a major US stock exchange, cementing the company's role as a cornerstone of the crypto-financial ecosystem. This move follows Circle’s recent regulatory milestone in Japan. On March 25, Circle became the first stablecoin issuer to receive regulatory approval in the country, enabling it to launch USDC trading on the SBI VC Trade exchange a day later. USDC is currently the second-largest stablecoin in the market, with a market capitalization of approximately $60.1 billion, according to CoinGecko . It trails only Tether ( USDT ), which maintains a dominant $143.9 billion market cap. Industry-Wide IPO Interest Circle’s IPO filing is part of a broader wave of crypto industry players eyeing public listings. Major firms including crypto exchange Kraken and blockchain infrastructure company BitGo are reportedly exploring plans to go public either later this year or in early 2026, signaling growing institutional interest and regulatory clarity in the digital asset space. While the timeline and valuation for Circle’s IPO remain unclear, the filing will undergo rigorous review by the SEC, which could take months. Investors, analysts, and the broader crypto community will closely watch how the SEC approaches Circle’s listing, especially amid an evolving regulatory landscape for stablecoins in the US. Trump-Backed Bitcoin Mining Firm Eyes IPO After Strategic Merger with Hut 8 In related news, American Bitcoin Corp., a cryptocurrency mining firm backed by members of the Trump family, is reportedly preparing for a public debut as part of a broader strategy to raise additional capital and expand its operations. According to an April 1 report by Bloomberg, the company is actively exploring an initial public offering (IPO) following its recent strategic merger with publicly listed Bitcoin mining company Hut 8. The news follows the March 31 announcement that Hut 8 has acquired a majority stake in American Bitcoin Corp., formerly known as American Data Centers. The Trump family’s involvement in the company is notable, with its founders including Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump — signaling a rare intersection between American political dynasties and the cryptocurrency mining sector. A New Bitcoin Mining Powerhouse As part of the acquisition, Hut 8 transferred its Bitcoin mining hardware and resources into American Bitcoin, creating a powerful mining entity with ambitions to dominate the US crypto mining landscape. While American Bitcoin will remain laser-focused on Bitcoin mining activities, Hut 8 is pivoting toward developing and operating high-performance data centers for artificial intelligence (AI) and other energy-intensive computing needs. Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8, described the transaction as a strategic evolution aimed at reducing capital costs and enhancing revenue predictability. “You can see this in the long term as two sister publicly traded companies — one that is energy, infrastructure, data centers, and the other one that’s Bitcoin mining, reserves, and AISCs [All-In Sustaining Costs]. Together, they form a vertically integrated company that has some of the best economics out there,” Genoot stated. This ambitious vertical integration strategy is designed to consolidate Bitcoin mining, infrastructure services, and high-performance computing into a single, streamlined ecosystem. According to Bloomberg, American Bitcoin Corp. is now considering an IPO as part of its broader capital-raising strategy. The timing and specifics of the public offering remain undisclosed, but sources familiar with the matter suggest that the company may pursue this move later this year or in early 2026, depending on market conditions and regulatory approvals. The Trump family’s involvement, along with the recent Hut 8 acquisition, positions American Bitcoin as a politically high-profile player in an industry facing increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny in the US. The company is also reportedly collaborating with Bitmain, the Chinese manufacturer of Bitcoin mining hardware. Bitmain’s involvement could spark further attention and regulatory interest, especially following US sanctions imposed on Sopghgo, Bitmain’s artificial intelligence affiliate. The formation of American Bitcoin Corp. and its IPO ambitions come at a time when the crypto mining industry is facing significant financial headwinds. The latest Bitcoin halving event in April 2024 slashed miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block, cutting directly into miners’ revenue streams. In response, many mining companies, including Hut 8, have begun pivoting to alternative business lines, such as data center infrastructure and AI-related computing services. This trend is seen as a defensive strategy to mitigate the impact of declining Bitcoin prices and reduced block rewards. According to a March report by Coin Metrics , miners are “diversifying into AI data-center hosting as a way to expand revenue and repurpose existing infrastructure for high-performance computing.” The report notes that this pivot could offer miners more predictable revenue streams compared to the volatile crypto market. JPMorgan’s recent analysis also highlighted the mounting financial pressure on Bitcoin miners in 2025, noting that declining cryptocurrency prices have compounded the challenges triggered by the latest halving event. Bitcoin’s price versus the network’s hashrate. (Source: JPMorgan) A Political Undertone American Bitcoin’s Trump family ties add a unique political dimension to its public listing plans. The Trumps' growing involvement in the crypto industry mirrors the broader trend of political figures and celebrities entering the digital asset space, often stirring debate about the implications of such high-profile endorsements. Given the increased regulatory focus on cryptocurrency mining's energy consumption and geopolitical associations, American Bitcoin’s potential IPO is expected to draw heightened scrutiny from regulators and environmental advocates alike. If American Bitcoin successfully completes its IPO, it will further cement the Trump family’s influence in the crypto world while reshaping the competitive landscape of Bitcoin mining in North America. The merged entity’s vertical integration strategy, combined with the diversification efforts of its parent company, Hut 8, suggests a new era of mining operations — one that combines traditional crypto mining with the rapidly growing demand for AI and data center services.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-02 05:30:00

Crypto analyst Nic Puckrin says it’s a 50-50 chance for a breakout or a drop, with possible BTC targets between $88,000 and $73,000. Bitcoin is trading below its 200-day average, and low volume suggests hesitation. Experts say tariffs may hurt Bitcoin short-term by slowing growth and raising inflation fears, but long-term, BTC could bounce back as stagflation limits further rate hikes. April 2, 2025 05:49:01 UTC Trump Tarrif News : Trump Eyes 20% Tariffs on Most Imports, $6 Trillion Revenue Target Raises Recession Fears President Trump is reportedly considering 20% tariffs on most imports, potentially generating $6 trillion annually, according to The Washington Post . While the proposal is still under review, Trump is set to begin rolling out reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday. Initially expected to be country- and product-specific, the broader plan signals a more aggressive trade stance. Economists warn that rising prices, low consumer sentiment, and ongoing inflation could push the U.S. economy into recession if the policy is implemented. April 2, 2025 05:49:01 UTC Donald Trump Tariff Announcement Live: Trump’s Tariffs Take Effect Today — Markets React, Allies Warn Retaliation President Trump’s long-awaited tariffs will be officially announced at 4 p.m. ET today and take immediate effect, the White House confirmed. While global markets saw a rebound ahead of the news, uncertainty remains high. Trump’s plan includes a 25% tariff on imported cars and targets countries like India, the EU, and Japan. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is open to negotiation but firm on “fixing past wrongs.” EU leaders warned of retaliation, while analysts remain split on whether markets will rally or retreat. April 2, 2025 05:40:25 UTC When is Trump Announcing Tariffs? The world is tense as US President Donald Trump prepares to announce reciprocal tariffs today, April 2—dubbed “Liberation Day.” The tariffs will take immediate effect once revealed. Tensions escalated after the White House criticized India for its 100% tariff on US agricultural products and pointed out similar barriers in the EU, Japan, and Canada. With India in the spotlight, anticipation is rising globally over which countries will face the brunt of Trump’s latest move in his aggressive trade agenda. April 2, 2025 05:40:25 UTC Liberation Day Announcement Time President Donald Trump will officially announce new tariffs at 4 p.m. ET on April 2 during a Rose Garden event titled “Make America Wealthy Again.” According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, the tariffs will take effect immediately, with collections starting Thursday. This move is part of Trump’s broader trade strategy tied to his so-called “Liberation Day,” aiming to penalize countries with unfair trade practices and strengthen U.S. economic standing ahead of the 2024 election campaign. April 2, 2025 05:08:23 UTC What is Liberation Day 2025 ? Starting April 2, US President Donald Trump will introduce new tariffs, calling it “Liberation Day” for America. These tariffs are aimed at countries that charge high duties on American products or have strict trade rules that the US sees as unfair.

Meanwhile, despite market volatility, UBS analysts believe that news flow will turn “more positive” toward the second half of the year, which could further boost the APAC markets. The Investment bank even commented, “We think investors can use market swings to build long-term exposure.

Donald Trump believes his reciprocal tariffs will help the country bring back its wealth On Monday, President Donald Trump claimed his expected reciprocal tariffs will be relatively less than what other countries have been charging over the years. He claimed his administration would be nicer and very kind and even charge substantially lower compared to other countries. He argued that other countries have been taking advantage of the U.S. and that the expected tariffs will only help the country earn back its wealth, calling it the country’s rebirth. He even tagged April 2, the announcement day for the tariffs, “liberation day.” A day before, Trump also stated that the tariffs would be imposed on “all countries,” hinting that the levies may extend to nations responsible for most of the country’s trade deficit. Trump is expected to announce his tariff plan on Wednesday during an event in the Rose Garden, currently scheduled for 4 p.m. EDT.

A similar standard for data-backed tokens, called VRC-20, has now emerged. Vana, an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain that helps users monetize personal data by bundling it into DataDAOs for AI model training, introduced the new standard early this week to boost trust and transparency in the market for data-backed digital assets. ""For data markets to work, tokens must be reliable, secure, and useful. As a universal standard for data-backed tokens, VRC-20 delivers this by ensuring fair and transparent data token trading,"" Vana announced on X. The VRC-20 standard design includes specific criteria such as fixed supply, governance, and liquidity rules while ensuring real data access by tying tokens to actual data utility. Additionally, it promotes continuous liquidity through rewards that ensure market stability. ""This isn’t speculation. This is real financialization of data,"" Vana noted. Vana launched its mainnet in December, with VANA as its native cryptocurrency. Since then, the network has onboarded over 12 million data points through multiple DataDAOs, reflecting strong demand for user-owned data. DataDAOs or data liquidity pools are decentralized marketplaces that bring data onchain as transferable digital tokens. DLPs are where data is contributed, tokenized and made ready for use in applications such as AI model training. Monday's announcement replaced VANA emissions as DataDAO inventive with a new feature that calls for DAOs to issue VRC-20-compliant tokens to receive liquidity support. Additionally, the protocol introduced data validator staking , where VANA holders can lock their coins in data validators instead of individual DataDAOs. ""Rewards are based on network security and usage. Stakers earn proportionally to their contribution to network uptime and data availability. No more idle staking. Earnings are tied to real network utility and reliability,"" Vana said. The VANA token changed hands at $5.58 at press time, the lowest in over two weeks, extending the decline from the recent price high of $8.78 on Binance, according to data source TradingView.",Tech|Data|Blockchain|Technology,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 05:47:30

The offering was initially set to raise at least $1.3 billion, but purchasers opted for an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of notes, GameStop said in an April 1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""The company expects to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin in a manner consistent with the Company's Investment Policy,"" GameStop added. The convertible notes are debt that can later be converted into equity and are scheduled to mature on April 1, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The conversion rate for the notes will initially be 33 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, according to the filing. GameStop shares didn’t see a significant move following the close of the convertible debt offering. GME closed the April 1 trading day up 1.34% at $22.61 and only saw an extra 0.5% bump after the bell, Google Finance data shows . GameStop’s share price barely moved after sharing it closed the convertible debt offering. Source: Google Finance Positive shareholder sentiment saw the stock jump nearly 12% to $28.36 on March 26, the day after GameStop announced its Bitcoin ( BTC ) plan, but its fortunes reversed the next day, with GME shares dropping nearly 24% to $21.68. Analysts at the time suggested the chilly reception reflected shareholders' fear of GameStop's deeper problems with its business model. GameStop joins growing Bitcoin move On March 25, GameStop confirmed that it had received board approval to invest in Bitcoin and US-dollar-pegged stablecoins using the notes and its cash reserves. Those reserves stood at $4.77 billion as of Feb. 1, compared with $921.7 million a year earlier, according to its 2024 fourth-quarter financial statements. GameStop is a relative latecomer among public companies creating Bitcoin treasuries. A slew of others have already added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in a playbook popularized by Micheal Saylor’s Strategy .

Following this rise, the EOS market capitalization has also surged past $1 billion for the first time since mid-February. Vaulta Banking Update Triggers EOS Price Rally to 2-Month High The Vaulta Banking feature , which was introduced by the EOS Network last month, has been boding well for the EOS token. In the last seven days, EOS price is up a staggering 40%, with the ecosystem’s growth playing a major role in boosting buyer confidence. Vaulta is a feature that seeks to bridge the traditional banking industry with Web3. With traditional financial institutions like BlackRock expanding their crypto presence , such a tool could gain massive adoption. More importantly, EOS has revealed the Vaulta Banking Advisory Council. It noted, “To bridge traditional finance and Web3, we’ve brought together seasoned leaders from banking, fintech, and digital assets. Their strategic guidance ensures Vaulta stays compliant, credible, and ready for mass adoption.” At the same time, it added that Vaulta will bring Web3 to portfolio investment including real estate and commodities through Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization. These developments around Vaulta are driving a massive rally for EOS price despite a broader crypto market crash . EOS Technical Analysis After Bullish Breakout The gradual uptrend recorded by EOS price in the last seven days and the uptick in buying activity have triggered a bullish breakout from a descending parallel channel. This breakout suggests that the trend has flipped from bearish to bullish. The RSI indicates that the EOS price rally is due to a surge in buying activity. This indicator stands at 77, a sign that EOS is about to be overbought, which could cause a short-term reversal before the trend continues. However, the ADX line is rising, which shows that the bullish momentum is getting strong. These bullish signals show there is room for more upside for the EOS price, which could see it reach the 227.2% Fibonacci level of $1.05. EOS/USDT: 1-day Chart Funding Rate HeatMap Shows Extreme Short Positioning The funding rate heatmap from Coinglass shows extreme short positioning on the EOS token. At press time, EOS had a funding rate of -277%, indicating that short sellers are willing to pay a higher funding fee to maintain their positions. This suggests traders do not anticipate EOS to sustain the momentum, and they expect the price to reverse as traders sell to book profits. Fundibg Rate Heatmap However, despite the increased number of short sellers, the Vaulta banking feature, bullish predictions from other analysts, and the surge in buying activity depicted on the 1-day chart suggest that it is possible for the altcoin to extend its gains, and possibly reach $1.

The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic beast, constantly shifting between different phases. Right now, the spotlight is firmly on Bitcoin, and the Altcoin Season Index is flashing a clear signal: we’re in Bitcoin Season. Let’s dive into what this means for you and your crypto portfolio. Unveiling the Altcoin Season Index: What Is It? The Altcoin Season Index, a fascinating metric from CoinMarketCap (CMC), acts as a compass for navigating the ever-changing tides of the crypto market. Think of it as a gauge that tells you whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. On April 2nd, at 00:33 UTC, this index registered a value of 14. This number, down a point from the previous day, isn’t just a random figure; it’s a crucial indicator that the market is currently experiencing a strong Bitcoin Season. How Does the Altcoin Season Index Work? To truly understand what a score of 14 signifies, let’s break down how the Altcoin Season Index actually works: Scope: The index meticulously tracks the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap. However, it intelligently excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC), focusing on genuine altcoin performance. Timeframe: It analyzes the price performance of these top 100 coins over the past 90 days, providing a medium-term perspective on market trends. The Benchmark: Bitcoin (BTC) is the benchmark. The index compares the performance of each of the top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin’s performance during this 90-day period. Defining Altcoin Season: For the market to be declared in ‘Altcoin Season’, a significant majority – at least 75% – of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. This signifies broad-based altcoin strength. Defining Bitcoin Season: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared when only 25% or fewer of these top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin. This indicates Bitcoin’s dominance and relative strength compared to altcoins. Index Score Range: The Altcoin Season Index score ranges from 1 to 100. A higher score indicates a stronger Altcoin Season, while a lower score, like the current 14, points towards a dominant Bitcoin Season. Bitcoin Season in Full Swing: What Does an Index of 14 Mean? With the Altcoin Season Index at a low of 14, the message is clear: Bitcoin dominance is currently the defining characteristic of the crypto market. This low score powerfully indicates that a vast majority of altcoins are not keeping pace with Bitcoin’s price appreciation over the last 90 days. In fact, fewer than 25% of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform the original cryptocurrency during this period. Why Does Bitcoin Dominance Matter? Understanding Bitcoin dominance and the shift between Bitcoin and Altcoin Seasons is crucial for several reasons: Portfolio Strategy: Knowing whether we are in a Bitcoin or Altcoin Season can significantly influence your investment strategy. In a Bitcoin Season, focusing on BTC or BTC-related assets might be more prudent. During an Altcoin Season, diversifying into select altcoins could potentially yield higher returns. Risk Management: Altcoins are generally considered riskier than Bitcoin. In a Bitcoin Season, altcoins might experience more significant drawdowns if Bitcoin corrects. Understanding the market phase helps in better risk management. Identifying Opportunities: Even within a Bitcoin Season, select altcoins might still perform well due to specific catalysts. However, a Bitcoin Season generally favors Bitcoin and signals caution when allocating heavily to altcoins. Conversely, an Altcoin Season can present lucrative opportunities in carefully chosen altcoins. Market Sentiment: The Altcoin Season Index reflects broader market sentiment. A strong Bitcoin Season can indicate a flight to safety or a renewed focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. An Altcoin Season often reflects a higher risk appetite and exuberance in the market. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season: Actionable Insights So, what should you do when the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season? Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio Allocation: Consider adjusting your portfolio to potentially increase your Bitcoin holdings, especially if you were heavily invested in altcoins. This doesn’t necessarily mean selling all your altcoins, but perhaps rebalancing to reflect the current market phase. Focus on Bitcoin Fundamentals: Bitcoin Season often brings renewed attention to Bitcoin’s core value propositions: store of value, decentralization, and scarcity. Research and understand these fundamentals to reinforce your investment thesis. Selective Altcoin Approach: While it’s Bitcoin Season, it doesn’t mean all altcoins are doomed. Look for altcoins with strong fundamentals, unique use cases, and active development. However, be more selective and cautious in your altcoin investments during this phase. Monitor the Index: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index. A sustained increase in the index could signal a potential shift towards Altcoin Season. Use it as one of many tools to gauge market trends. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin: Bitcoin Season can be an opportune time to DCA into Bitcoin, gradually accumulating more BTC over time, especially if you believe in its long-term potential. Are There Any Benefits to Bitcoin Season? While altcoin enthusiasts might prefer Altcoin Season, Bitcoin Season also offers certain benefits to the broader crypto ecosystem: Market Consolidation: Bitcoin Season can lead to a period of market consolidation, where speculative excesses are reduced, and focus shifts back to fundamental value. Attracting New Investors: Bitcoin’s relative stability and established brand can attract new investors to the crypto space, who might be hesitant to dive directly into the more volatile altcoin market. Strengthening Bitcoin’s Narrative: Bitcoin Season reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as the leading cryptocurrency and a store of value, which is crucial for its long-term adoption. Potential for Future Altcoin Season: Historically, Bitcoin Seasons have often been followed by Altcoin Seasons. Bitcoin’s growth can eventually pave the way for renewed interest and investment in altcoins as investors seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. Challenges of Bitcoin Season for Altcoin Holders Of course, Bitcoin Season also presents challenges, particularly for those heavily invested in altcoins: Altcoin Underperformance: The most direct challenge is the underperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin. This can lead to portfolio stagnation or even losses in USD terms if Bitcoin is rising while altcoins are not. Capital Rotation to Bitcoin: Bitcoin Season often sees capital rotating from altcoins back into Bitcoin, further altcoin prices. Sentiment Shift Away from Altcoins: Market sentiment can shift away from altcoins during Bitcoin Season, making it harder for altcoin projects to gain traction and attract new investment. Potential for Altcoin Correction: If Bitcoin experiences a correction after a period of dominance, altcoins, already weakened, could potentially face even steeper corrections. Conclusion: Riding the Bitcoin Wave The Altcoin Season Index at 14 is a clear indicator: we are currently navigating a Bitcoin Season. This doesn’t mean the end of altcoins, but it does signal a shift in market dynamics. Understanding this shift, adjusting your strategy accordingly, and staying informed are key to successfully navigating the crypto market’s ever-changing seasons. By recognizing Bitcoin’s current dominance and appreciating the cyclical nature of the crypto market, you can position yourself to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks, whether it’s Bitcoin Season or the altcoin surge that may follow.

Recent whale metrics indicated that large-scale investors bought roughly $8 million of the token, whereas a crypto exchange behemoth also listed it previously. In an upshot, traders and investors are eyeing more gains in the asset’s price due to recent advancements that underscore rising demand for the crypto. PENDLE Price Jumps 8% Amid Bullish Whale Transactions As of press time, PENDLE price witnessed an 8% uptick in value and exchanged hands at $3.05. The crypto’s 24-hour low and high were registered as $2.84 and $3.07, respectively. On a keynote, the rising price action aligns with the heightened buying pressure bought by whales in recent days. The latest data from tracker Lookonchain showed that whales bought roughly $8 million worth of coins in the past 5 days. Per the data, five newly created wallets collectively accumulated the aforementioned amount. Here Are The PENDLE Whale Addresses Captured: -0x21fBA58b20f62397c015b1f5a15f742ad430dFA -0x2EB48c60F4ea75fa0a0Ff5BB017EBD9f5981b8F5 -0x11DFEDf01B3FA824BbCB138159B2e6AFE43692a3 -0x981D8856f572Fb076626265114EAD67697dA5501 -0x6478C8681ADC3E7a0C17Aa1E1F0Ff16d1A61a8f6 Why Are Whales Accumulating? Meanwhile, the rising whale accumulations and PENDLE price upswing fall in line with another bullish development. Crypto exchange behemoth Coinbase unveiled a listing for the token at the end of March last month. As a result, large-scale investors are hoarding massive amounts of the token, aiming to capitalize on emerging market opportunities. Historically, listings on top crypto exchanges usually usher a bullish price action as they substantially increase an asset’s market exposure, thereby welcoming more funds from investors. CoinGape previously reported another similar chronicle, wherein cryptos BROCCOLI and TUT price rallied with their listings on Binance . Similarly, the Coinbase listing appears to be a vital catalyst for driving the whale frenzy and recent price upswing. Can Bullish Developments Fuel Bull Run Ahead? Usual market sentiments continue to tilt in favor of bulls, given the Coinbase listing and rising whale accumulations. Further, a renowned crypto market trader has poured additional optimism surrounding the coin’s future price action with his bullish prediction. Analyst AMCrypto recently took to X, revealing that PENDLE price is forming an “inverse head and shoulder pattern.” This pattern formation suggests that a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish is brewing amid bullish advancements. Source: AMCrypto, X In light of this dynamic, the analyst predicts that a break above $3 paves the way for a massive rally ahead. As mentioned above, the coin is currently trading above this price level. As a result, market watchers continue to weigh further bullishness on the asset’s long-term price prospects.

Here’s What You Need to Know!,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/will-solana-ever-reach-150-as-bearish-clouds-hover-over-sol-price-rally-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"The post Will Solana Ever Reach $150 as Bearish Clouds Hover Over SOL Price Rally? Here’s What You Need to Know! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The start of the second quarter is bullish for the Solana (SOL) price as the levels surpass $125 after a tight consolidation. Although SOL-based tokens are gaining momentum, the value of the native token remains unaffected. Does this suggest the market participants have shifted their focus away from the token? Will the SOL price continue to remain consolidated below $130? The SOL price is speculated to be under bearish influence, with a high risk of falling back to $100 in the coming days. The main reason behind the bearish narrative is the formation of a bearish flag in the daily chart. A breakdown from the pattern usually results in a massive pullback, but in the wider perspective, the bulls are trying hard to invalidate the pattern. The Solana price is displaying some hidden bullish divergence, which suggests a huge breakout is following after a tight consolidation for a while. As seen in the above chart, the SOL price is stuck within a bearish pennant, but the bearish activity began much before the validation of the pattern. The Ichimoku cloud has already undergone a bearish crossover before the end of Q1 that compelled the price to begin the monthly trade on a bearish note. However, the Bollinger Bands are trading parallel to each other, suggesting a drop in volatility. Meanwhile, the technicals remain indecisive as the RSI has displayed a bearish divergence while the CMF is trying to trigger a bullish divergence. This suggests the strength of the rally is weakening, but the bulls are gaining strength compared to the bears with a rise in the buying pressure. Therefore, the Solana (SOL) price is stuck within a determined range and displays a huge possibility of pullback. However, the bulls have been defending the support at $123 since March 2024, and hence, a rebound could be on the horizon. However, if the rise in the volatility negatively impacts the crypto markets due to the announcement of new tariffs by US President Trump, a breakdown may drag the SOL price to $115 or $110. Only a major sell-off or a FUD may drag the levels below $100; until then, the probability of revising a rise to $150 remains imminent.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 06:12:22

The White House confirmed that reciprocal tariffs on nations imposing duties on US goods would take effect immediately, after Trump unveils them, raising concerns over an escalating global trade war. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.27% to around 35,520, while the broader Topix Index dropped 0.9% to 2,637 on Wednesday. The Japanese yen steady at around 149.8 per dollar on Wednesday, remaining sideways for the week. Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda warned that the new US tariffs could significantly affect global trade and economic growth. Analysts suggest the economic fallout could influence the BoJ's decision on interest rates, with a hike anticipated in Q3 of 2025, likely in July. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.07% to around 3,360 on Wednesday, building on the previous session’s gains as investors awaited clarity on US President Donald Trump’s upcoming tariffs, and the offshore yuan fell to around 7.27 per dollar on Tuesday, as the looming implementation of President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs overshadowed positive manufacturing PMI data. China has launched its inaugural green sovereign bond sale, aiming to raise up to 6 billion yuan ($826 million) , while also securing a London listing. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.28% to 23,161 in early deals on Wednesday, reversing a modest gain in the previous session amid losses in most sectors. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.62% to 76,394 in Wednesday morning deals, supported by gains from realty, auto, consumer goods, and private banks. Meanwhile, final data from a private survey showed that the manufacturing sector in India grew the most in eight months during March. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.12% to close at 7,935 on Wednesday, building on the previous session’s gains. The Australian dollar strengthened to around $0.63 on Wednesday, marking its second consecutive session of gains. Elsewhere, fresh data showed that Australian industrial activity contracted further in March, weighed down by uncertainties surrounding US tariffs and domestic politics. The seasonally adjusted estimate for total dwellings approved in Australia fell by 0.3% month-on-month to 16,606 units in February 2025, less than the expected 1.4% decline. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that his country will ""stand up for national interests"" in response to President Trump's recent plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on all U.S. trade partners. He confirmed Australia will not impose retaliatory tariffs, noting the U.S. accounts for less than 5% of Australia's goods exports. He emphasized that strengthening trade ties with Asian markets will provide crucial support to Australian businesses. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended mixed as investors awaited clarity from President Trump regarding his upcoming tariff policy. Meanwhile, recent U.S. economic releases showed weak jobs data and a poor manufacturing report. Investors are now focused on Friday's nonfarm payroll report for more insights into the Fed's rate path.

The crypto market mood ring, also known as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, is showing a notable shift. We’ve seen a significant jump, suggesting that the pervasive fear gripping the market might be starting to loosen its hold. Let’s dive into what this means for you and your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index First things first, what exactly is this “Crypto Fear and Greed Index” everyone’s talking about? Think of it as a barometer for the overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. It’s calculated daily by Alternative.me, a software development platform, and it essentially tells us whether the market is leaning towards excessive fear or exuberant greed. This index is crucial because market sentiment is a powerful force that can significantly influence crypto prices. Here’s the lowdown on how it works: Scale: The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100. 0 – Extreme Fear: When the index dips towards 0, it indicates extreme fear in the market. This often happens during price crashes and periods of uncertainty. 100 – Extreme Greed: Conversely, a reading closer to 100 signals extreme greed. This typically occurs during bull runs when prices are soaring, and everyone is jumping on the bandwagon. Current Reading: As of April 2nd, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 44. Recent Change: This is a positive jump of 10 points from the previous day’s reading. Zone: Despite this improvement, the index is still in the “Fear” zone (typically ranges from 0-49). Analyzing the Improved Crypto Sentiment A 10-point increase in a single day is nothing to scoff at! This jump in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index clearly reflects an improved crypto sentiment within the market. But what does this really mean for you as an investor or someone keeping an eye on the crypto space? Here’s a breakdown of the potential implications: Reduced Panic Selling: A move away from extreme fear often suggests that panic selling might be subsiding. Investors are potentially becoming less reactive to short-term price fluctuations. Increased Buying Interest: As fear diminishes, some investors might see it as an opportunity to “buy the dip.” This increased buying pressure can contribute to price stabilization or even upward movement. Shifting Market Psychology: Overall, an improved sentiment indicates a shift in market psychology. It suggests a move away from a purely bearish outlook towards a more neutral or even cautiously optimistic perspective. Not Out of the Woods Yet: Crucially, even with this positive shift, the index remains in the “Fear” zone. This reminds us that while sentiment is improving, significant caution is still warranted. We are not in “Greed” territory yet, indicating the market is still fragile. Decoding the Market Sentiment Shift: What’s Driving the Change? So, what’s behind this shift in market sentiment ? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just pulled out of thin air. It’s calculated using a blend of six different market factors. Understanding these components can give us clues about what’s influencing the current sentiment change. Here’s a look at the factors and their weights: Factor Weight What it Measures Volatility 25% Current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 and 90 days. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Current market momentum and volume compared to the last 30 and 90-day averages. Social Media 15% Sentiment analysis from social media platforms, primarily focusing on crypto-related hashtags and engagement rates. Surveys 15% Weekly crypto surveys (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance 10% The dominance of Bitcoin compared to the total crypto market cap. A rising dominance can sometimes indicate a risk-off sentiment. Google Trends 10% Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries, reflecting general public interest in Bitcoin and potentially the broader crypto market. To understand the recent 10-point jump, we need to consider which of these factors might have contributed most significantly. For instance, has volatility decreased? Has market momentum picked up? Is social media sentiment turning more positive? Analyzing these underlying components offers a deeper understanding of the sentiment shift. The Role of Bitcoin Sentiment in the Index It’s important to note that Bitcoin sentiment plays a significant role in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Bitcoin, as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often acts as a bellwether for the entire crypto market. Its price movements and sentiment surrounding it tend to heavily influence the overall market mood. The index explicitly includes “Bitcoin Dominance” as a factor, recognizing Bitcoin’s central position. Furthermore, many of the other factors, such as volatility and Google Trends, are heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance and public perception. Therefore, shifts in Bitcoin’s price and news surrounding it are likely to be major drivers of changes in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Understanding Each Fear and Greed Index Component in Detail Let’s delve a bit deeper into each component of the Fear and Greed Index to truly grasp what they signify: Volatility (25%): High volatility is often associated with fear. When prices swing wildly, it creates uncertainty and anxiety among investors. The index measures current volatility against historical averages to gauge if volatility is unusually high, contributing to fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Strong market momentum and high trading volume usually indicate greed. When prices are rising steadily and lots of people are buying, it signals bullishness and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Conversely, weak momentum and low volume can point to fear and disinterest. Social Media (15%): Social media sentiment provides a real-time pulse on public opinion. Analyzing keywords, hashtags, and engagement related to crypto helps gauge whether the online conversation is leaning towards positive (greed) or negative (fear) sentiment. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, weekly surveys directly gauged investor sentiment. These provided a more direct measure of fear and greed by asking participants about their market outlook. (If surveys resume, they will again be a valuable component.) Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin dominance can be a complex indicator. During periods of fear, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived “safer” crypto asset, increasing its dominance. Conversely, in greedy phases, investors may be more willing to venture into altcoins, reducing Bitcoin dominance. Google Trends (10%): Google Trends data reveals the level of public interest in Bitcoin and crypto. High search volumes often correlate with greed and market tops, while low search volumes can indicate fear and potential market bottoms. Actionable Insights and Moving Forward The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, but it shouldn’t be used in isolation. Here are some actionable insights: Confirmation Tool: Use the index as a confirmation tool alongside other technical and fundamental analysis. Don’t base trading decisions solely on the index. Contrarian Indicator: Some investors use it as a contrarian indicator. Extreme fear might be seen as a buying opportunity, while extreme greed could signal an impending correction. However, this is a high-risk strategy. Monitor Trends: Pay attention to the trend of the index. Is it consistently rising, falling, or stagnating? These trends can provide more meaningful insights than a single day’s reading. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the factors that drive the index. Understanding what’s influencing volatility, momentum, and social sentiment can give you a better grasp of market dynamics. Conclusion: Cautious Optimism in the Crypto Air The recent 10-point jump in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 44 is undoubtedly a positive sign. It suggests that the grip of extreme fear on the crypto market is loosening, and a more balanced, albeit still fearful, sentiment is emerging. While this improvement offers a glimmer of hope , it’s crucial to remember that the index remains in the “Fear” zone. The crypto market is still navigating uncertain waters, and caution remains the watchword. However, this shift in sentiment is a development worth watching closely, as it could be the early signal of a more sustained recovery in market confidence.

In a new interview with independent journalist David Lin, Scaramucci says Bitcoin’s performance in the coming months will largely depend on President Trump’s trade war rhetoric. According to Scaramucci, he sees BTC soaring to new all-time highs if Trump dials down on tariff threats. But he notes that the Bitcoin bull market could end with a whimper if Trump decides to double down. “Bitcoin is being held back right now by the macro dilemma that we’re facing. I think people were expecting that President Trump would be pro-business and he’d be pro-growth for the stock market. I don’t think they were anticipating these starts and stops with the tariffs and this level of uncertainty. If it gets calmer and it looks more like the 2017, 2021 Trump term, Bitcoin will get to $200,000 this year. If you’re telling me we’re going to be in a protracted trade war and we’re going to be fighting with our European and Western allies, Bitcoin will probably hover near here, maybe get back to $100,000. But it is going to be very hard for Bitcoin to ascend to where I think it could go if we’re just in a more normal environment – normal being [the] proper intersection between government and finance.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $85,338, up over 3% in the past day.

Caraco, the CEO of ERA Queensland in Australia, expressed frustration over claims that XRP could surge to “$1,000 to $10,000 overnight.” In a post on X, he argued that such hype-driven narratives deceive new investors and set unrealistic expectations. According to Caraco, XRP’s current trading range of $2 to $2.50 reflects a more grounded outlook, with any substantial increase likely coming from institutional adoption and gradual market growth rather than sudden parabolic moves. 1000% Agree I have been a CEO of an Australian Stock Market Company and it’s sad to see incoming XRP Buyers been sold the story of $1000 to $10,000 and it’s parabolic and going to happen tommorow or next week.

The influencer pointed out that hype-filled statements no longer resonate with the community as people grow weary of baseless predictions. Emphasizing the importance of truth and transparency, All Things XRP urged community leaders to focus on fact-based insights instead of chasing attention with unrealistic claims. He called out those who predict $1,00 next month or $10,000 overnight . The post highlighted how the community looks for responsible leadership rather than sensationalism. Caraco echoed this sentiment, cautioning that treating the crypto market like the stock market is misleading. While many analysts have predicted rapid growth to targets as high as $10,000 , Caraco argued that crypto assets are inherently volatile, making precise predictions unreliable. Instead, he believes gradual progress driven by institutional interest and market maturity is more realistic. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Role of Regulation and Credible Insights Caraco also stressed the importance of regulation in fostering a more stable market environment. He noted that as legislation becomes clearer, cryptocurrencies lacking liquidity or substantial backing could face sanctions, helping curb misleading narratives. Caraco remains optimistic about XRP’s long-term potential. However, he firmly rejects the notion of sudden, astronomical price increases. In contrast to the hype-driven content, Caraco praised credible influencers like All Things XRP, Jake Claver, Max Avery, and Zach Rector. While these influencers are optimistic about the digital asset’s future , they provide well-researched and balanced analyses of XRP. Caraco criticized “clickbait marketing” that promotes sensational price targets, emphasizing that educated and grounded insights are essential for building community trust. His remarks serve as a reminder that sustainable growth requires a focus on facts and informed perspectives rather than speculative hype.

Circle, the powerhouse behind the USDC stablecoin, has just made a significant move. News broke via Unfolded on X and further reported by Fortune that Circle has confidentially filed for an Initial Public Offering (IPO). This cryptocurrency IPO could be a game-changer, signaling a new level of maturity and mainstream acceptance for the digital asset space. Let’s dive into what this could mean for you and the future of crypto. Why is the Circle IPO a Big Deal for Digital Assets? Circle’s move to go public is not just another company listing; it’s a potential watershed moment for the entire digital assets ecosystem. Here’s why this IPO is generating so much buzz: Validation of the Crypto Industry: A successful IPO from a major player like Circle lends significant legitimacy to the cryptocurrency industry. It signals to traditional investors and institutions that crypto is not just a fleeting trend but a serious asset class. Increased Transparency and Regulation: Public companies face stricter regulatory scrutiny and reporting requirements. Circle’s IPO could pave the way for greater transparency and accountability within the stablecoin sector, potentially easing regulatory concerns and fostering wider adoption. Capital Infusion for Growth and Innovation: An IPO can provide Circle with a substantial capital injection. This fresh capital could fuel further innovation in their product offerings, expand their global reach, and solidify USDC’s position in the competitive stablecoin market. Boost for USDC Adoption: A publicly traded Circle could enhance trust and confidence in USDC. Investors might see this as a sign of stability and reliability, potentially driving increased adoption and usage of USDC across various crypto platforms and applications. Circle’s USDC: A Stablecoin Giant in the Making For those new to the crypto space, understanding USDC’s role is crucial. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Think of it as a digital dollar designed for the internet age. Here’s a quick rundown of why USDC has become so prominent: Feature Description Pegged to USD Each USDC is designed to be redeemable 1:1 for US dollars, providing price stability. Transparency Circle publishes regular attestations to verify that USDC reserves are fully backed by cash and cash equivalents. Regulatory Compliance Circle is committed to regulatory compliance and works with established financial institutions. Wide Adoption USDC is supported on numerous cryptocurrency exchanges, DeFi platforms, and payment systems. USDC has become a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and is increasingly used for payments, remittances, and as a safe haven asset within the volatile crypto market. Its stability and reliability are key factors in its growing popularity. What Does a Circle IPO Mean for the Future of Stablecoins? Circle’s IPO aspirations could set a precedent for other stablecoin issuers. It signals a potential shift towards greater institutional involvement and regulatory alignment within the stablecoin sector. Here are some potential implications: More Stablecoin IPOs? Circle’s move might encourage other major stablecoin issuers to consider going public, further legitimizing the asset class and attracting institutional capital. Enhanced Regulatory Clarity: As a public company, Circle will operate under increased regulatory scrutiny. This could contribute to the development of clearer regulatory frameworks for stablecoins globally.

Circle needs to continue to differentiate itself and maintain its competitive edge. Maintaining Trust and Transparency: As a public company, maintaining the trust and transparency that has been crucial to USDC’s success will be paramount. Opportunities: Growth Capital: The IPO will provide significant capital for expansion, product development, and strategic acquisitions. Brand Building: Going public will enhance Circle’s brand visibility and credibility, attracting new users, partners, and institutional investors. Strategic Partnerships: Public status can facilitate strategic partnerships with traditional financial institutions and corporations. Global Expansion: The IPO can support Circle’s ambitions for global expansion, bringing USDC to new markets and user bases. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, take away from this news? Here are some actionable insights: Keep an Eye on Regulatory Developments: Circle’s IPO journey will likely be closely watched by regulators.

While investors hoped that regulatory reforms and the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve would boost prices, instead, Bitcoin has fallen from over $100,000 at the start of the year to the mid-$80,000s for most of March. With the markets bracing up for Trump’s reciprocal tariffs , it’s remains uncertain how BTC will react in the long run. President Trump is gearing up to drop a major announcement on April 2 at 4 p.m. ET, dubbed “ Liberation Day .” He’s expected to unveil reciprocal tariffs targeting 15 countries, including China, Canada, and Mexico, all of which have already imposed tariffs on the U.S. Tariff War Shakes Up the Market The ongoing tariff war is shaking up the stock market, with the S&P 500 dropping over 2% in the past five days. Bitcoin’s price often follows the market, so it could face more ups and downs. The trade war is likely to cause more short-term price swings. Crypto prices have taken a hit as they’ve become more tied to traditional assets like stocks and bonds, which are struggling due to economic uncertainty. U.S. tariffs on imports have left Wall Street worried about a global recession, making investors wary of risky assets like crypto. Marc Ostwald, Chief Economist at ADM Investor Services International, explained that Markets are losing their ‘risk appetite,’ which is pushing crypto further from safe-haven assets like gold, which remains the go-to choice in uncertain times. As the global financial and trade system grows more fragmented, investors are looking for safer alternatives to riskier assets like the U.S. dollar. Right now, gold is the go-to choice, up 18% so far this year. Bitcoin To Take Over Gold? However, this could change, says Omid Malekan, adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. He believes that Bitcoin might soon take over as the ‘new gold’. He noted that the future is uncertain as both crypto and tariffs are new and complex. Some believe crypto is a risky tech asset that would drop due to tariffs. But Bitcoin is also seen as “digital gold ,” and gold prices are rising with tariff news. He believes that when the economy is uncertain, investors might turn to Bitcoin just like they’ve turned to gold recently. Tariffs Could Boost Bitcoin In another positive note, Zach Pandl , head of research at Grayscale, notes that the impact of tariffs on crypto could be “priced in” and the worst might be over already. Besides, he believes that the Liberation Day could ease financial market struggles and if the tariffs are tough but phased, targeting 15 countries, markets will likely rally. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S Liberation Day 2nd April : Trump Tarrifs Announcment, Crypto News Today, XRP News, Trump Speech Today , He also pointed out that events like Circle’s IPO wouldn’t be happening if institutions weren’t confident in the crypto space and its regulations. Pandl believes that tariffs will reduce the demand for the U.S. dollar and open the door for other currencies like Bitcoin. He still believes that Bitcoin will reach new all-time highs this year, despite the current negative sentiment around its prices. Bounce-back For Bitcoin? Sid Powell, CEO & co-founder of Maple, is saying that traders are hopeful that Trump’s upcoming tariff announcement on April 2 will be less harsh than expected. Powell noted that after weeks of falling prices, any relief could trigger FOMO and a quick bounce-back for Bitcoin. However, he also warns that if the tariffs cause the U.S. dollar to strengthen or slow down the global economy, risky assets like crypto could suffer even more. So, investors are waiting to see what happens before making big decisions. Besides, if inflation rises, the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates, which could boost Bitcoin adoption and lead to a price increase over time. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In the past 24 hours, Act I The AI Prophecy (ACT) price has dropped over 63 percent to trade at about $0.06987 on Wednesday, during the early Western financial markets. Several other Binance-listed tokens – led by DEXE, KAVA, HIPPO, TST, LUMIA, and QUICK, among others – recorded more than 50 percent decline in the past 24 hours. After an on-chain investment, it was revealed that the Binance exchange lowered the leverage position for the involved tokens. As a result, market makers like Wintermute, which held positions exceeding the new limits were forced to liquidate their holdings automatically. Binance to Take Responsibility Following the Binance scandal on April Fools’ Day, the desire for the affected crypto investors to boycott the exchange is palpable. In the past 24 hours, the #BoycottBinance topic has been trending on the X platform, especially after the crypto exchange had not provided a detailed report on the incident as of this writing. Friends, I have decided not to use #Binance anymore, they have dragged the market into too much manipulation and many of the coins they have listed for a long time are being filled and emptied, I think this exchange should really be punished This is a call for everyone to… pic.twitter.com/fgHxayvoDP — DXC Foundation (@Dxc_Foundation) April 1, 2025 According to Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO at Wintermute, yesterday’s altcoin selloff on the Binance exchange was a reaction to an arbitrage opportunity in an Automated Market Maker pool rather than a deliberate strategy. Meanwhile, Yi He, cofounder at Binance, noted that the crypto exchange is collecting details and preparing a report on yesterday’s incident. Yi hinted at the involvement of another player, which has significantly complicated the incident. Nonetheless, the scandal has made a major dent in memecoins, especially those listed by Binance in the recent past. Moreover, some community members have accused Binance exchange of being focused to make profit on rising volume instead of focusing on building utility projects. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Search Trends Crash After Ripple Lawsuit Ends appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The long-standing Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit has officially wrapped up, but there’s a catch—we’re still waiting for the SEC’s official statement. Why the hesitation? In past cases like Kraken and Cumberland, the SEC gave official statements and confirmation, and this one’s no different. According to attorney Fred Rispoli, Ripple should receive an official update within 60 days. But here’s the million-dollar question—what’s next for XRP’s price? Investors had high hopes for a massive rally, even expecting a $10 surge, considering the emotional rollercoaster of the legal battle. After all, XRP’s price reacted strongly to events like Trump’s election, so wouldn’t this be an even bigger catalyst? Now, let’s put technical charts aside and dive into an unexpected data point: XRP’s global search interest. It plummeted to a new low of 16, according to Google Trends. To put that in perspective, XRP’s search interest peaked at 100 in January—the exact time of Ripple’s appeal deadline. Interestingly, XRP saw a 5% price rally during that period. trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(""TIMESERIES"", {""comparisonItem"":[{""keyword"":""xrp"",""geo"":"""",""time"":""today 3-m""}],""category"":0,""property"":""""}, {""exploreQuery"":""date=today%203-m&q=xrp&hl=en"",""guestPath"":""https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/""}); So, here’s a thought: was the SEC unintentionally keeping XRP alive through public attention? The endless social media debates, Gary Gensler’s constant mentions, and top lawyers joining the case all fueled the XRP buzz. Now that the lawsuit is over, the chatter’s died down, and so has the search interest. Is the SEC’s silence the final nail in the coffin for XRP’s social sentiment? Or is this just the calm before the next wave? Only time—and that much awaited official statement—will tell.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 07:24:18

Here is the Data,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/has-the-peak-in-bitcoin-and-altcoins-already-been-seen-or-is-the-big-bull-still-to-come-here-is-the-data/,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal has cited several key indicators that point to low public interest in digital assets, suggesting that the much-anticipated euphoria period of the current market cycle may not yet have materialized. In his statement, Alphractal outlined four key metrics that point to a lack of mainstream excitement around cryptocurrencies: Google search trends remain significantly lower than previous market peaks, indicating waning interest among the general public. Wikipedia searches for cryptocurrency-related pages have not reached previous cycle levels and are even declining. Crypto discussions on Reddit remain weak, a stark contrast to the surge seen during the height of enthusiasm in 2021. 4Chan participation, once a prominent forum for crypto discussions, has also seen a decline in activity. Alphractal believes that this trend raises an important question: Is the general public now well-informed about crypto, or is there simply a lack of demand for information? The firm leans towards the latter explanation, emphasizing that cryptocurrencies are still a relatively new asset class and most people are unfamiliar with the intricacies of these assets. Related News: Anticipated Altcoin Airdrop Announced - 50 Million Tokens to be Distributed to Users, Here are the Details Alphractal draws two important conclusions from these observations: The peak of public interest in 2024 was less intense compared to previous cycles. The expected market euphoria has not yet materialized, but it could occur in the coming months. With Bitcoin dominance still high and many altcoins trading at historically low prices, Alphractal suggests that a significant market rally could still be on the horizon, potentially resulting in a surge in searches and public interest in 2025. *This is not investment advice.

The BTC/JPY trading on the Japan-based bitFlyer fell 1% after failing to take out the trendline drawn off the record high reached on Jan. 20, data from charting platform TradingView show. BTC's USD-denominated price faced similar losses. Meanwhile, Asian equity indices and the U.S. equity futures treaded water ahead of President Donald Trump's sweeping new “Liberation Day” reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday that could trigger a global trade war. The tariff uncertainty has spurred several investment banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs , pencil in a higher chance of U.S. recession or consecutive quarterly contractions in the growth rate. Some crypto observers expect investors to treat bitcoin (BTC) as a haven asset should a tariff-led economic swoon materialize. Goldman, however, sees the Japanese yen, a long-preferred safe haven, as the top hedge against U.S. risks. ""The yen offers investors the best currency hedge should the chances of a US recession increase,"" Kamakshya Trivedi, head of global foreign exchange, interest rates and emerging market strategy at Goldman Sachs, said late Tuesday, according to Bloomberg . Trivedi added that the yen is also a ""very good hedge"" against U.S. labor market weakness and tends to do best when U.S. real rates [inflation-adjusted yields] and U.S. equities fall together. While BTC is widely seen as a digital gold or haven asset by crypto market participants, the cryptocurrency has historically moved in tandem with technology stocks. In other words, tariffs-led risk-off on Wall Street could spill over into the crypto market. Additionally, the yen's strength could prompt the unwinding of risk-on bullish trades financed by inexpensive yen-denominated loans, contributing to overall risk aversion in financial markets. The crypto market experienced this in early August last year when the yen carry trade unravelled, leading to declines in both stocks and BTC. During that period, bitcoin plummeted from approximately $65K to $50K within a week. Goldman expects the Japanese yen to rise to the low 140s against the U.S. dollar this year. The USD/JPY pair traded at 149.77 at press time. The exchange rate is known to closely track the differential between yields on the 10-year U.S. and Japanese bonds. The latter recently dropped to its lowest since August 2022, offering yen-bullish cues.",Markets|Bitcoin|yen|Goldman Scahs|recession|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 07:26:33

Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and also Mutuum Finance (MUTM). These tokens offer anonymous, hype-driven presale gains and real-world DeFi utility, however Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is unique in attracting real-world DeFi utility with its structured presale. With Cardano (ADA) and DOGE toying with market sentiment and meme driven pumps, MUTM’s lending philosophy and embedded buy pressure lay out a concrete pathway to exponential returns. With Cardano (ADA) looking poised to break out and DOGE attracting interest from whales, phase 4 of MUTM’s presale, priced at $0.025, provides a 140% return at launch — a unique low-risk, high-reward opportunity before pent-up demand ticks prices up. Cardano (ADA): Out Of The Bull Flag Ready For Breakout Analysts discover potential 10X rally as Cardano (ADA) surges. A historically inverse head-and-shoulders pattern indicates that Cardano (ADA) could fly to between $2.90 and $7.10, if it maintains momentum. Whale activity is fueling that thesis, as deep-pocketed holders control $8.8 billion worth of Cardano (ADA). But recent sell-offs by them have caused dips in the price, highlighting Cardano (ADA) volatility. Interest waned with the Cardano (ADA) slump in March; however, searches for “Cardano price prediction” shot up 170% last week. Cardano’s (ADA) upside is indeed real despite being tethered to speculative trends and shaky whale behavior for investors. Dogecoin (DOGE): Whale Accumulation Amidst Meme Hype Dogecoin (DOGE) is enjoying a 42% bounce-off its $0.14 low, now at $0.20. Analysts say Dogecoin (DOGE) might push to $0.80—or other predictions even suggest $6—if it breaks through the $0.31 area of resistance. Wallets with 10M–100M Dogecoin (DOGE) tokens, known as whales, have amassed 200M Dogecoin (DOGE) coins in fortnight—spurring optimism. One major catalyst is the House of Doge initiative that locked 10M Dogecoin (DOGE) into a reserved wallet and issued an increase in the sentiment of the community. But Dogecoin (DOGE) dependence on hype and limited usability renders it a speculative play. In stark contrast, MUTM’s DeFi framework is such that tokens have engineering engineered gains not for hopes of gains, but for engineering gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Pre-Sale Success and 140% Exchange ROI Phase 4 of its presale is fast approaching a conclusion, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) guaranteed profits will be available to current buyers with the token starting at $0.025 and moving to $0.03 in the next stage – a 20% jump. With a listing price of $0.06 per Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at launch, phase 4 participants will enjoy a 140% profit. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project offers passive income through its lending platform and mtTokens, while a buy-and-distribute mechanism supports price appreciation over the long term. Completing a Certik audit has provided credibility before exchange listings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have 7,700 holders and $6M raised with demand accelerating. After the launch, estimates of its price place Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $1.50 — a 5,900% increase over its current price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) returns are baked into its tokenomics, not left to the whims of the market like Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE). Why Delay? The Clock Is Ticking Get Predictable Profit with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) As Speculative Upside is Potential with ADA and DOGE Phase 4 is not indefinite — every completed stage reduces the opportunity for 140% returns at launch. With Certik audits coming soon and exchange listings on the horizon, Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) path is obvious: community-driven growth backed by utility, not hype.

But what sparked this interest? According to Eric Trump himself, it wasn’t just market trends or technological curiosity, but a direct response to what he describes as an orchestrated campaign of financial censorship against his family. Eric Trump’s Crypto Adoption: A Response to ‘Financial Censorship’ During a recent interview with Fox Business, Eric Trump detailed the unprecedented challenges faced by the Trump family when numerous U.S. banks abruptly closed their accounts. He named prominent financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Capital One, TD Bank, and First Republic, painting a picture of a coordinated effort to ostracize his family from the traditional financial system. This, he asserted, was the pivotal moment that opened his eyes to the importance of cryptocurrency . “I never thought I’d be in crypto,” Eric Trump stated, highlighting the unexpected nature of his entry into the digital asset space. He framed the bank account closures as an “attack” on the Trump family, a move that forced him to reconsider the vulnerabilities of centralized finance and explore decentralized alternatives. This personal experience underscores a growing concern among many about the potential for financial censorship and the increasing appeal of cryptocurrencies as a hedge against such actions. Why Did Banks Close Trump Family Accounts? While Eric Trump attributes the account closures to political motivations, banks often cite various reasons for such decisions, including: Risk Management: Banks are heavily regulated and must manage risks associated with their clients. Politically exposed persons (PEPs) and their families often undergo enhanced scrutiny due to potential reputational and compliance risks. Regulatory Compliance: Banks must adhere to strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. If a client’s activities raise red flags or compliance concerns, banks may choose to de-risk by closing accounts. Reputational Risk: Maintaining accounts for high-profile individuals, especially those embroiled in controversy, can pose reputational risks for banks. Negative publicity or association can impact a bank’s brand and customer trust. Business Strategy: Banks periodically review their client portfolios and may decide to terminate relationships that no longer align with their business strategy or profitability goals. It’s important to note that banks operate in a complex regulatory environment and must make decisions based on a multitude of factors. While Eric Trump views the closures as targeted financial censorship , banks would likely argue they were acting within their rights and responsibilities to manage risk and comply with regulations. The Allure of Cryptocurrency: A Decentralized Alternative Eric Trump’s embrace of crypto highlights a key appeal of decentralized digital currencies – their potential to offer a financial system outside the control of traditional institutions. For individuals and entities concerned about censorship, de-platforming, or arbitrary financial restrictions, cryptocurrency importance as an alternative becomes increasingly apparent. Benefits of Cryptocurrency as an Alternative Financial System: Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, meaning no single entity controls them. This reduces the risk of censorship or unilateral control. Accessibility: Cryptocurrency transactions can be conducted globally, often without the need for traditional banking intermediaries, increasing financial inclusion. Transparency: Blockchain technology, which underpins most cryptocurrencies, provides a transparent and auditable record of transactions. Security: Cryptography secures cryptocurrency transactions, offering a robust level of security. Control: Users have greater control over their digital assets compared to traditional banking systems, where accounts can be frozen or restricted by third parties. The Future of Digital Finance and Eric Trump’s Role Eric Trump’s entry into crypto could be seen as a symbolic moment, reflecting a broader trend of individuals and institutions exploring digital finance future and alternative financial solutions. His high profile and public stance could potentially influence public perception and accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies, particularly among those who share concerns about centralized control and financial censorship . However, the cryptocurrency space is not without its challenges. Volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and security risks remain significant hurdles. For widespread mainstream adoption, addressing these challenges is crucial. Nevertheless, stories like Eric Trump’s, driven by real-world experiences of perceived financial exclusion, underscore the compelling value proposition of cryptocurrencies. Challenges and Considerations in Cryptocurrency Adoption: Challenge Description Volatility Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate dramatically, posing risks for investors.

The altcoins are slightly in the red, aside from CRO and EOS, as both have charted impressive gains once again. BTC Dominance on the Rise The primary cryptocurrency had a good run last week when its price shot up to $88,800 to mark a multi-week peak. However, it couldn’t penetrate that level and started to lose value gradually in the next few days. The situation worsened on Friday when BTC’s floor gave in and the asset dropped to $81,600. It managed to recover some ground during the weekend, but that was short-lived. The start of the current business week was also painful, with a price drop to a weekly low of $81,200. The bulls finally stepped up at this point and didn’t allow a further breakdown below $80,000. In fact, BTC started to gain traction and jumped beyond $85,000 for the first time since Friday. Interestingly, data from Bitstamp shows that bitcoin flash-crashed to $81,200, while the same cannot be found on other exchanges, like Binance. Nevertheless, BTC’s current price is just over $84,000, and its market cap stands tall at $1.670 trillion. The asset’s dominance over the alts is on the rise again by nearing 60%, which is more than 1.5% higher than the numbers from last week. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView CRO, EOS Shoot Up Most altcois have turned red on a daily scale after yesterday’s impressive gains. BNB, SOL, TON, LINK, DOE, ADA, and XRP are all with minor losses. SHIB has dropped the most from the larger-cap alts. In contrast, EOS and CRO have emerged as today’s top performers. EOS has jumped by double digits (20%) and trades above $0.8, while CRO is up by 7.5% and sits north of $0.105. The total crypto market cap has shed about $40 billion since yesterday and is down to $2.8 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Get ready to dive into the details of their newly approved, groundbreaking delegate incentive plan , a massive $113 million initiative designed to supercharge participation and reshape the future of crypto governance. This move is poised to empower underrepresented voices and inject fresh dynamism into the Uniswap ecosystem. Let’s explore how this ambitious plan could redefine decentralized decision-making and what it means for you. Unveiling the $113M Delegate Incentive Plan : A New Era for Uniswap Governance The heart of this news is the Uniswap DAO’s preliminary approval of a substantial treasury delegation program. Imagine a system where active community members are not just heard, but actively incentivized to shape the platform’s direction. This is precisely what the delegate incentive plan aims to achieve. With a potential allocation of up to 18 million UNI tokens, valued at approximately $113 million, this initiative is a clear signal of Uniswap’s commitment to robust and inclusive governance. Here’s a breakdown of what this ambitious plan entails: Massive Token Allocation: Up to 18 million UNI tokens earmarked for delegation. Significant Financial Backing: Approximately $113 million in value at current prices. Targeted Delegation: Aimed at 12 delegates to ensure focused and impactful participation. Individual Delegate Incentive: Potentially 1 million UNI per delegate, providing substantial motivation. Tiered Rewards: Extra tokens for “top-tier” delegates who demonstrate exceptional engagement and contribution. Enhancing Governance: The core goal is to strengthen Uniswap’s decentralized governance framework. This move follows the Uniswap Foundation’s recent approval of a $165.5 million funding initiative, showcasing a broader push towards bolstering the Uniswap ecosystem and its governance mechanisms. The preliminary vote for this delegate incentive plan saw a strong 60% approval, indicating significant community support, although nearly 30% abstained, suggesting room for further dialogue and consensus-building as the plan moves forward to an onchain vote for final confirmation. Why a Delegate Incentive Plan ? Addressing the Core of Crypto Governance Challenges Decentralized governance, while revolutionary in concept, often faces challenges in practice. One common hurdle is ensuring active and representative participation. Many token holders, even those deeply invested in a project, may lack the time, resources, or expertise to actively engage in governance processes. This can lead to lower voter turnout and potentially less diverse perspectives shaping the future of the protocol. Uniswap DAO’s delegate incentive plan directly tackles this challenge by: Boosting Participation: Incentives can motivate more individuals to become active delegates. Diversifying Representation: Encouraging participation from underrepresented segments of the community. Rewarding Active Contributors: Recognizing and rewarding those who dedicate time and effort to governance. Strengthening Decentralization: Distributing governance power more broadly and effectively. Improving Decision-Making: Potentially leading to more informed and well-rounded decisions through increased participation. Essentially, this plan is about making crypto governance more vibrant, inclusive, and effective within the Uniswap ecosystem. By incentivizing delegation, Uniswap aims to harness the collective intelligence and dedication of its community to guide its future. How Does the UNI Token Play a Role in This Incentive Program? The UNI token is the lifeblood of Uniswap’s governance. Holding UNI grants users voting rights within the DAO, allowing them to propose and vote on changes to the protocol. This delegate incentive plan leverages the UNI token as the primary mechanism for rewarding active governance participants. Here’s how the UNI token is central to the incentive structure: Incentive Currency: UNI tokens are the direct reward for delegates. Governance Power: Delegated UNI tokens increase the voting power of active delegates. Alignment of Interests: Incentivizing delegates with UNI aligns their interests with the long-term success of the Uniswap protocol. Value Accrual: A thriving governance system, fueled by incentivized delegates, can potentially enhance the value of the UNI token itself. By allocating a significant amount of UNI tokens to this program, Uniswap DAO is demonstrating a clear commitment to investing in its governance infrastructure and empowering its community to shape the protocol’s trajectory. This strategic use of the UNI token underscores its importance not just as a utility token, but as a key instrument in decentralized governance. What are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of This Crypto Governance Initiative? Like any ambitious initiative, the Uniswap DAO’s delegate incentive plan comes with both potential benefits and challenges. Understanding these aspects is crucial for assessing its long-term impact on crypto governance and the Uniswap ecosystem. Benefits Challenges Increased Participation in Governance More Diverse and Representative Decision-Making Enhanced Protocol Security and Resilience Greater Community Engagement and Ownership Potential for Faster Innovation and Adaptation Risk of Centralization if Delegation is Concentrated Potential for Sybil Attacks or Malicious Delegation Complexity in Defining “Top-Tier” Delegate Criteria Sustaining Long-Term Delegate Engagement Ensuring Fair and Equitable Distribution of Incentives Navigating these challenges effectively will be key to the success of the delegate incentive plan . Careful consideration of delegate selection criteria, robust security measures, and ongoing monitoring of governance dynamics will be essential to maximize the benefits and mitigate potential risks. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for DeFi and You? The Uniswap DAO’s delegate incentive plan is more than just internal protocol news; it offers valuable insights into the evolving landscape of DeFi and crypto governance as a whole. Here are some actionable takeaways: Governance is Evolving: Protocols are actively experimenting with incentive mechanisms to improve decentralized governance. Participation Matters: Your voice and participation in DAOs can directly shape the future of DeFi. UNI Token Utility is Growing: The UNI token’s role extends beyond trading; it’s a key to governance and influence within the Uniswap ecosystem. Delegation is Powerful: Even if you don’t have time to be a delegate yourself, delegating your tokens to active participants is a way to contribute. Stay Informed and Engaged: Keep track of governance proposals and discussions within DAOs you are invested in. This initiative from Uniswap DAO serves as a powerful example for other DeFi projects and DAOs looking to enhance their governance models. It highlights the growing recognition that active and incentivized community participation is crucial for the long-term health and sustainability of decentralized protocols. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a More Decentralized Future Uniswap DAO’s $113 million delegate incentive plan represents a bold and innovative approach to strengthening crypto governance . By directly incentivizing active participation, Uniswap is not just aiming to improve its own decision-making processes but also setting a potential precedent for the broader DeFi space. As the plan moves towards a final onchain vote, the crypto community will be watching closely to see how this ambitious initiative unfolds and the impact it has on the future of decentralized governance and the evolution of the UNI token ecosystem. This move underscores the dynamic and experimental nature of decentralized organizations as they strive to build more robust, inclusive, and truly decentralized systems.

Earlier this month, VanEck also submitted a registration for an Avalanche ETF in the state of Delaware.

The investment manager has established a trust to serve as a preparatory measure in the ETF registration process prior to the formal application to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The firm marked the first attempt to establish a Binance Coin (BNB) ETF specifically in the U.S. market. Other BNB-related products, such as the 21Shares Binance ETP, exist, but they are not U.S.-based. The 21Shares BNB exchange-traded product is also the only ETN that tracks the Binance Coin index. The asset manager registered the new product on Monday, called VanEck BNB ETF, under filing number 10148820. According to public records on the official Delaware state website, the ETF was also registered as a trust corporate service company. Source: Delaware state website . Registration for the VanEck BNB ETF in Delaware. The New York-based company acknowledged that the BNB ETF will track the price of Binance Coin, currently ranked as the fifth-largest virtual currency by market capitalization. The digital asset is currently exchanging hands at around $599.70 with a 5.27% drop in the last seven days. On-chain data also revealed that the trading volume for BNB Coin has surged by 42% to more than $2.12 billion as a result of VanEck’s move. VanEck registers other digital asset ETFs The firm’s recent registration makes BNB join Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and Avalanche as the fifth digital asset to have an independent ETF registration initiated by VanEck in Delaware. The firm, managing nearly $115 billion in client assets globally, debuted its Bitcoin and Ether ETFs last year after securing approval from the SEC. The asset investment manager filed for a Solana ETF in June 2024, making it the first Solana exchange-traded fund in the U.S. The firm had registered a trust company for its SOL fund in November 2021, when the asset changed hands at pandemic-era peak of $259. VacEck also applied for SEC approval last month to launch the first AVAX ETF. According to public records on the official Delaware state website, the document is registered under file number 10125689, and the agent registered on the form was revealed to be CSC Delaware Trust. “VanEck seems to be taking a ‘throw everything at the wall and see what sticks’ approach, which makes sense. Avalanche isn’t the most widely traded cryptocurrency, but being first to market with an ETF in a new category comes with potential upside and little downside.” ~ Sumit Roy, senior ETF analyst at etf.com. The firm noted that the AVAX ETF is structured as a Delaware statutory trust and will be managed under a trust agreement, with VanEck as the fund’s main sponsor. The investment company will now have to file an official S-1 form with the U.S. SEC for a spot AVAX ETF. The NASDAQ exchange also applied to the SEC on March 28 to list shares of an Avalanche ETF issued by crypto asset manager Grayscale. Grayscale’s AVAX fund 19b-4 form showed that the ETF would use Coinbase Custody as its custodian. Grayscale also offers spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and has applied to launch funds based on other digital assets including XRP, Solana and Dogecoin. The firm’s BTC fund manages nearly $17 billion, and ranks third among other Bitcoin funds from BlackRock and Fidelity. The surge in ETF applications comes after the success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds last year, and as crypto-based exchange traded products garnered roughly $44 billion worth of assets in 2024.

Interest is through the roof, and even usually slow-to-change traditional financial institutions seem to have finally admitted that they need to adopt crypto, at least partially, not to miss out on future possibilities. But scratch beneath the surface, and you’ll find the same old problems that have persisted in the industry since its inception threatening to derail everything: outdated security, hidden fees, and platform interfaces so confusing they seem designed to keep people out rather than welcome them in. It doesn’t take a high-level industry insider to see the pattern: the market gets hyped, money flows in, but the fundamental issues never get fixed. With Web3 no longer just industry jargon but on the cusp of becoming a digital reality pillar, crypto’s make-or-break moment isn’t that far away. Will the industry actually deliver on its revolutionary promise, or just remain a playground for insiders who already know the secret handshake? It all depends on the industry’s willingness to finally face and fix the problems that have prevented mass-scale adoption since the beginning. Giorgi Shonia Aims to Have Security Reimagined It shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that the CEO of the upcoming trading platform Nordom Exchange, puts a particularly high emphasis on the need to provide better security. Unlike most exchange leaders who come from finance or marketing backgrounds, Shonia began his digital career in cybersecurity before transitioning to development. Those curious to meet Giorgi Shonia and learn more about his path or hear more of his expertise in the field, can visit his website. What jumps out in industry discussions is Shonia’s take that most exchanges treat security as a feature rather than a foundation. Too many platforms bolt on security after the problems have already popped up, scrambling to patch holes after attacks instead of building solid systems from day one. Nordom’s team is trying to take the opposite route, utilizing cold storage, encryption ( instead of enticing people with marketing buzzwords), and outside security audits. But here’s the thing—all the tech solutions in the world wrapped up in a singular platform won’t matter without a fundamental shift in attitude at large within the field. The industry needs to start putting user protection ahead of launching shiny new features. Exchanges must come clean about their security measures (and risks) instead of hiding behind vague promises and refusing to acknowledge there are any dangers at all. After years of headline-grabbing hacks, trust is in short supply. Earning Trust: Importance of Education and Transparency Let’s be honest—crypto can be a minefield for newcomers. Most platforms act like everyone who clicks on was born understanding blockchain. There’s a huge knowledge gap and it drives away people who’re just trying to gauge the situation. These are the people who might’ve stuck around and helped the ecosystem grow—if only the industry were more welcoming. Nordom’s approach is to have the platform act as an educational hub along with providing a more user-friendly trading experience. New traders can learn as they go, including what the concept of crypto mining even is, how to earn free crypto rewards through various platform activities, how to identify scams, etc.—making the whole thing less intimidating for regular people who are curious but confused by crypto’s complexity. But education is just one piece. Have you ever tried to figure out exactly what fees you’re paying on most exchanges? Good luck with that. The charges are usually buried in fine print that nobody reads. Platforms serious about sticking around need to make their pricing crystal clear—no financial decoder ring required. The crypto industry needs to make important choices about how it intends to operate going forward. Its future depends not just on fancy tech but on whether platforms can create spaces where regular folks feel safe, informed, and valued. The outlook seems bright, but without exchanges tackling these core issues, all that potential will remain just that—potential.",Guest Post,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 07:43:40

Do you ever wonder what it would have been like to buy Dogwifhat when it was just starting? Imagine securing a bag at its initial low prices, only to see it skyrocket into mainstream attention. Those who recognized Dogwifhat’s potential in its infancy are now sitting on massive gains, while latecomers can only wish they had moved sooner. But here’s the good news: a new meme coin is stealing the spotlight, and the opportunity is unfolding right now. Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now, and those who act swiftly stand to reap enormous rewards. With its blazing presale momentum and lucrative staking rewards, missing this could be a costly mistake. Arctic Pablo Coin Staking: Earn Rewards While You Wait One of the most thrilling aspects of Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is its staking feature. Investors can stake their tokens and earn an impressive 66% APY even before the official launch. This means early adopters aren’t just holding their tokens—they’re actively growing their investment while waiting for the market debut. Staking is a game-changer, especially in the meme coin space, where most projects lack such robust earning opportunities. It’s a chance to multiply holdings without additional purchases, creating a dynamic way to build wealth even before Arctic Pablo Coin hits major exchanges. Arctic Pablo Coin is among the best new meme coins to join now, offering investors a unique opportunity to maximize their holdings through staking while anticipating future price surges. Dogwifhat’s Early Days: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Entry Point When Dogwifhat first launched, it was just another meme coin in a sea of emerging projects. Skeptics doubted its staying power, but those with foresight saw something special. In its early trading days, Dogwifhat was available for a fraction of its current value. Visionary investors who got in at the right time and held onto their tokens saw astronomical gains as the project gained traction and community support exploded. Fast forward to today, Dogwifhat has become a household name in the meme coin sector. The price surge rewarded early believers with life-changing profits, but what about those who missed out? Does another opportunity like this exist in today’s market? Absolutely. And it’s unfolding right now with Arctic Pablo Coin. The Clock is Ticking: Arctic Pablo Coin is Surging—Don’t Get Left Behind For those who regret missing Dogwifhat’s early days, Arctic Pablo Coin is among the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now.

42791874,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145388,1743580259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Update: SEC Gemini Lawsuit Stalled by 60-Day Delay – What Does It Mean?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-gemini-lawsuit-delay/,"In a dramatic turn of events in the crypto world, the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Gemini Trust has taken an unexpected pause. Just when things seemed to be heating up, the SEC has requested a 60-day delay from a New York federal court. This request, reported by Bloomberg, hints at potential behind-the-scenes negotiations and raises critical questions about the future of the SEC Gemini Lawsuit and its broader implications for crypto regulation. Let’s dive into what this delay means and what could be next in this high-stakes legal drama. Why the Sudden Gemini Trust Delay ? Exploring the SEC’s Motives The SEC’s request for a 60-day delay might seem like a simple procedural matter, but it’s loaded with potential meaning. The official reason cited is to explore potential resolutions to the lawsuit. But what could these resolutions be? Here are a few possibilities: Negotiated Settlement: The most likely scenario is that the SEC and Gemini are engaging in settlement talks. The SEC might be looking for Gemini to agree to certain terms, potentially involving fines, operational changes, or even admissions of wrongdoing (though this is less likely from Gemini’s side). Further Investigation: While less probable given the lawsuit is already underway, the delay could provide the SEC with more time to gather additional evidence or refine their legal strategy. This is less likely, but in complex cases, new information can always surface. Regulatory Reconsideration: The crypto regulatory landscape is constantly evolving. It’s possible, though less likely, that the SEC is re-evaluating its approach to crypto regulation in general, and this delay reflects a broader strategic pause. It’s crucial to remember that the SEC initially charged Gemini and Genesis (another crypto firm) in 2023 for allegedly selling unregistered securities through Gemini’s Earn program. This program, which offered users interest on their crypto holdings, is at the heart of the legal dispute. The SEC argues that Earn constituted an investment contract and therefore should have been registered as a security. The Core Issue: Unregistered Securities and the Gemini Earn Program To truly understand the significance of this delay, we need to revisit the crux of the lawsuit: the allegation of selling unregistered securities . Let’s break down what this means in the context of Gemini Earn: What are Securities? In simple terms, securities are financial instruments that represent ownership (like stocks) or debt (like bonds). Under U.S. law, securities offerings generally need to be registered with the SEC to protect investors by ensuring transparency and disclosure of risks. Why the SEC Says Gemini Earn is a Security: The SEC argues that Gemini Earn, despite dealing with cryptocurrencies, functions like a traditional investment contract. Here’s their reasoning: Investment of Money: Users deposited their crypto assets into the Earn program. Common Enterprise: Gemini pooled these assets and used them to generate yield, allegedly through lending to Genesis. Expectation of Profits: Users expected to earn interest on their deposited crypto. Profits Derived from the Efforts of Others: The profits (interest) were generated by Gemini and Genesis’s management of the pooled assets and lending activities, not directly by the users themselves. Because of these factors, the SEC believes Gemini Earn should have been registered as a security offering. Gemini, on the other hand, likely argues that Earn was not a security and that existing regulations were not clear enough to classify it as such. Impact on Crypto Regulation : A Precedent-Setting Case? The SEC Gemini Lawsuit is not just about Gemini; it has far-reaching implications for the entire crypto industry and the future of crypto regulation . Here’s why this case is so important: Clarity on Crypto Lending: The outcome will set a precedent for how crypto lending products are regulated in the U.S. If the SEC wins, it could mean stricter regulations for platforms offering interest-bearing crypto accounts. Broader Definition of Securities: The case could further clarify the SEC’s view on which crypto assets and activities fall under the definition of securities. This has been a major point of contention and uncertainty in the crypto space. Investor Protection vs. Innovation: The lawsuit highlights the ongoing tension between the SEC’s mandate to protect investors and the crypto industry’s desire for innovation and less stringent regulation. The resolution will likely reflect a balancing act between these two priorities. The Gemini Trust Delay might be a sign that both parties are feeling the weight of this case and are seeking a negotiated solution to avoid a potentially lengthy and costly court battle. However, it could also simply be a tactical pause before the legal proceedings continue. What’s Next? Possible Scenarios and Timelines Predicting the future in legal battles is always tricky, but here are a few possible scenarios following this 60-day delay in the Digital Asset Lawsuit : Scenario Likelihood Potential Outcome Timeline Settlement Agreement High Gemini agrees to certain terms (fines, operational changes) without admitting wrongdoing. Case is resolved. Within 60 days or shortly after. Continued Litigation Medium Settlement talks fail. Legal proceedings resume, potentially leading to a trial. Months to years. Partial Settlement Medium Gemini and SEC reach agreement on some issues but continue to litigate others. Potentially ongoing litigation with certain aspects resolved. Regulatory Shift Low Unlikely to be the sole driver, but broader regulatory changes could influence the case. Ongoing, but less directly tied to the 60-day delay. The next 60 days will be crucial. Industry observers will be keenly watching for any signals of progress in settlement talks or indications that the parties are preparing for a protracted legal fight. The crypto community is particularly interested in how this case will shape the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. and beyond. Key Takeaways: Navigating the Uncertainties This Gemini Trust Delay in the SEC Gemini Lawsuit serves as a stark reminder of the regulatory uncertainties still surrounding the cryptocurrency industry. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in this case and other regulatory actions impacting the crypto space. Regulatory clarity is essential for the industry’s long-term growth. Understand Regulatory Risks: For crypto businesses, it’s crucial to proactively assess and mitigate regulatory risks, particularly concerning securities laws. Seek legal counsel to ensure compliance. Advocate for Clear Rules: Engage in constructive dialogue with regulators and policymakers to advocate for clear and sensible rules that foster innovation while protecting investors. Investor Due Diligence: For crypto investors, understand the regulatory landscape and potential risks associated with different crypto products and platforms. The SEC Gemini Lawsuit is a landmark case that will have lasting consequences for the crypto industry. This 60-day delay introduces a new layer of intrigue and uncertainty, but also perhaps a glimmer of hope for a negotiated resolution. The crypto world waits with bated breath to see what unfolds.

Speaking on the subject, Hoskinson said that once the stablecoin and market structure bills are approved, leading technology firms such as Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook will include cryptocurrency wallets on their platforms, potentially reaching a combined user base of 3 billion people. Hoskinson highlighted two major bills currently being considered in the US Congress. The first, a stablecoin bill, is the most likely to pass in the next 30 to 90 days, and the second, a broader market structure bill, is also being considered. “After these two bills pass, Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook will say, ‘Hey, we are crypto people now,’” Hoskinson said, predicting that these companies will integrate digital asset wallets into their operating systems and applications. According to Hoskinson, tech giants will have the opportunity to reduce their reliance on traditional credit card payment processing systems by issuing their own stablecoins or partnering with existing stablecoin providers. This move could make payments more efficient and cost-effective by enabling fee-free transactions within their ecosystems. Related News: Watch Out: An Altcoin Listed on Major Exchanges Hit by a Massive Hack Attack “They will do this because they can now legally hold and use stablecoins,” he explained, adding: “They don’t like paying credit card transaction fees.” If these companies integrate crypto wallets, they could effectively become financial services providers, reshaping the industry with their vast capital and user reach, according to Hoskinson. Hoskinson believes this shift will lead to the creation of new financial products, including yield-generating opportunities built directly into their platforms. The potential impact of these regulatory developments extends far beyond individual crypto investors, Hoskinson noted. With tech giants controlling access to billions of users, a seamless transition to integrated crypto services could drive unprecedented adoption of digital assets: “When these two bills pass, the floodgates will open and 3 billion people will walk through that door.” *This is not investment advice.

XRP has been consolidating within the pattern shown below, characterized by two converging trend lines that suggest a buildup of momentum. Technical analysis from well-followed X user @DefendDark indicates that a breakout from this formation could propel XRP toward a short-term target of $6. The symmetrical triangle has been forming over recent weeks, with XRP’s price action tightening as it approaches the apex of the triangle. This setup, commonly observed in crypto markets, often precedes a sharp move — either upward or downward — depending on the direction of the breakout. Fibonacci retracement analysis further supports this outlook, identifying $2.04 as a key support level and $2.2 as a critical resistance. A break above $2.2 could confirm the bullish trend, potentially driving XRP toward the $5 to $8 range in the mid term, per @DarkDefend. The Elliott Wave framework forecasts price movements in five distinct “waves” based on repeating price patterns, called ""waves."" The five-wave pattern reflects growing optimism, while the three-wave correction shows profit-taking or pessimism. These waves are driven by collective investor psychology and can occur across different timeframes and are considered by followers to be a way to map market behavior. As such, a bullish technical outlook coincides with growing optimism in the crypto market, driven in part by regulatory developments. The U.S. House will hold a crypto hearing on April 9, termed “The Future of American Innovation and Digital Assets: Adjusting U.S. Securities Law for the Digital Age,” with plans to develop a regulatory framework for digital assets. That could boost eyes on tokens perceived to be close to the U.S. government, such as XRP and Cardano’s ADA, which were named as part of potential crypto stockpile by President Donald Trump earlier in January.",Markets|XRP|Technical Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 07:57:44

In the times when the markets continue to display some uncertainty ahead of Trump’s new tariffs, the second largest token is displaying strength. While the lower targets at $1500 continue to remain active, the possibilities of a bear trap also appear to be quite evident. Therefore, similar to 2018 and 2022, the ETH price is expected to print massive bullish candles after facing consecutive bearish candles. Ethereum Whales Wake Up In the past few days, the ETH price has been facing massive selling pressure that has kept the price consolidated between $2000 and $2100. A popular analyst, Ali , reported a massive selloff of over 760,000 ETH in the last two weeks. On the other hand, an Ethereum OG, or the early investor who acquired 5001 Ethereum in 2017 at a base price of $277, has sold all his holdings. As per the data from an on-chain reporting platform, Lookonchain , the OG had begun to sell his holdings a month ago, making a total profit of over $8.6 million with an initial investment of around $1.36 million. Interestingly, this whale did not sell during the ETH peak above $4800 that could have attracted over $23 million in profit. This indicates the whale may have either found a better offer or lost faith in the next price action. Will a Rise Above $2500 in ETH Price Kick off an Altseason? The Ethereum price is closely monitored as the token was printing massive bearish candles, squashing the possibility of a rebound back to $4000. Currently, the token is in such a position where defending $2000 has become an uphill battle. However, the token has been trying to revive a strong upswing at frequent intervals, but the weakness among the bulls prevented the token from securing levels above the gains. Meanwhile, the price has now triggered a rebound from a crucial support level; hence, the possibility of a rebound emerges. The weekly chart of ETH displays an attempt of the bulls to remain within a bullish pattern, above the important ascending trend line. Ever since the price surged above $800 in Q4 2020, the token has been trading along an ascending trend line. The price is trying to hold the support at present and if the rebound is validated, the bearish clouds may fade away for a while. However, rising above the local resistance at $2081 and securing $2100 may pave the way for the token to test the higher resistance. Besides, securing the levels above the 200-day EMA could validate a bullish continuation, and as the weekly RSI has formed a double bottom, an upswing is imminent. Therefore, the Ethereum (ETH) price is primed to maintain a healthy upswing but if it fails to hold, a drop to $1500 could be imminent. If this happens, the probability of an Altseason may fade away indefinitely.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 07:58:00

Despite this short-term gain, the asset remains down by over 21.2% from its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. The ongoing price fluctuations have left Bitcoin in a downward trend on a broader time scale, with investors and analysts closely watching for signs of a rally. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Downtrend Continue? This Metric Suggests Yes Path To $150k: Short-Term Holders’ Changing Behavior Despite the recent dip, data from CryptoQuant provides interesting insights into Bitcoin’s market dynamics. According to one of CryptoQuant’s contributors, Onchained, the behavior of short-term holders is a key factor to observe in the current market. Onchained’s analysis suggests that short-term holders, defined as those who have held Bitcoin for between one and three months, are no longer panicking and selling at a loss as they did in previous market cycles. The analysis reveals a slowdown in the selling pressure from this group, suggesting a shift in sentiment. Onchained’s report highlights the importance of the Short-Term Holder Net Realized PNL to Exchanges (CEXs) metric. This metric helps determine the selling pressure on Bitcoin, showing who is selling, whether they’re selling at a profit or loss, and the overall intensity of the market’s movement. The data indicates that while short-term holders are selling, the realized losses have been relatively low compared to unrealized losses. This suggests that these holders, despite being in the red, are opting to hold their positions rather than panic sell. Onchained further notes that this reduction in selling pressure could indicate the formation of a market bottom. Historically, when realized losses from short-term holders have been low and selling pressure has diminished, it has marked the end of a downward trend and the beginning of a recovery phase. With 28% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply in the hands of short-term holders, if these coins transition into long-term holders, it could significantly contribute to Bitcoin’s price surge beyond $150,000. Related Reading: Saylor’s Strategy Adds $1.9 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin To Growing Portfolio Decreasing Selling Pressure and What It Means for Bitcoin’s Future Another CryptoQuant analyst, CryptoOnchain, has pointed out that the selling pressure from short-term holders is indeed decreasing, as reflected in both the Short-Term SOPR chart and the UTXO Age Band for holders between one to three months. The data shows a decrease in Bitcoin being moved by this group, suggesting that short-term investors are holding off on making further sales. This aligns with Onchained’s view that a reduction in short-term selling pressure could signal a market bottom.

Terrifying Crypto Analysis Emerges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-market-low-crypto-analysis/,"Is the cryptocurrency world bracing for another significant dip? Whispers of a potential Bitcoin market low are circulating again, fueled by a recent analysis that draws parallels to past market downturns. For those watching the volatile crypto markets with bated breath, this news could be a critical signal. Let’s dive into the details of this analysis and understand what it could mean for your Bitcoin holdings. Is Bitcoin Really Nearing a Market Low? Decoding the Crypto Analysis According to a recent post by crypto analyst Bilal Huseynov on CryptoQuant, a historical pattern might be repeating itself, suggesting that Bitcoin market low could be on the horizon. Huseynov points to the relationship between two key on-chain metrics: Realized Cap and Thermo Cap. This isn’t just speculative chatter; it’s based on observable data and historical market behavior. But what exactly are these metrics, and why are they causing a stir? Unpacking Realized Cap and Thermo Cap: Essential Crypto Analysis Tools To understand the analyst’s perspective on the potential Bitcoin market low , we need to grasp the concepts of Realized Cap and Thermo Cap. Think of them as unique lenses through which we can view the Bitcoin network’s health and investor sentiment. Realized Cap: Imagine tracking the price of every Bitcoin the last time it moved between wallets. Realized Cap is essentially the sum of all these prices. It’s a measure of the aggregate value investors paid for their Bitcoin holdings, providing a more nuanced view of the market’s capitalization than just multiplying the current price by the total supply. It reflects the ‘realized’ value locked into Bitcoin by investors. Thermo Cap: This metric represents the total security spend on the Bitcoin network since its inception. In simpler terms, it’s the cumulative sum of all block rewards and transaction fees paid to miners. Thermo Cap can be seen as the total capital injected into the Bitcoin ecosystem through mining activities. It represents the ‘thermodynamic’ energy expended to secure the network. The analyst’s observation hinges on the relationship between these two caps. Historically, significant market events have occurred when these metrics interact in specific ways. Let’s explore the concerning pattern highlighted in this crypto analysis . The Terrifying ‘Death Cross’ and BTC Price Prediction: Echoes of the $16,000 Low? Huseynov’s crypto analysis highlights a concerning trend: the Realized Cap is currently nearing the Thermo Cap. This proximity itself isn’t necessarily alarming, but the potential outcome is. He suggests that if the Realized Cap were to fall *below* the Thermo Cap – a scenario often referred to as a ‘death cross’ in this context – it could trigger a significant price correction, potentially pushing Bitcoin towards a Bitcoin market low . Why is this ‘death cross’ so significant for BTC price prediction ? Historical Precedent: The analyst points to a past instance when the Realized Cap dipped below the Thermo Cap. This event coincided with Bitcoin’s price plummeting to $16,000. This historical echo raises concerns that a similar pattern could lead to a similar price drop. Market Sentiment Indicator: When Realized Cap falls below Thermo Cap, it could suggest that the market’s perceived value (Realized Cap) is lower than the total investment in securing the network (Thermo Cap). This imbalance can reflect weakened investor confidence and increased selling pressure. Potential Price Target: While not explicitly stated as a definitive prediction, Huseynov’s analysis implies that if the ‘death cross’ materializes, we could see a substantial price decrease. The mention of the $16,000 low as a historical reference point is particularly noteworthy, even if the analyst tentatively mentions a higher figure of $75,000 in the original content (which seems to be a typo and likely should be much lower given the context of a market low and the $16,000 reference). Is History Repeating Itself? Lessons from Previous Bitcoin Market Lows The analyst’s comparison to the $16,000 Bitcoin market low is crucial. It forces us to consider whether market cycles and on-chain indicators are indeed cyclical. If history is any guide, understanding past market bottoms can provide valuable insights. Let’s briefly revisit the circumstances surrounding the previous instance when Realized Cap fell below Thermo Cap: Market Conditions: The previous occurrence likely coincided with a bear market phase, characterized by prolonged price declines and negative market sentiment. It’s important to assess whether current market conditions bear similarities to that period. External Factors: Macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and significant industry events can all influence Bitcoin’s price. Analyzing the external landscape alongside on-chain metrics is essential for a comprehensive crypto analysis . Investor Behavior: Understanding how investors reacted during past market lows can offer clues about potential future behavior. Are long-term holders remaining steadfast, or are we seeing signs of capitulation? While historical patterns can be informative, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is dynamic and evolving. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. However, these patterns do provide valuable context for navigating the current market. Navigating the Potential Bitcoin Market Low: Actionable Insights So, what should you do with this information? Is it time to panic sell, or is there an opportunity amidst the potential Bitcoin market low ? Here are some actionable insights based on this crypto analysis : Stay Informed: Continuously monitor on-chain metrics like Realized Cap and Thermo Cap, alongside traditional market indicators. Platforms like CryptoQuant and others provide real-time data and analytical tools. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. Diversification and proper risk management strategies are paramount. Consider DCA: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) can be a prudent strategy during market downturns. By investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, you can average out your entry price and potentially benefit from price rebounds. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that Bitcoin has historically recovered from significant price drops. If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, a market downturn could present a buying opportunity. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re unsure how to interpret this analysis or manage your crypto portfolio, consult with a qualified financial advisor. Conclusion: Brace for Volatility, But Stay Informed The crypto analysis suggesting a potential Bitcoin market low based on the Realized Cap and Thermo Cap pattern is a noteworthy development. While it doesn’t guarantee a price crash, it serves as a terrifying reminder of the market’s inherent volatility and cyclical nature. Staying informed, understanding key on-chain metrics, and managing risk are crucial for navigating these uncertain times. Whether this analysis proves accurate remains to be seen, but it underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. Keep a close watch on market movements and be prepared for potential price swings.

In findings published on X on April 1, onchain analytics firm Glassnode revealed that $110,000 was not high enough to make many hodlers sell. Glassnode: 2020 Bitcoin buyers “still holding” Bitcoiners who entered the market between three and five years ago have retained their holdings despite significant BTC price upside. According to Glassnode, this investor cohort, with a cost basis from anywhere between the 2020 lows of $3,600 and the 2021 highs of $69,000, is still hodling. “Although the share of wealth held by investors who bought $BTC 3–5 years ago has declined by 3 percentage points since its November 2024 peak, it remains at historically elevated levels,” it reports. “This suggests that the majority of investors who entered between 2020 and 2022 are still holding.” Bitcoin Realized Cap HODL Waves data. Source: Glassnode An accompanying chart shows data from the Realized Cap HODL Waves metric, which splits the BTC supply into sections based on when each coin last moved onchain. Using this, Glassnode is able to draw a distinction between the 2020-22 buyers and those who came immediately before them. “In contrast, over two-thirds of those who had bought $BTC 5–7 years ago exited their positions by the December 2024 peak,” it reveals, reflecting their lower cost basis. Speculators stay cool at BTC price highs As Cointelegraph reported , more recent buyers, who form the more speculative investor cohort known as short-term holders (STHs), have proven much more sensitive to recent BTC price volatility. Related: Bitcoin sellers 'dry up' as weekly exchange inflows near 2-year low Episodes of panic selling have occurred throughout the past six months as BTC/USD hit new record highs and then fell by up to 30% . Continuing, Glassnode argued that current STH participation does not suggest a speculative frenzy — something common to previous BTC price cycle tops. “Short-Term Holders currently hold around 40% of Bitcoin's network wealth, after peaking near 50% earlier in 2025,” it commented alongside Realized Cap HODL Waves data on March 31. “This remains significantly below prior cycle tops, where new investor wealth peaked at 70–90%, suggesting a more tempered and distributed bull market so far.” Bitcoin Realized Cap HODL Waves.

The sale, completed on Apr. 1, 2025, raised $1.48 billion after fees, according to the company’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. GameStop was initially aiming to raise $1.3 billion amid plans to add Bitcoin to its list of treasury assets. The sale surpassed expectations, with an extra $200 million in notes sold. The company stated the funds will be used for general corporate purposes, including Bitcoin purchases. GameStop’s decision to invest in Bitcoin is part of a larger trend whereby publicly traded companies are diversifying their balance sheets by holding the most popular cryptocurrency. Similar to Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which holds the largest Bitcoin treasury, GameStop has adopted the use of convertible senior notes to fund Bitcoin purchases. Strategy currently holds more than 500,000 Bitcoin, which is valued at over $45 billion.

By including Bitcoin in its holdings, GameStop hopes to improve its financial position and expand beyond its primary retail business. However, concerns have been raised about this new direction.

In a new CNBC interview, Lee says markets are “really oversold” currently following a correction that has come amid fears over US tariffs. According to the Fundstrat co-founder, investors are currently facing uncertainty, but there will be clarity after April 2nd that could relieve the selling pressure. “And this week, I think into April 2nd, investors have three things on their minds. One is, they just don’t know what the tariffs look like. They don’t know if it’s going to damage the economy. And I think, third, many are just a little terrified of the policies of the White House. But post-Wednesday, I think markets are going to have some visibility. That allows us to take some of the selling pressure off. So yes, I think it’s possible that instead of us breaking down here and seeing markets under further pressure, we actually got the right pieces for a bottom.” According to Lee, America’s economy is “going to come out okay” after the imposition of the proposed tariffs by the US administration scheduled for April 2nd, a day that President Donald Trump has dubbed “Liberation Day.” “Brexit’s [the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union] an example, you know. Brexit happened and the UK economy emerged okay. It didn’t have a huge recession and the stock market did okay.

The world of cryptocurrency payments just got a whole lot more exciting. In a groundbreaking move that’s set to redefine online shopping in the Lion City, Crypto.com, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has joined forces with tech giant Sony Electronics to bring crypto payments to Sony’s online store for Singaporean users. This partnership, announced via a buzzworthy post on X (formerly Twitter), marks a significant step forward for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption and offers a seamless way for Singaporean crypto enthusiasts to spend their digital assets on cutting-edge electronics. Why is Crypto Payment a Revolutionary Leap for Online Shopping in Singapore? Imagine buying that sleek new Sony Bravia TV or those noise-canceling headphones you’ve been eyeing, and paying for it all with your favorite cryptocurrency. Sounds futuristic, right? Well, for Singaporean users, this future is now a reality thanks to the collaboration between Crypto.com and Sony. But why is this such a big deal? Let’s break down the electrifying benefits of embracing crypto payments for online shopping: Unlocking Your Crypto Wealth: For years, many crypto holders have sought practical ways to use their digital assets beyond trading and investment. This partnership provides a tangible avenue to utilize cryptocurrency for everyday purchases, directly converting your crypto holdings into real-world goods. Seamless and Speedy Transactions: Crypto.com Pay is known for its efficiency and speed. Say goodbye to lengthy bank transfers or credit card processing times. Crypto transactions are typically faster, offering a smoother checkout experience on the Sony online store. Lower Transaction Fees (Potentially): Depending on the cryptocurrency used and network conditions, crypto transactions can sometimes incur lower fees compared to traditional payment methods, especially for international transactions. This could translate to savings for savvy shoppers. Enhanced Privacy and Security: Cryptocurrency transactions offer a layer of privacy, as they don’t require sharing sensitive banking details with the merchant. Furthermore, blockchain technology underpins crypto, providing robust security for transactions. Expanding Cryptocurrency Adoption in Singapore: This move by Sony, a globally recognized brand, sends a powerful message about the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate form of payment. It encourages wider cryptocurrency adoption within Singapore and potentially beyond. Sony Singapore Embraces the Future of Finance: What’s in it for You? Sony’s decision to integrate Crypto.com Pay is more than just a trendy move; it’s a strategic alignment with the evolving financial landscape. By embracing cryptocurrency adoption , Sony is: Catering to a Growing Market Segment: A significant and increasing number of Singaporeans are involved in the cryptocurrency space. By accepting crypto payments, Sony taps into this tech-savvy demographic and caters to their preferred payment methods. Positioning Themselves as Innovation Leaders: In a competitive market, being at the forefront of technological adoption is crucial. Sony is solidifying its image as a forward-thinking brand that embraces innovation and adapts to changing consumer preferences. Expanding Payment Options and Customer Convenience: Offering diverse payment methods enhances customer convenience and accessibility. Crypto.com Pay adds another valuable option for customers, making the purchasing process more flexible. Potentially Attracting International Customers: While initially for Singapore users, this integration could pave the way for wider crypto payment adoption across Sony’s global online stores in the future, attracting a broader international customer base. How Can You Dive into Crypto Payments on Sony’s Online Store with Crypto.com Pay? Ready to experience the future of online shopping? Using Crypto.com Pay at Sony’s online store is designed to be user-friendly. Here’s a simplified guide to get you started: Ensure You Have a Crypto.com Account and App: If you’re not already a Crypto.com user, you’ll need to sign up and download the Crypto.com app. This is your gateway to managing your cryptocurrency and utilizing Crypto.com Pay . Fund Your Crypto.com Wallet: You’ll need cryptocurrency in your Crypto.com wallet to make payments. You can deposit crypto from other wallets or purchase crypto directly within the Crypto.com app. Shop on Sony Singapore’s Online Store: Browse Sony’s online store and add your desired products to your cart, just like any other online shopping experience.

Once the payment is confirmed via Crypto.com Pay , your order is placed, and you’re one step closer to enjoying your new Sony products purchased with cryptocurrency! Navigating the Horizon: Are There Any Bumps on the Crypto Payment Road? While the integration of crypto payments is undeniably exciting, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Challenge Consideration Cryptocurrency Volatility: The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate. The price of the crypto you use to pay might change between the time you add items to your cart and complete the transaction. However, for everyday purchases, these fluctuations are often minimal and short-lived. Limited Cryptocurrency Options (Initially): It’s possible that initially, only certain cryptocurrencies will be supported via Crypto.com Pay on the Sony store. Users might need to use specific cryptocurrencies for transactions. It’s advisable to check which cryptocurrencies are accepted at the time of purchase. User Adoption and Education: While cryptocurrency adoption is growing, not everyone is familiar with using crypto for payments. Education and clear instructions from both Crypto.com and Sony will be crucial to ensure smooth user adoption and address any initial hesitancy. Regulatory Landscape: Cryptocurrency regulations are still evolving globally. Businesses need to navigate the regulatory landscape to ensure compliance and provide secure and legitimate crypto payment options. Despite these potential challenges, the overall outlook for crypto payments in e-commerce, especially in digitally-forward Singapore, is incredibly promising.

Details",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-faces-short-term-pullback-against-ethereum-a-recovery-looms-details/,"CrediBull Crypto (@CredibleCrypto), a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, has provided an updated outlook on the XRP/ETH trading pair, waiting for a temporary correction before further upward movement. After accurately predicting a 250% rally for XRP against Ethereum late last year, the analyst now expects a pullback in the short to mid-term. After nailing the the 250+% rally on $XRP /$ETH, my last update stated: ""Since we are now at range highs after a pretty massive move, it's possible we get a pullback soon. If we do, nothing to be concerned about."" We have since printed multiple weekly bearish divs on the pairing… https://t.co/kV5Ty4ZMdB pic.twitter.com/VjrvAj1IFw — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) March 31, 2025 Short-Term Pullback Expected for XRP/ETH In early March, CrediBull Crypto noted that the trading pair had reclaimed and retested a 4-year-long range, reaching a level not seen since 2021 and setting the stage for a significant rally. The asset accomplished this feat around the same time as the dismissal of the Ripple lawsuit , but its progress has stalled. CrediBull Crypto has observed multiple bearish divergences on the chart, signaling a potential correction. In his update from early March, he acknowledged that the digital asset had reached range highs following a substantial rally and stated that it could experience a pullback against ETH soon. XRP Expected to Decline While Ethereum Gains Strength The analyst also highlighted the relationship between XRP and Ethereum’s broader market positioning. He noted that XRP is likely to “tag range lows at $1.60-$1.80” while Ethereum remains in a massive higher timeframe demand zone. This suggests that ETH may perform better in the short term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The accompanying chart provided by CrediBull Crypto outlines a projected price movement in which XRP/ETH corrects further before resuming its upward trend. The expected decline would allow the market to reset before XRP continues its next major impulse move. Long-Term Bullish Outlook Remains Intact Despite the anticipated pullback, CrediBull Crypto remains optimistic about XRP’s long-term trajectory. The correction is viewed as a natural phase within a broader bullish cycle, with further upside expected once the market stabilizes. Commenting on the upcoming decline, he stated, “If we do, nothing to be concerned about,” reinforcing confidence in the digital asset’s future performance. While Ethereum is expected to see stronger short-term momentum, the long-term outlook for XRP remains positive, with a potential continuation of its upward trend once the correction phase concludes. One important factor that could aid XRP’s recovery is the recent market trend of investors dumping ETH for the digital asset. Another well-respected analyst recently drew attention to this phenomenon as the massive outflow caused ETH to fall below a crucial resistance level, and more investors dump the asset, it could fall further, giving XRP space for a swift recovery.

On Wednesday, April 2, burn statistics signaled that over 115 million coins were removed from the circulating supply, whereas transactions on the Layer 2 blockchain scaled new heights by topping 1 billion. In response, crypto market participants are now eyeing a highly bullish future for one of the most renowned dog-themed meme tokens amid bolstered market dynamics. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Soars Over 12,000%, Supply Takes A Blow Data from the official tracker Shibburn indicated that the SHIB burn rate surged 12,278.89% in the past 24 hours. Per the data, this massive surge rode the back of 115.89 million tokens removed from the supply in just a day. Source: Shibburn, X Notably, the burn mechanism permanently reduces the circulating supply by transferring tokens to a null address. As a response, traders and investors weigh bullishness on the asset’s future prospects by considering the law of supply and demand. With today’s massive burn saga, the total number of coins killed to date reached 410.72 trillion SHIB. Meanwhile, 584.35 trillion tokens still remain in circulation. Further, it’s worth mentioning that the wallet address “0xc439514852e132c” single-handedly burnt 92.64 million tokens, aiding the surge. The impact of the constant Shiba Inu burns has kept investors hopeful about a price rally ahead. On the other hand, the coin’s layer 2 blockchain, Shibarium, is making monumental strides. Shibarium Transaction Volume Hits 1B SHIB’s marketing lead Lucie further revealed on X that the transaction volume on the Layer 2 blockchain has crossed the 1 billion mark. This chronicle has added to the optimistic buzz orbiting the crypto as it underscores its network’s rising popularity. Soon after its launch in August 2023, the L2 network gained significant traction with its vast offerings. Ranging from seamless transactions and gaming opportunities to utilities with tokens such as TREAT, LEASH, and BONE, the L2 network offers users top-notch services in the Web3 space. The rising transactions add to bullish market sentiments, accompanying the Shiba Inu burn rate upswing. Is SHIB Price Gearing Up For A Rally? Despite the bullish advancements, SHIB price traded down nearly 4% today, resting at $0.00001224. The meme coin hit a low and a peak of $0.00001214 and $0.00001312 in the past 24 hours. Besides, the weekly chart also indicated a 20% crash in value. This bearish action has kept investors cautious over future aspects despite the Shiba Inu burn surge and Shibarium advancement. Source: Nebraskangooner, X Simultaneously, a renowned crypto market trader going by the name Nebraskangooner revealed that SHIB continues to reject resistance just like other altcoins. Crypto market participants continue to thoroughly monitor the token, given that some market stats indicate a bullish stance whilst the price wanes. Also, CoinGape reported that the coin’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, shared a cryptic location update recently.

Crypto fund founder slams BTC as ‘out-of-date’,https://finbold.com/is-bitcoin-dead-crypto-fund-founder-slams-btc-as-out-of-date/,"As Bitcoin ( BTC ) attempted yet another rally towards $85,000 on April 1, Justin Bons, the founder and CIO of Cyber Capital, took to X to bash the world’s premier cryptocurrency . Specifically, Bons argued that BTC is, in 2025, a mere outdated dinosaur that, while being a successful experiment, is no longer in a position to disrupt the world of finance in any way, shape, or form. The Cyber Capital founder highlighted Bitcoin’s lack of ability to process numerous transitions per second, describing them as severely lagging behind other blockchains , and warned the flaw could easily prove catastrophic for investors and mining companies . He also warned that Bitcoin’s security has been collapsing in recent years, thus posing a danger to the entire ecosystem. He pointed toward cryptocurrency’s governance as the main culprit for its failures. BTC is a dinosaur: The tech is ridiculously out-of-date! At an embarrassing max 7 Transaction-Per-Second, it is in a position to disrupt nothing. BTC’s collapsing security kill scarcity guarantees, putting users in danger! From utility to economics, BTC is a failure. Is Bitcoin an existential threat to other crypto? Indeed, Bons opined that ‘BTC has been captured by a relatively small group.’ However, the founder of Cyber Capital also highlighted that the problem is not the fault of traders and enthusiasts but the issue with the blockchain’s design. Lastly, Justin Bons concluded that the world’s premier cryptocurrency has become a ‘game’ he is refusing to play and warned that Bitcoin has become an existential threat to other digital assets. Simultaneously, he urged the community to stop ‘paying lip service to such a deeply flawed network,’ explaining in no uncertain terms he deems BTC to be running on technology that is ‘ridiculously out-of-date.‘ Are crypto traders abandoning Bitcoin? The argument that Bitcoin is severely outdated by 2025 is nothing new, and the community, as well as the industry’s institutional actors, have been working on solutions such as layer two networks. Thus far, the criticism has hardly impacted BTC’s dominance, though some factors indicate traders are losing confidence. For example, the number of active Bitcoin addresses at the beginning of March of the current year was akin to the numbers seen in 2018 and far below the 2021 highs, according to the data Finbold retrieved from Glassnode on April 2. Bitcoin price and active addresses chart. Source: Glassnode The situation is all the more stark given that, even with the 2025 turbulence and the threat that the bull cycle will suffer an early end due to external pressure, Bitcoin’s price is – at $84,648 – higher than it was at any point prior to the November 2024 rally.

A bearish head-and-shoulders pattern could pull its value to $1.50 although bullish predictions have suggested reclaiming $3 could set a rally toward $15. Yet, uncertainty looms. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) erupts in its fourth presale stage, accumulating 7,700 holders and raising $6 million. As phase four tokens go for $0.025 — only a 20% increase at $0.03 away in the next phase — investors are directing their gaze. So the big question is, how is a presale token putting a top-10 cryptocurrency in the dust? XRP’s Current Position Ripple (XRP) now meets a crucial inflection point. The head-and-shoulders pattern outlined by analysts such as Ali Martinez indicates a possible 32% decline to $1.50 if support at $2 gives out. Even Peter Brandt’s bearish $1.07 target only heightens these fears compared to CryptoELITES’ bullish $15 prediction. Such a divide is indicative of XRP’s dependence on speculative heat rather than real utility. The lack of immediate use cases other than cross-border transactions also craters confidence. A breakout above 3 dollars could dismiss bearish opinions, before the way is not free of volatility. For risk-averse participants, XRP’s prevailing conditions create more anxiety than comfort. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) On the Rise Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes to the rescue of speculative market disturbances with efficient and managed growth. Phase four of its presale is currently underway, with tokens priced at $0.025, before a planned increase to $0.03. Early buyers guarantee (at its $0.06 exchange listing) 140% return — a figure based on publicly available tokenomics. Excluding launch, analysts forecast a moonshot to $3.50 in 2025, equivalent to a 13,900% increase from phase 1. Demand is driven by the protocol’s lending model. Users deposit assets like ETH or DAI and receive mtTokens, which bear interest and grow in value over time. A buy & distribute system takes the revenue of the platform and uses it to buy back MUTM, redistributing the tokens to the stakers, and creating a continued upward pressure on the price. Couple this with the options of overcollateralized lending and peer-to-peer lending. Security Drives Mutuum Finance (MUTM)— When it comes to Defi, security is pretty important, and Mutuum Finance recognized the need for an audit, on 1st October 2023, Mutuum Finance underwent a Certik audit to ensure the integrity of the smart contract. Results will be released shortly afterwards through official channels, further ensuring the investors’ trust. The quick progression of the presale (fourth phase is almost full) proves urgency! The trade off of waiting would be not catching it at the $0.025 price point before a potential 20% increase. Changing Tastes in a Tumultuous Market While XRP currently is bound to emotional currents and legal tides, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has quantifiable progress. The presale’s $6 million pull and 7.7k holder base are a testament to grass-roots confidence lacking in larger, staid projects. As phase four fills rapidly, the opportunity for pre-listing profits shrinks. Combining DeFi ingenuity with measured expansion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a lucid path from presale to post-launch ease of mind. XRP trading, get ready for the rollercoaster of your life MUTM investors suppress interest rate volatility and lock in perfect rates In the uncertain crypto market of 2025, predictability is often more powerful than hype. Lock Up A Position While Phase Four Is Open In today’s speculative climate, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) strikes a balance between risk and reward when rarely done. Pending Certik audit completion adds another credibility aspect, and tiered presale structure ensures those first in will net the biggest profits. As phase four approaches with its 20% price rise, delay can cost huge gains. MUTM is a stable alternative for users who want to stay away from volatile assets like XRP. Act now — before the next surge.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) as well as other altcoins have likely already priced in a lot of the U.S. recession fears, but there’s still a chance for some more downside if the recession actually happens. In a recent research report , analysts at crypto management firm Bitwise outlined that Bitcoin’s performance during past recessions has shown mixed results. For instance, during the 2020 Covid recession, Bitcoin sold off by over 50% but still ended the year up more than 300%.

Based on this case, the analysts say it is “quite likely that Bitcoin is likely going to stay under pressure if equity downside continues.” So far, Bitcoin has already experienced a drawdown of about 27% from its peak, suggesting most of the recession fears are reflected in the price. “The key takeaway here is that U.S. recession fears are already being priced into bitcoin and other cryptoassets as we speak but there might still be a little bit more downside left if a U.S. recession actually materialises.” Bitwise Yet, the analysts also see signs of “peak uncertainty,” noting that U.S. economic policy uncertainty is “as high as during Covid” and that “Google search trends for the word ‘recession’ also as high as during Covid.” As analysts at QCP Capital noted earlier in a Telegram post , markets are now focused on President Donald Trump’s upcoming “Liberation Day” announcement on April 2, where he is expected to unveil new reciprocal tariffs. The analysts pointed out that with consumer confidence at a 12-year low and equities already under pressure from a 4-5% weekly drawdown, aggressive trade policies could deepen recession fears and weigh further on risk assets, including Bitcoin.

Several community members shared theories for the incident, speculating that recent adjustments in the exchange’s position limits could be responsible. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin (BTC) Poised For A Q2 Recovery? Analyst Points To 2017 Similarities Altcoins See Q2 Opening Crash On Binance Multiple altcoins saw a peculiar start to Q2 after their price tanked on Binance on Tuesday morning. The crypto community raised the alarm after Solana-based memecoin and AI Agent token Act I: The AI Prophecy (ACT) plunged around 50% in less than an hour. The cryptocurrency, which once had a market capitalization of $722 million, has moved sideways for most of March, hovering between the $0.18-$0.19 price range until today. In 30 minutes, ACT crashed from the $0.189 mark to the $0.087 level, registering a 53% fall. Similarly, the DEXE, KAVA, DF, HIPPO, BANANAS31, LUMIA, TST, and QUICK tokens also recorded a sudden price drop, losing between 10% and 35% of their value in an hour. ACT’s team acknowledged the incident, stating, “Dear ACT community, we want to assure you that we’re fully aware of the current situation. Our team is actively investigating and working collaboratively with all relevant parties to address this matter.” The post also noted they had begun developing a response plan alongside their trusted partners. Analyst Altcoin Sherpa suggested that a price bounce for ACT seems likely but noted that “ppl might realize that they don’t really want to hold this coin and view this as a forced rebalance event. Nobody buying. Nobody selling.” No April Fool’s Joke As Binance posted about a different April Fool’s joke, investors started to speculate what caused the sudden bleeding, with some joking that the prank had gone too far. The crypto community guessed that Wintermute was responsible for the Altcoin massacre, as it reportedly liquidated several of its positions today. Nonetheless, the trading firm’s CEO, Evgeny Gaevoy, denied the rumors, stating, “Not us fwiw, but also curious about that postmortem.” Meanwhile, Lookonchain suggested that Binance’s recent update of its leverage and margin tiers on several altcoins, including ACT, could have been the reason for the token crash. Six hours later, Binance Customer Support replied to Wu Blockchain’s report, revealing that the reason for the dump was that three VIP users cross-sold tokens worth 514,000 USDT in the spot market and a non-VIP user transferred a large amount of ACT from other platforms and sold 540,000 USDT worth of the token in a short period. As a result, the cryptocurrency’s price dropped, which led some users to close their futures contracts, triggering the decline of other altcoins. The crypto exchange pointed out that they recently took “the initiative to take preventive measures to adjust leverage multiples downward.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Calls Dogecoin Chart A ‘Beauty’ As Key Indicators Align “Binance Contracts has recently issued consecutive adjustment announcements for the ACTUSDT perpetual contract, during which there was no market movement and no active reduction of any user’s position,” the post detailed.

Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) 2025 price rally may be boosted by the US Federal Reserve pivoting to quantitative easing (QE) , when the Fed buys bonds and pumps money into the economy to lower interest rates and encourage spending during difficult financial conditions. “Bitcoin trades solely based on the market expectation for the future supply of fiat,” according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer of Maelstrom. Hayes wrote in an April 1 Substack post : “If my analysis of the Fed’s major pivot from QT to QE for treasuries is correct, then Bitcoin hit a local low of $76,500 last month, and now we begin the ascent to $250,000 by year-end.” The Fed reduced the Treasury runoff cap to $5 billion per month from $25 billion effective April 1, while keeping mortgage-backed securities (MBS) runoff steady at $35 billion. The Fed may allow the MBS roll off without replacement and the excess principal payment might be reinvested into Treasurys, according to comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell published by Reuters. “Mathematically, that keeps the Fed balance sheet constant; however, that is treasury QE. Bitcoin will scream higher once this is formally announced,” added Hayes.

The pace of capital deployment will increase or decrease depending on the accuracy of his predictions. “I still believe Bitcoin can hit $250,000 by year-end because now that the BBC has put Powell in his place, the Fed will flood the market with dollars,” wrote Hayes, adding: “That allows Xi Jinping to instruct the PBOC to stop tightening monetary conditions onshore to defend the dollar-yuan exchange rate, which increases the net quantity of yuan.” Despite the optimistic prediction, many market participants are betting on a lower Bitcoin price top for the end of 2025.

These days, companies are spending billions of dollars annually on blunt, ineffective advertising campaigns with very little to show for it. Such challenges call for drastic solutions, and Uber has responded by turning to the XION blockchain’s novel Web3 technologies to power a much more efficient, verifiable and incentivized customer acquisition strategy that’s already showing positive results. Traditional Ads Are Losing Effectiveness Over the years, Uber has noticed that its online advertising campaigns are slowly but surely losing their impact. Its new user acquisition costs have increased steadily as a result of various challenges faced by the traditional online advertising industry. These days, the impact of online ads is significantly lower than what it used to be, due to intensified competition with every brand throwing hundreds of thousands of dollars at the same ad platforms. Brands are also dealing with rising “ad fatigue”, where consumers are, to be frank, becoming seriously disconcerted by the invasive ads that seem to follow them across every website they visit. The use of ad blockers has increased, and more consumers than ever are choosing to purposely avoid clicking on ads. That’s led to declining rates of engagement, which forces brands to spend more than ever before to keep up with their user acquisition targets. In addition, companies also have to deal with tougher regulations. Privacy laws such as Europe’s GDPR and California’s CCPA, and Apple’s new App Tracking Transparency policy have dented brands’ ability to effectively target consumers. There’s also the growing ad fraud phenomenon they have to navigate, with an estimated $84 billion worth of advertising spend lost to fake ad impressions in 2023. Faced with these challenges, Uber last year came to the conclusion that traditional online advertising is no longer sustainable. It was a stark realization that led it to implement an entirely different customer acquisition strategy that’s only possible with Web3 technologies. Web3 Incentivizes User Engagement Uber’s revolutionary solution was to launch an entirely new user acquisition strategy based on offering powerful incentives to high-value targets using an app known as EarnOS , powered by the XION blockchain. EarnOS makes full use of Web3’s innovative capabilities, allowing Uber to target customers of rival brands such as Bolt, Lyft and Grab. Those users can securely connect their accounts to EarnOS to verify their ride histories, and in return for providing this verifiable data, brands like Uber can offer them tempting rewards and discounts in return for using its service. The beauty of this approach is that it means Uber can target only the most likely prospects – consumers who are already using ride-sharing services. It’s much more efficient than relying on “hit and miss” ad impressions, which seek to lure in less-likely customer prospects. With its Web3 campaign, Uber enables riders who use its services to enter regular sweepstakes, with the number of entries corresponding to how many times they ride with one of its competitors. By doing so, it can engage riders who are substantially more likely to switch from one of its rivals to use its own services. To reassure consumers that their privacy is preserved, Uber points out that EarnOS uses a cryptographic technology called “zero-knowledge proofs”, which allows for their ride histories to be verified while preserving their anonymity. What’s more, consumers can retain full control of their information and choose who they want to share it with. EarnOS also helps Uber to engage with consumers over the longer-term, as it can offer ongoing incentives to ensure they continue to use its services on a regular basis. The more consumers use its ride sharing services, the greater the rewards they can earn. It fundamentally changes the nature of Uber’s marketing strategy from passive, ad-based customer acquisition to one that rewards user engagement. Blockchain Abstraction Is Key Uber’s next-generation customer acquisition campaign has only been made possible recently thanks to XION’s incredible innovations in blockchain abstraction . Until recently, interacting with blockchain has always required a high-degree of technical skills on the part of the end user, limiting its effectiveness. For instance, blockchain users are required to create a crypto wallet and secure it with a seed phrase, and then they need to go through the drama of signing up to a crypto exchange, including KYC, to be able to buy the cryptocurrencies required to use blockchain services. XION changes that by abstracting away these complexities. With it, users can create a non-custodial account (really a blockchain wallet) using an email and password, so there’s no more seed phrase to worry about. They can use that account with every single app in XION’s ecosystem, and they don’t have to worry about buying different crypto tokens or paying gas fees or waiting for transactions to process. Everything is simplified to the extent that they won’t even know they’re using a blockchain-based platform. It’s Web3, but not as we know it. Next-Generation User Acquisition By providing Web3 capabilities with a Web2-like user experience, XION can potentially transform the nature of customer acquisition across every industry, helping hundreds of brands to shift to a much more effective, laser-targeted, incentivized engagement model with verifiable results. It provides a way for brands to reward users located anywhere in the world, and they won’t even need a bank account or have to worry about expensive cross-border transactions, as these rewards can be paid out in blockchain-based stablecoins that can be sent anywhere in the world instantly. All this while preserving user’s full anonymity, ensuring any and all sensitive data is secured. Given the growing ineffectiveness of web-based advertising, blockchain abstraction technologies such as XION’s have the potential to transform internet digital marketing forever, enabling every brand to adopt a strategy based on incentivized, laser-targeted engagement. What’s more, advertising will no longer be a one-way street. Because Web3 allows brands to verify consumer behavior, they’ll be able to measure loyalty and gain insights that allow them to tailor their products and services specifically for different consumer subsets, enhancing their services. Finally, Web3 also solves the ongoing problem of ad fraud by verifying ad impressions, enabling brands to trust the results they’re seeing.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MINING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 09:35:21

The blockchain firm transferred the tokens across multiple wallets, with 700 million coins later locked in escrow. However, the unusual absence of the scheduled April escrow release has left investors questioning Ripple’s motives. XRP News: Ripple’s 1 Billion Move Sparks Speculation Ripple has been the hot topic in the latest XRP news thread with its latest move. The recent transactions have drawn attention due to their sheer volume and an unexpected deviation from its usual schedule. According to Whale Alert, the blockchain company moved 1 billion XRP in multiple transactions, with a significant portion being re-locked in escrow. Whale Alert data showed that the first transfer saw 300 million XRP, valued at approximately $629 million, sent from the Ripple (26) wallet to the “rBg…91m” address. Shortly after, another 200 million XRP worth $420 million was sent to the “rKD…2op” wallet. Interestingly, the “rKD…2op” wallet later received another 170 million XRP in a separate transaction from Ripple (27). Soon after, 330 million XRP was transferred to the “rDd…eCK” address, marking its first transaction since March. These movements totaled 1 billion XRP. Ripple Locked 700 Mln XRP In Escrow Despite moving a massive sum, Ripple locked 700 million XRP back into escrow accounts. The “rKD…2op” wallet, which received 370 million XRP, locked the entire amount in escrow shortly after the transactions. Similarly, the “rDd…eCK” wallet re-locked all 330 million XRP it received. This brought the total escrowed amount to 700 million, leaving 300 million XRP untouched. Currently, the wallet “rBg…91m” holds these funds, likely for operational liquidity. What’s Lies Ahead? These latest transfers have drawn attention mostly due to the absence of the expected 1 billion XRP escrow release in April. Usually, Ripple releases 1 billion XRP on the first day of each month before re-locking a part of the locked amount. However, no such event has been witnessed this month yet. However, with these latest transfers, speculations are high on the potential reason behind the move. Besides, the discussions further amplified as the Ripple Vs SEC case is likely to end in August. Meanwhile, amid the transfer, XRP price today slipped 3% to $2.12, while its one-day volume fell 11% to $3.83 billion. Besides, a recent report indicates that Ripple’s coin price may slip to $1.5 if it loses critical support ahead.

Although ETH has bounced back from the support of $1,800, analysts are weighing the possibility of how low it can fall further from here. Some analysts believe that the largest altcoin is currently facing a make-or-break scenario. Ethereum Price – A Do or Die for Investors? With a 44% drop since the beginning of 2025, Ethereum price has been under a strong bearish grip so far. The monthly chart reveals ETH has been trading within a well-defined channel since 2018, with clear “Top Level” and “Bottom Level” boundaries. Source: Merlijn The Trader The price is currently testing what analysts have labeled the “Make or Break Level” – a mid-channel resistance zone that has historically determined significant price movements. As we can see from the above image, ETH is trading in a critical support range. If the ETH price bounces from here, the road to $20,000 and above is open for the altcoin. However, if it fails to hold this support, it can also crash under $1,000 levels, all the way to $610. For the first time in history, Ethereum has ended all three months of Q1, in negative territory. Market analysts believe that Q2 would be better. Our Ethereum price prediction shows that ETH would continue to flirt around $1,880 levels over the next month. $ETH just had the worst Q1 in history. Q2 is where it all turns around! pic.twitter.com/2JUB8woYXV — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) April 2, 2025 ETH Whale Selloff Intensifies Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported a significant decline in Ethereum whale activity , with large transactions dropping 63.8% since February 25. Over the past two weeks, whales have sold 760,000 ETH, signaling reduced institutional or large-holder participation in the network. Source: Ali Martinez Despite this, some market analysts believe that ETH will soon start outperforming Bitcoin. Popular analyst Michael van de Poppe stated that altcoins will soon start gaining momentum as Gold shows signs of topping out. “If Gold starts to correct in this month, likely ETH starts to outperform Bitcoin,” noted Poppe . Ethereum ETF Flows Disappoint Inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs have also dried up amid poor Ethereum price performance. The net inflows since its inception have slipped under $2.5 billion, showing waning institutional interest in the asset class. This is down from the peak of $3.042 billion on February 25. Experts attribute Ethereum’s struggles to its lack of leadership and innovation in the Web3 space.

Leading trade associations have collectively voiced an urgent appeal to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, urging the appointment of a dedicated crypto special envoy and the formulation of a robust action plan for digital assets and blockchain technology. This bold move, as reported by Cointelegraph, signals a strong desire within the industry to propel the UK to the forefront of the global crypto landscape. But what exactly does this mean for the future of crypto in the UK, and why is this call to action so critical right now? Why a Crypto Special Envoy and Why Now for the UK Crypto Sector? Imagine navigating a complex maze without a map or guide. That’s somewhat analogous to the current situation facing the burgeoning UK crypto sector . While there’s immense potential, the path forward requires clear direction, coordination, and a unified strategy. This is precisely why a coalition of six influential digital economy bodies has penned a letter to Prime Minister Starmer’s special advisor, advocating for a paradigm shift in how the UK approaches digital assets. Drawing inspiration from the United States’ proactive approach, which includes a ‘crypto czar’ to steer policy and innovation, these trade associations believe the UK needs a similar figurehead – a crypto special envoy . This envoy would act as a central point of contact, a champion for the industry, and a key driver in coordinating policy across different government departments. But what are the specific benefits of having such a role? Unified Strategy: A special envoy can ensure a cohesive and consistent approach to crypto regulation UK , fostering a more predictable and business-friendly environment. Industry Advocacy: This dedicated individual can act as a strong voice for the UK crypto sector within government, understanding their unique needs and challenges. Innovation Catalyst: By focusing on fostering innovation, the envoy can help unlock the transformative potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. Global Competitiveness: In the rapidly evolving global crypto landscape, a special envoy can help the UK stay competitive and attract international investment. The timing of this appeal is also crucial. The global digital asset market is maturing, and other nations are actively developing their regulatory frameworks and strategies. The UK risks falling behind if it doesn’t seize this moment to create a supportive ecosystem for crypto innovation and growth. Unpacking the Proposed Digital Assets Action Plan: What Should it Include? Beyond the appointment of a crypto special envoy , the trade associations are calling for a comprehensive digital assets action plan . This isn’t just about reacting to trends; it’s about proactively shaping the future of the digital economy in the UK. But what key elements should such an action plan encompass to truly boost the sector? Here are some potential pillars of a successful digital assets action plan : Pillar Description Benefits for UK Crypto Sector Clear Regulatory Framework Developing specific and unambiguous regulations for digital assets, addressing areas like stablecoins, DeFi, and NFTs.

This action plan isn’t just about ticking boxes; it’s about creating a dynamic and thriving ecosystem where the UK crypto sector can flourish, driving economic growth and technological advancement. Blockchain Technology: The Bedrock of the Digital Asset Revolution At the heart of this entire conversation lies blockchain technology . It’s the foundational technology that underpins cryptocurrencies and a vast array of other digital assets. Understanding its potential is key to appreciating why the trade associations are pushing for this strategic focus. Blockchain technology offers: Transparency and Security: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, making them transparent and tamper-proof. Efficiency and Speed: Blockchain can streamline processes and reduce transaction times compared to traditional systems. Decentralization: It distributes control, reducing reliance on intermediaries and potentially lowering costs.

It’s about positioning the UK as a leader in the next wave of technological innovation. Benefits of a Thriving UK Crypto Sector: More Than Just Hype? Skeptics might dismiss crypto as mere hype, but the trade associations and industry leaders see a much bigger picture. A thriving UK crypto sector offers tangible benefits that extend to the entire economy. Let’s look beyond the headlines and consider the real-world advantages: Job Creation: A growing crypto sector means new jobs in development, compliance, legal, marketing, and many other areas. Economic Growth: Increased investment in digital assets and blockchain technology will contribute to the UK’s GDP. Technological Leadership: Embracing crypto and blockchain positions the UK as a leader in cutting-edge technology.

These benefits are not just theoretical; they are based on the observed growth and impact of the crypto sector in other countries that have adopted proactive strategies. The UK has the potential to replicate and even surpass this success. Challenges and Actionable Insights: Navigating the Crypto Landscape Of course, embracing the UK crypto sector comes with challenges. Concerns around volatility, illicit activities, and consumer protection are valid and need to be addressed. However, these challenges are not insurmountable. A well-designed crypto regulation UK framework, coupled with a strategic action plan, can mitigate these risks while fostering innovation. Here are some actionable insights for moving forward: Prioritize Education: Educate policymakers, regulators, and the public about the potential and risks of crypto and blockchain technology . Foster Collaboration: Encourage dialogue and collaboration between government, industry, and academia to develop effective policies. Embrace Gradualism: Implement regulations in a phased approach, starting with clear guidelines and gradually refining them based on experience and market developments. Focus on Innovation: Create regulatory sandboxes and innovation hubs to encourage responsible experimentation and development. Promote International Standards: Work with international bodies to develop global standards for crypto regulation UK and digital assets. By proactively addressing these challenges and embracing these actionable insights, the UK can create a robust and responsible crypto regulation UK framework that unlocks the immense potential of the digital asset sector. Conclusion: A Visionary Step Towards a Digital Future The call from UK trade associations for a crypto special envoy and a comprehensive digital assets action plan is more than just a request; it’s a visionary step towards securing the UK’s position in the digital future. By embracing blockchain technology and fostering the growth of the UK crypto sector , the UK can unlock significant economic, technological, and societal benefits.

Which side will BTC breakout? Let’s find out in this BTC price prediction for April 2025. Table of Contents What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin short-term price prediction Bitcoin coin price prediction: short-term outlook BTC price factors for April 2025 As the first and the most reputed cryptocurrency to launch till date, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has seen an all-time high of $108,786 in January 2025. Since then the price of BTC has seen a downward correction and is currently trading at $84,257, which is a 5.17% drop from its previous weekly high of $88,728. BTC 1d chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss the BTC price prediction by giving you its short and price forecasts, and specifically focus on Bitcoin price prediction in April 2025. What is Bitcoin? According to Bitcoin.org , ‘’Bitcoin is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money.’’ Peer-to-peer technology allows BTC to function independently of banks and a central authority; the network handles transaction management and bitcoin issuance collectively. BTC is open-source; everyone can participate, no one owns or controls it, and its design is publicly available. Due to a number of its special features, BTC enables innovative applications that were not possible with earlier payment methods including traditional banks or otherwise. Now let’s discuss BTC price prediction in April 2025 both from a technical point of view and also look into some fundamental factors that could affect the price as well. You might also like: Analysis: Bitcoin may see consolidation in April and May as selling pressure drops Bitcoin short-term price prediction What can be a realistic projection for the BTC token? Let’s analyze this token for a short term outlook and then discuss Bitcoin price prediction in April 2025. Bitcoin coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s BTC price prediction for the near future, the token is projected to rise by 38.22% and reach $116,112 by Apr. 28, 2025. This is a far-fetched prediction and unlikely that BTC can rebound to new all-time high in such a short time. Analysts on X believe BTC is headed towards a deep correction and moving towards the $75000-$70000 zone. Analysts like Dr. Profit has pointed out this price prediction for BTC. BOOOOM! #Bitcoin is now very close to hit the short area we spoke about two days ago. What a great feeling to see Bitcoin doing what we expected, just for us to get a great short entry! Placing many short orders in the yellow area, prepare to dump very soon. https://t.co/QNwEZJpnXd pic.twitter.com/KN2MDqWpdJ — Doctor Profit 🇨🇭 (@DrProfitCrypto) March 24, 2025 Meanwhile other analysts are of the opinion that we are still in an uptrend and the ongoing dip is just a good buying opportunity. If you think Altcoin Season hasn't arrived yet, you must be crazy. A huge bull run is coming, and you're still scared! All you need to do is make your portfolio and stay under the money in April and May. $Btc pic.twitter.com/n4aYuiZYwR — @CryptoELlTES (@CryptooELITES) March 26, 2025 BTC price factors for April 2025 Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, recently shared her thoughts on the market in an interview with crypto.news , saying that after a brief correction following April 2, she expects the market to stabilize and pave the way for future growth. President Donald Trump had previously promised to implement new tariffs on April 2, calling it a crucial moment for the economy just weeks after the last round rattled markets and sparked recession worries. Market volatility has been greatly influenced by the tariff scenario, as evidenced by the U.S. policy uncertainty index hitting all-time highs. Although trade talks have grown to be a major cause of investor anxiety, many analysts believe that the level of uncertainty may soon reach a high. The increase in gold prices in April 2025 is another significant factor impacting the price of BTC . Gold has long been seen as a safe-haven asset, and rising prices sometimes indicate escalating concerns about a recession. Investors move money from riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies to gold and bonds when they’re looking for stability. The price of BTC and other digital assets may decline as a result of this trend. The Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy will also be very important. The Fed may decrease liquidity and lessen the appeal of riskier assets if it maintains high rates in an effort to fight inflation. In contrast, indications of rate reductions could raise the price of BTC. Opinion may be influenced by the SEC’s position on BTC ETFs, cryptocurrency regulation, and enforcement actions against exchanges. Stricter regulations may result in sell-offs, but clearer regulatory frameworks may encourage institutional adoption.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency including BTC, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a price point that was once considered a very strong support or resistance may become invalid in a very short time. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the price action before having any price expectations for the future of the BTC token. Will Bitcoin go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While BTC is not affected by the aforementioned events in general, it is still hard to determine how high or low BTC will go. Hence, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include increased adoption, global policies, and critical support and resistance levels. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for BTC price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious as no one can accurately predict how high or low BTC can go. Should I invest in Bitcoin? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any BTC price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals and long-term global sentiment which may very well decide the future of BTC.

With investors constantly hunting for projects that promise exponential returns, fresh contenders are making waves. Among them, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is stealing the spotlight with its unique concept and deflationary tokenomics. Meanwhile, Bonk continues to hold its ground as a community-driven sensation, and Osaka Protocol is gaining traction with its AI-powered innovations. As these three projects capture investor attention, the real question is—which one has the highest potential for massive growth? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC ) is turning heads with its aggressive token burn strategy and a presale that’s heating up fast. Designed for long-term sustainability, APC reduces supply weekly by eliminating unsold tokens, making it a deflationary asset primed for scarcity-driven value surges. The presale is already generating a frenzy, with early adopters rushing in before prices climb. Meanwhile, Bonk remains a dominant force in the meme coin sector, while Osaka Protocol is carving a niche in AI-integrated blockchain solutions. This article dives into the latest developments and updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Bonk, and Osaka Protocol. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Surge: How Token Burns Enhance Value The Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) ecosystem employs a strategic token burn mechanism designed to drive long-term value. Every week during the meme coin presale , unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation, increasing scarcity and elevating potential investor gains. Once the presale concludes, any remaining tokens will also be burned, ensuring a deflationary supply model. This burning process helps stabilize demand and reinforces the coin’s long-term growth potential, making Arctic Pablo Coin a standout in the space. All burn transactions are verifiable on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering full transparency. With fewer tokens in circulation, early investors could benefit from increasing value as supply diminishes. This calculated approach strengthens confidence in the project and aligns with the broader strategy of making Arctic Pablo Coin an elite contender among the best new meme coins for exponential returns. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale Momentum: Act Now Before the Price Jumps The Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC ) meme coin presale is heating up, and investors are racing to secure their holdings before the next price increase. Each phase of the presale brings a higher valuation, creating a golden opportunity for those who enter early. The limited token supply and rising demand indicate that waiting too long could mean missing out on significant potential gains. As the presale progresses, prices continue their upward trajectory, making this moment the best time to get in before the next surge. Priced at $0.000087, Arctic Pablo Coin’s 17th presale stage—Glacial Glade—is already drawing massive attention. Over $2 million raised and a headline-worthy 9,084.48% projected ROI signal serious investor interest. For anyone eyeing meme coin presales with explosive upside, APC is hard to ignore. Bonk: The Community-Driven Dog-Themed Meme Coin Bonk, a popular Solana-based meme coin, has captured the attention of the crypto community with its decentralized and community-focused model. Created as a response to centralized dog coins, Bonk’s distribution model ensured that 50% of its total supply was airdropped to Solana users, fostering a strong and engaged ecosystem. The token has since been widely adopted, driving up trading volumes and maintaining its relevance within the meme coin space. Bonk’s tokenomics and vibrant community have contributed to its steady growth and adoption. It has been integrated into numerous DeFi applications, offering utility beyond its meme status. With ongoing developments, partnerships, and exchange listings, Bonk remains a significant player among emerging meme coins, demonstrating the power of community-driven crypto projects. Osaka Protocol: Bridging Decentralization and AI Technology Osaka Protocol is a rising star in the blockchain and AI integration sector, blending meme coin appeal with cutting-edge technological advancements. The project focuses on decentralization and artificial intelligence, offering a unique ecosystem where smart contracts interact with AI-driven applications. This innovative approach positions Osaka Protocol as a disruptive force in the crypto world, with its native token gaining increasing traction.

Since its last report in September 2024, Google Threat Intelligence Group has observed a rise in DPRK IT workers infiltrating tech and crypto firms in multiple countries across Europe. These individuals use fake identities and create multiple fake personas to secure high-paying jobs at tech and blockchain companies, often using additional fabricated personas for references. In one case, a single individual was found operating under at least 12 different personas across Europe and the U.S., targeting organizations within the defense and government sectors. Source: List of countries impacted by DPRK IT workers According to the latest report , a number of of DPRK IT workers have been found to be actively involved in blockchain projects in the UK, such as developing Solana and Anchor/Rust smart contracts and building a blockchain-based job marketplace using the MERN stack and Solana. In addition to the IT workers themselves, investigations have also uncovered a network of facilitators supporting these workers in navigating European job websites and providing them with false identity documents.

With economic pressure mounting, the country has turned to cyber operations as a major revenue stream, using IT workers to secure high-paying jobs and funnel earnings back to the state. In 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department estimated that these workers collectively generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually for North Korea. The DPRK government withholds up to 90 percent of the wages earned by these workers, thereby channeling substantial funds into its military projects. Beyond directly funneling their salaries to the regime, North Korean IT workers sometimes act as entry points for state-sponsored hacking groups like Lazarus Group , which was recently in the spotlight for orchestrating the $1,5 billion hack of Bybit exchange. Notably, Lazarus stole over $600 million from the Ronin Network (Axie Infinity) in 2022, with IT workers playing a key role in providing access to internal systems. In August 2024, on-chain sleuth ZachXBT uncovered over 25 crypto projects infiltrated by DPRK devs. While Lazarus’s hack of Bybit—after which North Korea became the fifth-largest government holder of Bitcoin ( BTC )—was linked to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in its multi-sig wallet rather than direct infiltration, it has raised awareness of the DPRK’s threat in the U.S. According to GTIG report , this heightened awareness is one of the key factors behind the expansion of North Korean infiltration efforts into Europe, in addition to increased public reporting, U.S. Department of Justice indictments, and challenges related to right-to-work verification.

The cryptocurrency is currently navigating a crucial phase where technical indicators hint at both bullish and bearish possibilities. Here’s an in-depth analysis of XRP’s short-term trajectory based on the 1-hour, 30-minute, and 15-minute charts. 1-Hour Chart Analysis XRP has been consolidating within a descending triangle pattern, signaling potential breakout opportunities. The price recently tested the lower boundary near $2.50, coinciding with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. This suggests that XRP might be experiencing a corrective phase before initiating a stronger upward movement. A confirmed breakout above $2.20 would indicate a bullish shift. 30-Minute Chart Analysis On the 30-minute chart, XRP’s trend leans slightly bearish, with 57.14% of moving average signals pointing downward. The 50-period moving average also indicates the possibility of a trend reversal. However, key support at $2.00 remains intact, and a break above the $2.20 resistance level could signal renewed buying pressure. 15-Minute Chart Analysis Short-term price action shows consolidation near the middle Bollinger Band, reflecting market indecision. Immediate support is observed at $2.05 , while resistance stands at $2.15. If buyers push the price beyond this resistance, XRP could gain further momentum. Conversely, a drop below $2.05 might lead to a decline toward $1.533 before finding stability. Future Price Direction and Expected Rebound Bullish Scenario: If XRP maintains support above $2.05 and successfully breaches the $2.20 resistance, it could climb toward $2.37, aligning with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. This movement could develop within the next 24 to 48 hours. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bearish Scenario: A breakdown below $2.05 could see XRP testing $1.533, with a potential stabilization before any significant recovery. Based on current price dynamics, a rebound is likely within the next 48-72 hours, provided XRP sustains key support levels and gains bullish momentum. Traders should monitor these critical levels closely to anticipate market shifts. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In an April 1 announcement , Cruz unveiled the Facilitating Lower Atmospheric Released Emissions Act, which he believes will make Texas the “number one place for Bitcoin mining.” The FLARE Act proposes a change to the U.S. tax code that would allow companies to permanently deduct the full cost of systems designed to capture and repurpose natural gas that would otherwise be flared or vented. These systems, called flaring and venting mitigation systems, would qualify for 100% expensing starting in 2026. To qualify, the equipment must intake natural gas and convert it into something useful, like electricity, liquid fuels, or even computational power for digital asset mining. The bill lists several eligible uses, including compressing or liquefying gas for transport, producing petrochemicals or fertilizer, and powering oilfield equipment or the electrical grid. Besides the incentives, the bill blocks foreign entities of concern, including those tied to China , Russia, Iran, or North Korea, from benefiting from the incentives. This clause is meant to keep the tax break exclusive to U.S.-aligned operators and strengthen domestic energy independence. You might also like: SpaceX to launch first polar orbit crewed mission backed by Bitcoin mining tycoon By turning stranded gas into usable energy, Cruz and supporters argue the bill would not only cut emissions but also boost energy innovation and grid resilience, especially during periods of peak demand or extreme weather. “This bill takes advantage of Texas’s vast energy potential, reinforces our position as the home of the Bitcoin industry, and is good for the environment. I call upon my colleagues to expeditiously take up and advance this legislation,” Cruz said. The bill has already picked up support from industry players who see it as a win-win for both energy and innovation. Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings endorsed the legislation in an X post, adding that it could reduce emissions and “unlock stranded energy” across Texas and beyond. See below. The FLARE Act from Sen. @tedcruz allows full expensing for infrastructure that captures and repurposes flared gas into value-added uses—like Bitcoin mining. MARA supports this legislation. It recognizes Bitcoin mining’s role in reducing emissions and unlocking stranded energy. https://t.co/7GhnGYQqXx — MARA (@MARAHoldings) April 1, 2025 Last year, MARA partnered with NGON to launch a 25-megawatt micro data center operation across wellheads in Texas and North Dakota. The data center will use excess natural gas to generate electricity to power data centers, offering energy producers a high-efficiency solution for methane mitigation. Under the legislation, infrastructure like this would qualify as a flaring and venting mitigation system, making it eligible for permanent full expensing. That means MARA and similar operators could deduct the entire cost of installing such systems from their taxable income, starting in 2026. Long before he introduced the FLARE Act, Cruz floated the idea at the 2021 Texas Blockchain Summit that Bitcoin mining could turn excess energy from oil and gas operations into something useful instead of just burning it off. “Use that power to mine Bitcoin. Part of the beauty of that is the instant you’re doing it you’re helping the environment enormously because rather than flaring the natural gas you’re putting it to productive use,” he said at the time.

42795799,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145433,1743587410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin’s Bold Leap: Surging as a Prime Alternative to Tech Stocks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-prime-tech-stock-alternative/,"In a surprising turn of events, Bitcoin (BTC), the pioneering cryptocurrency, is increasingly being viewed not just as digital gold, but as a potent alternative to tech stocks. This fascinating shift comes at a time when the U.S. economy faces mounting uncertainties, fueled by concerns over tariffs and fluctuating market dynamics. Could this be a game-changer for investors seeking to diversify beyond traditional tech giants? Let’s delve into the insights from a Standard Chartered executive that are turning heads in the financial world. Is Bitcoin Really Becoming the New Tech Stock? Geoff Kendrick, the Head of Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered, has ignited a compelling discussion by highlighting Bitcoin’s growing correlation with the NASDAQ. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it suggests a fundamental shift in how institutional investors are perceiving BTC. Kendrick argues that Bitcoin is starting to behave more like a tech stock than the inflation hedge it was originally conceived to be. This perspective challenges conventional wisdom and opens up exciting new avenues for portfolio strategy. But what exactly does this correlation mean for you? In essence, it implies that Bitcoin’s price movements are increasingly mirroring those of major tech stocks listed on the NASDAQ. When tech stocks rise, Bitcoin tends to follow suit, and vice versa. This relationship is crucial for investors because it suggests that Bitcoin is becoming integrated into the broader tech-driven investment landscape. Why the Shift? Economic Uncertainty and Tariffs Several factors are driving this intriguing transformation. Firstly, the rising economic uncertainty in the U.S. is pushing investors to seek assets that can perform well even amidst market volatility. Traditional tech stocks, while historically robust, are now facing headwinds from various sources, including: Concerns over Tariffs: Trade tensions and tariffs can significantly impact the global operations and profitability of tech companies, leading to investor apprehension. Inflationary Pressures: While initially touted as an inflation hedge, Bitcoin’s recent behavior suggests it’s reacting more to macroeconomic factors influencing growth stocks. Geopolitical Instability: Global events and geopolitical risks often trigger market fluctuations, impacting investor sentiment towards traditional equities, including tech stocks. In this environment, Bitcoin , with its decentralized nature and limited supply, is presenting itself as a potentially attractive investment alternative . Its independence from traditional financial systems and governments can be seen as a buffer against some of these economic uncertainties. Investors are starting to recognize this and are allocating capital accordingly. Bitcoin vs. Tech Stocks: A Head-to-Head Comparison Let’s take a closer look at how Bitcoin stacks up against traditional tech stocks . While both are considered growth assets, they possess distinct characteristics that investors should consider: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Tech Stocks (e.g., NASDAQ) Asset Class Cryptocurrency, Digital Asset Equity, Stocks Decentralization Decentralized, No central authority Centralized, Regulated markets Supply Limited (21 million BTC) Unlimited (Stock supply can vary) Volatility Historically High Generally Lower (than Bitcoin, but can be volatile) Regulation Evolving regulatory landscape Heavily regulated Market Maturity Relatively nascent, growing institutional adoption Mature, well-established markets As you can see, while tech stocks represent established companies with proven business models, Bitcoin offers a unique value proposition rooted in decentralization and scarcity. The choice between them, or a strategic blend of both, depends on an investor’s risk tolerance, investment horizon, and belief in the future of digital assets. The “Magnificent 7” and the Bitcoin Proposition Kendrick’s analysis takes an even more provocative turn when he suggests replacing Tesla (TSLA), a prominent member of the “Magnificent 7” U.S. tech stocks, with Bitcoin . The “Magnificent 7” – comprising Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, NVIDIA, Tesla, and Meta (Facebook) – have been the darlings of the stock market, driving significant portions of its growth. However, Kendrick posits that substituting Tesla with Bitcoin in this elite group could potentially lead to: Higher Returns: Bitcoin, despite its volatility, has historically outperformed many traditional assets over longer periods. Lower Volatility (in the context of the portfolio): While Bitcoin itself is volatile, its inclusion in a portfolio alongside other tech stocks could potentially diversify risk and, surprisingly, reduce overall portfolio volatility due to its unique market dynamics and lower correlation with some traditional assets compared to individual tech stocks. This is a bold claim, but it underscores the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a mainstream investment. It’s not just about comparing Bitcoin to individual tech stocks; it’s about considering its strategic role within a broader investment portfolio and its potential to enhance returns and manage risk in innovative ways. Portfolio diversification is key in today’s uncertain economic climate, and Bitcoin might just be the unexpected piece of the puzzle. Benefits of Considering Bitcoin as a Tech Investment Alternative Why should investors seriously consider Bitcoin as a tech stocks alternative? Here are some compelling benefits: Diversification Beyond Traditional Markets: Bitcoin offers diversification away from traditional equities and fixed income, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Exposure to a Nascent and Growing Asset Class: Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are still in their early stages, offering significant growth potential as adoption increases. Potential for High Returns: Bitcoin has historically demonstrated the potential for substantial returns, although this comes with higher volatility. Decentralization and Transparency: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature can be appealing to investors seeking assets outside of government and traditional financial control. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional stock markets, Bitcoin markets operate 24/7, offering continuous trading opportunities. Navigating the Challenges and Risks Of course, investing in Bitcoin , especially as a tech stocks alternative, is not without its challenges and risks. Investors need to be aware of: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility can be significant, leading to potential losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and changes in regulations could impact Bitcoin’s price and adoption. Security Risks: Cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets can be targets for hacking and theft. Secure storage and risk management are crucial. Complexity: Understanding the technology and market dynamics of Bitcoin requires effort and due diligence. Market Sentiment: Bitcoin’s price can be heavily influenced by market sentiment and news events, leading to rapid price swings. Actionable Insights: Integrating Bitcoin into Your Investment Strategy So, how can investors translate these insights into actionable strategies? Here are a few key takeaways: Educate Yourself: Thoroughly understand Bitcoin , its technology, and its market dynamics before investing. Start Small: Begin with a small allocation to Bitcoin as part of your portfolio diversification strategy. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: Invest a fixed amount regularly to mitigate the impact of volatility. Use Reputable Exchanges and Wallets: Choose secure and regulated platforms for buying, selling, and storing Bitcoin. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market trends, regulatory developments, and news impacting the cryptocurrency space. Consult a Financial Advisor: Seek professional advice to determine if Bitcoin aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Conclusion: The Dawn of a New Investment Paradigm? The notion of Bitcoin emerging as a viable investment alternative to tech stocks is a powerful signal of the evolving financial landscape. Standard Chartered’s perspective highlights a potentially transformative shift in how institutional investors are viewing and utilizing cryptocurrencies. While challenges and risks remain, the benefits of diversification, exposure to a growing asset class, and the potential for significant returns are increasingly compelling. As economic uncertainties persist and the digital economy expands, Bitcoin’s role in investment portfolios is likely to become even more prominent. The bold move of considering Bitcoin alongside, or even in place of, traditional tech giants may just be the beginning of a new era in investment strategy.

This decrease represents a 74% decline from its all-time high of $2.98 in February 2025. ​ Major Token Unlock Ahead A major contributing factor to this downturn is the upcoming unlocking of over 124 million PI tokens this month, with projections indicating a total of 1.6 billion tokens to be unlocked over the next year. Besides, PI trading activity is also slowing down, indicating that investor excitement is fading fast. The Pi Core team recently announced that the inaugural PiFest on the Open Network achieved record participation, with over 125,000 registered sellers, more than 58,000 active sellers, and 1.8 million Pioneers engaging with the Map of Pi, highlighting Pi’s real-world utility on a global scale. Community Members Demand New Leadership However, this announcement has not been well-received by the community. Dr. Altcoin remarked that since the commencement of PiFest, trading activity within the Pi ecosystem has significantly declined, with the only transactions involving the sale of Pi for cash. He also criticized the Pi co-founders, suggesting that they appear disconnected from the practical realities and concerns of the broader Pi community. Community members are unhappy with the Pi Core Team’s updates and are demanding more transparency and fresh leadership with real crypto expertise. They want updates that spark interest, not just the boring routine reports. Pi Network’s Mining Rate Drops By Over 1% Notably, the Pi Network’s mining rate has dropped by 1.18% this month, now at 0.0029030 π per hour. This continues a trend of gradual mining rate reductions. While there were hopes of Pi listing on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, it hasn’t materialised yet. While the BTCC exchange did add Pi for spot trading, it has not boosted the coin’s price. Over the past seven days, the Pi coin price has tanked by 20%, with the next crucial support levels at $0.60. Furthermore, the correction under $0.70 comes with heavy selling pressure as daily trading volumes tanked 52% to $148 million. Pi Network is currently forming a classic falling wedge pattern, testing the lower boundary near $0.687. A confirmed breakout with volume above the $0.71–$0.72 range could signal a bullish move, potentially pushing the price toward $0.75–$0.78, where key resistance levels lie. In a recent X post, Dr. Altcoin stated that Pi’s price could continue to decline toward $0.60 until April 7 unless the Pi Team takes substantial action to reduce the 6.78 billion circulating supply through token burns. Pi is likely to keep dropping toward $0.6 until April 7, unless the Pi Team significantly reduces the 6.78 billion supply through token burns. pic.twitter.com/YXBSKvxRX1 — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) April 2, 2025 Pi Network’s Growing Inflation Concerns Pi Network is becoming one of the most inflationary cryptocurrencies, and this trend might continue. With a max supply of 100 billion Pi coins and only 6.7 billion currently in circulation, token unlocks are increasing the number of coins in the market. While some cryptos tackle this by burning tokens to reduce supply, it’s unclear if Pi has plans for such a strategy. Options could include burning tokens not moved to the mainnet by June or using ecosystem fees for token burns. Nicolas Kokkalis, Pi’s co-founder, is likely to address these issues in the project’s first X Space. He is expected to discuss Pi Network’s future plans, including the roadmap and upcoming features.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MINING|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 09:51:07

The country will explore the use of blockchain technology to promote the “on-chaining” of important data and realize data encryption processing and process flexibility. Li Chunlin, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said that the Commission had applied privacy computing to the sharing and application of credit information to reduce the risk of information leakage. A 2024 study revealed that China attached great importance to the development of blockchain technology, listing it as a key area of ‘national cutting-edge technology layout’ and encouraging local governments to actively explore its application potential, aiming to use the characteristics of blockchain technology to improve the efficiency, transparency, and security of government services. China’s Cyberspace Administration (CAC) regulations require all blockchain companies to register their users and to provide personal data and activity sheets to the authorities upon request. According to the Data Security Management Regulation, incidents that could harm national security or public interest must be reported within 24 hours of identification. Chunlin says NDRC will use blockchain to secure credit data The Chinese government said it has applied privacy computing to the sharing of credit information to reduce the risk of information leakage. It will explore the use of blockchain technology to promote the ""chaining"" of key data, realise data encryption processing and process… — LondonCryptoClub (@LDNCryptoClub) April 2, 2025 Chunlin said at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office on April 2 that in terms of strengthening technical support and guarantee, the NDRC had applied privacy computing to the sharing and application of credit information to reduce the risk of information leakage. The initiative highlighted China’s drive towards innovative technology to improve credit data security, although market reactions remained unclear. Previously, China’s credit systems were supported by technologically advanced frameworks, showing an upward trend in loan distributions across small enterprises. By 2024, these loans reached trillions of yuan, indicating substantial demand and growth. The integration of blockchain reportedly promises to further strengthen these systems by offering enhanced encryption and data processing. China’s adoption could potentially position it as a leader in credit management innovation as global economies integrate similar technologies. “We are committed to enhancing the financing environment for small businesses to foster growth and innovation.” ~ Li Chunlin The project outlined in the ‘National Data Infrastructure Construction Guidelines’ will be implemented in two phases. The first phase, which focuses on designing the system architecture, is expected to be completed by 2026, while the full deployment is scheduled for 2029. According to Chunlin, a key component of this infrastructure is the integration of smart contracts to automate data processes and eliminate unnecessary human intervention. The system will provide high-level security and reliability by ensuring that recorded data cannot be changed. Data leak reveals public-private collaboration to monitor Chinese cyberspace SentinelLABS analyzed a data leak containing infrastructure details and work logs from employees of Chinese state-affiliated private sector security firm, TopSec, revealing that TopSec was likely enabling content moderation for internet censorship purposes, a key strategy used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to monitor and control public opinion on issues that the state deems contentious or antisocial. SentinelLABS identified this leak as a submission to a multi-scanner platform that fired off a rule that looked for common abuse activities associated with Kubernetes (K8s). According to SentinelLABS, the data leak included a document with 7K+ lines of work logs and code used to organize infrastructure for the firm’s DevOps practices and downstream customers. It included scripts that connected to several Chinese government hostnames, academic institutions, and news sites. SentinelLABS also reported that it found evidence indicating that TopSec provided bespoke services to a state-owned enterprise on the date that a corruption investigation targeting the organization’s top official was announced. The leaked documents analyzed by SentinelLABS referenced multiple organizations in both the private and public sectors, likely customers or otherwise associated with TopSec. Some of the TopSec customers referenced in these documents included Dongwu Fund Management Co. Ltd, Gucheng County Petition Bureau, Illegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center, Linhai Rural Commercial Bank, and Petkit, among others. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The recovery in the DOGE price was followed by a drop of over 4% triggered by Elon Musk’s comment of Dogecoin not being adopted by the government. Meanwhile, the selling pressure has faded to some extent, which could elevate the levels beyond $0.2 soon as technicials are turning bullish. Ever since the institutions have landed in the crypto space, the crypto has been less influenced by the developments in the space or by the on-chain readings. The only thing that matters currently is the US government and its policies. It has been broadly seen in the traditional markets and gold, which is peaking due to uncertainty. Dogecoin whales have accumulated more than 220 million DOGE throughout March while the price remained consolidated around $0.17 and experienced a single push to above $0.2, which was thrashed in no time. Considering the historical chart, the DOGE price has reached the lower support of the lower rising parallel channel. The price is finding its support at the 200-day weekly MA while the 50-day weekly MA is acting as an immediate resistance. The selling pressure has dropped over the past few weeks and the MACD levels are heading for a bullish crossover, which suggests the price may soon trigger a rebound and maintain a healthy upswing. Will Dogecoin Price Reach $0.25 in April 2025? Whenever the Dogecoin price finds itself between the two MAs, it tends to maintain a horizontal consolidation until these levels undergo either a bullish or bearish crossover. Besides, in the short term, price action also displays a similar trend. The daily chart of DOGE shows the price is consolidating along the multi-month ascending trend line, flashing bullish signals for the upcoming price action. The price is holding along the rising trend line that it has held since the October breakout. The MACD suggests a drop in the buying pressure but the levels, which were about to undergo a bearish crossover, have diverted. On the other hand, the RSI remains incremental, holding along the ascending trend line, suggesting the rise in the strength of the rally. Therefore, the Dogecoin price is expected to maintain an ascending consolidation along the trend line and reach the crucial resistance around $0.2. These levels have been acting as resistance and support levels as and when required. Therefore, a surpass from these ranges may build more confidence among the market participants. As the volume has slightly increased recently, it indicates the bulls are vigilant and hence may exhibit required action, pushing the Dogecoin (DOGE) price beyond $0.25.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 09:53:12

However, hopes for a boost from Elon Musk faded after he clarified that the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) has no plans to adopt the meme coin. Massive Whale Buys Last Month The biggest meme coin in terms of total market capitalization witnessed enhanced volatility throughout March, with its price ranging from $0.14 to almost $0.25. Currently, it trades at around $0.17, representing a 25% decline on a 30-day scale. DOGE Price, Source: CoinGecko Whales seem unfazed by this turbulence, and they increased their holdings during that timeframe. The X user Ali Martinez revealed that these investors ended the month with net purchases of over 220 million DOGE, which equals more than $37 million (calculated at current rates). He pointed out that whales now own approximately 10.52 billion tokens, constituting roughly 7% of Dogecoin’s circulating supply. When such large investors buy substantial amounts of DOGE, they effectively decrease the available number of tokens on the open market. If demand remains constant or increases, this reduction can lead to upward pressure on the price. ​ Such actions can also be interpreted as a signal of confidence in the asset’s future performance, which could encourage additional buying from retail investors, further driving up the valuation. Musk’s Recent Comments Elon Musk’s entry into the US political scene several months ago triggered huge enthusiasm among DOGE proponents. Tesla’s CEO was appointed to lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). The division has the same abbreviation as the popular meme coin, while the billionaire is known as a firm supporter of the latter. And while the crypto community expected some kind of endorsement, Musk’s recent comments poured cold water on such hopes. He said the US government has no plans to use DOGE in any form. “They happen to be similar names, but really, we’re literally just trying to make the government 15% more efficient,” he added. That said, bulls will have to wait for other catalysts that could push the price up in the near future . One example is the potential approval of a spot DOGE ETF in America. Grayscale, Bitwise, and Osprey Funds are some of the firms that have submitted applications to launch this type of product. The chances of a green light before the end of the year are currently projected to be just below 70%.

All the tariffs will take effect immediately. Markets have receded over recent weeks in anticipation of the tariffs, but a much greater degree of certainty could now be restored. Will the U.S. stock market and Bitcoin start reversing their downward trends? What really matters to the market For markets, what really matters isn’t news that has the potential to send them rapidly in one direction or the other, it is ‘certainty’, or as close to that as it is possible to get. The news can be really bad or extremely good, but as long as the market is able to price this in, huge spikes up or down can generally be avoided. Will the tariffs already be sufficiently priced in? The U.S. stock market, and also Bitcoin, given the strong correlation, have come down relatively hard over the last few weeks due to the large uncertainty over President Trump’s tariffs. The market has not known with any degree of confidence just how harsh the tariffs would be, or how many countries they would affect. Therefore, once this is known later on Wednesday, when President Trump announces the tariffs at a formal event, it may be that the amount the stock market has already dipped, could be more than what will be priced in, thereby allowing the market to start reversing its current downtrend. U.S. stock market primed for a bounce Source: TradingView The S&P 500 has dipped as much as 10.6% from top to bottom. The horizontal support band from $5,635 down to $5,560 is currently holding, so a rally could take place from here. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI, and the Relative Strength Index, are also both in excellent positions for a bounce. If one looks at the charts of all the ‘magnificent seven’ stocks, a very similar scenario is happening there. Trend changes are potentially just starting to take place. If you also throw Bitcoin into the mix, this is one more asset perfectly primed for take-off. Impetus needed for Bitcoin Source: TradingView The short-term chart for Bitcoin shows that a ceiling is over the price. This is formed by the horizontal resistance at $85,000, plus the descending trendline . The bulls need some impetus in the form of some bullish event. This could potentially be the U.S. stock market spiking higher. Weekly chart has $BTC primed for Breakout Source: TradingView The weekly view of the $BTC price shows just how primed Bitcoin is for that breakout. Some good horizontal support has developed under the price, and it just remains for the bulls to break the ascending trendline and confirm above. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart has the indicators very close to the 20.00 level. If this is passed by both indicators, with the blue line on top, momentum should lift the price higher. The more unlikely scenario is that $BTC is once more rejected at the descending trendline, and a breakdown to $70,000 occurs. That said, the key is the U.S. stock market, and how it reads today’s tariffs announcement. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Projects built on the popular Solana network, including applications and job boards, are getting hit by the rising attacks. Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) operatives pose as legit remote workers to infiltrate companies, take over critical systems and steal sensitive data which is likely sold to “generate revenue for the regime.” The increased threat in Europe is a shift from a U.S.-heavy focus as DPRK-linked entities faced heat from DOJ indictments and tighter hiring scrutiny stateside. The report reveals that one such worker juggled 12 fake personas across the U.S. and Europe and sought employment by fabricating references, building a rapport with job recruiters, and using additional personas they controlled to vouch for their credibility. It’s not like the workers lack coding chops either: Workers were found taking projects ranging from token hosting platform using Next.js, React and CosmosSDK, and Golang, and even created an entire Solana-based job marketplace. More blockchain-related projects involved Anchor and Rust smart contract development. One worker even developed an artificial intelligence (AI) web application using Electron, Next.js, and blockchain applications. A key culprit may be workplaces that let employees use their own devices. “(Google Cloud) believes that IT workers have identified BYOD environments as potentially ripe for their schemes, and in January 2025, IT workers are now conducting operations against their employers in these scenarios,” the report said. “Global expansion, extortion tactics, and the use of virtualized infrastructure all highlight the adaptable strategies employed by DPRK IT workers.” DPRK entities and hacking groups are one of the biggest threat actors in the crypto ecosystem, stealing an estimated $1.3 billion from projects in 2024 and conducting a $1.5 billion hack on crypto exchange Bybit in February alone.",Markets|North Korea|Hack|Solana,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 09:58:05

Recently, Whale Alert, the vigilant eye of the crypto space, reported a significant event: a whopping 370 million XRP tokens have been locked in escrow at Ripple. For those deeply invested in the crypto sphere, and especially in XRP, this news sparks a flurry of questions. What does this mean? Why is Ripple making such a move? And crucially, how will this impact the future of XRP? Let’s dive deep into this massive development and unlock the layers of meaning behind Ripple’s latest strategic maneuver. Decoding the XRP Escrow: What’s Really Happening? First, let’s break down the basics. Escrow in the cryptocurrency world, particularly for Ripple and XRP , isn’t a new concept. Think of it as a digital safety deposit box. Ripple uses escrow to manage the supply of XRP tokens systematically. These escrow accounts are essentially smart contracts designed to release XRP tokens at predetermined intervals. This process was initially set up to ensure a predictable and controlled release of XRP into the market, fostering stability and trust within the ecosystem. But why is this important, and how does it benefit the XRP community? Here’s a simplified breakdown of why Ripple utilizes XRP escrow: Predictable Supply: Escrow ensures a steady and predictable release of XRP tokens, preventing sudden floods of tokens into the market, which could potentially lead to price volatility. Transparency and Trust: By locking tokens in escrow, Ripple demonstrates transparency in its token distribution strategy. This builds trust among XRP holders and the broader crypto community as it shows a commitment to a controlled supply. Long-Term Planning: Escrow allows Ripple to plan for the long term, using the released XRP for various operational and developmental purposes, supporting the growth and expansion of the XRP Ledger and its ecosystem. In essence, escrow is a mechanism that underpins Ripple’s commitment to responsible XRP management. It’s not just about locking away tokens; it’s about strategically managing the flow of XRP to support its long-term vision. But with 370 million XRP now locked, what’s the immediate impact? The Significance of 370 Million XRP Lockup: A Closer Look The sheer volume – 370 million XRP – is what grabs attention. To put this into perspective, at current market valuations, this amount represents a significant value. Locking up such a substantial quantity signals a strong commitment from Ripple. It suggests a strategic move aimed at reinforcing the long-term value and stability of XRP . But let’s unpack the potential implications further: Aspect Potential Implication of 370 Million XRP Escrow Supply Dynamics Reduces the immediate circulating supply of XRP, potentially creating scarcity. In theory, reduced supply with stable or increasing demand could exert upward pressure on price. Market Sentiment Can be interpreted as a bullish signal. Locking up a large amount may indicate Ripple’s confidence in XRP’s future value and its commitment to its long-term success. Strategic Reserves These escrowed funds are likely reserved for future operational needs, partnerships, ecosystem development, or even strategic investments. It provides Ripple with a financial buffer and resources for growth. Investor Confidence Actions like this can bolster investor confidence by demonstrating responsible token management and a long-term vision for XRP. It reassures investors about the stability and potential of their investment. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors. While a reduced circulating supply can be a positive catalyst, market sentiment, broader economic conditions, regulatory developments, and adoption rates all play significant roles in determining cryptocurrency prices. So, while this escrow lockup is noteworthy, it’s just one piece of the larger puzzle. Ripple’s Strategic Playbook: Why Escrow Matters in the Bigger Picture? To truly understand the significance of this 370 million XRP escrow, we need to consider Ripple’s overarching strategy. Ripple has consistently emphasized the utility of XRP in facilitating faster and cheaper cross-border payments. Escrow is integral to this strategy because it allows Ripple to: Fund Operational Activities: Released XRP from escrow is used to fund Ripple’s operations, including technology development, business expansion, and supporting the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Incentivize Adoption: A portion of the released XRP may be used to incentivize partnerships and adoption of XRP-based solutions by financial institutions and other entities. Maintain Market Stability: The controlled release mechanism helps in maintaining a degree of market stability by preventing sudden supply shocks. Ripple’s use of escrow is not just a financial maneuver; it’s a strategic tool designed to foster a healthy and sustainable blockchain ecosystem around XRP. By carefully managing the supply, Ripple aims to build long-term value and utility for XRP, which is crucial for its widespread adoption and success. What Does This Mean for XRP Holders and the Crypto Community? For those holding XRP, news of a substantial escrow lockup can be viewed with cautious optimism. It reinforces the idea that Ripple is committed to a measured and strategic approach to managing the XRP supply. But what are the actionable insights for the average crypto enthusiast? Stay Informed: Keep track of announcements from Ripple and monitor on-chain data like escrow transactions reported by Whale Alert. Understanding these movements can provide insights into Ripple’s strategy. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Ripple’s escrow strategy is inherently long-term focused. This lockup reinforces their commitment to the future of XRP. Investors should align their perspective accordingly, considering XRP as a long-term investment rather than a get-rich-quick scheme. Diversify and Manage Risk: While escrow news can be positive, the crypto market is volatile. Diversification remains a key strategy to manage risk. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if that basket seems to be getting more secure. Understand Market Dynamics: The price of XRP, like any cryptocurrency , is influenced by numerous factors. Escrow is just one of them. Keep an eye on broader market trends, regulatory news, and adoption updates to get a holistic view. Ultimately, the 370 million XRP escrow lockup is a significant event that underscores Ripple’s strategic approach to managing XRP. It’s a move that reflects long-term planning and a commitment to stability and growth within the XRP ecosystem. For XRP holders and the broader crypto community, it’s a reminder of the intricate dynamics at play behind the scenes and the importance of staying informed and strategic in this ever-evolving digital landscape. Looking Ahead: The Future of XRP and Ripple’s Strategic Escrows As we move forward, expect Ripple to continue utilizing escrow as a key tool in its XRP management strategy. These strategic lockups are likely to remain a recurring feature, designed to support the long-term health and stability of the XRP market. The 370 million XRP lockup is not just a number; it’s a statement – a statement of intent, strategy, and commitment from Ripple to the future of XRP. In conclusion, the recent 370 million XRP escrow lockup by Ripple is more than just a transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver with potential implications for supply dynamics, market sentiment, and investor confidence. While the crypto market remains complex and multifaceted, understanding these strategic moves provides valuable insights into the long-term vision and commitment of key players like Ripple. By staying informed and adopting a strategic perspective, stakeholders can navigate the exciting yet volatile world of XRP and cryptocurrency with greater clarity and confidence.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitmex-founder-arthur-hayes-makes-bitcoin-price-prediction-for-2025-here-are-the-details/,"BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes suggested that Bitcoin’s price action is entirely driven by market expectations regarding future fiat money supply. Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $250K by Year-End Amid Fed Policy Shift In his latest article, Hayes argues that Bitcoin (BTC) could climb toward a $250,000 target by the end of 2025 if the U.S. Federal Reserve makes a major policy shift from quantitative tightening (QT) to quantitative easing (QE) for Treasury bonds. According to Hayes, Bitcoin responds sharply to changes in monetary policy, acting as a barometer for global liquidity conditions. Hayes points out that previous periods of aggressive money printing, such as during the COVID-19 stimulus period, have led to significant rallies in Bitcoin and other risk assets. If the Fed reverses its QT stance and continues to buy Treasuries through QE, it could inject a large amount of liquidity into the financial system. Hayes argues that this will drive investors into hard assets like Bitcoin, strengthening Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against fiat devaluation. Can Bitcoin Reach $250K? Hayes’ $250,000 Bitcoin price target is based on the assumption that the Fed will ease in the face of economic pressures. While such a target is ambitious, increasing speculation that monetary policy will shift could further fuel bullish sentiment in the crypto market. With Bitcoin set to surpass its all-time high in 2025, macro trends and central bank policies could play a decisive role in determining whether Hayes can achieve his six-figure prediction. *This is not investment advice.

The figure is two thirds of the total amount stolen across 2024, although it's worth noting that the majority of Q1's losses can be attributed to the $1.45 billion Bybit hack. Aside from that, CertiK analyzed 197 hacking incidents in Q1, 98 of which occurred on Ethereum. The two largest hacks following Bybit were the $71 million Phemex heist in January and the $49.5 million exploit suffered by crypto neobank Infini. Phishing attacks, which involve stealing a victim's credentials to gain access to personal accounts, remains the highest attack vector accounting for 81 incidents. There were also 15 incidents of private key compromise. Only 0.38% of stolen funds in Q1 have been returned compared to 42.09% in the previous quarter, making the adjusted loss much higher. In February no stolen funds were returned at all.",Finance|Hack|Exploit|CertiK,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 10:06:03

Despite the altcoin crash, the crypto market cap is up 0.50% and currently sits at $2.7 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) was one of the handful of cryptocurrencies to register an increase, rising just over 1% to cross $84,000. However, the flagship cryptocurrency remains down by over 4% over the past week. Ethereum (ETH) registered a marginal increase over the past 24 hours but is yet to reclaim $2,000, with the price languishing just above $1,850. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) dropped almost 1% to $2.08 as sellers looked to drive the price below $2. Most altcoins have registered substantial declines over the past 24 hours, with Solana (SOL) down almost 2% and trading at $124. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) are down nearly 1%, while Toncoin (TON) registered a significantly larger decline, falling almost 4%. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Polkadot (DOT) , and Litecoin (LTC) have also registered substantial declines. Altcoins Register Substantial Decline Several prominent altcoins and meme coins registered a significant decline on April 1. The decline comes despite April being a historically strong month for crypto and the broader market. However, market sentiment remains cautious due to macroeconomic uncertainties. Riya Sehgal, Research Analyst at Delta Exchange, stated, “The upcoming ISM Services PMI, US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP), and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech could drive volatility, alongside former President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement. These factors may cause fluctuations in IV, leading to both periods of contraction and expansion.” Despite the downturn, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) registered notable increases. According to Sehgal, BTC must hold above $84,000 to maintain its bullish structure and retain chances of a potential upside. A break above $85,000 could open the door for a move to $90,000. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) registered a marginal increase to maintain its upward trajectory. However, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is struggling to reclaim $2,000. Altcoins, however, traded primarily in the red, with Ripple (XRP) down over 1%, while Dogecoin dropped towards $0.168, falling almost 1%. Solana (SOL) is down nearly 2% as it struggles to stay above $120, while Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (ADA), Toncoin (TON), Chainlink (LINK), and Litecoin (LTC) also registered substantial losses. Crypto Traders In Wait-And-See Mode Bitcoin (BTC) maintained its position above $83,000 as traders prepare for President Donald Trump’s next tariff-related announcement, expected this week. While BTC and ETH made notable gains, altcoins remained in the red as markets adopted a wait-and-see approach. Presto Research Analyst Min Jung stated, “​​Right now, the market is in a wait-and-see mode, as the details of the tariffs have yet to be disclosed.” Trump is expected to announce “several massive tariffs” later today. According to reports, analysts worry the latest tariffs could cause a chain reaction and trigger a global trade war. Jung added, “There's a mix of sentiment. Some investors believe the impact may be less severe than initially feared, viewing the recent dip as a potential 'buy the dip' opportunity. However, many traders are still opting to remain on the sidelines until there's greater clarity. The market's next move will largely hinge on the tone and substance of the actual announcement.” UK Trade Bodies Urge Government To Make Crypto A Priority Several British trade associations have urged Prime Minister Keir Starmer to appoint a special envoy dedicated to crypto. They have also asked for a dedicated action plan for digital assets and blockchain technology. In a letter written on March 31, the coalition of six UK digital economy trade bodies urged the Prime Minister’s special advisor on business and investment, Varun Chandra, for a greater strategic focus and alignment to deliver investments, growth, and jobs for the crypto industry. The coalition comprises the UK Cryptoasset Business Council, Global Digital Finance, The Payments Association, Digital Currencies Governance Group, the Crypto Council for Innovation, and techUK. They also highlighted the US’ shift on crypto under the Trump administration. The coalition letter stated, “Britain’s commitment to an economic trade deal focused on technological cooperation with the US presents a significant opportunity to mirror the United States’ ambition in fostering leadership in blockchain, digital assets, and other emerging financial technologies.” The group also called for creating a dedicated government action plan for crypto and blockchain technology. SEC Seeks 60-Day Delay In Gemini Lawsuit The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Gemini Trust have requested a 60-day stay in their ongoing lawsuit to explore a potential resolution. The motion was submitted to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 1 and requests the court postpone all future deadlines as discussions occur. The SEC filed its first lawsuit against Gemini Trust and Genesis Global Capital, claiming they unlawfully raised billions through the Gemini Earn program without registering it as a securities offering. The lawsuit was part of a broader crackdown on crypto firms under the Biden administration. Gemini had previously agreed to return $2.18 billion to customers as part of a settlement with New York regulators. However, the motion did not specify if discussions could lead to a settlement, dismissal, or another resolution. Both parties have stated that pausing the case is in the public interest and conserves judicial resources. The SEC and Gemini also agreed to provide a joint update within 60 days of the request being approved. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) recovered on Tuesday as it reclaimed $85,000. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has dropped during the ongoing session, as selling pressure forces the price back below $85,000. BTC’s push above $84,000 comes after it registered a substantial decline of over 4% last week. According to data from Crypto Finance, Bitcoin dominance has increased to 61.4%, marking a substantial shift towards BTC and cementing its position as a resilient asset during periods of market stress. However, it also urged traders to remain cautious as economic uncertainties, including President Trump’s tariffs and stagflation risks, could pressure BTC, thanks to its correlation with Equity markets during risk-off sentiment. “Bitcoin dominance increased to 61.4%, underscoring a rotation toward BTC as the relatively more resilient asset during market stress.” The report added that as long as market uncertainty and volatility persist, BTC would retain its relative strength. However, if risk appetite returns, the market could see some mean reversion in ETH/BTC and broader altcoin performance. However, the report stresses that the market favors caution for now. BTC encountered a testing weekend that saw the price register a substantial decline, plunging to a low of $81,578. However, the markets showed signs of a recovery on Monday, as BTC registered a marginal increase despite considerable selling pressure. BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, rising almost 2% to reach an intraday high of $88,839 before settling at $87,523.

BTC is back in the red during the ongoing session, down almost 1% and trading at $84,622, having slipped below the 20-day SMA. Sellers will look to retain control and drive BTC towards $80,000. Analysts have predicted BTC could slip below $80,000 this week. A break below this level could see a decline to $75,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) failed to push above $2,000 despite a positive start to the week and surging past $1,900. However, it lost momentum after coming across resistance around $1,920. However, buyers have not ceded much ground to the bears, keeping ETH above $1,800. While ETH has recovered during the week, it faces significant challenges, with the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency losing over half its value since December. ETH started the previous week on a bullish note, rising almost 4% on Monday, pushing above the 20-day SMA and $2,000 and settling at $2,082.

On the other hand, buyers will look to regain control and attempt a move past $2,000. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has been trading sideways since Sunday as traders wait for the next catalyst to dictate price action. SOL has struggled to build momentum in recent sessions, losing key support levels and losing over half its value since reaching $295 in January.

Tether owns 100,521 BTC in total, meaning the firm holds nearly 8,000 BTC outside its reserves wallet, according to the crypto data platform Arkham . The stablecoin issuer announced in May 2023 that it would regularly allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits toward buying Bitcoin, and it purchased 8,888 BTC worth $735 million in the first quarter of 2025. Tether chief executive Paolo Ardoino said in 2023 that Bitcoin had emerged as a store of value and “continually proven its resilience.” “Our investment in Bitcoin is not only a way to enhance the performance of our portfolio, but it is also a method of aligning ourselves with a transformative technology that has the potential to reshape the way we conduct business and live our lives.” Tether issues USDT, the largest stablecoin by market cap.

Strategy in a bull flag Source: TradingView Strategy, fresh from a recent huge purchase, worth $1.92 billion, now has a likely unassailable lead over other Bitcoin-oriented companies, as its holdings have grown to over 528,000 BTC. Looking at the weekly time frame chart, it can be seen that a bull flag is now able to be drawn, which is extremely bullish going forward. Tuesday’s more than 6% rise has moved the price back towards the top trendline of the bull flag, although it has met with some resistance here. Wednesday’s open is suggesting a retrace back to $301, but with the Stochastic RSI indicator lines rising at the bottom of the chart, more upside momentum could be incoming. Boyaa bull flag ready for breakout Source: TradingView Boyaa is a company that doesn’t receive much mention in Western press, but it is the biggest holder of BTC in Asia, with 3,183 BTC, worth over $270 million. An online board and card game company would probably not be expected to rank high in Bitcoin circles, but this one certainly does. The weekly chart, with data from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, shows that the price is inside a bull flag, and is currently poised for breakout. If the breakout is successful, a measured move could take the price to over $8 HKD, which is more than double the current price. Metaplanet at bottom of triangle and ready to rise Source: TradingView Metaplanet, listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, is more known in the West. After following Michael Saylor’s Strategy playbook, this company has received a new lease of life, with a price surge that took it more than 2,000% higher since it started buying Bitcoin in 2024. Currently, the price is hovering at the bottom of the triangle, but a bounce may not be far off, as long as Bitcoin starts to reverse its downtrend. Upside targets are based on the Fibonacci levels in the chart above. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Speculation over whether the regulatory body will vote to withdraw its appeal has left traders uncertain, contributing to heightened selling pressure. This uncertainty, combined with broader market corrections, has made XRP vulnerable to further declines. XRP’s Battle with Resistance and Market Pressures Following recent price fluctuations, XRP has struggled to maintain its footing above key support levels. After breaking past the $2.20 threshold earlier in the week, the token slipped back to $2.10, indicating a lack of strong buying momentum. If the SEC’s decision is delayed or if concerns persist, XRP risks falling below the critical $2 mark. As of now, XRP commands a market capitalization of $122.3 billion. However, it remains significantly below its all-time high of $3.84, hovering within a tight trading range of $2.05 to $2.50. Market sentiment suggests that bearish forces could soon push the token toward an even deeper correction. Indicators Point to Mounting Bearish Momentum A series of technical indicators reinforces the notion that XRP is currently facing strong downward pressure . The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 39, reflecting weak momentum well below the neutral 50 threshold. Meanwhile, the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) has plunged to -182.70, signaling that the asset is deep in oversold territory. Further confirming the bearish bias, the Stochastic Oscillator is at a concerning 11.67%, highlighting a lack of strong buying activity. The Awesome Oscillator, which remains in negative territory at -0.13, underscores the growing dominance of sellers in the market. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator prints a negative reading of -0.06, reinforcing the bearish outlook. The Momentum Indicator holds steady at -0.31, further suggesting that downward pressure is unlikely to ease in the near term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Risk of a Larger Decline Given the overwhelming bearish sentiment, XRP faces the risk of a major downturn if it fails to hold key support levels. A drop below $2 could trigger a cascade of panic selling, potentially pushing the asset down to $1.80 or lower. Unless bullish traders step in to provide support, the most probable direction remains downward, with technical indicators offering little hope for a swift recovery. External Market Factors Could Exacerbate Volatility Beyond XRP-specific concerns, broader macroeconomic uncertainties are also weighing on the crypto market. Recession fears, labor market instability in the United States, and ongoing trade policy developments have all contributed to the volatility seen in recent weeks. However, for XRP, much depends on the outcome of the SEC’s decision regarding its appeal. If regulators opt to withdraw the case against Ripple, the market could see a significant shift in sentiment, potentially providing the token with a much-needed boost. Until then, traders remain on edge, watching for any developments that could influence XRP’s next major move.

Despite these losses, the PEPE price remains above the $0.0000074 support level, signaling possible resilience. Analysts suggest that after testing a falling wedge pattern, the meme coin could experience a surge, potentially increasing by 130-140% if the market stabilizes. Is 130%-140% Price Surge Possible for Pepe Coin Price After Falling Wedge Breakout? The Pepe Coin price is currently experiencing a slight correction while testing a critical resistance level within a falling wedge pattern. This technical setup suggests that the token may be on the verge of a breakout. Analysts are closely watching for any signs of a significant move as the token approaches this key resistance zone. A breakout from this pattern could potentially trigger a bullish wave, with estimates indicating a price surge of 130% to 140% in the midterm. This setup has caught the attention of many analysts in the crypto space, offering an exciting opportunity for those tracking the PEPE price action. The outcome will depend on whether the token can maintain its momentum and successfully break through the resistance in the coming days. Whale Purchase of 492B PEPE Sparks Surge The whale transaction witnessed in the crypto market on April 1, 2025, marks a significant event as a fresh wallet acquired a staggering 492 billion PEPE tokens valued at $3.74 million. This move sent ripples through the community, drawing attention to the sudden surge in demand for the token. As the market absorbs this large buy order, the value of PEPE may experience upward pressure. However, the effect will depend on whether this whale continues to accumulate or if other traders follow suit.

Currently, the price of PEPE is at $0.000000746, marking a decrease of about 3% in the past 24 hours. The crypto market is still fluctuating, with bulls and bears struggling to control. The BTC price is currently hovering above $85,k and the ETH price is currently above $1,850, with slight market movement. The Pepe coin price has experienced a significant drop, but the price is finding support near the $0.000000700 level. A reversal could occur if it breaks through key resistance levels, specifically at $0.000001 and $0.0000015. These levels act as potential milestones for a rebound. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) shows a positive momentum shift, while the MACD indicator indicates some bullish movement in the short term. The moving averages gradually converge, which could signal an upward trend. Source: TradingView If the Pepe coin price prediction can maintain its momentum and break through resistance, it could reach $0.000002 in the near future, which represents an upside of approximately 161% from the current price.

This prediction comes after the Ethereum network flipped Solana in a key metric, signaling a possible trend reversal. Ethereum Flips Solana in Key Network Metric The Ethereum network has been lagging behind Solana in terms of decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes for the last six months. However, Ethereum has now reclaimed its top position as the king of DeFi. Data from DeFiLlama shows that Ethereum has attained monthly DEX volumes of $64 billion, which is higher than Solana’s $52 billion in volumes. The data further shows that Solana has been topping this metric since October. DEX Volumes The main reason why Ethereum has retaken the top spot is because of fading meme coin activity on Solana. Despite diversification attempts by PumpFun , the ongoing market turmoil has hampered speculative trading activity that is rampant with meme coins. Top Analyst Says Ethereum Price Is Extremely Undervalued According to top crypto market analyst Crypto Rover, Ethereum price shows signs of being “extremely overvalued.” In his Ethereum price prediction , the analyst observed that ETH had posted four consecutive red months. This scenario was last seen during the 2018 bear market before a strong upward breakout. Ethereum Price Chart If ETH is indeed undervalued, it suggests that the recent dip may have pushed the altcoin to a local bottom. This might precede a strong move to the upside. However, despite the analyst’s positive forecast for Ethereum price, ETH is facing intense selling pressure. A recent Coingape article reported that since February 25, Ethereum whales have sold more than 760,000 tokens. At the same time, ETH ETF inflows from SoSoValue show intense selling by institutions. Ethereum Technical Analysis as Q2 Hints at 60% Gains Coinglass data shows that Q2 has been the second-best performing quarter for Ethereum price. The altcoin records average returns of 60% during the quarter, and if history rhymes, ETH could surge past $3,000. On the shorter 4-hour time frame chart, Ethereum price has formed a rounding bottom pattern, which might precede a reversal of the trend from bearish to bullish. The height of this rounding bottom suggests that ETH can record a 7.96% price rally from its current price and reach $2,062. Breaking the $2,000 psychological barrier is bullish for Ethereum, and could spark the beginning of a positive quarter for this altcoin. The RSI has risen to 50, which is a neutral level where both buyers and sellers are battling for control. Meanwhile, the AO bars have flipped to the positive side, a sign that the underlying momentum is now bullish. ETH/USD: 4-Hour Chart To sum up, Ethereum is flashing positive signals, which suggest that the price might soon soar past the $2,000 psychological barrier. With analysts predicting that ETH may be extremely undervalued and network activity rising, the altcoin might be on the verge of a trend reversal.

42800532,https://coinpaper.com/8320/game-stop-and-tether-bet-big-on-bitcoin-in-treasury-shake-up,1743595200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,GameStop and Tether Bet Big on Bitcoin in Treasury Shake-Up,https://coinpaper.com/8320/game-stop-and-tether-bet-big-on-bitcoin-in-treasury-shake-up,"Two major players from vastly different industries — video game retailer GameStop and stablecoin issuer Tether — have made significant Bitcoin acquisitions in the first quarter of 2025, signaling a growing trend among companies to diversify their balance sheets with digital assets. GameStop announced the completion of a $1.5 billion private offering of convertible notes to fund its Bitcoin purchases, while Tether acquired 8,888 Bitcoin worth approximately $750 million, increasing its total holdings to over $8.4 billion. Both moves come amid ongoing regulatory discussions and market debate over the role of Bitcoin in corporate treasury strategies. GameStop Raises $1.5 Billion to Buy Bitcoin, Signaling Bold Treasury Strategy Shift Video game retailer GameStop has officially closed its highly anticipated $1.5 billion private offering of convertible notes, revealing in a regulatory filing that it plans to deploy the capital toward acquiring Bitcoin. The move marks a significant strategic pivot for the company, which has long been at the center of meme-stock culture and retail investor speculation. In a filing submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, GameStop confirmed the completion of its private offering of 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2030. The offering included the full exercise of the initial purchaser’s option to buy an additional $200 million in notes, raising the total proceeds to $1.5 billion. The company stated explicitly that the funds will be used to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet, drawing a clear parallel to the playbook employed by business intelligence firm Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) in 2020, when it became one of the first publicly traded companies to make large-scale Bitcoin purchases as part of its treasury strategy. A Bold But Polarizing Move GameStop’s announcement initially fueled a brief rally in its stock price last week as crypto and equity markets reacted to the news. However, the rally was short-lived. Shares of the company have since pulled back, suggesting a growing skepticism among investors and analysts about the long-term viability and prudence of tying the retailer's treasury strategy to a volatile digital asset. GameStop stock price (Source: Google Finance ) The decision comes at a time when GameStop is sitting on over $4 billion in cash reserves and has reported $3.8 billion in revenue in 2024, according to its latest financial disclosures. This strong balance sheet could provide the company with enough financial cushion to absorb the risk of exposure to Bitcoin’s price swings. However, analysts and market watchers remain divided over whether the move represents visionary leadership or a high-stakes gamble. GameStop’s foray into Bitcoin is reminiscent of Strategy’s pioneering move in August 2020, when the software company initiated its now-famous Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Strategy’s stock soared over the following years as the price of Bitcoin surged, but the company also faced criticism over its heavy exposure to a volatile and largely unregulated asset. GameStop’s pivot mirrors this strategy almost four years later but comes with key differences. While MicroStrategy’s move was led by CEO Michael Saylor’s personal conviction in Bitcoin as ”digital gold,” GameStop’s decision appears more corporate and tactical, likely aimed at leveraging its meme stock status and the interest of crypto-native retail investors. Bitcoin’s Role in Corporate Treasuries: Growing Trend or Risky Bet? GameStop’s move reignites the broader debate about whether corporations should allocate treasury reserves to Bitcoin. While Strategy and Tesla famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in the past, many publicly traded companies have remained cautious amid regulatory uncertainty and the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency markets. Still, GameStop’s announcement may encourage other companies with strong balance sheets and millennial-driven brand equity to follow suit, further blurring the lines between traditional corporations and digital asset ecosystems. GameStop has yet to disclose the specific details of its Bitcoin acquisition plan, including how much Bitcoin it intends to purchase and when those transactions will occur. Market participants will be watching closely in the coming weeks and months for SEC filings and company statements that could shed light on the scale and timing of its purchases. Tether Acquires 8,888 Bitcoin in Q1 2025, Expanding Holdings to Over $8.4 Billion Amid Regulatory Scrutiny Meanwhile, Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings in the first quarter of 2025, adding 8,888 BTC to its balance sheet, according to onchain data. The latest acquisition, valued at approximately $750 million at the time of writing, underlines Tether’s ongoing strategy of diversifying its reserves beyond traditional assets such as US Treasurys and cash equivalents. Blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence tracked the movement of the Bitcoin purchase from a Bitfinex-associated address to a wallet controlled by Tether. This latest transaction brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 100,521 BTC, currently valued at $8.46 billion. Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset Tether’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation is part of its broader investment strategy to diversify reserve holdings and generate returns outside of conventional financial instruments. Since 2023, the company has been transparent about its intent to hold Bitcoin as part of its reserve portfolio, positioning the digital asset as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risk. This latest purchase also arrives in the wake of regulatory discussions that could have significant implications for Tether’s Bitcoin reserves. In February, JPMorgan analysts suggested that pending US stablecoin legislation might require Tether to liquidate certain ”non-compliant” assets, including Bitcoin, precious metals, and secured loans, to meet new reserve standards. The report warned that under the proposed bills, Tether could be forced to divest its riskier holdings and replace them with cash or short-term US Treasurys to maintain its status as a compliant stablecoin issuer. Tether, however, was quick to dismiss the report’s conclusions. A spokesperson for the firm responded publicly, criticizing the analysts for lacking a fundamental understanding of both Tether and Bitcoin. The company emphasized that no stablecoin laws have yet been finalized in the US, and any assertions about forced divestment remain speculative at best. Tether’s Expanding Investment Empire Tether’s Bitcoin acquisitions are only one facet of the firm’s increasingly aggressive investment strategy. After posting $13 billion in profits in 2024, Tether has used its massive cash reserves to pursue high-profile and unconventional investments that extend far beyond cryptocurrency markets. The company has become the world’s seventh-largest buyer of US Treasurys, surpassing major economies such as Canada, Taiwan, and Mexico. Tether’s appetite for strategic investments has also reached mainstream sectors. In February 2025, Tether acquired a majority stake in Juventus FC, one of Italy’s top football clubs, in a landmark move that shook the sports and financial worlds. A month later, the firm invested €10 million ($10.8 million) in Italian media company Be Water, further embedding itself in Italy’s business landscape. Additionally, Tether has sought to acquire a controlling interest in South American agribusiness giant Adecoagro, signaling its ambitions to become a diversified financial powerhouse. Tether’s growing influence is also evident in its prior investments. Video platform Rumble, in which Tether invested $775 million in late 2024, recently launched a wallet feature supporting USDT payments for content creators — a development seen as a move toward greater stablecoin adoption in digital economies. Recent blockchain data also shows Tether minted an additional $1 billion worth of USDT on the Tron blockchain on March 31, indicating sustained demand for the stablecoin despite regulatory uncertainty and competitive pressures from emerging fiat-pegged tokens. Historically, large-scale USDT minting has often coincided with upward momentum in Bitcoin prices. Analysts suggest that the increased supply of stablecoins contributes to market liquidity and provides fresh capital inflows into the broader crypto ecosystem. David Pakman, managing partner at crypto investment firm CoinFund, recently forecasted that the global stablecoin supply could surge to $1 trillion by the end of 2025. If realized, this exponential growth could catalyze further adoption of digital assets, including Bitcoin, and enhance Tether’s role as a market heavyweight. The Regulatory Crossroads While Tether’s financial strength and growing investment footprint appear impressive, its Bitcoin strategy could face future challenges. The debate surrounding stablecoin regulation in the United States remains ongoing, and the eventual outcome could force structural adjustments in Tether’s reserve strategy. For now, Tether shows no signs of slowing down. Its Q1 Bitcoin purchase, combined with a diversified portfolio of investments in finance, sports, media, and technology, signals a clear intent to evolve beyond the realm of crypto markets and become an institutional player on the global financial stage.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-02 12:00:00

Price action is consolidative and leaning slightly bearish in the short term. By Edris Derakhshi The USDT Paired Chart On the USDT pair, XRP is currently hovering above the $2 support zone after a series of lower highs following the rejection from the $3.00 resistance area. The asset has yet to make a higher high since mid-February and continues to face selling pressure on each attempt to rally. The 200-day moving average is rising steadily and currently sits well below the price near the $1.80 mark, acting as dynamic support for now. The RSI is also drifting near the 40–45 zone, suggesting weakening momentum without being fully oversold. If the buyers fail to defend the $2, the price may quickly slide toward the next demand around $1.50. On the other hand, to shift sentiment, XRP needs to reclaim $2.5 and close firmly above it. The BTC Paired Chart The XRP/BTC pair has been consolidating after a strong rally in November last year, with the price currently trading around 2,500 SAT. The pair has faced resistance near 3,000 SAT, which has led to the recent pullback. The 200-day moving average at approximately 2,000 SAT remains intact, indicating that, similar to the USDT pair, the broader uptrend is still in play. Yet, the RSI is trending lower, suggesting a potential weakening of momentum, but as long as XRP holds above 2,000 SAT, a bullish continuation above the 3,000 SAT area could be expected.

The assault is contributing to increasing fears of investor desperation as more collapses in the country’s digital asset sector continue. Investor Broke Into CEO’s Home Over Unanswered Fund Recovery Questions The perpetrator, who goes by Mr. A, is said to have lost 87 BTC and 190 ETH when Delio ceased operations in 2023. Frustrated with the silence, he went to see CEO Jeong Sang-ho at his home. An argument turned violent, and the police were called in. A summary fine of 1.5 million won ($1,023) for breaking and entering and assault was issued to Mr. A. While punished, he can still appeal the judgment in court.

Yet, despite this strong buying activity, Bitcoin’s price dropped from $94,400 to $82,500, a 12% decline. So, who’s buying? Why is Bitcoin falling? And what’s next for the market? Tether and MicroStrategy Lead the Buying Spree One of the most unexpected buyers this quarter was Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT. Tether added 8,888 BTC in Q1, bringing its total holdings to 92,646 BTC. While Tether’s involvement in Bitcoin is not new, this latest addition has raised eyebrows in the crypto space. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy , already known as the biggest corporate Bitcoin holder, continued its aggressive buying strategy. The company purchased 81,785 BTC in Q1, spending over $8 billion to increase its already massive Bitcoin holdings. Other companies also joined the trend: The Blockchain Company added 605 BTC. Semler Scientific increased its holdings by 1,108 BTC. Metaplanet bought 2,285 BTC. Who’s Planning to Buy Next? While these companies have already made huge purchases, CryptoQuant notes that others are preparing to buy more Bitcoin. Marathon Digital, a well-known Bitcoin mining firm, is planning a $2 billion stock sale to fund more BTC purchases. Similarly, GameStop has proposed a $1.3 billion convertible note offering, signaling its intent to incorporate Bitcoin into its strategy. If Companies Are Buying, Why Is Bitcoin Falling? Despite corporate buying, Bitcoin’s price still fell by 12% in Q1. CryptoQuant points to two key factors that may have driven the decline. Firstly, the long-term holders sold off a massive 178,000 BTC during the quarter, adding significant sell pressure that outweighed corporate purchases. Another major factor was the outflows from Bitcoin ETFs. In Q1, around $4.8 billion flowed out of Bitcoin ETFs, adding even more downward pressure on the market. CryptoQuant Suggestion CryptoQuant’s analysis suggests that only if this selling slows down, Bitcoin could see a strong recovery. With more companies planning big purchases, the market could soon turn bullish again.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 12:06:08
42801474,https://cryptonews.com/?p=347116,1743595572,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/42801474.jpeg,Google Warns UK Crypto Firms of North Korea-Linked Fraudsters,https://cryptonews.com/news/google-warns-uk-crypto-firms-of-north-korea-linked-fraudsters/,"According to Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) , North Korea-linked tech operatives are broadening their infiltration of global blockchain companies, with a noticeable shift toward targeting firms in the United Kingdom and Europe. The move follows heightened scrutiny from U.S. authorities, which has pushed many of these actors to seek employment beyond American borders. These operatives disguise themselves as legitimate remote workers, securing employment within firms handling sensitive blockchain and artificial intelligence projects. The Google report highlights these operatives’ evolving tactics, including the expansion of a sophisticated global network of fake identities, new extortion strategies, and exploitation of corporate bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies to evade detection. North Korea-Linked IT Fraudsters Build Global Network of Fake Identities, Says Google Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has uncovered an extensive web of fraudulent identities used by North Korean IT workers to secure employment in companies across Europe, particularly in the UK. Jamie Collier, a GTIG adviser, emphasized that these IT workers have evolved their operations in response to growing awareness in the U.S., pivoting toward European markets where scrutiny remains lower. “In response to heightened awareness of the threat within the United States, they’ve established a global ecosystem of fraudulent personas to enhance operational agility,” Collier noted. The report outlines how North Korean operatives pose as professionals from various countries, including Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Ukraine, the U.S., and Vietnam. List of countries impacted by DPRK IT workers. Source: Google Many leverage fake credentials and references to gain access to companies handling cutting-edge blockchain and AI projects. Some of the identified activities include developing blockchain-based platforms using technologies such as Solana, Anchor, Cosmos SDK, and Rust. Another activity is the creation of a job marketplace utilizing the MERN stack and Solana. Collier further warned that the presence of enablers within the UK suggests the formation of a broader support network, enabling these operatives to persist in their schemes. Report Reveals Surge in Extortion Threats by Dismissed Workers Since October The GTIG report highlights a troubling rise in extortion tactics by dismissed North Korean IT workers. Since October, these workers have increasingly resorted to threatening former employers with data leaks, seeking to sell proprietary information to competitors or expose internal project details unless paid off. “In these incidents, recently fired IT workers threatened to release their former employers’ sensitive data or to provide it to a competitor,” the report states. This data often includes proprietary code and critical company intelligence. This escalation coincides with intensified U.S. law enforcement actions, including indictments and disruptions targeting North Korean operatives. The U.S. Department of Justice recently indicted two North Korean nationals for orchestrating a fraudulent IT employment scheme that involved more than 60 companies. The U.S. Treasury has also sanctioned entities accused of operating as front companies for North Korean IT activities. These operatives’ tactics have expanded beyond mere infiltration. Previously, when IT workers were dismissed, they would attempt to re-enter companies under different identities. However, recent firings have resulted in outright extortion, indicating a shift toward more aggressive financial exploitation strategies. In a related move, Google UK has recently introduced stricter policies on crypto-related advertisements to combat fraudulent activities. @Google has announced a policy update requiring advertisements for digital asset exchanges and wallets in the UK to register with the FCA. #Google #Crypto https://t.co/MwvQojg8vE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 21, 2024 Starting January 15, 2025, all digital asset exchanges and wallet providers seeking to advertise in the UK must register with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The UK’s FCA has been actively clamping down on misleading crypto promotions. These regulatory actions align with broader global trends, where authorities have mandated pre-approval for crypto-related advertisements. With cyber threats intensifying and regulatory oversight increasing, UK-based crypto firms must remain vigilant to protect their businesses from both external and internal risks.

Ethereum Price Analysis,https://cryptopotato.com/whats-next-for-eth-after-10-weekly-decline-ethereum-price-analysis/,"Ethereum is attempting a recovery after bouncing from the $1,800 zone, but the price remains trapped below key resistance, and the broader trend is still bearish. Short-term momentum has improved slightly, but upside continuation remains uncertain. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi The Daily Chart The daily chart shows ETH stabilizing around the $1,900 area following a sharp rejection from the $2,200 zone in late March. The asset remains well below the 200-day moving average, which continues to slope downward around the $2,800 region, confirming bearish market structure on a macro level. The most recent bounce has taken the price back into the $1,900 resistance zone, but the buyers are yet to show strong follow-through. The RSI is also rebounding from oversold levels, suggesting short-term relief, but there is no bullish divergence or momentum breakout to support a sustainable trend reversal. A decisive daily close above $1,950–$2,000 would be the first signal that buyers are regaining control. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH is trading within a horizontal consolidation pattern, with the lower boundary at $1,800 and the higher one near the $2,200 region. After the recent sell-off, the price rebounded into the $1,900 supply zone but faced immediate resistance and is now pulling back slightly. Moreover, RSI hit near-overbought conditions during the bounce and is now cooling off, indicating potential consolidation or another retest of the $1,800 area. If ETH fails to break out above the higher boundary of the pattern, another leg down to sweep the $1,780–$1,750 liquidity becomes more likely. A confirmed breakout above $2,200, however, would invalidate the pattern and suggest a short-term bullish reversal. Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Exchange Reserve Ethereum’s exchange reserve has continued its multi-month downtrend, now reaching a new low of around 18.3M ETH held on trading platforms. This persistent decline suggests long-term holders and institutions are moving assets into cold storage or staking, reducing immediate sell pressure. Despite the bearish price action, the supply on exchanges is not increasing, which historically has acted as a bullish divergence when accompanied by reversal structures. The low reserves may act as a supply constraint once demand re-emerges, but for now, the lack of bullish momentum means this on-chain trend is supportive, not decisive.

However, the RSI moving average is at 46.88, meaning there is some attempt to recover, but it’s still weak. The recent lows around $0.342 act as short-term support.

A Deep Dive Into Its $1.5B Fundraising,https://coingape.com/blog/will-gamestop-bitcoin-strategy-pay-a-deep-dive-into-its-1-5b-fundraising/,"GameStop is making news again, only that this time, it has nothing to do with meme stocks. The gaming retailer is making a bold move into Bitcoin, after successfully raising $1.5 billion through a convertible note offering. This action has ignited debates in the cryptocurrency market, and the financial sector. The question at hand is whether what Gamestop is making is just a visionary bet, or a high-risk gamble that will soon backfire. This article delves deeper into Gamestop’s strategy, its potential impact on the company and Bitcoin, and whether this move could pay off. GameStop’s $1.5 Billion Fundraising: What You Need to Know GameStop recently issued convertible senior notes worth $1.5 billion to raise capital. Convertible notes allow investors to convert debt into equity, which means it is essentially taking on debt with the option of turning it into shares later. Why Raise $1.5 Billion? GameStop has been looking for methods to transform itself following the meme stock boom during the pandemic. Inspite of attempts to shift towards e-commerce and digital assets, the company has faced challenges in achieving profitability. This capital infusion provides the gaming retailer with the financial ability to consider new strategies, such as investing in Bitcoin. Initially, the gaming company had announced that it planned to secure a minimum of $1.3 billion through its convertible senior notes offering, but investor demand led to the purchase of an additional $200 million in principal amount, bringing the total to $1.5 billion, as detailed in the company’s April 1, 2025, filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission . GameStop’s Cryptocurrency Gamble: What’s the Strategy? GameStop announced that it plans to use some of its raised funds to buy Bitcoin for its reserve treasury , following in the footsteps of companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla. This marks a big shift from its usual gaming business to a wider investment approach. Potential benefits of buying Bitcoin include: Hedge against inflation: Many see Bitcoin as digital gold offering protection from currency devaluation. Drawing in crypto-savvy investors: GameStop has a large base of retail investors who are bullish on cryptocurrency. Long-term value growth : If Bitcoin’s price goes up, it could boost GameStop’s financial position. However, Bitcoin’s price swings make this a strategy with high risks and high rewards. How Does This Affect GameStop and Its Stock Price? Short-Term Market Reaction: GME stock surged following the announcement, as investors speculated on the company’s new direction. Some analysts have expressed skepticism, arguing that using debt to buy Bitcoin is a risky move. Bitcoin’s price also saw an uptick, possibly due to increased institutional confidence. Long-Term Implications: If Bitcoin’s value rises, GameStop’s balance sheet could benefit significantly. On the other hand, if Bitcoin crashes, the company could face major losses, impacting investor confidence. To manage the situtaation, GameStop could integrate crypto payments, NFTs, or blockchain-based gaming strategies to align with its Bitcoin holdings. Will GameStop’s Bitcoin Move Pay Off? Gamestops bold strategy is commendable, however, its success depends on how effectively it can integrate crypto into its business model, as well as the long-term performance of Bitcoin. Possible Scenarios: Best-case scenario : In case Bitcoin price increases, the gaming retailer’s investment will grow, boosting its financial health. Worst-case scenario: This is a case whereby GameStop could face challenges in managing its debts, and the value of Bitcoin drops. Middle ground: The company maintains Bitcoin as a long-term asset but doesn’t fully capitalize on it for business innovation. Conclusion GameStop’s choice to buy Bitcoin signals a key turning point for the company and the wider crypto world. This move comes with big risks, but it could also pay off well if Bitcoin’s value keeps going up. People who invest should watch how the company handles this change. They’ll want to see if its Bitcoin plan leads to gains over time—or if it adds another unpredictable chapter to its story. The post Will GameStop Bitcoin Strategy Pay?

42800920,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145539,1743595809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Forex Forecast: UBS Predicts EUR/USD Drop to 1.07 & Unveils Swedish Krona Strength Potential,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ubs-eur-usd-forecast-sek/,"In the fast-paced world of Forex trading, staying ahead of the curve is paramount. Major financial institutions like UBS provide crucial insights that can shape your trading strategies. Recently, UBS released its latest Forex forecast, sending ripples through the market with a significant EUR/USD target for Q2 and an optimistic outlook on the Swedish Krona (SEK). Let’s dive into the details of this potentially game-changing Forex forecast and understand what it could mean for traders and the broader currency landscape. What’s Behind UBS’s EUR/USD Forex Forecast? UBS has set a EUR/USD target of 1.07 for the second quarter of the year. This target suggests a potential weakening of the Euro against the US Dollar. But what factors are driving this prediction? Several elements could be at play: Interest Rate Differentials: The monetary policy stances of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) play a critical role. If the Fed maintains a hawkish stance with higher interest rates compared to the ECB, it typically strengthens the US Dollar, potentially pushing EUR/USD lower. Economic Growth Divergence: The relative economic performance of the Eurozone and the United States is another key determinant. If the US economy shows stronger growth momentum than the Eurozone, investors may favor the US Dollar, leading to a decline in EUR/USD . Geopolitical Factors: Global events and geopolitical tensions can significantly impact currency valuations. Uncertainty in Europe, coupled with relative stability in the US, can also contribute to Euro weakness against the Dollar. Safe-Haven Demand: In times of global economic uncertainty, the US Dollar is often considered a safe-haven asset. Increased demand for safe-haven currencies can further bolster the Dollar and pressure EUR/USD downwards. To better understand the context, let’s consider a simplified table comparing potential factors influencing EUR/USD: Factor Potential Impact on EUR/USD if Positive for USD Potential Impact on EUR/USD if Positive for EUR US Interest Rates Downward Pressure Upward Pressure (if EUR rates rise more) US Economic Growth Downward Pressure Upward Pressure (if Eurozone growth outperforms) Geopolitical Stability (US vs. Eurozone) Downward Pressure (if US more stable) Upward Pressure (if Eurozone becomes more stable) Safe-Haven Flows Downward Pressure Upward Pressure (Less likely for EUR in global crises) The Potential for Swedish Krona (SEK) Strength Interestingly, alongside the EUR/USD forecast, UBS also highlights the potential for Swedish Krona (SEK) strength. This might seem counterintuitive at first glance, especially when considering global economic uncertainties. However, several factors could support a stronger SEK: Riksbank’s Monetary Policy: The Swedish central bank, Riksbank, has been actively combating inflation. If the Riksbank continues its hawkish stance, potentially through further interest rate hikes, it could attract foreign investment and strengthen the Swedish Krona . Strong Swedish Economy Fundamentals: Sweden boasts a robust and diversified economy. Solid export performance, technological innovation, and prudent fiscal management can contribute to investor confidence in the SEK. Lower Inflation Compared to Eurozone: If Sweden manages to keep inflation under better control compared to the Eurozone, it could make SEK relatively more attractive. This is because lower inflation erodes the value of a currency less over time. Geopolitical Positioning: Sweden’s perceived neutrality and stability in a volatile geopolitical landscape can also act as a draw for investors seeking safer currencies, potentially benefiting the Swedish Krona . Actionable Insights: Trading Implications of UBS’s Forecast So, how can traders leverage this Forex forecast from UBS? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor EUR/USD Closely: Keep a close watch on the EUR/USD pair, particularly as we move into Q2. Pay attention to economic data releases from both the Eurozone and the US, as well as statements from the ECB and Fed. Consider Short EUR/USD Positions: If you align with UBS’s view, you might consider opening or increasing short positions on EUR/USD , targeting the 1.07 level. However, always manage your risk appropriately with stop-loss orders. Explore Opportunities in SEK Pairs: The potential for Swedish Krona strength suggests opportunities in pairs like USD/SEK (potential for downside) or EUR/SEK (potential for downside). Conduct thorough analysis before trading SEK pairs, as they may have different volatility characteristics compared to major pairs like EUR/USD . Diversify Your Forex Strategies: While forecasts are valuable, it’s crucial to diversify your trading strategies. Don’t rely solely on one institution’s outlook. Combine UBS’s insights with your own technical and fundamental analysis. Stay Informed on Global Events: Geopolitical developments and unexpected economic shifts can rapidly alter currency valuations. Stay informed about global news that could impact the Forex forecast and adjust your strategy accordingly. Challenges and Risks to Consider It’s important to remember that any Forex forecast , including UBS’s, is not a guarantee. Currency markets are inherently volatile and influenced by a multitude of factors, many of which are unpredictable. Here are some challenges and risks to keep in mind: Forecast Accuracy: Economic forecasts are subject to error. Unexpected events, policy changes, or shifts in market sentiment can invalidate even the most well-researched predictions. Market Volatility: The Forex market is known for its volatility. EUR/USD and SEK pairs can experience sharp and sudden movements, especially during periods of economic uncertainty or major news releases. Execution Risk: Even if a forecast proves accurate, successfully executing trades to profit from it requires careful timing and risk management. Slippage and unexpected market gaps can impact trading outcomes. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen ‘black swan’ events – rare, high-impact occurrences – can completely disrupt market expectations and render existing forecasts irrelevant. Conclusion: Navigating the Forex Landscape with Informed Insights UBS’s Forex forecast provides valuable insights into potential movements in EUR/USD and the Swedish Krona . While suggesting a possible dip for EUR/USD to 1.07 and highlighting SEK strength, it’s crucial to approach this information with a balanced perspective. Use these insights to inform your trading decisions, but always conduct your own due diligence, manage risk effectively, and stay adaptable to the ever-changing dynamics of the Forex market. By combining expert analysis with your own market understanding, you can navigate the Forex landscape with greater confidence and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities.

These tokens are all looking primed for a potentially explosive month as savvy traders scan the charts for the next big move. With encouraging chart patterns emerging on multiple timeframes, the coming weeks could set the tone for the rest of 2025. Especially bullish right now is the up-and-coming GambleFi project Rollblock , which has been capturing massive attention with the kind of momentum and Web3 innovation that could drive a 50x rally this year. Here’s why… Rollblock (RBLK): Record-Breaking Growth and a GambleFi Surge Rollblock ( RBLK ) is out to revolutionize the online gaming industry and is quickly becoming the project that everyone else will chase once it hits the mainstream. With over $11.1 million in presale inflows already and record-breaking growth in new user signups and wagered bids month after month, the platform is hitting a real stride in 2025. At the heart of Rollblock’s innovative ecosystem are 8000+ highly immersive, AI-powered games including live roulette, Monopoly, and a sports prediction league that covers thousands of real-time matches across all international sports. It’s all secured on Ethereum, delivering real blockchain transparency to a $500 billion industry that is sorely in need of a revamp after decades of manipulation and lost trust. Recently, fiat payment options via Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard are opening the door to a massive new wave of players. The project’s Gaming Anjouan license and audit by Solid Proof have given it undeniable legitimacy, and the recent rise in mobile-first GameFi adoption is playing straight into Rollblock’s hands. With the recent buzz around the Burn Dashboard preview, tokenomics are front and center too. RBLK Supply Trending Lower Long Term Rollblock’s revenue-sharing system is designed to reward holders while constantly reducing the token’s supply. Each month, 30% of Rollblock’s revenue is used to buy back RBLK – 60% of those purchased tokens are then burned, reducing the overall supply, while 40% is used to fund industry leading staking rewards of up to 30% APY. With Stage 10 of the presale already over 53% sold at $0.062, and major exchange listings coming soon, this has to be one of the most promising entries in all of Web3. Explore Crypto Nautic’s full video review here: https://youtu.be/vF8vIHIvjfE?si=uQsATqLU1fCmYW6b Bitcoin (BTC): Approaching Key Resistance at $84.6k Bitcoin is up by 4% today to reach $85.2k. According to BB Crypto , “Bitcoin can test the area of $8610-$86600 again 📈.” This aligns with today’s price movement, where support around $81,000 has held strong and daily candle closes are now crucial to maintain short-term momentum. If the bulls push past resistance, Bitcoin could soon head into price discovery again. If bulls break through $85,600, Bitcoin could make a run toward $88,000 in April. Price movement will hinge largely on ETF inflows, and whether daily candle closes remain strong above support. Ethereum (ETH): Gains 4% As Gas Fees Tumble Ethereum is trading at $1,910 today, holding steady and up 4% despite recent market volatility around the threat of a global trade war. As CoinGape Daily pointed out, “Ethereum fees are at their lowest since 2020… and no one is talking about it?” That stat might reflect low demand for Ethereum right now, but it also sets the stage for future activity to come roaring back on the network, especially if Ethereum’s role in the wider DeFi economy continues to grow. If gas fees stay low while activity picks up across layer 2s, Ethereum could target $2,500 this April. XRP: Support Tested Once Again XRP is currently up 3% today to hit $2.15, consolidating here after multiple retests of a key support level at $2. WiseCharts called this level for some time, posting today, “It’s going to be many times that we’ve tested this support, I’ve shared it multiple times.” While some traders may see this as weakness, strong support is also a sign of resilience and if XRP breaks out from here in April, it could be a launchpad that will send it all the way past resistance. If XRP finds strength in the weeks ahead and breaks above $2.50, a run back toward $3.00 is possible this month. The key will be whether XRP buying volume returns on the next retest. Solana (SOL): Downtrend Remains After Major Rejection Solana is up by 2% to reach $129 today. Solana has had a tough time recently and has lost 9% of its market cap in the last month of trading. According to Trader Emma, “The SOL/USD 4-hour chart on Binance indicates a downtrend… After a brief consolidation phase between 137 and 151, the price faced rejection at 137.88.” With take-profit levels now around $132, Solana bears still appear to be in control, and it will take strong bullish volume to reverse course in the coming days. A break above $130 could send Solana toward $150 in April, but only if market sentiment shifts and traders return to the chain. Solana’s next move also depends on trading volume recovering from the current slump, which has been in freefall ever since the recent fallout from the Libra token launch. BNB: At A Crossroads And Looking for Direction BNB is trading around $612 today, having pumped by 3.6% in the last 24 hours on strong volume. If BNB can break above $625 with bullish momentum, it may retest the $650 level this April. The trend will depend heavily on the Binance exchange’s overall platform activity and wider market growth. Marcus Corvinus noted the crossroads that BNB holders find themselves in: “Volatility is heating up, and a slight bearish trend is in play. Will the bulls step in for a comeback, or is there more downside ahead?” With volatility heating up and bears gaining slight ground, it’s a critical time for BNB bulls to step in if the trend is to shift back up. Dogecoin (DOGE): Millionaire Wallets Disappearing DOGE is sitting at $0.17 after losing 5% this week amid months of steady declines. It looks as though Dogecoin whales have sold up and moved on to other ecosystems in recent weeks, as Crypto.Andy reported, “The number of DOGE millionaire addresses plunged by 41.37%… from 1,930 to 1,154,” showing a sharp reduction in the number of large Dogecoin holders. Confidence among OG Dogecoiners has clearly dipped, but this could also create more decentralized distribution among the meme community. If Dogecoin can reclaim $0.20 with support from retail investors and a tweet or two from Elon Musk, a move toward $0.35 is within reach this month. General sentiment on X and speculative demand for memes will be the biggest drivers here. Cardano (ADA): Climbing Toward a Breakout Cardano is trading at $0.68 today, after gaining 6% in an impressive relief rally. Amina_chattha underlined just how much potential lies with this promising layer 1 token if investors buy Cardano at these beaten down levels: “If you invest $100 in ADA at $0.60 and it climbs to $1.50, your investment could grow to $250…” The setup is simple, and Cardano’s chart looks ready for a breakout. With the Midnight privacy side chain nearing launch and momentum returning, Cardano could be one of the more bullish projects right now. If ADA can hold $0.60 as support and if volume continues to build, a breakout beyond $0.80 is possible in April. Rollblock Brings The Most Bullish Potential This Month April has only just begun but has already delivered promising price action for Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, BNB, Dogecoin, Rollblock, and Cardano. These tokens are all incredibly bullish investments (if investors can stomach some volatility) but none is more compelling than Rollblock right now. With record-breaking recent growth, real revenue-sharing utility, and a fully-loaded GameFi platform, Rollblock remains the top pick for outsized gains in 2025.

While its short-term bearish remains intact on the daily scale, it is footing an increase with an inverse head-and-shoulder pattern. The past month of trading has seen CRV through a temporal suspense in the short-term bearish as the price recovered steadily for three weeks. This brought a substantial increase and is now looking strong daily Meanwhile, looking at the latest setup, it appears to be forming H&S – an inverse head-and-shoulder pattern on the daily chart. This classical pattern indicates a potential reversal in the bearish trend. If the pattern comes into play, we can expect a new positive sentiment in the market. Currently, the market bias remains bearish on the short-term scale. An increase above last week’s high should bring a complete formation of the right shoulder before breaking out of the neckline. While this may signal a slight shift, we can anticipate a major rally once it reaches the top. In the opposite direction, the bulls may lose control if supply increases. Should that happen, the price may roll back to the recent low. A break from there may cause a catastrophic loss. But with the look of things, CRV appears set for a surge following over 10% recovery in a month. CRV’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview CRV currently eyes the $0.6 resistance level, tested last month. A surge above it should allow buying at $0.762, validating the bullish H&S pattern. Above this level lies the $0.92 resistance. The latest surge is currently supported by $0.445. A fall below it could roll the price back to $0.347, with a potential breakdown to $0.27.

Once driven by hopes of regulatory clarity and renewed institutional interest, XRP has dropped 20% over the past month. A key catalyst came on March 19 for the digital asset, when Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had dropped its lawsuit over an alleged $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering. The announcement sparked a brief rally, with XRP climbing to $2.55. However, the token has since corrected by nearly 16.5%, slipping back to $2.12 at press time. XRP one-month price chart.

Based on technical indicators and market trends, the model now projects an average price target of $2, suggesting a flat projection from current levels and limited short-term upside. Finbold AI XRP price prediction. Source: Finbold Among the AI models, Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers a mildly optimistic view, projecting a move toward $2.15. The model highlights bullish signals, such as the 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) remaining above the 200-day average (SMA200). The large language model sees this as a sign of confidence, strengthened by regulatory progress and rising institutional interest. Conversely, GPT-4o maintains a conservative stance, predicting no price change (from the time of prediction) and holding firm at $2. The model points to a mixed technical picture, noting that while the SMA200 is trending upward signaling long-term strength the SMA50 is now turning downward, showing weakening short-term momentum. XRP market outlook Looking forward, XRP’s near-term direction will largely depend on the potential approval of a U.S. XRP-spot ETF , with 18 applications currently submitted to the SEC. A green light from regulators could open the door to significant institutional inflows, pushing XRP toward higher price targets. Global macroeconomic conditions including inflation data, central bank policies, and broader investor appetite for digital assets will also remain crucial. With supply-side factors creating additional headwinds , XRP’s ability to reclaim and sustain key price levels will be critical in determining whether it can break out of its current range or remain under pressure through April.

Meanwhile, the promising GameFi protocol Rollblock is on a tear, pulling in real revenue and breaking new ground in Web3 gaming. This has led some analysts to call for an astonishing 50x rally this year. Here’s why Rollblock might be the best crypto to buy in 2025. Rollblock (RBLK): Consistent Revenue and Real Adoption in GambleFi While many crypto gaming tokens rely on relentless hype and vague roadmaps, Rollblock is quietly delivering what matters most in the form of consistent revenue and steady user growth. The platform has already raised over $11.1 million in its popular presale in a matter of months and continues to see strong month-on-month increases in new signups and total deposits, as well as total wagered volume on the platform. With more than 8000 AI-powered games currently live including live Monopoly, blackjack, roulette, and a global sports prediction league, the ecosystem is packed with innovative features, and players are loving it. Every bet and payout is secured on Ethereum, bringing real blockchain transparency to an industry infamous for its lack of it. Fiat payment options through the likes of Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard make onboarding easier than ever. Rollblock stands out as one of the only GambleFi projects in 2025 that combines product-market fit with trustworthy credentials, including a Gaming Anjouan license and a full audit from Solid Proof. Even at this early stage in its development, Rollblock remains a serious business with a serious upside. The Tokenomics Behind RBLK’s Rise Rollblock’s tokenomics are built to reward holders while reducing the circulating supply of its native token RBLK. 30% of all platform revenue is used to buy back RBLK each week on the open market. A massive 60% of those tokens are burned to reduce the supply, while the remaining 40% ends up in the hands of loyal community members who can earn staking rewards of up to 30% APY. That means long-term holders can earn a passive income while the supply continues to shrink. With Stage 10 of the presale already over 53% sold at $0.062, there’s a growing urgency to get in early. Freddie Finance breaks down why here: https://youtu.be/qztj3p8uy_c?si=U1TVQ94C6Anvi6Vp Pi Coin Price (PI): Will It Rebound or Collapse? Pi Network is trading at $0.71 today, slightly above its key support zone. Despite a rally today of 4%, Pi Network holders have had to put up with a galling 22% decline in the last week of trading. The Pi Network chart may look shaky, but some traders are still hopeful a breakout is coming. As @mosesifunanya observed, “PI is locked inside a classic falling wedge pattern on the 1H chart, a formation often associated with potential bullish reversals.” Pi Network’s recent price action has been respecting the wedge boundaries closely, now pressing against the lower end where a bounce will need to take place. A breakout above $0.78 could reverse the downtrend and give Pi Network bulls something to work with. However, if support around $0.67 breaks down, the price could be heading for a deeper correction. The next few days are key to determining whether Pi Network bounces or continues grinding lower. Rollblock Runs Rings Around Other Projects Pi Network may still be trying to find its footing right now, but Rollblock is already sprinting ahead with growing revenue, adoption, and an incredible product-market fit. For investors hunting for the best crypto to buy in 2025, Rollblock looks set to lead the pack with serious upside potential from here.

This led to a serious massive explosion and is now looking strongly bullish on the daily chart. EOS has been on the bulls’ radar for the past three weeks now as volume flows back into the market. This came after mounting support at $0.435 in March but failed to overcome the $0.67 resistance after a bounce. It saw a rejection and consolidated for over a week. This led to a break out of a three-month falling resistance line before testing it as support. Yesterday, being the start of a new month, it flipped a crucial resistance level of $0.67 to a daily high of $0.82. This led to a significant shift in the daily structure and is now forming a double-bottom pattern on the weekly chart. Adjusting to the daily chart, it appears highly bullish as it posts double-digit gains today. A further surge in volatility could bring a significant recovery in the recent dip before considering a major shift in the trend. Right now, EOS appears to have found a bottom following the latest increase in the demand level. From the look of things, the trend is likely to shift completely if the bulls dominate throughout this month. There are currently no signs of the bears in the market. If they show up again, they must pull the price below last month’s low to gain control. As of now, the bulls are in charge. EOS’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The latest surge was intercepted at $0.82 while EOS target $0.99. However, if it flips through these levels in the next surge, $1.25 and $1.5 are the next resistance levels to keep an eye on. Yesterday’s breakout resistance of $0.67 is now considered a support level for a pullback. Right below it lies the $0.545 and $0.435 levels – last month’s low.

Bitfarms has reached an initial agreement for a private debt facility of up to $300 million from Macquarie Equipment Capital to support its Panther Creek data center project in Pennsylvania. In an April 2 press release , the Canadian crypto mining company said that the first tranche of the loan is $50 million, with the rest available if the company “achieves specific development milestones.” Bitfarms CEO Ben Gagnon says the partnership with Macquarie is the beginning of its investment in the “near-term development” of Panther Creek data center, adding that amid the surging AI revolution and the growing demand for power and infrastructure, the financing “arrives at a pivotal time.” “The maturity of each facility is two years from the date of closing. Each facility will bear interest at a rate of 8% per annum, with interest on the initial draw of $50 million paid in kind for the first three months.” Bitfarms You might also like: Bitfarms stock is ‘undervalued’ as firm pivots to AI and energy: analyst Joshua Stevens, an associate director at Macquarie, pointed out that the location is “within 100 miles of New York City and Philadelphia,” which could make it appealing to high-performance computing tenants.

The financial winds are shifting down under, and it could have ripple effects across the global economy and even into the crypto markets. Whispers from the financial district suggest a significant move by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) – a potential interest rate cut that could send shockwaves through traditional finance and beyond. Let’s dive into what this means for you, the savvy crypto investor. Why is an RBNZ Rate Cut on the Horizon for New Zealand Interest Rates? The global economic landscape is a complex puzzle, and New Zealand, despite its island nation status, is very much a piece of it. Several factors are pointing towards the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) potentially easing its monetary policy. But why now? Let’s break it down: Slowing Economic Growth: Globally, we’re seeing signs of economic deceleration. Inflation, while still elevated in some regions, is showing signs of cooling. New Zealand’s own economic indicators might be suggesting a need for stimulus to prevent a sharper slowdown. Inflationary Pressures Easing: While inflation remains a concern worldwide, there’s a growing consensus that peak inflation may be behind us. If the RBNZ believes inflationary pressures are moderating in New Zealand, they might feel more comfortable cutting rates to support growth. Global Central Bank Actions: Central banks around the world are closely watching each other. If other major central banks begin to signal or implement rate cuts, the RBNZ might feel pressure to follow suit to maintain New Zealand’s economic competitiveness. Domestic Economic Data: Key domestic data points in New Zealand, such as employment figures, consumer spending, and business confidence, likely play a crucial role in the RBNZ’s decision-making process. If these indicators are weakening, a rate cut becomes a more probable tool to inject vitality into the economy. What Does a 3.5% Interest Rate Forecast Mean for the Global Economy? A potential cut to 3.5% for New Zealand interest rates is not just a local event; it’s a signal on the global stage. Here’s why this matters in a broader context: Impact Area Explanation Currency Markets (NZD): A rate cut typically weakens a currency. Expect the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) to potentially depreciate against other major currencies like the USD, EUR, and AUD. This can impact import and export prices and potentially influence inflation. Global Bond Yields: While the impact might be less direct than on currency markets, a rate cut by the RBNZ can contribute to the overall global trend of potentially lower bond yields, especially if it reinforces expectations of easing monetary policy worldwide. Investor Sentiment: Central bank actions are closely watched by investors globally. An RBNZ rate cut could be interpreted as a sign of increased economic caution, potentially impacting investor sentiment towards riskier assets, including emerging markets and, to some extent, even cryptocurrencies. Trade Flows: A weaker NZD can make New Zealand’s exports more competitive, potentially boosting trade surpluses. Conversely, imports become more expensive. These shifts in trade flows can have ripple effects on regional and global trade balances. How Does an Interest Rate Cut Act as Economic Stimulus? The primary goal of an interest rate cut is often to provide economic stimulus. But how does this mechanism actually work? Think of it like this: Lower Borrowing Costs: Reduced interest rates make borrowing cheaper for businesses and individuals. This encourages businesses to invest and expand, and consumers to spend more on big-ticket items like houses and cars. Increased Spending and Investment: With cheaper credit, businesses are more likely to take out loans for expansion, hiring, and innovation. Consumers are incentivized to borrow for purchases, boosting overall demand in the economy. Potential Inflationary Pressure (in the long run): While the immediate goal might be stimulus, consistently low interest rates can, over time, lead to increased inflation as demand outstrips supply. Central banks must carefully balance stimulus with inflation control. Asset Price Inflation: Lower interest rates can also fuel asset price inflation, particularly in real estate and potentially in financial markets. This is because cheaper borrowing makes these assets more attractive and accessible. What’s the Impact on Crypto and Your Investments? Now, let’s bring it back to the world of crypto. How might an RBNZ rate cut, and the broader trend of potential global economic stimulus, affect your cryptocurrency portfolio? Risk-On Sentiment: Lower interest rates can sometimes fuel a “risk-on” sentiment in financial markets. When traditional fixed-income investments offer lower returns, investors may look to higher-yield, albeit riskier, assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Inflation Hedge Narrative: If rate cuts globally contribute to inflationary pressures in the longer term, the narrative of Bitcoin and certain cryptocurrencies as inflation hedges could gain renewed traction. Investors might seek refuge in digital assets if they perceive fiat currencies as being devalued by inflation. NZD/Crypto Trading Pairs: For those trading in NZD-denominated cryptocurrency pairs, a weaker NZD might influence trading dynamics. It could make cryptocurrencies relatively more expensive in NZD terms, potentially increasing demand or volatility in these pairs. Broader Market Liquidity: Monetary easing, like rate cuts, generally increases liquidity in financial markets. This liquidity can sometimes flow into various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, potentially providing more capital for investment and trading. Navigating the Interest Rate Forecast: Actionable Insights So, what should you do with this information? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on official announcements from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and related economic data releases. Market reactions can be swift, and being informed is your best defense and opportunity. Diversify Your Portfolio: As always, diversification remains key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A mix of asset classes, including crypto, stocks, and perhaps even traditional safe havens like gold, can help navigate uncertain economic times. Manage Risk: Be mindful of the potential for increased volatility in both traditional and crypto markets in response to central bank actions. Manage your risk exposure accordingly and avoid over-leveraging. Consider the Long Term: While short-term market reactions can be dramatic, remember to keep your long-term investment goals in mind. Don’t make impulsive decisions based on short-term news cycles. Conclusion: A Crucial Moment for the Global Economy and Crypto The expected RBNZ rate cut is more than just a local monetary policy adjustment; it’s a potential bellwether for the global economic climate. It underscores the interconnectedness of the world economy and how actions in one country can ripple outwards, potentially impacting everything from currency markets to cryptocurrency valuations. For crypto investors, understanding these macroeconomic trends is increasingly crucial. By staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining a long-term perspective, you can navigate these evolving financial landscapes and position yourself to capitalize on opportunities while mitigating potential downsides. The world of finance never stands still, and staying ahead of the curve is the name of the game.

While BTC fell back to $ 84,000, an analyst said that BTC was showing an upward trend and may have bottomed. Market analyst Omkar Godbole said that Bitcoin may have bottomed at $76,000 and that some data indicate an upward trend. The analyst said that Bitcoin is experiencing a correction similar to corrections seen after major events in the past and may have formed a bottom that points to higher lows. At this point, the analyst, who argued that Bitcoin formed a bottom at $ 76,000 on March 10, claimed that BTC formed a triangle bottom pattern consisting of higher lows in the last correction, similar to the corrections seen during the US spot ETF launch and the August 2024 yen carry trade pullback. The analyst said that BTC has fallen 30% from its January peak of $109,000, reaching a bottom on March 10, before and after which it recorded higher lows. Accordingly, BTC bottomed at around $78,000 on February 28 and just above $81,000 on March 31, creating a triangle bottom pattern. “The triangle bottom pattern, which indicates a transition from lower lows to higher lows and sellers exhaustion, is similar to the bottom patterns seen in early 2024, around the time of the yen carry trade pullback in August 2024 and the spot ETF launch.” The analyst finally noted that there are bullish signals such as sellers exhaustion and signs of potential bullish momentum, but macro risks remain. “There are reasons to consider the possibility of renewed bullish momentum. But as always, external risks such as Trump's tariffs could disrupt this trend.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: With the Recent Drop, Has Bitcoin (BTC) Bottomed?

Stay COTI is designed to supercharge dapp deployment on COTI’s privacy-enabled L2, making it easier for devs to turn their ideas into reality in record time. With the mainnet having successfully launched, the next phase of COTI’s evolution is to onboard developers in their droves. While grant programs can expedite this process, there also needs to be suitable tooling in place to ease their entry into a new ecosystem, albeit one using the familiar EVM. Enter Stay COTI, the community hub that will convince builders to stick around and create something useful. Keeping It COTI on L2 The bull case for COTI’s Layer 2 network goes something like this: enterprises are prevented from participating fully in onchain markets due to privacy concerns. Compliance obligations and company policy prevent them from broadcasting sensitive financial data across public networks – which is where COTI comes in. Its privacy tech, based on a version of Garbled Circuits, is computationally lightweight and capable of playing nice with compliance regs.This means it’s possible to have an RWA platform, for instance, whose users are verified but whose activity is confidential, despite being conducted wholly onchain. That’s one use case for COTI’s new L2 – but there are many more that have been mooted, from AI agents to payment systems. Aspiring builders needn’t tackle anything as ambitious as an institutional RWA platform in other words. And with Stay COTI providing a helping hand, they may be pleasantly surprised to find just how easy it is to deploy their first dapp. No Code, No Limits One of the cool things about Stay COTI is that it supports natural language prompts thanks to a sprinkling of AI magic that eliminates the need for coding. “No code” is the new “Learn to code” in tech – much to the chagrin of those who’ve spent years learning to code only to find that AI does it better. In practice, a degree of coding knowledge will still be required to create more sophisticated dapps, be it on COTI or any other blockchain network. Stay COTI, however, does a lot of the heavy lifting. Aside from simplifying the act of creating a COTI-powered dapp, the platform enables users to apply for funding or marketing support to help further develop their idea. There’ll also be plenty of hands-on support including live build sessions, streamed weekly, demos, and real-world coding events. In short, there’ll never be a better chance to create your first dapp or transform your big idea into a working reality. COTI has grand goals about making its L2 the backbone of the DeFi, AiFi, and RWA economy, forming the de facto web3 privacy layer that supports an array of use cases and applications. If that vision comes to pass, it will be thanks in no small part to Stay COTI and the effect it has in catalyzing development on the newest and most confidential Layer 2 in town.

While Cardano is showing strength above key levels and could be ready for a breakout, the low-cap gaming gem Rollblock is gaining massive attention with its insane price potential and growing reputation as the best crypto presale to buy in 2025. Some investors are already betting on a rally to $8 for RBLK this year, and the momentum is building by the day. Rollblock (RBLK): The $0.06 Crypto With Insane Price Potential Rollblock is proving that success in Web3 isn’t about hype; it’s about a solid community and relentless innovation. Its comprehensive ecosystem includes over 8000 AI-powered games like poker, Monopoly, and stacks of slot machines, as well as a booming sports prediction league that lets users place bids on thousands of live events. All this action is secured anonymously on the Ethereum blockchain, bringing transparency to a $500 billion industry historically plagued by trust issues. With over $11.1 million in inflows already flowing into its presale token launch and consistent month-on-month growth in new users, deposits, and wagers, Rollblock is fast becoming the breakout project of 2025. What sets Rollblock apart is just how easy it is to join the platform. There’s nothing to download or install as it runs in any web browser. Users can deposit with Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, and Mastercard and dive into high-quality GameFi entertainment in seconds. Rollblock’s unique blend of immersive gaming, real revenue generation, and blockchain integrity is quite simply unmatched. What Makes RBLK’s Tokenomics So Bullish? Find out what has made Crypto Octo so bullish here: https://youtu.be/ONh5c192f3o?si=fsTNSby5C_mcEELG Rollblock’s deflationary revenue-sharing model is built to create value for its loyal holders. Each week, 30% of the platform’s revenue is used to buy back RBLK. 60% of those tokens are then burned to reduce the already capped supply, while the other 40% goes toward staking rewards of up to 30% APY. This approach rewards long-term believers while reducing the token’s available supply. Stage 10 of the presale is already more than 53% sold, with tokens priced at $0.062 and a price hike looming as major exchange listings approach. Cardano Price Prediction (ADA): Can It Hit $4 This Year? Cardano is trading at $0.67 today, up by 5% as volume increases by an encouraging 24% and RSI turns bullish. Despite this, Cardano is down by 11% in the past week as it was unable to sustain its price point above $0.75. Clearly, ADA is at a crossroads. According to COG Chain, “ADA is holding strong above $0.6700, maintaining its momentum. The next exciting price targets to watch are $0.6850 and $0.7000!” That strength is backed by solid support around $0.65, which could present a prime buying zone for long-term Cardano investors if there’s a pullback. If momentum continues and we see a clean breakout, ADA could be heading for $4 or higher in 2025. Volume is building, setting up Cardano to potentially leave its current range behind for good. Rollblock Holds All The Aces This Cycle Cardano is looking strong in the short term, but Rollblock is by far the more bullish of the two, with real-world adoption growing and earnings through the roof. With tokenomics designed for sustainable price growth and a thriving GameFi platform already live, Rollblock stands out as the coin with the most upside in 2025 and could rise as high as $8 on its very first bull run.

The market is buzzing with excitement as EOS, the token powering the EOS Network, experiences a jaw-dropping surge. In the whirlwind world of cryptocurrencies, where volatility is the norm, a 30% jump in 24 hours is nothing short of sensational. Let’s dive into the heart of this EOS price surge and uncover what’s fueling this remarkable rally. Decoding the EOS Price Surge: What’s Driving This Crypto Rally? The initial spark for this crypto surge in EOS can be traced back to renewed interest and activity within the EOS Network. While the specific catalysts can be multifaceted, here are a few key factors that are likely contributing to this impressive price action: Increased Network Activity: A potential uptick in decentralized application (dApp) usage, smart contract deployments, or overall transaction volume on the EOS Network can signal growing utility and demand for the EOS token. This increased activity often translates to positive price momentum. Project Developments and Announcements: Any significant announcements regarding upgrades, partnerships, or new projects within the EOS ecosystem can inject fresh enthusiasm into the market. Positive news tends to attract investors and drive up demand for the native token. Broader Altcoin Market Sentiment: The cryptocurrency market often moves in waves. A positive shift in overall market sentiment, particularly within the altcoin market , can create a rising tide that lifts many boats, including EOS. When Bitcoin and Ethereum show strength, altcoins often follow suit. Technical Factors and Trading Dynamics: Chart patterns, breakout levels, and increased trading volume can also play a crucial role in price surges. Technical analysts often identify key levels that, once breached, can trigger rapid price appreciation as traders react to market signals. Community and Social Media Buzz: The crypto market is heavily influenced by community sentiment and social media discussions. Increased positive mentions, trending topics, and community engagement around EOS can contribute to a bullish narrative and fuel buying pressure. Is EOS a Lucrative Cryptocurrency Investment Now? Navigating the Altcoin Market The burning question on everyone’s mind: Is this EOS price surge a signal to jump into cryptocurrency investment in EOS? While the recent gains are undeniably exciting, it’s crucial to approach any investment decision with caution and informed analysis. The altcoin market , while offering potentially high returns, is also known for its volatility and risk. Potential Benefits of Considering EOS Investment: High Growth Potential: As demonstrated by the recent surge, EOS has the capacity for rapid price appreciation. If the factors driving this rally are sustainable, there could be further upside potential. Established Network: The EOS Network is not a new entrant to the crypto space. It has a history, a community, and a track record of development, which can provide a degree of stability compared to newer, untested projects. Technological Foundation: EOS is designed to be a powerful platform for dApps, boasting features like fast transaction speeds and scalability. If the network continues to attract developers and users, the underlying technology could support long-term value growth. Lower Entry Point (Compared to Peaks): Despite the recent surge, EOS is still trading significantly below its all-time highs. This could be seen as a more attractive entry point for investors who believe in the project’s long-term potential. Challenges and Risks to Consider: Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Price surges can be followed by sharp corrections. It’s crucial to be prepared for potential price swings and invest only what you can afford to lose. Competition in the Smart Contract Platform Space: The EOS Network faces intense competition from other smart contract platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. The success of EOS depends on its ability to maintain and grow its market share in this competitive landscape. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the entire crypto market, including EOS. Project-Specific Risks: Like any crypto project, EOS faces its own set of risks related to development, adoption, and community support. It’s important to stay informed about the project’s progress and potential challenges. Actionable Insights: Navigating the EOS Surge and the Cryptocurrency Investment Landscape So, what should you do amidst this exciting EOS price surge ? Here are some actionable insights for navigating this situation and the broader cryptocurrency investment landscape: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions, conduct thorough research on the EOS Network, its technology, its community, and the factors driving the current price surge. Don’t rely solely on hype or social media sentiment. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Evaluate your own risk tolerance and only invest an amount that you are comfortable potentially losing. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification is a key principle in investing. Consider spreading your investments across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Stay Informed: The crypto market is constantly evolving. Stay up-to-date with the latest news, trends, and developments in the altcoin market and the EOS Network specifically. Follow reputable crypto news sources and analysis platforms. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you are considering investing in EOS, you might consider using a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. DCA can help to smooth out the volatility of the market. The Future of EOS and the Broader Crypto Surge: What’s Next? The EOS price surge is a compelling reminder of the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. Whether this rally is a short-term blip or the start of a sustained uptrend remains to be seen. The future of EOS, like that of the broader crypto market, will depend on a multitude of factors, including technological advancements, adoption rates, regulatory developments, and overall market sentiment. For investors, the key is to stay informed, remain disciplined, and approach the cryptocurrency investment landscape with a balanced perspective. The altcoin market offers exciting opportunities, but also comes with inherent risks. Understanding both the potential rewards and the potential pitfalls is crucial for navigating this exciting and ever-changing world.

42804193,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=704256,1743601035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42804193.jpeg,Sentiments turn bearish on the U.S. dollar ahead of Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariff announcement,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sentiments-turn-bearish-us-dollar/,"RSM U.S. Chief Economist Joseph Brusuelas recently revealed that forex traders are turning bearish on the U.S. dollar in preparation for President Donald Trump’s new tariff announcement on April 2. Brusuelas further noted that global investors are becoming more cautious about the risks associated with Trump’s tariff policies, leading to more negative sentiment among domestic and global traders. The economist highlighted the positive sentiment around the greenback since October last year reached its peak before Trump’s inauguration. Market analysts predicted at the time that other currencies, including the euro, pound, and Japanese yen, would weaken this year amid global economic uncertainties ahead of Trump’s entry into office. The U.S. dollar index hit its highest levels in two years around mid-January, further fueled by the positive December jobs report. The U.S. dollar index (DXY) has dropped by 0.15% today to 104.10, compared to a 0.1% drop yesterday. A Nasdaq report revealed that the dollar dropped more due to the ISM and job openings reports, which were lower than expected. The report further indicated a growing fear of a weakening in the U.S. economy as investors expect Trump’s tariff policies to lower economic growth in the country. The currency also experienced the sharpest monthly drop in 2 years last month, declining by over 3.4%. The U.S. dollar further weakened against the euro by 4.5% and against the Japanese yen by 4.7%. More Wall Street companies have seen the decline as a sign of recession, with Goldman Sachs’ expectations for a recession rising to 35% from 20%. Trump to announce broader tariffs on ‘Liberation Day’ 1. April 2nd is the day Trump has been teasing for weeks. He’s calling it Liberation Day — where 20%+ tariffs are expected to hit imports from over 25 countries. Markets are bracing. We could be in for one of the most volatile weeks in years. pic.twitter.com/nQ8gmSLEJZ — Real World Asset Watchlist (@RWAwatchlist_) March 30, 2025 President Trump hinted at reciprocal tariffs to be announced on Wednesday, hyping April 2 as the ” Liberation Day .” The expected announcement has been speculated to be the biggest batch of tariffs the president is yet to announce. The speculations came after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at retaliation against 15% of countries that account for bulk goods imports into the U.S. Bessent mentioned in the Fox Business interview that the ‘Dirty 15’ countries imposed hefty tariffs on U.S. goods. The Treasury Secretary still did not reveal any names. The Trump National Economic Council Director, Kevin Hassett, also noted that the president would target 10 to 15 countries that allegedly accounted for trillions of dollars in deficit to the U.S. economy. U.S Commerce Department data indicated that China, Mexico, Canada, the EU, Malaysia, Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Switzerland, Italy, Sweden, France, Indonesia, India, Thailand, and Austria as the countries with the largest goods trading deficits with the U.S. in 2024. A U.S. Trade Representative Office notice also highlighted a focus on 21 countries that had the largest trading goods deficit with the U.S., adding South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Russia, the UK, Turkey, Argentina, and Brazil to the list. On Sunday, Trump insisted that tariffs should first target all countries instead of working with a cutoff. The president also suggested that the trade deficits indicated that other countries were taking advantage of the U.S. Trump has already initiated 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, 20% on goods from China, and 25% on steel and aluminum imports. Trump’s tariff policies to boost the euro Brusuelas forecasted the euro to surge as investors shifted their focus to other economies and the confidence in the U.S. dollar continued to erode. The economist pointed out that investors currently held long positions on the euro despite holding long positions on the U.S. dollar from late October to the beginning of March this year. Brusuelas further indicated that the positioning change came after the UK and EU’s shift to investing more in defense and infrastructure. Net euro positioning turns bullish. Source: RMS U.S. Mizuho Bank’s EMEA arm executive director Jordan Rochester also forecasted the euro to end on a high this year. Rochester suggested that the euro might initially drop to $1.06 or $1.07 before climbing to $1.12 or higher by the end of 2025. The Mizuho Bank executive further suggested that the EU and other regions would impose retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. once President Trump announced the tariffs’ full details. Bank of America’s global head and MD of G10 FX strategy, Athanasios Vamvakidis, agreed with Brusuelas and Rochester, mentioning that Trump’s tariff policies would eventually boost the euro. Vamvakidis further explained that the EU was focusing on more “growth-friendly policies” than the U.S. policies. The BofA global head also highlighted that the U.S. dollar would drop further despite a possible surge immediately after Trump’s tariff imposition.

Concerns of regulatory capture — a situation in which regulators or lawmakers are co-opted to serve the interests of a small constituency — have grown as crypto lobbying gains influence in Washington. The risks of regulatory capture are twofold: First, the public interest is shut out from policy-making in favor of a single industry or company, and second, it can make regulators blind to or paralyzed by economic risks. Now, not even three months into Trump’s presidency, American lawmakers and industry crypto observers have voiced concerns that this regulatory capture could not only negatively affect the country but curb competition within the crypto industry as well. Regulatory capture in the battle for crypto policy In a March 28 letter, prominent members of the US Senate Banking Committee and Committee on Finance addressed Acting Comptroller Rodney Hood and Michelle Bowman, Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governor’s Committee on Supervision and Regulation. The letter specifically addresses the launch of USD1 , a stablecoin project from the Trump family’s decentralized finance project World Liberty Financial (WLFI), as Congress considers GENIUS Act legislation on stablecoins. Related: Trump’s crypto project launches stablecoin on BNB Chain, Ethereum The senators suggest there are opportunities for regulatory capture and conflict of interest. “President Trump may review any actions the OCC takes with regard to USD1’s stablecoin application. He would be positioned to intervene in and deny the OCC from promulgating stablecoin safeguards, or force the agency to refrain from initiating any enforcement actions against WLF.” Son Eric Trump pumps his father’s memecoin ahead of the inauguration. Source: Eric Trump They added that he could attempt to intervene or deny assistance to USD1’s competitors and that the GENIUS Act provides no provisions to prevent such conduct. Crypto industry observers have also echoed concern over a single entity's undue influence over policy when it comes to Coinbase’s influence in Washington’s development of stablecoin policy. In January, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong signaled that his firm would be willing to delist Tether (USDT), the world’s largest stablecoin, if the version of the stablecoin bill under consideration in Congress became law. Under those terms, USDC, in which Coinbase is a major shareholder, would essentially be fencing out its largest competitor from the US market. Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter cried foul, stating that “Regulatory capture is poison. Reminds me of what SBF used to do.” Related: SBF always played both sides of the aisle despite new Republican plea At the time, Vance Spencer, founder of crypto venture firm Framework Ventures, said that it was “a blatant attempt at regulatory capture by US players done at the expense of US national interest.” “The future of stablecoins can be US dollar-based only if we allow a broader competitive set of stablecoin issuers to flourish and deny gatekeeping/gaslighting by those interested in regulatory capture,” he concluded. George Selgin, senior fellow and director emeritus of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told Cointelegraph that the Bitcoin reserve is another clear example of the crypto lobby’s influence over the regulatory process. Trump signs the Bitcoin reserve executive order. Source: David Sacks “It's unlikely that anyone would have considered it desirable, let alone necessary, for the US government to maintain digital asset stashes — in fact, there's no good reason for its doing so — had it not been for intense pressure from cryptocurrency enthusiasts,” he said. Regulatory capture is old hat in Washington lawmaking Different lobbies influencing policymaking in Washington are nothing new, so much so that “regulatory capture” to the layman would seem to describe business as usual. Selgin said that the Biden administration’s approach to crypto was equally an example of regulatory capture, just in favor of traditional financial firms that, with their lobbying efforts, wished to limit competition from industry upstarts. “Regulators' relatively hostile stance toward crypto [under Biden] was no less evidence of regulatory capture than their more indulgent stance toward it today. The main difference was in who did the capturing,” he said. “Financial regulatory capture is an old story; only some new players are now proving to be adept hunters.” When asked how one would differentiate between legitimate industry advocacy and regulatory capture, Selgin said, “I don't think you need to. First of all, the line between them is very thin.” Industries rarely take complete control of regulators due in part to the fact that individual firms within an industry have different ideas about what ideal regulation looks like, said Selgin. Furthermore, any kind of successful advocacy “‘captures’ regulators to some extent” if only by virtue of the fact that it makes them change their beliefs about how best to regulate. What is to be done? The question remains then: is regulatory capture just to be accepted as a natural part of the policymaking process? Some academics have suggested creating entirely new government bodies to deal with the problem. Gerard Caprio, William Brough professor of economics, emeritus at Williams College, proposed the creation of an expert panel dubbed a “Sentinel” to oversee regulator behavior. But such proposals face nearly impossible headwinds, not only because of their technical complexity, but due to the simple fact that lawmakers have no incentive to set up an organization that oversees them. Related: Trump’s CFTC pick Brian Quintenz gets crypto’s foot in the revolving door According to Selgin, the ultimate determination is not “whether or how the industry manages to influence regulators. It's whether the resulting regulatory regime serves the public interest [...] If a regulation is harmful, it's harmful whether it was lobbied for or not.” And the public’s interest in crypto is getting harder to see. Polls about crypto sentiment, trust and ownership vary wildly, and the Trump administration’s personal interest has done little to endear it to skeptics or middle-of-the-road voters. Some industry surveys claim that a whopping 70% of Americans own crypto. Source: NFT Evening Even crypto lobbyists admit that the (barely) bi-partisan drive for crypto is driven by a desire to appease the crypto industry’s deep pockets ahead of the 2026 midterms. Dave Grimaldi, executive vice president of government relations at Blockchain Association, said , “There are [...] pro-crypto candidates who won and were funded by our industry and had votes coming to them from crypto users in their district. [...] And then there were also incumbent, sitting members of Congress who lost their seats because they were so negative for completely unnecessary and illogical reasons.” Little can be done until lawmakers and regulators agree there is a problem to solve and exert the political will to solve it.

Crypto enthusiasts are buzzing about a recent report from Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, indicating that a staggering 330 million XRP tokens have been locked in escrow by Ripple. But what does this mean for you, the XRP holder, and the broader crypto market? Let’s unravel this significant development and explore its potential implications. Decoding the XRP Escrow: What’s the Real Story? For those new to the XRP ecosystem, understanding the concept of ‘escrow’ is crucial. Ripple, the company behind XRP, utilizes an escrow system to manage the release of its massive XRP holdings. Think of it as a giant, automated crypto safe deposit box. This system was designed to ensure a predictable and controlled supply of XRP entering the market, fostering stability and trust. Here’s a breakdown of why escrow is so vital for XRP: Predictable Supply: Escrow ensures that Ripple cannot suddenly flood the market with billions of XRP, which could potentially crash the price. The release schedule is pre-programmed and transparent. Market Stability: By controlling the token supply, escrow mechanisms aim to reduce volatility and create a more stable trading environment for XRP. Investor Confidence: Knowing that XRP’s release is managed through escrow gives investors confidence in the long-term value and sustainability of the cryptocurrency. Decentralization Goals: While Ripple holds a significant amount of XRP, the escrow system demonstrates a commitment to a more decentralized distribution over time, reducing the concentration of tokens in Ripple’s direct control. In essence, the escrow system is a cornerstone of XRP’s tokenomics, designed to balance supply and demand while building trust within the cryptocurrency community. 330 Million XRP Locked: A Closer Look at the Transaction Now, let’s zoom in on the specifics of this 330 million XRP lockup. Whale Alert, known for its eagle-eyed tracking of large cryptocurrency transactions, flagged this movement, bringing it to the attention of the crypto world. Here’s what we know: Amount: 330 million XRP. To put this into perspective, at current prices, this is a substantial value, though the exact USD equivalent fluctuates with the market. Source and Destination: The transaction originated from a Ripple-controlled wallet and was moved to an escrow wallet. This indicates an internal movement within Ripple’s ecosystem, reinforcing the planned token management strategy. Timing: These escrow operations often occur at the beginning of each month, as part of Ripple’s pre-set schedule for XRP release and re-locking. It’s likely this is a routine part of their operational cadence. Confirmation: While Whale Alert provides transaction data, official confirmation from Ripple directly regarding the specific purpose or details of this particular lockup is always valuable for complete clarity. While 330 million XRP sounds like a massive figure (and it is!), it’s important to remember this is within the context of Ripple’s overall XRP management strategy and the billions of XRP already in escrow. Ripple’s Escrow Strategy: Why Does It Matter for XRP? Understanding Ripple’s Ripple escrow strategy is key to deciphering these token movements. It’s not just about locking up tokens; it’s about a carefully orchestrated plan to manage XRP’s supply and distribution. Let’s explore why this strategy is so crucial: Aspect Importance for XRP Controlled Supply Prevents market saturation and potential price crashes due to sudden large releases of XRP. Predictable Releases Provides transparency and predictability for investors, reducing speculation and fostering long-term confidence. Incentive Alignment Aligns Ripple’s incentives with the long-term success of XRP. By controlling supply, Ripple is incentivized to grow the XRP ecosystem’s value. Long-Term Vision Demonstrates a long-term commitment to XRP’s development and adoption, rather than short-term profit maximization through rapid token sales. In essence, Ripple’s escrow strategy is a balancing act – managing supply to support XRP’s price and stability while ensuring enough tokens are available for ecosystem development and institutional adoption. This strategic approach is designed to foster a healthy and sustainable XRP market. Token Unlock vs. Token Lockup: Decoding the Crypto Jargon In the crypto world, you’ll often hear terms like ‘token unlock’ and ‘token lockup.’ It’s essential to understand the difference, especially when discussing events like this 330 million XRP escrow movement. Let’s clarify these terms: Token Lockup: This is when tokens are moved into escrow or a similar mechanism, making them temporarily unavailable in the circulating supply. The 330 million XRP movement is an example of a token lockup. It reduces the immediate available supply. Token Unlock: This is the opposite – tokens are released from escrow or vesting schedules, increasing the circulating supply. Ripple typically unlocks a portion of XRP from escrow each month, some of which is then re-locked, while some is used for operational purposes. Understanding this distinction is crucial for interpreting crypto news accurately. A token lockup is generally seen as neutral to slightly positive as it reduces potential selling pressure, while a large, unexpected token unlock could sometimes be perceived negatively if the market fears a sudden influx of supply. Crypto News and Market Reactions: How Might XRP Respond? So, how might the market react to this crypto news of 330 million XRP being locked? Market reactions in crypto are notoriously complex and depend on numerous factors, but here are some potential scenarios: Neutral to Slightly Positive: Given that this is likely a routine escrow operation, the immediate market reaction might be muted. However, it could be perceived slightly positively as it reinforces Ripple’s commitment to controlled supply and market stability. Limited Price Impact: Unless this news triggers broader market sentiment shifts, the direct price impact of this specific lockup might be limited. Larger market trends and overall crypto sentiment usually have a more significant influence on XRP’s price. Focus on Fundamentals: Events like this often shift investor focus back to the fundamentals of XRP – its utility, adoption, and Ripple’s ongoing legal battles and partnerships. Long-term investors are likely to see this as part of the planned ecosystem management. Whale Activity Monitoring: Keep an eye on whale activity. Large holders’ actions often provide insights into market sentiment. Continued accumulation or selling by whales could amplify or dampen the impact of such news. Ultimately, while this 330 million XRP lockup is a significant event in terms of token movement, its immediate price impact might be less dramatic than other types of crypto news, such as major regulatory announcements or technological breakthroughs. Actionable Insights: What Should XRP Holders Do? For XRP holders, news like this provides an opportunity to reinforce your understanding of XRP’s tokenomics and Ripple’s strategy. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep track of credible crypto news sources like Whale Alert and official announcements from Ripple. Understanding token movements and ecosystem developments is crucial for informed investment decisions. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of XRP and Ripple. Routine escrow operations are part of the planned strategy and shouldn’t be viewed in isolation. Diversification: As with any investment, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Manage your risk by diversifying your crypto portfolio. Due Diligence: Always conduct your own research (DYOR) before making any investment decisions based on news or market events. Understand the risks and potential rewards. Community Engagement: Engage with the XRP community and participate in discussions. Community sentiment and collective knowledge can be valuable resources. By staying informed and maintaining a balanced perspective, XRP holders can navigate the crypto market with greater confidence and make well-reasoned decisions. Conclusion: XRP’s Secure Future? The news of 330 million XRP being locked in escrow at Ripple, while seemingly dramatic at first glance, is actually a testament to Ripple’s well-structured and transparent token management strategy. This routine operation underscores their commitment to controlled supply, market stability, and long-term ecosystem health. For XRP holders, it reinforces the planned nature of XRP’s distribution and the mechanisms in place to foster a sustainable and predictable market. While immediate price surges might not be guaranteed by such events, the underlying message is clear: Ripple is actively managing XRP’s supply with a long-term vision in mind, potentially paving the way for a more secure and stable future for XRP.

42804386,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=704166,1743601256,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42804386.jpeg,Circle’s IPO documents show rising costs and deep Coinbase dependency,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/circles-ipo-show-coinbase-dependency/,"Circle’s new initial public offering (IPO) filing has shed light on its relationship with Coinbase, including the millions paid to the exchange for USDC stablecoin distribution. According to the filing, over 50% of the firm’s revenue in 2024 went to Coinbase. The S-1, a preliminary filing for companies planning to go public, shows that Circle generated $1.67 billion in revenue for 2024. This represents a sizable increase from $1.4 billion in 2023 to $772 million in 2022. However, the company is doing worse financially as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) decreased by 29% to $285 million, and net income also fell by 42% to $155.67 million. Circle financial statement (Source: X/ Matthew Sigel) While many factors caused this, analysts have identified the major problems as Circle’s distribution costs and reliance on Coinbase. According to the filing, the USDC issuer spent $1.01 billion in distribution and transaction costs for 2024, beating its expenses in 2023 and 2024. Interestingly, Coinbase got most of these funds, receiving $908 million while Binance also got $60.25 million and monthly fees for its partnership with Circle. The massive amount paid to Coinbase is due to the share of USDC being held on the exchange. The supply of USDC on Coinbase is now 20% of the total USDC in circulation, up from the 5% it was in 2022. Although the amount paid to Coinbase is surprising, the two companies have a long relationship. In 2018, they formed the Centre consortium that launched USDC but Circle gained full control of the stablecoin in 2023 when they dissolved the consortium. However, Circle had to pay $210 million in its own stock to buy Coinbase’s stake in Centre, giving the exchange about 8.4 million common shares for the stake. With this relationship, Coinbase stands to be a major beneficiary of Circle’s IPO success. Analysts raise concerns about Circle’s financials Meanwhile, Circle’s IPO filing has put the company in the public eye, with financial analysts raising concerns about its business fundamentals. According to commenters such as the head of digital assets research at VanEck, Matthew Sigel , and Farside Investors, the company’s high distribution costs are a major issue. The massive distribution costs highlight how USDC growth in the past year might be coming at a high price for Circle’s business. USDC has been the fastest-growing stablecoin in the past few months. Its circulating supply increased by 100% in the last 12 months with more than $15 billion this year alone, enough to raise its market cap above $60 billion. Farside Investors also noted the company’s massive spending on compensation and higher-than-expected gross creation and redemption numbers for USDC. The firm wrote: “The gross creation and redemption numbers are a lot higher than we would have thought for USDC. Gross creations in a year are many multiples higher than the outstanding balance.” Meanwhile, Dragonfly investment analyst Omar had a more scathing criticism of the IPO filing, noting that he does not see the potential of it going to the $5 billion that Circle is aiming for. He also pointed out the distribution costs, the potential deregulation which will bring in more competitors, and the likelihood of interest rate cuts as headwinds for the company. He said: “32x ’24 earnings for a business that just lost its mini-monopoly and facing several headwinds is expensive when growth structurally challenged. feels like a hail mary for some liquidity before the squad rolls in.” However, Circle acknowledged some of these challenges in its filing, particularly the cost of distribution partners and reliance on Coinbase. The firm mentioned new global partners such as Nubank, Mercado Libre, and Grab. VanEck Ventures general partner Wyatt Lonergan also admitted that new partnerships and Circle’s status as the only stablecoin firm with a legitimate claim to go public could prove to be its advantage. Nevertheless, the analyst provided predictions on how the IPO could turn out. In the base case scenario, Circle will ride the stablecoin narrative for about 12 months, find ways to diversify revenue, and sign new deals with major distribution partners like Visa. However, if the stock market continues to decline, Circle stock could suffer and Lonergan expects that Coinbase could acquire the company. He added that Coinbase could even buy up Circle before it goes public, allowing the exchange to fully own the stablecoin issuer. Still, he believes an outsider such as Ripple , which also has its own stablecoin, could swoop in with a massive bid to acquire Circle so as to increase its market share. The filing also shows that USDC has recorded 25 trillion in on-chain transaction volume throughout its lifetime, with over $1 trillion in tokens minted and redeemed within that period.

The two New York Stock Exchange-listed funds will start trading on Wednesday. The Bitcoin Covered Call ETF (BTCC) and Bitcoin Premium Income ETF (BPI) offer covered call writing strategies, which involves selling call options to generate income on the premium received. Call options are derivatives contracts betting on the price of an asset rising. They give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the asset at a predetermined price within a define period of time. BTCC will write calls very close to spot prices to deliver income for investors seeking regular cash flow, with the options premiums possibly also providing a cushion against market downturns. BPI meanwhile will target options with strike prices that are well out-of-the-money, meaning the price is much higher than the spot price. This would allow investors to participate in much of BTC's upside potential while possibly benefiting from some dividend income, according to an emailed announcement from Grayscale on Wednesday. The options contracts that both ETFs use will track other bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscale's own Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC). Despite the surge in institutional investment into BTC through spot ETFs since their introduction in January 2024, bitcoin's volatility does not appear to be going anywhere for the time being. After gaining nearly 48% in the fourth quarter, the largest cryptocurrency kicked off 2025 by losing 12% in the historically bullish first quarter.

The funding will support Bitfarms’ initial development of its high-performance computing (HPC) data center at Panther Creek, Pennsylvania—expected to reach up to 500 MW of capacity. An initial $50 million tranche has been drawn at the parent level to cover development soft costs and general corporate purposes. The remaining $250 million is contingent upon the achievement of key project milestones, at which point the facility becomes fully secured at the project level. Each tranche has a two-year term and carries 8% annual interest, with the initial tranche featuring interest paid in kind for the first three months. The financing includes equity-linked warrants for Macquarie, tied to future draws and priced at a 25% premium to recent trading averages. Bitfarms will maintain minimum liquidity levels and comply with several customary covenants. CEO Ben Gagnon highlighted the strategic importance of the partnership, noting Panther Creek’s advantageous location near major metropolitan areas and its multiple power sources that support efficient, redundant, and scalable operations.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $84,500, up 10% from its March low. Meanwhile, U.S. stock market futures pointed lower, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 dropping by over 300 points. Trump Liberation Day is here The main catalyst for Bitcoin, altcoins, and the stock market will be Trump’s Liberation Day speech at the Rose Garden. In this address, he is expected to announce reciprocal tariffs on most countries, including the European Union, China, India, and Japan. Analysts warn that these tariffs could lead to a major recession this year. Goldman Sachs and PIMCO have raised their recession odds to 35%. A downturn would likely result from slowing business investment and weakening consumer spending. In theory, Bitcoin price should decline once Trump announces the tariffs. However, in practice, BTC and the stock market may bounce back. There are three main reasons for this. First, the Liberation Day tariffs have already been priced in by market participants, as Trump has been discussing them for weeks. As such, the market may “buy the fact” once the announcement is made. You might also like: Here’s why crypto market and gold prices diverged ahead of Liberation Day A good example is how Bitcoin’s price jumped to a record high ahead of Trump’s inauguration and then dropped after he became president. Second, Bitcoin has weathered major challenges in the past. It not only survived but thrived during the COVID-19 pandemic and the difficult regulatory era under SEC Chair Gary Gensler. In an emailed note to crypto.news, Gadi Chait, an investment manager at Xapo, downplayed the current fear: “These price swings may rattle speculators, but ultimately, this is just noise. Bitcoin has always been and always will be a long-term play; its value lies in its inherent sovereignty, decentralisation, and finite nature, not short-term volatility. We’ve been here before, and we’ll likely be here again, but Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains undeniable.” Finally, a recession could actually be bullish for Bitcoin and other risk assets, as it may prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and reintroduce quantitative easing. Bitcoin price has strong technicals BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong technicals. It has formed an ascending channel and currently sits near its lower bound. The last time it touched this level was in August last year, and it rebounded to a new all-time high shortly after. Bitcoin has also remained above the 50-week moving average, another bullish sign. As such, BTC will likely bounce back and possibly hit $100,000 in the coming weeks. A break below the lower side of the channel would invalidate the bullish outlook.

Meanwhile, South Korea launched a large-scale test of its retail CBDC, with 7-Eleven stores accepting payments in digital Korean won during the trial phase. In the UK, leading trade associations urged Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office to develop a national crypto strategy, including appointing a special envoy and creating an action plan to position the country as a global blockchain leader. Sony Electronics Singapore Adopts USDC Payments Sony Electronics Singapore recently took a major step toward crypto adoption by enabling payments in USDC stablecoin through a partnership with Crypto.com. The announcement was made on April 2, and is a strategic collaboration that is aimed at making cryptocurrency payments more mainstream. Chin Tah Ang, general manager of Crypto.com Singapore, stated that partnering with a well-established brand like Sony helps raise awareness about the simplicity and convenience of using crypto for everyday purchases. This development is part of a broader trend in Singapore, where stablecoin payments are gradually gaining more and more traction. Earlier this year, Metro, a publicly listed department store chain in Singapore, also began accepting stablecoins like Tether’s USDT. These initiatives align with the country's growing status as a leading destination for Web3 companies. In 2024, Singapore issued twice as many crypto licenses as the previous year, which is part of its risk-adjusted approach to regulation and its focus on fostering the digital asset ecosystem. According to industry leaders, Singapore's regulatory framework makes it a lot easier for new crypto firms to collaborate with local banks, which is a big advantage compared to other global markets. Crypto.com has also been actively expanding its presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Toward the end of 2024, the exchange partnered with Deutsche Bank to provide corporate banking services in key markets, including Singapore, Australia, and Hong Kong. Singapore’s push toward becoming a global crypto hub is supported by developments in its financial sector. In November of 2024, reports emerged that Singapore Gulf Bank was seeking a $50 million fund injection to buy a stablecoin payments company in 2025. The digital bank even considered selling up to 10% of its equity to facilitate the acquisition. (Source: ApeX Protocol) A study that was conducted at the end of 2024 proved Singapore's leadership in blockchain technology, and ranked the country highest among all surveyed jurisdictions based on various factors, including regulatory clarity and crypto adoption. This suggests that Singapore’s balanced approach to crypto regulation is successfully attracting major players and setting the stage for broader digital asset adoption across the region. 7-Eleven South Korea Accepts CBDC Payments South Korea’s popular convenience store chain 7-Eleven is now also accepting payments in the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) as part of a nationwide test phase running until the end of June. As an incentive to promote the use of the CBDC, the retailer is offering a 10% discount on all products purchased using the digital currency during the trial period. Moon Dae-woo, head of 7-Eleven’s digital innovation division, stated that the initiative is part of the company’s efforts to integrate digital advancements into its operations and drive its digital transformation. The CBDC test phase began on April 1 and will continue until June 30. It involves various retail participants and up to 100,000 citizens who will be able to use the digital Korean won for payments. Participants can convert their existing bank deposits into digital tokens stored in a distributed ledger system, with the tokens holding the same value as the traditional Korean won. Each participant is subject to a maximum conversion limit of 5 million won, which is approximately $3,416, during the test period. The testing program was announced on March 24 by South Korean government agencies, including the Bank of Korea, the Financial Services Commission, and the Financial Supervisory Service. The goal is to evaluate the practical use of the CBDC and gather feedback from users and merchants. Eligibility was limited to citizens aged 19 or older who hold deposit accounts in participating banks, including KB, Koomin, Shinhan, Hana, Woori, NongHyup, IBK, and Busan. Beyond 7-Eleven, the pilot program includes a wide range of retail and service outlets like coffee shops, supermarkets, K-pop merchandise stores, and food delivery platforms. Overall. the initiative is part of South Korea’s strategy to modernize its financial infrastructure and explore the potential of a state-backed digital currency. The Bank of Korea initially announced plans for this retail CBDC test in November of 2023, and plans to use the results to help develop a prototype for a future monetary system that leverages digital currency technology. UK Industry Calls for Crypto Action Plan The UK certainly also wants its piece of the crypto cake. A coalition of six British trade associations urged Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office to strengthen the country’s focus on crypto and blockchain technology. In a letter dated March 31, the group called for the appointment of a dedicated special envoy for digital assets and the creation of a clear government action plan to support the growth of the sector. The letter was addressed to Varun Chandra, Starmer’s special adviser on business and investment. It places a lot of emphasis on the need for strategic alignment to drive investment, innovation, and job creation in the crypto industry. Part of the letter sent to Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office The coalition includes key digital economy organizations like the UK Cryptoasset Business Council, Global Digital Finance, The Payments Association, Digital Currencies Governance Group, the Crypto Council for Innovation, and techUK. In their letter, the trade bodies pointed out recent policy developments in the United States, and specifically mentioned the appointment of a crypto czar under President Donald Trump. They argued that the UK should mirror the US approach, particularly in light of ongoing trade negotiations that prioritize technological collaboration. The trade associations recommended that the UK establish a blockchain special envoy to coordinate policy efforts and position the country as a leader in financial technologies. They also proposed the creation of a detailed action plan to attract blockchain and crypto firms, including a dedicated government concierge service to assist high-potential businesses. Furthermore, the letter suggested that the UK government recognize the synergies between blockchain, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing, and explore their combined potential for public services. Additionally, the coalition called for the establishment of a high-level forum where industry leaders, regulators, and government officials can collaborate on digital asset policies. They believe that the UK has the resources and infrastructure to become a hub for blockchain innovation, especially due to the country’s strong talent pool, regulatory sophistication, and academic institutions. (Source: LinkedIn ) The trade bodies estimate that the crypto and blockchain sector could add 57 billion British pounds, or $73.6 billion, to the UK economy over the next decade. They also project that the global economic contribution of the sector could reach $1.8 trillion by 2030.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|USDC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-02 13:47:01

With the Treasury Department and federal agencies set to reveal their digital asset holdings, including Bitcoin, on April 5, all eyes are on which cryptocurrencies will make the cut. While Bitcoin’s inclusion seems certain, the real question is: which altcoins will join it? Interestingly, Trump has already dropped hints about his top picks – Here are they! US Is Set to Reveal Crypto Stockpile On March 6, Trump signed an executive order to create the U.S. Strategic Digital Asset Reserve also known as the Digital Asset Stockpile, which will include various cryptocurrencies. As part of the plan, all federal agencies must report their Bitcoin and other crypto holdings to the Treasury Secretary within 30 days, setting the deadline for April 5. A key point in the order is that the Treasury and Commerce Secretaries are allowed to expand the reserve with budget-neutral strategies. This means they can acquire more crypto assets through strategic deals rather than direct spending. Key Altcoin To Watch However, a week earlier, before signing an executive order, Trump took to Truth Social to hint at the digital assets he favors. Alongside Bitcoin, he mentioned Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). These five cryptocurrencies could play a major role in the U.S. crypto stockpile. Meanwhile, these assets are among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, making them strong contenders for the reserve. Bitcoin remains the dominant player with a market value of $1.69 trillion, followed by Ethereum at $225.4 billion. XRP, Solana, and Cardano hold market caps of $123.6 billion, $64.8 billion, and $24.14 billion, respectively.

42804547,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145417,1743601840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: North Korean IT Workers Target UK Crypto Firms in Alarming Crypto Cyber Threat,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/north-korean-it-workers-uk/,"In an alarming development for the cryptocurrency world, Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has issued a stark warning: North Korean IT workers are aggressively shifting their cyber infiltration efforts towards the UK, specifically targeting blockchain firms. This marks a significant geographical pivot from their previous focus on the U.S., highlighting a growing and evolving threat landscape for the global crypto industry. Are you prepared for this emerging digital siege? Let’s delve into the details of this critical security concern and understand how it could impact your crypto ventures. Why the Shift to UK Blockchain Firms by North Korean IT Workers? For some time, North Korean IT workers have been under the microscope of U.S. authorities due to their involvement in cyber-enabled financial crime, often aimed at funding the nation’s weapons programs. As U.S. scrutiny intensifies, these cyber operatives are adapting, seeking softer targets and less heavily monitored territories. The UK, with its burgeoning fintech sector and growing number of UK blockchain firms , presents an attractive alternative. Cointelegraph reported on GTIG’s findings, emphasizing this geographical shift and the increasing sophistication of these threat actors. Several factors contribute to the UK becoming a prime target: Less Intense Scrutiny (Compared to the U.S.): While the UK has cybersecurity measures in place, the level of focused attention and resources dedicated to tracking North Korean cyber activities might not be as extensive as in the U.S., creating perceived vulnerabilities. Thriving Fintech and Crypto Scene: The UK is a global hub for financial technology, with a vibrant and expanding cryptocurrency ecosystem. This offers a larger pool of potential targets for financially motivated cybercriminals. Remote Work Culture: The global shift towards remote work, accelerated by recent events, has inadvertently opened doors for these deceptive operatives. They can more easily blend into the remote workforce and secure positions within unsuspecting companies. The Modus Operandi: Remote Job Scams and Fake Identities The tactics employed by these remote job scams are cunning and deceptive. These individuals create elaborate fake identities, often with fabricated resumes and online profiles, to apply for legitimate remote positions within blockchain and cryptocurrency companies. They are particularly targeting projects involving: Solana: A high-performance blockchain platform known for its speed and scalability. Anchor Protocol: A decentralized savings protocol offering attractive yields. AI-Driven Blockchain Applications: Projects that integrate artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, often complex and cutting-edge. By successfully infiltrating these organizations, they gain insider access to sensitive information, intellectual property, and, most importantly, financial assets. Their ultimate goal is often to siphon funds, steal cryptocurrency, or compromise the integrity of the blockchain projects themselves. The deceptive nature of these remote job scams makes them particularly challenging to detect early on. Understanding the Cyber Threats Posed by North Korean Operatives The cyber threats emanating from North Korean IT workers are multifaceted and can have devastating consequences for targeted organizations. It’s crucial to understand the potential risks: Threat Type Description Potential Impact Financial Theft Directly stealing cryptocurrency assets from company wallets or customer accounts. Significant financial losses, reputational damage, loss of investor confidence. Data Breach and Exfiltration Stealing sensitive company data, including proprietary code, customer information, and financial records. Competitive disadvantage, regulatory fines, legal repercussions, erosion of trust. Supply Chain Attacks Compromising software or systems used by the targeted company to inject malware or backdoors, potentially affecting a wider network of users and partners. Widespread disruption, cascading failures, systemic risk to the blockchain ecosystem. Intellectual Property Theft Stealing innovative blockchain technologies and algorithms for North Korea’s own technological advancement or for sale to other malicious actors. Undermining innovation, hindering the growth of legitimate blockchain companies, enabling further illicit activities. These cyber threats are not merely theoretical risks; they are real and present dangers that demand immediate and proactive cybersecurity measures. Strengthening Crypto Security: Actionable Insights for UK Firms In light of this escalating threat, bolstering crypto security is no longer optional but a critical necessity for UK blockchain firms . Here are actionable steps that organizations can take to mitigate these risks: Enhanced Due Diligence in Hiring: Implement rigorous background checks, especially for remote positions. Verify credentials, conduct thorough interviews (including video interviews to assess authenticity), and check references meticulously. Robust Identity Verification Processes: Utilize advanced identity verification technologies to confirm the true identities of remote employees. Consider biometric verification and multi-factor authentication for access to sensitive systems. Cybersecurity Awareness Training: Educate your employees about the tactics used in remote job scams and phishing attempts. Regular training can significantly reduce the risk of human error, a common entry point for cyberattacks. Network Segmentation and Access Control: Implement network segmentation to limit the lateral movement of attackers within your systems. Enforce strict access control policies, granting employees only the necessary permissions. Continuous Security Monitoring: Employ real-time security monitoring tools and intrusion detection systems to identify and respond to suspicious activities promptly. Regularly audit security logs and systems for anomalies. Incident Response Plan: Develop and regularly test an incident response plan to effectively handle security breaches. A well-prepared plan can minimize damage and facilitate a swift recovery. Collaboration and Information Sharing: Engage with industry cybersecurity groups and law enforcement agencies to stay informed about the latest threats and share threat intelligence. By proactively enhancing crypto security measures, UK blockchain firms can significantly reduce their vulnerability to these sophisticated cyberattacks. Spotting Red Flags: Identifying Potential Remote Job Scams Being vigilant and recognizing the red flags associated with remote job scams is crucial for protecting your organization. Here are some indicators to watch out for: Generic or Vague Job Descriptions: Be wary of job postings that lack specific details about the role, responsibilities, or required skills. Unrealistic Salary Offers: If the salary seems too good to be true for the advertised position, it could be a lure. Research industry benchmarks for comparable roles. Lack of Formal Interview Process: Legitimate companies typically have a structured interview process. Be suspicious if the hiring process is rushed or informal. Requests for Sensitive Information Early On: Be cautious if asked for sensitive personal or financial information (like bank account details or social security numbers) before a formal job offer. Inconsistencies in Online Profiles: Cross-reference information on resumes and online profiles (LinkedIn, etc.). Look for inconsistencies or lack of professional online presence. Poor Communication Skills: Pay attention to the quality of communication. Grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or reluctance to engage in detailed conversations can be red flags. By being aware of these potential red flags, companies can improve their ability to detect and avoid falling victim to remote job scams orchestrated by malicious actors. Conclusion: A Call to Vigilance in the Crypto World The warning from Google GTIG serves as a critical wake-up call for the cryptocurrency industry, particularly for UK blockchain firms . The evolving tactics of North Korean IT workers and their strategic shift towards the UK underscore the persistent and adaptable nature of cyber threats in the digital age. Ignoring these cyber threats is not an option. Proactive vigilance, robust security measures, and continuous adaptation are paramount to safeguarding your crypto assets, your company’s reputation, and the integrity of the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.

The price is constantly failing to hold above the $2 level. In the past few months, the $2 level has been an important support zone and a dip below $2 may signal more trouble for XRP. The broader market sentiment is slightly shifting with Bitcoin trading above the $85,500 mark. Here’s a breakdown of what’s next for XRP in April: According to analyst Egrag Crypto, April is shaping up to be a key month, with price action expected to test both the lower and upper ends of the range. XRP is likely to revisit the lows around $1.90–$1.79 through a wicking process. At the same time, the upper range near $2.80–$3.00 will also be tested in a similar way. If the downside wick holds, there’s potential for a 62–70% upside from the lowest point. The market is still in the “boredom phase,” according to the analyst. After one final dip to the $2 region, a strong upward move could follow in this cycle. #XRP – April Candle Formation Forecast April is shaping up to be a dynamic month where we’ll see tests at both ends of the range.

The price has since hovered around $85,000 on April 2. The latest rejection from the $85,500 resistance level raises questions about whether BTC price could drop further over the next few days. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Trump’s tariffs could drive Bitcoin prices lower? April 2 marks what US President Donald Trump dubbed “Liberation Day,” unveiling sweeping reciprocal tariffs targeting imports from numerous countries. Market participants are concerned this might trigger another sell-off in cryptocurrencies, pushing prices lower. Key takeaways: The proposed tariffs include a 25% levy on auto imports and broad duties on goods from nations like China, Canada, and Mexico. While these measures aim to reduce the US trade deficit and bolster domestic manufacturing, they could result in inflation and a risk-off mood. This could spook investors in the global market, with risk-on assets like Bitcoin bearing most of the brunt. For instance, when Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China in early March, Bitcoin dropped from $105,000 to $92,000 overnight. Commenting on the current risk-asset landscape, trading firm QCP Capital emphasized the effects of Trump’s trade tariffs release today, especially as investors brace for retaliatory measures from affected nations. “The US seems increasingly intent on isolating itself in pursuit of more favorable trading terms,” the firm said in a Telegram note to investors, adding that the targeted countries are “not likely to concede.” QCP also pointed out that “rather than fracturing under pressure,” global players appear to be closing ranks, particularly after a meeting by officials from China, Japan and Korea to explore deeper regional trade cooperation. “In the short term, we expect all risk assets to remain under pressure.” Inflationary pressures and a shift to safe havens Trump’s tariffs are widely expected to fuel short-term inflation, a dynamic that typically pressures risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Key points: Higher import costs translate to rising consumer prices, prompting a flight to traditional safe-haven assets such as gold, which hit a record high of $3,150 per ounce this year, or US Treasurys. Unlike gold, Bitcoin has yet to fully establish itself as a reliable inflation hedge in the eyes of investors. While some view it as “digital gold,” BTC price remains highly correlated to stocks. The February 2025 crypto crash, which saw $2 billion in liquidations after earlier tariff announcements, underscores this vulnerability. Liquidity could tighten as the Fed is signaling a cautious approach to rate cuts. Lowering of interest rates, for example, is unlikely before June, despite one Fed meeting scheduled in the interim, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool . Fed target rate probabilities for May 7 FOMC meeting. Source: CME Group The odds of the Fed keeping interest rates unchanged at the May 7 meeting are 83.5%. This could further dampen enthusiasm for BTC and push its price lower if key price levels do not hold. Related: Bitcoin price can hit $250K in 2025 if Fed shifts to QE: Arthur Hayes Bitcoin price analysis sees a ‘lot of volatility’ ahead Bitcoin’s price is notoriously prone to overreactions, amplified by leveraged trading in the crypto derivatives market. The uncertainty surrounding the scope and retaliation to Trump’s April 2 tariffs could spark panic selling, triggering a cascade of liquidations. “Today is the day where the Trump administration shares details about the proposed tariffs on the rest of the world,” popular trader Daan Crypto Trades wrote on X. Market participants have been looking forward to this event over the last few weeks, which has caused a lot of uncertainty. “Depending on the severity of the tariffs and how the market interprets it, a larger move is due,” the trader said, adding: “Regardless of what happens, a lot of volatility is pretty much a guarantee today.” Others doubted the severity of Trump’s tariffs, with analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe arguing that it could be “a big non-event or an event that's heavily priced into the markets.” “I would expect the markets to go back to neutral after today is over.” Fellow analyst AlphaBTC believes that Bitcoin price must hold above $84,000 to avoid deeper corrections. The analyst shared a chart showing that a breakdown of the $84,000 support would trigger a sell-off to areas below $80,000, with the March 14 low at $79,900 being the first level of interest. 📈 #Bitcoin must hold 84K ‼️ Keeping it simple, no H4 close below 64K and last the day without Trump dumping on markets. #Crypto #BTC https://t.co/UPRkWfegdP pic.twitter.com/OkJDc5jXWl — AlphaBTC (@mark_cullen) April 2, 2025 This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The events of the whales offloading altcoins to exchange is one such indicator for the investors to sell. Such movements indicate that the large trader’s confidence in that asset is low, and they may potentially sell them. If they did, this could build selling pressure on the tokens and crash their prices. 3 Altcoins to Sell Before They Crash In an X post, the santiment revealed that crypto whales have moved an ample supply of many tokens, hinting at the upcoming sell-off. Such events create the need for the altcoins to sell before the downtrend begins, and traders end up bearing losses. According to Santiment, Eurite (EURI), Neiro (NEIRO), and Moca (MOCA) witnessed large transfers to crypto exchanges. Let’s discuss them one by one. 1. Eurite (EURI) EURI is among the relatively newly launched tokens and had a great start before crashing in late 2024. Interestingly, it made a significant recovery in the last month when the rest of the cryptos crashed. However, the whales moving nearly 2.92% of its total supply is concerning. If the whales decide to dump the token, it could result in a serious downtrend, making it among the top altcoins to sell. 2. Neiro (NEIRO) Neiro token’s performance is in turmoil, as its performance is 94% down from its prime, showcasing weak demand among investors. Moreover, as the crypto market crashed , investors’ interest shifted toward more utility-based tokens. The whales moving 1.21% of its total supply is an indication of the same. Long-term low demand and whale offloading could trigger a further downtrend. 3. Moca Network (MOCA) After a highly bullish performance at the beginning of the year, the MOCA token is crashing like most of the cryptos. The token is 85% down from its prime and lacks significant bull momentum, especially as downward pressure is high on the market due to today’s Donald Trump tariff announcement . The crypto whales’ 0.88% supply moves increased the possibility of a crash, making it among the top altcoins to sell. Will These Cryptos Crash Next? Although whales’ movement often indicates potential selling incidents, this does not necessarily mean the same. More importantly, the effect may not be as severe as a crypto crash as all these altcoins are already following a downtrend, so the investors’ sentiments may not drop hastily. Besides, the entire crypto market is on the verge of crashing due to investors’ fearful sentiments before Donald Trump’s tariff report. Investors must stay updated with the market and consider risky cryptos to sell.

While BTC is influenced by macroeconomic policies and liquidity cycles, let’s explore if Bitcoin’s funding rate will help in predicting the next Ethereum price move. Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. It stands tall at $1.68 trillion, while Ethereum (ETH), the second largest crypto’s market cap is $226 billion. Due to capital flows, the correlation of altcoins, including Ethereum, with Bitcoin is high. Due to this, a sudden crash or rally in BTC is reflected by the crypto market as well. Why Bitcoin’s Funding Rate Matters to Ethereum Price? Funding rate is a concept developed to maintain the price of perpetuals with the spot price of the underlying asset. If the funding rate of Bitcoin is high, it suggests that it is expensive to long, i.e., longs pay shorts and vice versa. Often this is a sell signal. Since this metric will determine the directional bias for BTC, it can be used to determine how other altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) will react. According to on-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr ., the average funding rate of Bitcoin on Binance, ByBit, OKX, and Deribit has dropped into the negative territory. This is a bullish signal that has previously resulted in bullish reversal. Bitcoin Funding Rate Implication on Ethereum price Adler adds that despite this bullish sign, “poor macroeconomic indicators” are “blocking” Bitcoin and Ethereum prices from rallying. “The corporate sector is actively buying coins, spot market selling pressure is minimal, experienced investors have stopped selling, LTH have returned to accumulation, and several on-chain metrics indicate a normalization of market conditions after the overheating phase.” If it weren’t for the macroeconomic conditions, ETH’s value could have pushed higher with Bitcoin price. Furthermore, positive signals from the Fed and the Trump administration has also paved the way for renewed “inflow of cash via ETFs, potentially triggering the start of a new rally”, says Adler. Ethereum Price Analysis Analyst Michaël van de Poppe explained that an Ethereum price rally is possible if the ETHBTC ratio flips from 0.03 to a support level. “The only thing $ETH needs to do is to bottom out here. And that’s a very, very hard task.” ETHBTC On the other hand, there is a massive bullish divergence developing between Ethereum price and Relative Strength Index (RSI) since July 2024. A bullish divergence is when the price produces lower high and RSI produces a higher lows. This non-conformity is indicates that momentum is rising while price is not reflecting it, which suggests a bounce is likely. ETH PRICE ANALYSIS If the RSI divergence plays out, investors can expect Ethereum price prediction to forecast a massive rally. The short-term target would be $3,000. Beyond this, $4,000 and $5,000 are good psychological levels to watch.

It analyzes the project’s technical architecture, compliance framework and its potential impact on regulated asset tokenization . The report presents insights into transaction efficiency, security mechanisms and crosschain interoperability. It also evaluates how Coreum fits into the evolving financial landscape. Blockchain evolution and institutional requirements The adoption of blockchain technology by financial institutions has been increasing in lockstep, with the value locked in tokenized real-world assets (RWA). The latter grew by 85% in 2024 . Our report examines how third-generation blockchains, such as Coreum, are addressing the challenges of scalability, regulatory compliance and interoperability. Improvements in the infrastructure on the base layer will lead to more seamless institutional adoption in the future. Read the full version of the report for free here . Coreum is structured to support applications that require predictable transaction costs, regulatory oversight and seamless integration with financial infrastructure. Network data indicates that Coreum achieves a transaction throughput in excess of 7,000 TPS and a time to finality of about 1.2 seconds . This positions Coreum well in a crowded and highly competitive layer-1 blockchain landscape. Coreum integrates most of its compliance features at the protocol level, a critical factor for institutional adoption. The network includes onchain KYC and AML monitoring in collaboration with AnChain.ai , an AI-driven compliance provider. This is unlike conventional blockchains, where compliance tools are third-party application-layer software. Coreum puts compliance at its foundation together with real-time risk assessment and fraud detection. Decentralized exchange (DEX) and institutional trading infrastructure Our report also analyses Coreum’s decentralized exchange (DEX) infrastructure. While many layer-1 blockchains rely on liquidity pools, Coreum features a built-in onchain order book. There are important differences between the models. Coreum’s order book DEX allows for deterministic trade execution with minimal slippage, which makes it well-suited for institutional trading strategies. In contrast, AMM-based DEXs rely on liquidity pools that sometimes lead to price inefficiencies and higher exposure to impermanent loss. Coreum’s DEX architecture also supports high-frequency trading, with transaction processing speeds comparable to traditional financial exchanges. A notable aspect of Coreum’s DEX is its advanced API , which enables integration with institutional trading systems. The API is designed to provide low-latency access to order book data, market execution tools and automated trading strategies. This infrastructure allows financial firms and market makers to integrate Coreum’s DEX into their existing trading workflows. It ensures compliance with industry standards and benefits from blockchain-based settlement efficiencies. Read the full version of the report for free here . Interoperability and network connectivity Coreum’s interoperability strategy includes connections with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and the Cosmos/IBC network. These integrations enable crosschain liquidity and asset transfers, which creates support for financial applications that require seamless movement between blockchain ecosystems. This integration allows institutional users to leverage XRPL’s efficiency in payments and Cosmos’ modular interoperability framework with over 100 connected chains . The ability to interact with multiple networks without sacrificing security or compliance aligns with institutional requirements for blockchain adoption. Conclusion: Networks designed for institutional adoption will need to address compliance, scalability and interoperability challenges. Coreum’s technical structure and regulatory considerations provide a case study for how blockchain networks may evolve to meet these requirements. With its deterministic fee structure, built-in compliance framework and high-speed trading infrastructure, Coreum represents an example of how third-generation blockchains are positioning themselves at the intersection of crypto and regulated financial markets.

The Breez SDK was initially developed to simplify the process of integrating Lightning Network support into different consumer applications. Dozens of existing projects and companies currently build on Lightning using the SDK. The SDK supports two methods of Lightning integration. Native, which allows app developers to integrate a Lightning wallet or functionality utilizing the Greenlight service offered by Blockstream, which allows the wallet provider to host a cloud based Lightning node for users while keeping private keys solely in the users control, and Nodeless, which allows Liquid support to seamlessly integrate with the Lightning Network. Both models supported in the SDK give full support to the range of features available on the Lightning Network, as well as Liquid, without the complexity of having to build support from scratch. Misty Breez is built on the Nodeless SDK tooling. This means that users’ coins are self-custodied on the Liquid sidechain, giving users the ability to fully control their own funds but also requiring the trust trade-offs involved in using the Liquid Network (i.e. that the majority Federation signers will remain honest and trustworthy). The wallet supports BOLT 11 and BOLT 12 invoices, LNURL-Pay, Lightning Addresses, on-chain BTC addresses, and even Matt Corrallo’s BIP 353 using DNS to fetch payment details for another user’s wallet. It also supports offline payments based on mobile notifications in the phone’s operating system. Breez SDK’s goal is to provide developers with the tooling to build a seamless and use-case specific user experience with as little effort as possible. In that vein Misty Breez aims to set a benchmark for a simplified user experience that other developers can use as a reference for Lightning integration into their own applications, or even to build on top of Misty Breez itself. If you want, feel free to simply integrate the functionality you seek to build into Misty Breez itself and rebrand it however you want (it is 100% opensource). Documentation for the Breez SDK Nodeless configuration used by Misty Breez is available here . The Github for the Misty Breez implementation is available here . Lastly, for users who wish to play around with the application, early access release is available here for Android , and here for iOS . All the tooling for developers to build a new UX experience for users is here today.

How Frostr Saves Your Nostr Identity,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/no-password-reset-how-frostr-saves-your-nostr-identity,"Bitcoin Magazine No Password Reset? How Frostr Saves Your Nostr Identity Born out of a hackathon at TABCONF 2024, Frostr may have just solved Nostr ’s most pernicious issue: the inability to reset your password if your private key gets compromised. Started in October of 2024, Frostr just announced the alpha release of Igloo and Forst2x , a desktop and accompanying browser extension key signers for the Nostr ecosystem. The project was founded by Topher ( cmdruid ) who made his name as a Bitcoin engineer for developing Tapscript — a popular library for managing Taproot, Schnorr signatures, and Bitcoin transactions — and Austin ( bitcoinplebdev ) a Lightning developer for Voltage and founder of PlebDevs , a Lightning-powered developer education platform with over 500 enrolled students. While resetting a password may seem innocuous or like a simple UI feature, it’s not that easy. Let me take you on a journey of the complexity of the issue it solves and the magnitude of what is at stake if we fail to solve this apparently simple problem. The Social Media Revolution Social media has changed the world. And yet, we find ourselves in a strange place with our digital identities. Who we are online and how we assert ownership of our online profiles often depends on trusted third parties like Facebook that are too big to care about any individual customer and fundamentally have the power to change the rules at any time, or even cancel your account altogether. The deplatforming of controversial influencers and even politicians in recent years serve as examples of how this centralized power can be wielded. Perhaps the best-known illustration of this is the removal of U.S. President Donald Trump from both Facebook and Twitter shortly after the January 6 riots at the U.S. capitol, just days before the end of his first term. Still, much of the world continues to operate on this digital neo-feudalism structure. It seems there’s a fundamental problem with the “decentralization” of identity that is yet to be solved. Modern-Day Bank Robbery Identity systems are a critical layer of society. Whether you are a citizen of Rome 2,000 years ago or of the United States today, doors open and close based on what ID you hold. Today’s systems, as advanced as they may seem, rely on a pre-digital conception of identity and security: They depend on authenticating your face. The ID card itself, whether your driver’s license or passport, helps government employees, bank tellers and bar bouncers all over the world do a very simple thing: Decide if you look like the person on the official card, and then sort out if you are allowed access or not. But the world is changing fast. Neither the obscurity of your physical appearance nor the secret nature of your social security number (SSN) are what they were in the pre-internet world: Many people have published their full names and pictures to Facebook, and a series of hacks have leaked tons of SSN data to the dark web. (For example, the Equifax Data Breach in 2017 , which affected 147.9 million Americans, or the National Public Data Breach of 2024 with over 200 million Americans compromised.) In the analog, pre-internet days, when a robber burst through the doors of their local bank, they would do so to take the cash, gold and tradable valuables stored in the vaults. But that’s no longer how things work. In the digital age, money is no longer cash. Fiat payments are often reversible, so if you hack into a bank and move money to your account somehow, not only can that be reversed, but you just exposed a link to your identity. Today, the online equivalent of a robber is not looking to steal cash, gold or other valuables, but rather, personal identity data. That data can, in turn, be used to defraud those same banks, as well as businesses of all sizes. Indeed, identity fraud costs more than all other forms of theft combined, totaling over $56 billion in 2020. Not only have many of these centralized platforms had their data vaults hacked and their contents sold on the dark web for pennies on the dollar, but AI is improving quickly and has already passed the Turing test of image generation. We are at a point where rogue actors can create fake selfies holding fake IDs with leaked user data and fool the gatekeepers to your digital wealth. This threat is likely to incentivize change, and you can see the new efforts by tech companies and government institutions to upgrade identity systems. Take California’s mobile driver’s license app as an example, mDL — developed in partnership with both Google and Apple — is initially integrated with airports for identity verification. But the app also invites developers to integrate it as a form of authentication for websites in general. ID.me takes a similar approach and is already fully integrated with the IRS, boasting 136 million members. Many of these apps require face or fingerprint authentication, and ask for increasingly complex KYC selfies from their users who must hold up IDs and recent newspapers to be authenticated. Despite the obvious weakness of using your face to authenticate your identity in the age of Facebook, tech giants continue to rely on biometric data, combining it with mass surveillance tools seen in the social credit score systems being built up in China . To have a chance at curbing what seems like fate in the digital age, before it comes to the West, we need an identity authentication system that is both secure and agnostic to biometric data. We need an identity system that does not rely on our face. Enter Nostr, a Bitcoin-Era Identity and Social Media Protocol Born out of the Bitcoin developer ecosystem, Nostr has quickly grown into a social media network in its own right. An abbreviation of “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays” — a bit of a mouthful — Nostr empowers users to authenticate themselves into social media pseudonyms (nyms) and sign their posts with a Bitcoin-style private key. As a self-custody system that fundamentally democratizes the internet away from its current structure, it opens up a whole new set of possibilities for social media. Proponents of Nostr argue that users can finally own their own data and no longer need to depend on the charity or benevolence of the Silicon Valley giants when they decide to move platforms or pick the wrong political party. Nostr works via a distributed client-server network topology, which allows you to access content across various servers called relays. If one goes down or starts censoring users unfairly, chances are there’s another window into the Nostr content feed that will grant you access and allow you to publish your thoughts. The dream of Nostr is to unlock a new generation of social media technology that does not turn users into products by mining their data, that does not force biometric authentication, compromising their privacy, and that allows developers to build in an open network whose cryptography and specs are already open source and which is natively integrated with Bitcoin, the internet’s money. Celebrities and users who wish to protect their Nostr brands from fake accounts trying to impersonate them can follow a standard similar to the one developed by Keybase , which asked users to publicly attest to their a keybase identity with their other social media accounts, consolidating markers of reputation into one cryptographically controlled identity. Though that is not currently a practice in Nostr, it is a problem reasonably well solved in a decentralized way by Keybase. However, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Pushing identity ownership to the edges comes with a whole new set of problems that up until now have not really been solved and which have personally held me back from investing in building up my brand on Nostr. No Password Resets There’s currently no real way to reset your password for a Nostr nym or identity. Built on a simple public key pair system, if your private key gets hacked or leaked, your identity is essentially now under the control of whoever got it. (You both have the secret, so no one has exclusive control of it.) This is a huge issue. Although the examples of such hacks are not too common, they are a significant deterrent for brands that might consider putting serious capital into building on this new social network protocol. This particular risk is made worse by the intended design of Nostr, which invites many different interfaces to be created to access content of various kinds with the same user identities and means that users give their private keys to multiple clients, thus multiplying the risk of compromise. One layer of defense that has been built up and become popular as a result is the idea of an external signer, often a browser extension like Alby that helps manage your private key as a kind of password manager, facilitating signing of content for you on the various Nostr platforms. While this works well enough today it doesn’t solve the fundamental problem. One mistake and the nym is effectively compromised, the value of that built-up brand or reputation not just harmed but potentially exploitable by scammers wearing your identity to harass your friends or customers. This is similar to the very common impersonation scams on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, which clone your profile and DM your known associates with phishing schemes, but even worse. In Nostr such an attack would be done with your identity — not a fake profile — significantly harming confidence in the authenticity of all content for those who are aware of the issue. The solution should be simple: just create a password reset feature. Right? Well, it turns out some very creative engineering is needed here, because password resets are basically only possible by giving up your control over your identity to a third party who can update a central database and give you a new key set. Until now, that is. Let’s dive into Frostr. Frost a Breakthrough in Sovereign Key Management Recent breakthroughs in cryptography have opened new doors for self custody in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry. One specific innovation that is quickly entering the market is Frost, a Schnorr-based key management and key rotation scheme that achieves similar functionality as Bitcoin multi-signature addresses and transactions, but without the on-chain transactions costs or privacy trade-offs. Schnorr is a form of cryptography invented in the 1990s. A few years after the expiration of its European and U.S. patents, Schnorr started being discussed as a possible future upgrade to Bitcoin, and was ultimately introduced in the Taproot soft fork upgrade of 2020. That same year Chelsea Komlo and Ian Goldberg published “FROST: Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures”, a technical spec that set the foundation for its use in the Lightning Network infrastructure as well as new multi-signature schemes for self custody known as FROST. While the cryptography is complex and explaining it beyond the scope of this article, it resembles schemes like Shamir’s secret sharing. The cryptographic principles involved allow users to create a 24-word seed with Trezor’s hardware wallet, split up into three shares of 12 words each. Any two shares combined can be assembled into the master private key of the wallet, while any one share alone is insufficient to compromise or recover access to the account. Here’s a two-minute video explanation of FROST by Andrew Poelstra, Head of Research at Blockstream: This same principle is used in FROST, a scheme which is designed to enable multi-party, multi-signature wallets, like those used by exchanges, potentially replacing multi-signature Bitcoin scripts, benefiting users with more privacy and lower costs. Frostr extends FROST by integrating it with Nostr’s relay protocol — hence the added “r” in the name. It also adapts the technology to single-user wallets, rather than industrial-grade, multi-user schemes, allowing simpler setups and unlocking key rotation (password resets) for individual users with single key pairs, like those used in Nostr. Frostr enables three new features in particular: Threshold key signing, so that if one key gets compromised, it can be rotated out, and a fresh set of sub keys are generated, which generate the Nostr private keypair. No need to change your Nostr public and private keys (nsec). Similar to — for example — a 2-of-3 multisignature Bitcoin wallet, where if one key is lost or compromised, the other two can be used to move the coins to a new stable structure, and regain control of three fresh keys, but off-chain. It’s a magical thing. No need for application-layer solutions to Nostr key rotation, only the key signers like Alby would have to integrate Frostr; Nostr apps like Primal or Damus would not even know that Frostr is being used for key rotation by its users. Users who already have Nostr accounts, whose nsecs have not been compromised, do not need to migrate to new keypairs and identities but simply remove their nsecs from current key signers and start using Frostr as a more secure key management system instead. The result? A major piece of the decentralized social media puzzle is unlocked: Trustless identities with password resets that do not depend on centralized gatekeepers for authentication. The consequences of this innovation, if fruitful, are fundamental. The Nostr ecosystem would be wise to take a look at Frostr; it might just be enough of a security and UI improvement that a whole new generation of non-biometric, trustless digital identities, and sovereign data ownership use cases are unlocked for the Bitcoin age.

Cardano price is experiencing significant volatility following announcements about a potential US crypto strategic reserve. While Cardano surged a little on the news, many investors have begun diversifying their portfolios by rushing to emerging projects like Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , which has now raised over $3.18 million in its presale as it advances through Stage 3. Cardano Price Prediction Cardano has been on quite a ride lately. After the reserve announcement , ADA experienced a temporary surge, reigniting interest in investors. This movement highlighted Cardano’s potential as a scalable smart contract platform with strong fundamentals. Credits: TradingView However, it seems the movement was temporary, as the altcoin has dipped by over 3% in the past week. But, Cardano performed better in the past one month time frame when compared to Bitcoin. Moreover, Cardano has suffered from several regulation-based problems in the past. Now that the SEC has become even stricter when it comes to cryptocurrencies, investors are finding a potential risk. Cardano price is currently at $0.6880 as published on CoinMarketCap. This is why they are moving to newer projects like YETIO. New Viral Play-To-Earn Altcoin – Yeti Ouro Yeti Ouro has emerged as a fresh alternative for investors seeking new opportunities beyond established cryptos. This ERC-20 token uses a deflationary model and real-world utility to create a sustainable demand for itself. Moreover, YETIO’s differentiator lies in its advanced Play-to-Earn (P2E) game called Yeti Go. Bringing serious industry firepower to the table, the team behind this project has joined forces with a leading game asset studio credited with hits like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space. On the audio side, the vibe is just as premium—crafted by sound engineers who’ve worked with Grammy-nominated artists including Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid. Ready for a first look? Scroll down to meet the game’s central character and catch an exclusive glimpse of the striking visuals that set the stage. The project’s presale has gained remarkable traction, selling over 206 million tokens and raising more than $3 million so far in investments. This success indicates strong market confidence and positions early investors for potential significant returns. The timing is particularly strategic, as Yeti Ouro advances along its development roadmap while SOLIDProof’s audit report —detailing the game’s mechanics and ecosystem—takes shape Why is Cardano’s Community Moving to YETIO? Cardano’s community hasn’t particularly lost trust in the altcoin; it’s just diversifying. Cardano’s slow progress has a lot to do with this. Moreover, the attraction also lies in YETIO’s amazing risk-reward profile. While Cardano’s success hinges on long-term ecosystem growth, YETIO’s presale offers much higher price growth chances: Exchange Listings : As YETIO launches on major exchanges in the coming days, its presale success can be replicated there as well. Gaming Adoption : According to the project’s roadmap, Yeti Go’s cross-platform launch (PC, iOS, Android) targets several thousand active users by 2026, which means it has the potential to tap into the massive gaming industry. To invest in YETIO is easy. Investors will need a suitable Defi Wallet on the respective network, which may include Metamask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase, etc, place an order on the official Yeti Ouro website for the required amount of YETIO tokens and complete with one-click transaction. Conclusion Cardano’s vision of a decentralized world remains noble, but the market rewards utility and speed. Yeti Ouro’s presale momentum shows that it is a project that delivers now, not tomorrow. With $3.18 million raised and a gaming ecosystem poised for launch, YETIO offers a bridge between blockchain’s promise and its practical application. At the same time, Cardano’s journey is far from over, but its investors want something new. By diversifying into Yeti Ouro, they’re not just chasing gains, they’re endorsing a future where blockchain’s value is measured in fun, engagement, and real-world use. YETIO tokens are currently available for $0.024 in its presale. So, invest now to make the most out of this early bird offer! Moreover, if you invest over $500, you get a 15% bonus on your purchases!

42805181,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=704242,1743602412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42805181.jpeg,"DOGE official at DOJ brags about hacking, distributing pirated software",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/doge-official-at-doj-brags-about-hacking/,"A senior advisor at the US Justice Department (DOJ), Christopher Stanley, boasted about his past involvement in hacking and distributing pirated software, according to archived copies of his former websites. Stanley, who worked for both Elon Musk’s companies, X and SpaceX, now holds an advisory capacity in the Deputy Attorney General’s office. Stanley, 33, was appointed to the Justice Department during his tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), an initiative co-founded by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, set up by President Donald Trump to cut down federal spending. While serving at the newly created government office, Stanley was quickly promoted to a senior advisory position in the Deputy Attorney General’s office, a role with access to sensitive federal investigations and grand jury secrets. The Justice Department confirmed that Stanley holds an active security clearance, which predates his work at DOGE. Stanley’s piracy and illegal distribution of software past According to a Wednesday Reuters exclusive , Stanley’s online history dates back to 2006 when, at just 15 years old, he began running websites and forums focused on software piracy, video game cheats, and hacking. The archived versions of these websites show that Stanley distributed pirated ebooks and bootleg software while also posting about his hacking exploits, as documented by archived copies stored by the nonprofit Internet Archive and its ‘Wayback Machine.’ Under the fake names “eNkrypt” and “Reneg4d3,” he bragged about getting into other websites. In a 2008 post, he talked about how he took over a competitor’s message board. One of his known forums, fkn-pwnd.com, proudly claimed to “ Fucking Up Servers ” and contained explicit content that mocked victims of his hacking activities. Stanley continued his illegal actions online over the years on reneg4d3.com, error33.net, and electonic.net, among others, where he and other users talked about hacking and stealing software. According to reneg4d3.com, Stanley explained how he used flaws in other websites to get in without authorization and then took over a competing website for cheating in video games. When Stanley was 19, he wrote, “I no longer hack into PayPals, gain root access into other people’s computers (sic), or exploit online websites like StickAM.” This meant that he no longer hacked into computers. He made the post after allegedly receiving a lawsuit threat from the South Korean gaming company Nexon Co. for allegedly “infiltrating their game software and altering certain aspects of the game.” Still, in 2014, Stanley reportedly shared footage on YouTube of himself breaching a rival hacking group’s customer database, meaning he was still partaking in malicious activity. A concern for national security Reuters said that six former Justice Department officials are worried about Stanley’s background because of the sensitive nature of his job at the DOJ right now. Jonathan Rusch, a former Justice Department prosecutor, said that after he admitted to handling stolen data, it is debatable if he can safeguard sensitive records. “I would have very serious concerns about hiring him in and giving him access to these kinds of records,” Rusch said. Others who worked with the DOJ before, like cybersecurity analyst Dan Guido, suggested that Stanley’s experience with cybercriminals could be viewed as a learning experience rather than a liability. Several of the 33-year-old’s websites have now disappeared from the Internet Archive. Stanley’s specific responsibilities within the DOJ are unclear, though the Deputy Attorney General’s office, led by former Trump attorney Todd Blanche, oversees US Attorney’s offices and manages criminal investigations into various offenses, including hacking and cybercrime. It is also unknown whether Stanley is still employed by X and SpaceX, but he lists these companies on his LinkedIn profile. Christopher Stanley still lists his roles with X and Space X on his X profile. Source: X (formerly Twitter) A profile photo on X shows him standing in front of the Office of Justice Programs emblem, which is part of the department responsible for awarding grant funds. According to the DOJ, Stanley, like Musk, holds the title of “special government employee” and does not receive a government salary.

However, according to two chartists the popular meme‐inspired token could be on the verge of a major breakout. Crypto Balo (@btcbalo) and Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) both shared technical charts suggesting a new leg up for DOGE, highlighting specific price thresholds, Fibonacci retracement levels, and a recently confirmed bullish pattern. Dogecoin Never Below $0,15 Again? On the three‐day DOGE/USDT chart published by Balo, Elliott Wave markers (labeled (1) through (5) and A‐B‐C) indicate that the market completed a corrective phase near the $0.15 region. This conclusion rests on a cluster of technical signals, including a strong support zone and visible convergence in trading volume. According to Balo, the final wave of the broader correction appears to have ended in the low‐mid teens, which he believes has solidified into a key inflection point. Balo draws special attention to several Fibonacci levels on his chart. He notes that $0.2350 aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, while $0.1671 marks the critical 0.786 retracement. In his view, a sustained price above the 0.786 retracement is essential for maintaining Dogecoin’s bullish momentum. Balo further references the 1.0 retracement at $0.0805, labeling it as a major cycle low from previous years but emphasizing that DOGE has not revisited that level for a considerable period. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Calls Dogecoin Chart A ‘Beauty’ As Key Indicators Align Based on these observed price structures, Balo anticipates that Dogecoin could move sideways for a brief period to gather momentum. He underscores a likely doubling in price before DOGE encounters its “next major resistance” near $0.3552–$0.36. In his words, “DOGE looks like a bottom to me. Could go sideways for a bit to build momentum but we should be good for a 2x from here before the next major resistance. Once we reclaim $0.36 we can start talking about new ATHs again.” Related Reading: Pundit Gives Dogecoin Price 30-40% Chance Of Crash To $0.165 As RSI Enters Oversold Levels Thus, he identifies $0.36 as the inflection point that could pave the way to reclaiming historic highs above $0.76, but stresses that he wants to see a decisive break above this resistance first. Until then, he sees $0.15 as a robust support floor and maintains confidence that DOGE’s price action may mimic its bullish structure from September 2024. DOGE’s Falling Wedge Breakout Cas Abbé’s shorter‐term analysis, plotted on a four‐hour chart, points to a classical falling wedge formation. Following a decisive move beyond the wedge’s upper trendline, Abbé suggests that buyers have taken the initiative to reverse the prior downtrend. A key factor in Abbé’s assessment is the Relative Strength Index (RSI). He notes that the RSI dipped briefly into oversold territory—an occurrence often regarded as a reliable indicator that selling pressure has reached an extreme. Since then, the RSI has rebounded into the low‐50s range, signaling the possibility of renewed bullish momentum. Citing these technical developments, Abbé comments, “DOGE falling wedge breakout. 4H RSI entered the oversold zone which is an obvious bottom signal. If BTC doesn’t lose its momentum, DOGE could rally towards $0.22–$0.25 in the coming weeks.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.17.

33767162,[object Object],1743602454,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Japan’s Metaplanet Doubles Down On Bitcoin With 160 BTC Buy,https://bitcoinist.com/japans-metaplanet-doubles-down-on-bitcoin-with-160-btc-buy/,"Metaplanet has purchased an additional 160 Bitcoin worth $13.39 million, pushing its total holdings to 4,206 BTC, according to Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich. The Japanese company paid about 12.49 million yen ($80,063) per Bitcoin in this latest acquisition, according to a statement released April 2. The Asian Bitcoin Champion The purchase strengthens Metaplanet’s position as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder and the ninth-biggest worldwide, based on data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. The firm first announced its Bitcoin strategy in April 2024 and has been steadily building its crypto reserves since then. Its ambitious plans include reaching 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and expanding to 21,000 BTC by late 2026. Metaplanet’s stock took a small hit during Wednesday morning trading in Japan, dropping 0.98% while the Nikkei 225 index remained flat, according to Google Finance data. This minor dip comes despite the company’s stock having surged more than 3,000% since it began focusing on Bitcoin. Multiple Ways To Stack Sats The firm isn’t just buying Bitcoin directly. According to the company’s reports, it acquired 696 BTC during the first quarter of 2025 through selling cash-secured Bitcoin put options. This strategy yielded 50 BTC from premiums and 645.74 BTC from option exercises. The total cost for these first-quarter purchases was approximately ¥10.152 billion ($91.7 million). Metaplanet has acquired 160 BTC for ~$13.3 million at ~$83,264 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 103.3% YTD 2025. As of 4/2/2025, we hold 4206 $BTC acquired for ~$359.8 million at ~$85,544 per bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/ovVaTP8SNo — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) April 2, 2025 On March 31, Metaplanet raised an additional 2 billion yen ($13.22 million) by issuing its 10th Series of Ordinary Bonds. The company plans to use all these funds to buy more Bitcoin, showing its commitment to its crypto treasury approach. Measuring Success In Bitcoin Metaplanet has developed its own method for tracking performance. The company uses what it calls “BTC Yield” as its primary key performance indicator. This metric measures the percentage change in total Bitcoin holdings compared to fully diluted shares. According to company statements, the Bitcoin yield reached 309% in the final quarter of 2024 and 95% in the first quarter of 2025. The Bitcoin program is on track to generate ¥3.0 billion (around $27.5 million) this year, making up most of the company’s annual revenue target of ¥3.4 billion ($31.3 million). Metaplanet keeps raising capital from investors to invest in more Bitcoins. Its aggressive acquisition strategy has so far paid off with the dramatic stock price boost, although whether this success keeps repeating itself hinges on the performance of Bitcoin’s price and investor faith in the company’s unorthodox treasury strategy.

It has dropped by 22% as investors remain concerned about Donald Trump’s tariffs. However, billionaire Michael Bloomberg is warning about a grim fiscal reckoning in the US, which could be a tailwind for BTC price. Billionaire Bloomberg Warns on US Debt Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who established his eponymous company, has warned that the US faces a major reckoning as public debt and deficit surges. He wrote this in response to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that estimated that the public debt will hit 100% this year and 118% in the next decade. In his opinion, he argued that the US could face a grim fiscal reckoning if Congress fails to act to reduce spending. In reality, however, Congress and the Trump administration are implementing policies that may worsen the debt situation. Trump wants to deliver more tax cuts and partially pay for them through tariffs. The implication is that the tax cut will be so big such that tariffs will not fill the gap. Also, there is a concern that the US could move into a recession as Goldman Sachs and PIMCO have predicted. A recession at a time when debt is rising would lead to a higher debt-to-GDP ratio over time. Bloomberg said : “ Higher tariff revenues won’t come close to balancing the books. In fact, the impact on overall revenue is likely to be negative , because tariffs depress commercial activity and job creation.” A Debt Crisis Would Benefit Bitcoin Price A debt crisis in the US would benefit safe havens, which explains why the price of gold has surged to a record high. Bitcoin price would also benefit since it is often seen as a digital version of gold. Indeed, despite recent outflows, spot Bitcoin ETFs have had a net inflow of over $700 million this year and $36 billion since January 2024. That is a sign that investors see it as a safe-haven asset. To some extent, Bitcoin is better than gold since it has a fixed supply cap and is seeing more adoption by companies like MetaPlanet, Grayscale, Trump Media, and Tesla. BTC Price Analysis: Can it Retest ATH Short-term Bitcoin price charts suggest that the coin is on the cusp of a bearish breakdown, potentially to $70,000. However, the weekly chart shows that the recent retreat is a mere pullback inside an ascending channel. For example, BTC dropped from the upper side of this channel in March last year to its lower between August and November. It is worth noting that the BTC price has remained stubbornly above the 50-week Exponential Moving Average, a sign that the uptrend is intact. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the Bitcoin price will rebound and retest the all-time high of $109,300 later this year as US debt fears rise. Bitcoin Price Chart The bullish BTC price forecast will become invalidated if the coin crashes below the 50-week moving average at $77,800. Such a move would lead to a big drop, potentially to the psychological point at $50,000.

Although Bitcoin remained above $65,000, its rally showed signs of fading momentum. Altcoins experienced a general pullback, indicating that the broader market is struggling to maintain recent gains. Despite this, meme coins offered a surprising deviation from the downtrend. Top meme coins such as DOGE, PEPE, and SHIB showed a mild rebound during the past 24 hours. The meme coin market cap stood at $2.72 trillion, reflecting a small 0.39% uptick. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE), a top meme coin, has been showing signs of recovery over the past 24 hours. The price is currently trading at $0.1712, reflecting a 0.76% increase. DOGE is holding slightly above the key support level of $0.17, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment. If the broader crypto market continues to improve, the DOGE price could move toward the $0.20 mark in the near term. Additionally, bullish momentum may push the price higher, possibly reaching $0.30 before the end of April. Speculation surrounding a possible DOGE-related ETF is also fueling renewed attention toward meme-based assets. This has helped drive renewed interest across similar tokens. According to a tweet from a crypto analyst, Dogecoin is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern. The structure includes a left shoulder, head, and right shoulder. A confirmed neckline breakout could signal the start of a stronger upward movement. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Pepe Coin (PEPE) price is witnessing a slight rebound following a recent meme coin resurgence. The PEPE price stands at $0.000007342, reflecting a 2% dip over the past 24 hours. Cryptocurrencies price movement shows growing optimism, with technical indicators pointing toward a potential bullish trend. A crypto analyst issued a fresh alert, highlighting a falling wedge pattern forming on the PEPE chart. The meme coin is now testing resistance, suggesting that a breakout could be imminent. The analyst identified price targets of $0.000017 and $0.000025, urging the market to closely monitor the movement. Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB) Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB) price is still holding steady above the key support zone of $0.000012. This level has remained intact throughout the past week, offering stability even as the broader crypto market trends lower. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001237, showing signs of resilience despite the general downtrend. SHIB’s 24-hour trading volume surged to $230.07 million, marking a 28% increase within a single day. Meanwhile, the burn rate for Shiba Inu has jumped by 104,201.39% over the last 24 hours. According to Shibburn data , a total of 115,890,322 SHIB tokens were removed from circulation during the same period . The increased volume and burn rate activity points to heightened interest in the SHIB ecosystem. SHIB is closely watching its current support as bulls seek a breakout despite crypto market weakness. Conclusion Cryptocurrencies prices: DOGE, PEPE, and SHIB showed resilience despite broader weakness, with interest in meme coins slightly improving in a largely uncertain market.

The latest proposal, Senate Bill 283, was filed this week by Sen. April Weaver as a companion to House Bill 482 , which was introduced in March. The legislation would permit the state to allocate up to 10% of its public funds to digital assets, but only those with a market capitalization exceeding $750 billion. “The investment in digital assets from any of the funds described in this section shall not exceed, in aggregate, 10 percent of the balance of the fund at the time of the investment,” the bill read. Currently, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is the only cryptocurrency that meets this threshold. The bills also specify that these assets must be held directly by the state treasurer, a qualified custodian, or through exchange-traded products. By introducing identical bills in both legislative chambers, Alabama lawmakers aim to expedite the legislative process.

Alabama is the latest to introduce bills allowing up to 10% of state funds to be invested in Bitcoin, following similar efforts in other states. Earlier this year, Texas lawmakers propos ed the creation of a state Bitcoin reserve, with the idea of holding Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Meanwhile, states like Wyoming have passed legislation recognizing Bitcoin as legal property and are working on policies to integrate digital assets into their financial systems. Arizona and Missouri have also seen legislative efforts to position Bitcoin as part of their state reserves, though none have yet been enacted into law. These efforts align with broader trends in financial policy, where states are increasingly considering Bitcoin alongside traditional assets.

After acquiring TrueUSD from TrueCoin in December 2020, Techteryx appointed First Digital Trust (FDT), a Hong Kong-based fiduciary, to manage its stablecoin reserves. According to documents prepared by U.S. law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel, FDT was instructed to invest the reserves in the Aria Commodity Finance Fund (Aria CFF), a Cayman Islands-registered vehicle. However, court filings allege that approximately $456 million was instead improperly diverted into Aria Commodities DMCC, a separate, unauthorized entity based in Dubai. Court documents identify Matthew Brittain as controlling Aria Commodity Finance Fund (Aria CFF) through Aria Capital Management Ltd and Cecilia Brittain as the sole shareholder of the separately owned Dubai-based entity Aria Commodities DMCC. However, emails from Aria's Matthew Brittan are signed with an address in Dubai. Court documents say that Cecilia is Matthew's wife. ARIA DMCC engages in trade finance, asset development, and commodity trading, while ARIA CFF finances commodity traders, including ARIA DMCC and third parties, according to Matthew Brittain, who described the relationship between the two companies in an email to CoinDesk. Attestations produced by Moore CPA Limited show that FDT managed $501 million of TrueUSD's reserves by November 2024. Hong Kong court filings say Chok allegedly directed around $15.5 million in undisclosed commissions to an entity called ""Glass Door"" and separately structured approximately $15 million in unauthorized trade finance loans from FDT to Aria DMCC, later retroactively mischaracterizing them as legitimate fund investments in actions plaintiffs describe as fraudulent misrepresentation and misappropriation. ""The remittances to Aria DMCC were blatant misappropriation and money-laundering,"" a statement of claim reads. ""They were made without the knowledge, authorization or approval of the Plaintiff."" These statements have not been tried in court as of press time. Aria DMCC invested funds in global projects that they described as relatively illiquid, such as manufacturing plants, mining operations, maritime vessels, port infrastructure, and renewable energy ventures. When Techteryx attempted to redeem its investments from Aria CFF between mid-2022 and early 202,3 it received little or no funds back, with Aria entities allegedly defaulting on payments and failing to fulfill redemption requests, the court documents say. Techteryx then took full operational control of TUSD in July 2023 , terminating TrueCoin's involvement. As part of a transitional period following the December 2020 sale, TrueCoin continued running the day-to-day operations of TUSD. According to court filings, Sun stepped in around this time to provide emergency liquidity support, which was structured as a loan. The Techteryx team then quarantined 400 million TUSD so that retail redemptions could continue and token holders wouldn't be affected, despite the stablecoin issuer's empty coffers, the court filings said. First Digital says it followed Techteryx's instructions In response to a request for comment from CoinDesk, Vincent Chok, First Digital's CEO, categorically denied any wrongdoing or participation in fraudulent schemes. Chok told CoinDesk that First Digital Trust acted strictly as a fiduciary intermediary, executing transactions precisely according to instructions provided by Techteryx and its representatives. He asserted that his company was not responsible for independently evaluating or advising on these investment decisions. ""It is our understanding that one of the main blockers voiced by ARIA for early redemptions of funds (as requested by Techteryx) has been their AML/KYC concerns regarding the deal between TrueCoin and Techteryx and the true identity of the ultimate beneficial owner of Techteryx,"" Chok said in an email to CoinDesk, adding that he believed nobody named in the case considers Aria illiquid. ""We have not yet had the opportunity to fully defend ourselves,"" Chok said in an email to CoinDesk. ""We are fully committed to clarifying these matters in due course as the legal and arbitration process continues."" Aria Group's Matthew Brittain said to CoinDesk that he ""completely rejects Techteryx’s claims against ARIA DMCC and any related entities,"" adding that ""a number of false allegations were made in the court proceedings."" Techteryx was fully aware of term commitments, Brittain said, and these were outlined in contracts that subscribers have agreed to when investing in ARIA CFF, which are clearly set out in the Offering Memorandum. Brittain also echoed Chok's concerns about Techteryx's beneficial ownership, pointing to Wall Street Journal coverage of the topic. The Hong Kong writ identifies Li Jinmei as the ultimate beneficial owner of Techteryx. A spokesperson for Techteryx confirmed that this is not the same person as Jennifer Yiyang – the previous ultimate beneficial owner of the company – despite some media reporting to the contrary. ""The subscriber has not resolved these issues,"" Brittain continued, referring to the beneficial ownership concerns. Prime Trust's collapse and SEC settlement compounds challenges While this was happening, TUSD's challenges continued in the form of a collapsing banking partner and regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. In mid-2023, Prime Trust, an independent crypto custodian based in Nevada that is not connected to this case, but which TrueUSD used for its fiat ramps, was put into receivership by state regulators. State regulators alleged Prime Trust had improperly used customer funds to cover withdrawal requests, raising serious concerns about its financial stability. Court filings from Nevada showed that Prime Trust owed around $85 million in fiat obligations with only about $3 million available. This wasn't the last headache for the stablecoin issuer. In September 2024, TrueCoin and TrustToken (the stablecoin's owners before Techteryx) settled with the SEC over allegations they falsely marketed TrueUSD as fully dollar-backed while secretly investing reserves in risky offshore funds. Without admitting wrongdoing, or detailing the nature of their offshore investments with Aria's companies, both TrueCoin and TrustToken agreed to pay civil penalties and disgorge profits to the tune of just over $500,000 to resolve charges of fraud and unregistered securities offerings. For his part, Aria's Brittain said that investing in Aria wasn't the right move to begin with for a stablecoin's reserves. ""ARIA CFF has never held [its] strategy out as highly liquid, or appropriate for the reserves of a stablecoin,"" he said in an email.",Markets|Justin Sun|TrueUSD|Exclusive,EN,0,0,ASIA|COMMODITY|FIAT|REGULATION|TUSD,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 14:09:48

The brokerage firm offers bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) to any U.S. citizen over the age of 18. The assets are custodied by Fidelity Digital Assets and held in a cold wallet. The crypto IRA product has no fees, and customers can invest in a Roth IRA, traditional IRA or rollover IRA, according to Fidelity's website. The new product comes as financial advisors are increasingly offering crypto to their clients. A survey by TMX Vetta Fi recently showed that 57% of advisors plan on increasing their allocations into crypto ETFs, although their biggest focus is in crypto equity ETFs. “Fidelity is committed to offering investment products and solutions to meet the changing needs and interests of our customers, accompanied by education and support,” a spokesperson told CoinDesk. Clients of the brokerage firm have increasingly voiced interest in a tax-advantaged way to trade and hold crypto, a person familiar with the matter, said. Fidelity already offers a number of crypto exchange-traded funds, which let investors track the prices of digital assets without directly investing in them. The company recently filed to list a Solana ETF on the Cboe Exchange.

It’s not just about paying taxes. The evolving rules mean even small oversights can lead to large penalties or expensive audits. You're reading Crypto Long & Short , our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Below are five common missteps that often catch crypto investors off guard — and how you can stay compliant. Neglecting wallet-based accounting: The IRS now expects detailed reporting of each wallet’s transactions and balances. That means no more lumping all your trades together on a single spreadsheet. Whether you’re using hot wallets, cold wallets or a combination of both, each wallet’s records must be individually tracked. Tools like CoinTracking , CoinLedger or TaxBit can simplify this process by syncing real-time data from various exchanges. Proper wallet-based accounting not only keeps you compliant but also prevents surprises if the IRS decides to dig into your transaction history. Misreporting staking rewards: Staking rewards are taxable income the moment they hit your wallet — even if you haven’t sold them for fiat. Many people mistakenly think they only have to report staking income at the time of sale, but the IRS disagrees. For instance, if you earn 2 ETH worth $3,000 total in staking rewards, that’s taxable income when received. Missing or misstating these amounts can draw unwanted attention from regulators who are already watching crypto activity closely. Overlooking IRS letters and form 1099-DA: Key IRS notices like Notice 6371 (basically, “we have questions”), Notice 6374 (“explain yourself”) and CP2000 (“we think you owe us”) can arrive if something doesn’t line up in your tax filings. In 2025, crypto exchanges will also send Form 1099-DA, which outlines your crypto income, trades and rewards. Any discrepancy between this form and what you report is a surefire red flag. Always review these documents carefully for accuracy and be prepared to correct any errors before they escalate. Failing to report all transactions: Think those small trades on a decentralized exchange are invisible? Think again. The IRS and its partners have sophisticated blockchain analysis tools that track activity, even on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and privacy coins. Every single transaction — trades, airdrops, forks and rewards — must be included in your tax filing. “I forgot” won’t save you if your wallet addresses are linked to unreported transactions. Missing the chance to adjust cost basis and avoiding excessive deductions: The 2025 tax year brings a critical opportunity to adjust your crypto cost basis under new guidelines . These rules allow investors to reallocate unused cost basis across wallets or exchange accounts, provided they document the method before their first 2025 trade and follow specific record keeping requirements. Done correctly, it can lower your capital gains tax and keep you in the clear. However, going too far with deductions — like inflating business expenses or hobby-related costs — can trigger an audit if numbers appear unrealistic. The IRS scrutinizes deductions that don’t align with typical income levels, so stay within reason and maintain thorough supporting records. Staying audit-ready Crypto taxation is increasingly complex, but staying compliant doesn’t have to be stressful. The best practices? Use reliable crypto tax software, double-check every detail on your return, keep meticulous records and be transparent if you discover past errors. A proactive approach helps ensure you’re ready for any IRS inquiry — and keeps your focus on what really matters: your crypto investments.

The block trade represents one of the largest bearish bets in recent weeks, suggesting deep pessimism about Bitcoin’s short-term prospects against a backdrop of looming macroeconomic uncertainties. Massive Put Option Signals Bearish Sentiment According to options trade analysts Greek.live, an investor bought Bitcoin puts expiring on April 25, with a strike price of $60,000. The transaction involved more than 1,000 BTC and has a notional value of almost $100 million. In the analysts’ opinion , the motive behind the move could either be extreme risk hedging or highly leveraged speculation. They warn against dismissing the bearish signals, reporting that negative sentiment is dominating trading flows, with increased demand for put options that profit from a drop in Bitcoin’s price. For instance, for the said $100 million bet to be successful, BTC has to lose at least 30% of its current value, which would translate to a drop of about $25,000. Traders are paying hefty premiums to protect themselves from such downsides, indicating a cautious outlook among their ranks brought about by the uncertainty surrounding BTC’s near-term outlook. The pessimism is also reflected in price projections over these short periods, with analysts like Michaël van de Poppe noting a key resistance level between $82,000 and $87,000. “Above $87K is the real acceleration and likely run towards a new ATH,” he tweeted. “Sub $82K is a test of the lows,” he added. Despite the turbulence, long-term BTC investors are remaining steadfast. According to findings by on-chain analytics platform Glassnode, holders who accumulated the number one cryptocurrency between 2020 and 2022 have largely resisted the urge to sell, even when the asset’s price briefly topped $108,000 earlier in the year. It is a different case with short-term traders. Many of them have been quick to panic, with episodes of capitulation occurring during the last few dips when they sold their holdings at a loss. Rocky Price Performance Looking at the market, Bitcoin has managed a modest 0.8% gain in the last 24 hours. Trading at $84,635 at the time of writing, the asset oscillated between $82,649 and $85,438, with the current price being a 28.9% improvement across the previous 30 days. However, BTC is down slightly more than 3% over the past week and is almost 22% below its all-time high price. The first quarter of 2025 was one to forget, with the 12% dip registered in that period marking its worst start to a year since 2018.

Its pump occurred shortly after the asset’s inclusion on Binance Alpha. MEW Climbs the Ladder The meme coin sector has seen better days, with many tokens experiencing declines in the past 24 hours. PEPE has fallen by 2%, FLOKI (FLOKI) is down 2.5% for the day , while Shiba Inu (SHIB) has retraced by 3.5%. However, some have charted substantial gains. An evident example is Cat in a Dogs World (MEW), whose price has jumped by almost 15% on a daily scale . MEW Price, Source: CoinMarketCap Currently, it is worth roughly $0.003077, which is the highest mark observed in the past six weeks. Its market capitalization surged above $270 million, making MEW the 14th-biggest meme coin. Its upswing could be attributed to Binance, which recently placed the asset in its Binance Alpha section. The latter is a platform part of the exchange’s ecosystem designed to spotlight crypto projects with growth potential. It serves as a pre-listing token selection pool and could be followed by official inclusion in the trading venue. Despite its recent revival, MEW stands far from its peaks registered in 2024. Last year, the meme coin garnered significant attention from investors, while the popular exchanges that allowed trading services with it include OKX, Upbit , Kraken, Bybit, Gate.io, and others. MEW reached an all-time high of around $0.012 in November 2024 , and since then, it has been on a significant downfall. Back then, its market capitalization stood above $1 billion, coinciding with an overall boom of the entire meme coin niche. The Binance Effect in the Past Support from the world’s largest crypto exchange often positively affects the price of the involved assets due to increased liquidity and boosted accessibility. Last week, it included the meme coins Mubarak (MUBARAK), CZ’s Dog (BROCCOLI714), Tutorial (TUT), and Banana for Scale (BANANAS31) in its Binance Simple Earn section. Some of the assets witnessed a significant rally shortly after the announcement. TUT was the best performer, recording an impressive 130% price explosion. A similar case was observed in December last year when Binance added further support for the meme coin launched on the BNB chain – Simon’s Cat (CAT). The asset’s valuation soared by 50% mere hours after the disclosure.

Following this hacking incident, Korean hackers emerged and Google warned investors in its latest report. Google Cloud warned in a recent report that North Korean hackers are targeting blockchain projects and increasing illegal cyber activity across Europe. Google stated in its report that hackers mostly targeted Solana (SOL)-based projects. North Korean hackers have been reported to be posing as legitimate remote workers to infiltrate companies, take over critical systems and steal sensitive data for the purpose of generating revenue. The report highlighted the use of fake identities and advanced coding skills in their operations, including developing blockchain and artificial intelligence applications. At that point, it was discovered that one of these employees was working under 12 false identities in the U.S. and Europe, fabricating references, establishing relationships with employers, and seeking employment using additional identities that he had checked to ensure his credibility. *This is not investment advice.

Both candidates won, further reinforcing the party's narrow national majority. The two seats in Florida had been vacated when President Donald Trump tapped the previous members to join his administration, including his national security advisor, Michael Waltz, and the congressman Trump initially picked as attorney general, Matt Gaetz, who quickly bowed out under the pressure of accusations that he'd had sex with a minor and was linked to illegal drug use. Florida voters elected state Senator Randy Fine to take Waltz's former seat and picked the state's chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis, to replace Gaetz. The races drew a high level of attention and money from both parties, because of every seat's importance to the tight majority in the House. While Democrats failed to steer the conservative districts onto their side, they did win much more support in both districts than they had in the recent 2024 elections. An affiliate of the Fairshake PAC had paid for advertising supporting the pro-crypto candidates, Patronis and Fine, in the primary and general elections in Florida, including a last-minute $1.5 million to help ensure their victory. ""We are thrilled to see two strong champions of innovation headed to Washington,"" said Fairshake spokesman Josh Vlasto, in a statement.

Under a Memorandum of Understanding, the companies will focus on developing strategies around issuing and circulating stablecoins pegged to the US dollar and Japanese yen, according to a joint announcement. Additionally, the collaboration will explore stablecoins as a settlement mechanism for tokenized real-world assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Stablecoins continue to be a major focus of crypto regulatory frameworks worldwide, and one of the sectors venture capitalists are eyeing in 2025 as nation-states push stablecoins to the forefront of their digital asset strategies.

Mở đầu đầy hứng khởi với cú bứt phá lên kỷ lục $109,590 vào tháng 1, nhưng đà tăng nhanh chóng bị dập tắt bởi làn sóng bán khi có tin tốt. Kỳ vọng về chính sách thân thiện với crypto dưới thời Tổng thống Trump tái đắc cử dần phai nhạt khi chưa có thay đổi pháp lý rõ ràng. Từ đỉnh cao, Bitcoin đã lao xuống mức thấp nhất $77,041 ( mất gần 29% ) và phần lớn dao động trong vùng $78,000 – $88,000. Sự thống trị của Bitcoin so với tổng vốn hóa thị trường tiền điện tử Tuy nhiên, nếu xét về sức mạnh tương đối, Bitcoin vẫn đang giữ vị trí ngôi sao sáng nhất! Tỷ lệ thống trị của BTC đã tăng lên hơn 61%, ngay cả khi tổng vốn hóa thị trường crypto giảm mạnh. Điều này cho thấy dòng vốn đang chảy từ các altcoin rủi ro hơn sang Bitcoin trong bối cảnh bất ổn vĩ mô gia tăng. Ethereum, Solana và các altcoin khác đã giảm từ 35-50% từ các đỉnh chu kỳ của chúng, củng cố vai trò “tài sản dự trữ” của Bitcoin trong thế giới kỹ thuật số. Bước vào quý II, biến động giá vẫn phụ thuộc nhiều vào các tín hiệu kinh tế vĩ mô, đặc biệt là chính sách của Fed và dòng chảy ETF. Hiện tại, dấu hiệu bán tháo đã dịu bớt, nhưng thanh khoản vẫn eo hẹp, nên để có cú breakout lớn thì cần một chất xúc tác đáng kể. Một vài mảng sáng của nền kinh tế Mỹ vẫn xuất hiện, ví dụ như thâm hụt thương mại đang thu hẹp và chi tiêu cho hàng hóa lâu bền tăng. Nhưng, những điểm sáng này bị lu mờ bởi các vấn đề cấu trúc nghiêm trọng hơn. Lạm phát đang tăng tốc nhanh hơn dự kiến, được thúc đẩy một phần bởi chi phí nhập khẩu tăng do các mức thuế mới. Lạm phát lõi tăng 0,4% trong tháng Hai—mức tăng hàng tháng lớn nhất trong hơn một năm—và kỳ vọng của người tiêu dùng cho thấy lạm phát sẽ duy trì ở mức cao trong tương lai. Thu nhập Cá nhân, Chi tiêu và Tiết kiệm (Nguồn: Cục Phân tích Kinh tế Mỹ) Trong khi đó, tăng trưởng đang chậm lại. Thu nhập thực tế hầu như không tăng khi loại trừ các khoản hỗ trợ từ chính phủ , và chi tiêu cho dịch vụ—động lực chính của nền kinh tế—đã bắt đầu co lại. Niềm tin người tiêu dùng đang suy giảm, với chỉ số của Conference Board rơi xuống mức thấp nhất trong hai năm và ngày càng nhiều người Mỹ dự đoán tỷ lệ thất nghiệp sẽ tăng. Những xu hướng này phản ánh sự thận trọng ngày càng tăng của các hộ gia đình, thể hiện qua tỷ lệ tiết kiệm cá nhân đang tăng. Chính sách thương mại vẫn là một điểm nóng . Các mức thuế mới và kỳ vọng về thêm các biện pháp trong tháng Tư và Năm đang khiến doanh nghiệp và người tiêu dùng phải điều chỉnh hành vi: họ đổ xô mua trước, trì hoãn đầu tư hoặc cắt giảm tuyển dụng. Mặc dù thâm hụt thương mại tháng Hai đã thu hẹp , điều này theo sau sự gia tăng nhập khẩu mạnh mẽ vào tháng Một, làm méo mó dự báo GDP. Kết quả là, tăng trưởng quý đầu tiên được dự đoán sẽ chững lại đáng kể. Dù vậy, ngành công nghiệp tiền mã hóa vẫn đang hưởng lợi từ cam kết ngày càng rõ ràng về khung pháp lý, với sự ủng hộ chính trị và sự quan tâm ngày càng tăng từ các tổ chức lớn. Ủy ban Chứng khoán và Giao dịch Mỹ (SEC) đã chính thức rút các vụ kiện chống lại Kraken, Consensys và Cumberland DRW—ba cái tên lớn trong ngành. Đây là một bước chuyển mình lớn từ cách tiếp cận “phạt nặng” trước đây của SEC sang một phương pháp điều tiết hợp tác hơn. Điều này cũng báo hiệu sự cam kết xây dựng các quy tắc minh bạch và mang tính xây dựng cho ngành. Củng cố thêm hướng đi này, Nhóm Đặc nhiệm Crypto của SEC đã thông báo sẽ tổ chức bốn buổi thảo luận nhóm giữa tháng Tư và tháng Sáu năm 2025. Các phiên họp này sẽ tập trung vào các vấn đề then chốt như quy định giao dịch crypto, lưu ký tài sản kỹ thuật số, token hóa và tương lai của tài chính phi tập trung (DeFi). Sự kiện mở cửa cho công chúng và thể hiện mong muốn của SEC trong việc tạo ra một cuộc đối thoại cởi mở và minh bạch để định hình chính sách crypto. Song song đó, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) đã công bố một đối tác đình đám với Crypto.com để ra mắt loạt ETF tập trung vào crypto. Đây là bước tiến mới của TMTG vào lĩnh vực sản phẩm tài chính, nhằm tận dụng nhu cầu ngày càng tăng đối với các phương tiện đầu tư tài sản kỹ thuật số. Dù dự án này vẫn đang chờ phê duyệt từ cơ quan quản lý, nó có tiềm năng tăng đáng kể độ nổi bật của cả TMTG và Crypto.com trong các vòng tròn tài chính truyền thống. Vậy là, dù Q1 không mấy rực rỡ, nhưng thị trường crypto vẫn tiềm ẩn nhiều tín hiệu tích cực. Liệu Q2 có mang đến cú bứt phá? Hãy cùng chờ xem nhé!

While Ripple risks a big drop if it loses this support, one contrarian analyst believes that it could stage a “massive explosion” and possibly hit its all-time high in the coming months. Crypto Analyst Sees XRP Price Having a Massive Explosion Analysts are still bullish on the Ripple price as it remains in a steep local bear market. In an X post, Coinvo , who describes himself as a Bitcoin investor and trader, predicted that it was now in an accumulation phase that could lead to a strong bullish breakout in the longer term. XRP Price Chart Forecast He cited a weekly chart showing that the XRP price was hovering above a crucial support level. The support, $1.9780, was the highest swing in 2021, when Bitcoin and most altcoins soared. As such, he believes that this could be a break-and-retest pattern, a popular continuation sign. If his Ripple price forecast happens, it means that the XRP price will soar by 65% and retest the year-to-date high of $3.4. Another pundit with over 232k followers on X, used a daily chart and predicted that the XRP price may 5x-10x from the current level. He believes that the next leg up could happen post a breakout of this consolidation. If his forecast is correct, it means that the XRP coin could surge to over $10 . XRP Price Forecast Ripple Price Needs to Hold the Support at $1.9780 The daily chart paints a mixed picture of the XRP price. On the positive side, the accumulation and distribution indicator has continued rising and is hovering at its all-time high, signaling a potential rebound. Also, the coin has remained above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), meaning that bulls are in control for now. Most importantly, it is above the crucial support at $1.9780, where it has failed to move below several times since November last year. The risk, however, is that this support level is the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern . In this case, the head is at $3.5, while the shoulders are at $3.0. The neckline also coincides with the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. XRP Price Chart Therefore, bullish investors need to ensure that the XRP remains above this support, and invalidates the H&S pattern by moving above the shoulders at $3. A crash below that level could point to further declines, potentially to the 61.8% retracement point at $1.50.

These assets will be held by Fidelity and stored securely in a cold storage facility. According to the company’s website, the crypto IRA product charges no fees and supports investments through Roth IRAs, traditional IRAs, and rollover IRAs. This latest move reflects a growing trend among financial advisors to incorporate crypto into the products they offer.

""While retail interest is weak due to the fixation on price action, professional investors are recognizing the global adoption momentum spurred by the Trump administration’s embrace of bitcoin, and many are seeing these market conditions as an opportunity to start or increase an allocation,"" Leon added. The ETFs saw over $1 billion in inflows in the first quarter of the year despite a challenging macro situation that sent the S&P 500 Index into its biggest quarterly loss since 2022 and bitcoin's 13% plunge. Leon expects inflows to be even stronger in the second quarter — as much as $3 billion or even more as wirehouse platforms unlock and legislative policy progresses. ETF inflows possibly less than meets the eye The $1 billion in first quarter net flows — and whatever the second quarter brings — doesn't necessarily reflect investor interest in buying the bitcoin dip. That's because of the so-called basis trade (also known as cash-and-carry). In this, institutional players buy the spot bitcoin ETF while shorting CME bitcoin futures, picking up yield without exposure to price movement. That yield was well into the double-digits in late 2024 and remained nicely above the risk-free rate throughout much of the first quarter. It's collapsed to the 5% area of late, suggesting arbitrage-related ETF inflows may dry up. Back to bull case: It's still early “While a favorable price environment would certainly be a boost, it's important to remember that adoption of spot bitcoin ETFs by these groups is still in its infancy,"" said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, who is also bullish on the outlook for inflows throughout the rest of the year.. ""As they grow more comfortable allocating to bitcoin, this should provide a meaningful tailwind for inflows,” he added.., While many institutions have indeed already made their first allocations into bitcoin in the past year, it represents only a small fraction of ETF investment, with most of the money still coming from retail investors — something recently noted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, whose IBIT is the asset-gathering leader among the spot ETFs. The more favorable regulatory stance toward the industry, not to mention the government’s own potential allocation into bitcoin, however, means that ratio could soon shift significantly. During an ETF conference in Las Vegas earlier this month, a survey showed that 57% of advisors plan on increasing their allocations into crypto ETFs this year as crypto has lost its “reputational risk” attribute among advisors. The view that bitcoin could serve as a “safe haven” in times of an economic decline, which investors remain anxious about, could also boost confidence in the asset, especially as fears of a potential recession grow. “If we see continued rate cut expectations, signs of economic uncertainty, or deepening fears of a potential recession in the US, Bitcoin’s role as 'digital gold' will likely support additional inflows,” said David Siemer, CEO of Wave Digital Assets. “While some short-term traders may rotate out if price weakness persists, long-term players will continue to keep inflows strong, especially as institutional adoption takes off and drives demand throughout the year.""",Markets|Bitcoin ETF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 15:55:25

Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to give out a negative verdict with respect to the market scenario. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,710.66 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB’s price dropped over the last 24 hours towards the resistance at $699.5. Sellers stepped in to sell the assets; However, the support floor at that level seems stable because the Bulls secured the level this week. In addition, the coin is now trading below the psychological mark of $600. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,710.66 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. In March 2025, BNB was trading near the psychological mark of $600, which it still continues to do so in April.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-02 15:55:56

In Europe, WisdomTree is at the forefront of leading that charge. The global financial services firm offers a number of exchange-traded products (ETPs) that offer diversification and an incredibly easy way to buy and sell crypto assets. Here Dovile Silenskyte, WisdomTree’s Director of Digital Assets Research, discusses crypto’s evolution as an asset class, the most recent adoption trends and WisdomTree’s latest ETP based on the CoinDesk 20 index. How do you see crypto becoming more akin to a traditional asset class? As with every asset class, diversification is essential. Investors diversify across and within equity and bond positions, so it should be no different when considering allocating capital to cryptocurrencies. Relying solely on bitcoin is akin to holding only one stock in an equity portfolio, which is a suboptimal strategy in terms of risk-adjusted returns. A well-diversified approach across multiple digital assets can enhance exposure to the broader growth of the sector. As the digital asset class evolves, investors require a benchmark to measure performance, invest and trade. The CoinDesk 20 index serves as the benchmark index for the crypto industry and is the world’s most traded crypto index — it could be viewed as the S&P 500 of crypto. Taking a broad and diversified approach through the CoinDesk 20 provides a practical way to access opportunities across the digital asset market. For investors who lack access to deep crypto knowledge, broad-based crypto indices offer a streamlined way to gain market exposure without the complexities of token selection. Just as ETF investors use index-based funds to gain equity exposure without stock-picking, a diversified crypto index allows for systematic, passive participation in the growth of digital assets. What kind of adoption trends have you seen in the past? Are there geographical nuances you’ve observed? After more than 15 years of existence, multiple boom-and-bust cycles and over half a billion users , cryptocurrencies have cemented their place as a major asset class rather than a passing trend. Bitcoin and ether have become integral components of institutional portfolios. Despite cryptocurrencies' long-term growth potential, many investors are still unsure. With a total market cap of approximately $3 trillion , the ecosystem and use cases are growing steadily. The crypto market is now of a similar (or larger) size as staple institutional investments such as high-yield bonds, inflation-linked bonds and emerging markets small caps. Crypto adoption is not monolithic — it varies across geographies based on regulatory landscapes, institutional infrastructure and economic needs. Europe is leading the way with investors being able to invest into bitcoin exchange-traded products for the last 5+ years and now having access to a broad range of single coin and crypto basket ETPs. How is WisdomTree enabling this next phase of growth beyond bitcoin? WisdomTree has been providing access to crypto via ETPs since 2019. It has since grown its range to include ETPs providing exposure to five other individual coins and four diversified basket products, including its new ETP providing exposure to the CoinDesk 20. WisdomTree's crypto ETPs leverage institutional-grade storage solutions ensuring high levels of security, and some of them also generate a staking yield. By incorporating staking into a crypto ETP, investors can gain exposure to the growth of these networks while also participating in their security and governance. Tell us more about the WisdomTree Physical CoinDesk 20 ETP that you just launched. The strategy helps investors avoid the complexities of selecting individual assets, as it aims to provide secure and diversified exposure to approximately 90% of the crypto market by market cap , helping shape the next wave of innovation. The strategy also provides a highly diversified entry point into the crypto ecosystem, further democratizing access to a historically difficult part of the market to get exposure to. And finally, the strategy also aims to provide staking yield. Where can someone get additional information?

The company announced the public release of Open Deep Search (ODS) on April 2, describing it as a high-performance, developer-friendly alternative to platforms like Perplexity AI and OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Sentient’s ODS aims to empower developers with open-source “Loyal AI” models, which Sentient says preserve the original intent of their developers. The firm’s fingerprinting technology allows developers to protect intellectual property while maintaining model openness — aiming to solve the biggest issue of open-source AI, the challenges of monetizing a model without centralization. “AI should belong to the community, not controlled by closed-source corporations,” according to Himanshu Tyagi, co-founder of Sentient and professor at the Indian Institute of Science. “We’re building, monetizing and delivering open-source AI with a key principle in mind: singularity in intelligence but plurality in use cases,” he added. ”Open-source development ensures performance and user control that closed systems simply cannot match.” Related: Crypto trader turns $2K PEPE into $43M, sells for $10M profit Sentient’s ODS outperforms ChatGPT, Perplexity Sentient’s ODS scored 75.3% accuracy on the “Frames” benchmark, which measures factuality, retrieval and reasoning capabilities, used to answer complex “multi-hop questions” that require the integration of multiple sources. ODS surpassed OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o Search Preview’s 50.5% and the Perplexity Sonar Reasoning Pro, which scored 44.4%. To prevent potential bias, Sentient ensured that its researchers didn’t have access to the Frames testing sets during the benchmarking process. Dobby NFT mint. Source: Sentient “Independent verification is only needed for closed-source solutions because open-source solutions have no incentive to falsely report the evaluations,” Tyagi said, adding: “Anyone with a computer can run our code, reproduce our results, and verify whether it is correct or not. The numbers reported can be reproduced using the repo's eval section by anyone and thus are globally verifiable.” The ODS release follows growing interest in Sentient’s platform. The firm said it amassed more than 1.8 million waitlist registrations in the lead-up to the launch. Related: $1T stablecoin supply could drive next crypto rally — CoinFund’s Pakman A turning point for open-source AI The release of Sentient’s new open-source search framework comes amid a tipping point for open-source AI development. “We’re witnessing a significant shift as open-source AI solutions increasingly challenge closed-source dominance,” Tyagi said. “Examples such as DeepSeek’s advancements in reasoning, Manus’s innovations with agents, and now our own contributions to ODS with advanced AI search frameworks highlight this shift,” he added. “Open-source models can easily outperform closed-source giants with the right architecture,” said Sewoong Oh, Sentient’s lead researcher and professor at the University of Washington. “The results of these benchmarks validate our mission to create an open ecosystem that benefits all AI builders and users.” The launch also builds on Sentient’s earlier momentum. In February, the firm completed one of the largest NFT minting campaigns to date, with more than 650,000 participants gaining fractional ownership of its AI models.

ETH Price Dips 57% in 30 Days as Rival Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Gets Ready For a 14700% Rally,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-ethereum-price-recover-eth-price-dips-57-in-30-days-as-rival-mutuum-finance-mutm-gets-ready-for-a-14700-rally/,"Ethereum (ETH) has faced a sharp 57% decline in the past 30 days, raising concerns among investors about its ability to recover. With transaction fees hitting their lowest levels since 2020 and market sentiment turning cautious, ETH’s short-term outlook remains uncertain. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a major competitor, attracting significant investor attention. Phase 4 of the presale has already launched giving investors optimism. Over $6 million has been accumulated and 7700 holders attracted. New investors purchase MUTM at its current price of $0.025 because the value will reach $0.03 as part of Phase 5. Current investors have the opportunity to achieve a 140% return on investment before the project launch occurs at $0.06. MUTM could hit $8.82, 14700% after launch. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows Mutuum Finance leads the decentralized lending market through its innovative dual-lending system and it has established itself as a quick-growing collaborative system. The project maintains increasing popularity as 7700 investors put $6 million into the presale. During Phase 4 which presents the current trading value of $0.025 investors can expect a 20% price increase in Phase 5 to secure substantial profit potential. Research data indicates that MUTM stands among the most underpriced yet promising DeFi projects set to exceed $2 after its release on the market. Mutuum Finance stands apart for its ability to unite the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models in one system. The P2C model combines USDT liquidity pools that produce passive income for users who benefit from automatic smart contracts used for lending operations. Both P2P and P2C models deliver fundamental DeFi functions to users through their different mechanisms for transacting directly between parties without third-party involvement. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. The Development of a Stable Secure Environment To demonstrate its focus on stability Mutuum Finance releases a fully secured Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by USD. The stablecoin token stands distinct from algorithmic stablecoins because Mutuum Finance bases it on over-collateralization to provide both risk reduction and long-term trustworthiness. Open financial architectures paired with audited smart contracts alongside this architecture strengthen investor trust by covering all the vulnerabilities found in past DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance implements incentive plans as a method to increase its community reach. By offering $100,000 giveaway the program will give out 10 thousand dollars worth of MUTM tokens to winners among 10 participants in addition to its innovative referral system that pays users for successful new investor acquisitions. Early adopters of Mutuum Finance obtain both special staking pools and governance rights and VIP access to platform updates which keeps them committed to the platform over the long term. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth Mutuum Finance implements controlled token supply restrictions and deflationary mechanics throughout presales to build scarcity in its framework thus boosting the token’s potential value growth. The staking program gives crypto users attractive incentives to remain engaged while ensuring token sustainability during long-term development of the platform. Ethereum (ETH) may be struggling, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as the next big DeFi disruptor. With a projected 14,700% rally to $3 in 2025, investors are flocking to its presale, which has already raised over $6 million. At just $0.025 in Phase 4, early buyers stand to gain 140% ROI before launch at $0.06. The dual-model lending system, USD-backed stablecoin, and deflationary tokenomics make MUTM a top pick for those seeking exponential growth in the DeFi market.

Solana's top DeFi exchange just brought digital collectibles platform DRiP Haus into its orbit. The acquisition is part of Jupiter's push to become what Jupiter's Kash Dhanda calls the ""Solana super app:"" a home not only for traders of financial instruments like swaps and perps, but for digital culture connoisseurs too. ""We don't believe it,"" Dhanda said of the NFT doomsayers. ""We think NFTs are here for the long term."" Built from the bricks of the short-lived Solana store , DRiP Haus survived the NFT market's brutal downturn as a digital collectibles distribution hub. Instead of trading it focuses on disseminating: Startups across Solanaland spin up and send out their visual campaigns on DRiP, according to Dhanda, who estimates it now creates the vast majority of Solana NFTs that ""aren't spam."" Dhanda and DRiP Labs founder Vibhu Norby both declined to state how much Jupiter paid in the all-cash deal. A person familiar with the deal estimated it at two times the funds raised. The startup previously raised $11.5 million from venture investors. Jupiter co-founder Meow hinted at the acquisition in late February during his campaign to defer a multi-million dollar token payday, which yields more JUP for him later while funding token incentive programs for acqui-hired teams now. Norby confirmed his team will be getting tokens from the incentives program. Half of DRiP's eight-person team will continue working on the distribution platform, while the other half will focus on bolstering Jupiter's currently nonexistent NFT capabilities, most critically by adding a swaps router to the DeFi exchange's homepage. Norby will oversee DRiP from an ""executive, strategic point of view"" from within Jupiter. While the DRiP brand will remain separate, Norby said its visual identity will be reworked to align more closely with the new mothership. He's also working on building a ""really, really excellent NFT experience"" within Jupiter's mobile app.",Finance|Jupiter|Solana,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|JUP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 16:00:00

As this emerging presale project races past $4.5 million raised, traders who’ve long supported Ethereum’s dominance are now eyeing MAGACOINFINANCE as a serious contender. With limited supply, rising demand, and whispers of exchange listings, it’s quickly becoming one of the most talked-about tokens in early 2025. Meanwhile, coins like Solana, Polkadot, Kaspa, and Aptos continue to hold ground—but may not match the raw momentum of this rising presale force. CURRENT PRICE – $0.000245 – LISTING PRICE $0.007 -PRE-SALE SELLING OUT! MAGACOINFINANCE – EARLY INVESTORS ALREADY CASHING IN CURRENT PRICE – $0.000245 LISTING PRICE – $0.007 NEXT PHASE ALMOST HERE MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining serious ground after raising over $4.5 million in record time.

Its appeal lies in simplicity with strength—clear tokenomics, a growing community, and actual use cases that appeal to both retail traders and larger players. It’s not hype—it’s a structured launch that’s earning trust through results, not just promises.

What Investors Are Watching Solana (SOL) – Trading around $127, Solana continues to dominate in speed and NFT innovation. Polkadot (DOT) – At $4.212, DOT remains focused on blockchain interoperability and cross-chain development. Kaspa (KAS) – Priced at $0.06, KAS is gaining traction for its high-speed blockDAG architecture. Aptos (APT) – APT, currently at $5.326, is building momentum as a scalable Layer-1 backed by major VC support. PRE-SALE SELLING OUT- JOIN THE BIGGEST PRE-SALE IN HISTORY! Conclusion Ethereum may still leading, but the excitement building around MAGACOINFINANCE is impossible to ignore.

This piece offers valuable insights into which cryptocurrencies are poised for growth, exploring key factors that may influence their market performance. Readers will discover the potential movers in the crypto space, primed for significant returns. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Recent Dip Amid Strong Six-Month Climb Dogecoin suffered a sharp one-month drop of nearly 30% while boasting a robust 60% gain over the past six months. The coin experienced significant short-term pressure, with a weekly decline near 12%, highlighting bearish sentiment in the near term. In contrast, its six-month recovery underlines a renewed investor interest that turned the trend around despite recent setbacks. The coin currently trades between $0.13 and $0.23, with immediate resistance at $0.28 and a secondary target at $0.38, while support is solid at $0.08. Bears currently dominate the short-term scene, and the lack of a clear trend suggests cautious trading. Some traders might consider short-term selling near resistance and view support levels as potential entry points for a rebound. ai16z Price Slide Highlights Key Levels in Focus Over the past month, ai16z dropped by 60.21%, and in the last six months, it fell nearly 87% from its price range of $0.0601 to $0.3629. This decline shows a sustained period of weakness, with indicators signaling downward pressure. The coin’s behavior reflects significant losses while trading in a wide price range, highlighting overall instability. Currently, the coin faces resistance at $0.561, with a second barrier near $0.8638, while support levels are not clearly defined below its trading range. Bears dominate as momentum remains weak, and the RSI hovers around 41.80, indicating no clear trend. Traders may consider waiting for a test of the resistance or a clear shift near the lower boundary before making a decision. Conclusion DOGE and AI16Z are poised for significant growth, potentially reaching $1. As annual buying opportunities emerge, mid-term investors might see favorable conditions. Monitoring these coins could yield promising returns. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Rumors That Musk May Quit His DOGE Position,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/just-is-there-a-clash-between-elon-musk-and-donald-trump-rumors-that-musk-may-quit-his-doge-position/,"President Donald Trump has privately informed his inner circle that Elon Musk will soon step back from his prominent role as a managing partner and political figure in the administration, according to sources close to the White House, as first reported by Politico. The anticipated transition marks a significant shift in their relationship, which had previously positioned Musk as a key figure in the Trump administration's efforts to streamline government operations. Despite Musk’s departure from his active role, Trump remains pleased with his contributions, particularly through his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative. Three administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Trump and Musk agreed that the billionaire entrepreneur would soon focus on their businesses in a more supportive and advisory role. Related News: JUSt IN: And Fidelity Announces Anticipated Major Cryptocurrency Development - It Involves Bitcoin and Two Altcoins Musk’s planned withdrawal comes amid growing frustration among Trump’s inner circle and outside allies over his unpredictable nature. Many see him as a political liability, especially after Tuesday’s Wisconsin Supreme Court elections, in which Musk lost by 10 points to a conservative candidate he openly supports. Democrats used Musk’s financial involvement in the race — reportedly around $20 million — to frame the election results as a referendum on Musk’s controversial influence. One senior administration official suggested Musk would retain an informal advisory position and could continue to appear in the White House, while another insider warned that those who expected Musk to disappear entirely from Trump’s political orbit were “kidding themselves.” Musk’s transition comes as his special government employee status is expected to expire in late May or early June, temporarily exempting him from some ethics and conflict of interest rules and giving him significant influence within the administration. *This is not investment advice.

US President Donald Trump is expected to announce bilateral tariffs for global trade. According to Trump's plan, the US will impose reciprocal customs duties on every country in the world that imposes customs duties on the US, without exception, and it will be announced today. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a press conference that the tariffs would go into effect immediately after they were announced, adding, “April 2, 2025 will go down in history as one of the most important days in modern American history.” Trump's speech, which has an impact on both global and crypto markets with his statements, will also be closely followed by Bitcoin and crypto investors. Trump is expected to announce the tariffs at a major event at the White House today, April 2. He is expected to announce new tariffs for 15 countries, including China, Canada and Mexico, which already impose tariffs on the United States. Trump is expected to make a statement on April 2 at 16:00 local time, 23:00 Turkish time. What to Expect in the Cryptocurrency Market? K33 Research analysts Vetle Lunde and David Zimmerman said they expect the tariff announcements to have a major impact on the market, with correlations between stocks and Bitcoin remaining high. “Our base case scenario for BTC is that tariffs will create volatile conditions throughout April. We think Bitcoin will extend its consolidation in the $75,000 to $88,000 range. We do not expect a sense of certainty and clarity after April 2, as we expect answers, negotiations, sudden turns and surprises throughout April.” BRN chief analyst Valentin Fournier said that significant and critical risk remains due to the unpredictability of Trump's speech. “Given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Trump’s speech, there could be a potential downside and increased volatility if the market disappoints on expectations. Until tariff uncertainty clears, we recommend low overall exposure to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and remaining cautious.” Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale, said the worst of the tariff impact on cryptocurrencies may already be reflected in prices. He added that if Trump’s tariff plans are implemented gradually, financial markets could recover, which could help Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

The platform raised $85 million in seed funding led by Pantera Capital and Framework Ventures, alongside Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. “The release of Open Deep Search is a milestone in our mission to make AI accessible to everyone,” said Himanshu Tyagi, co-founder of Sentient. “Open-sourcing a framework that outperforms industry leaders like Perplexity throws down the gauntlet to closed-source AI developers while giving developers access to a powerful primitive that frees them to create the applications they’ve always dreamed of.” Scaling access through Sentient Chat Open Deep Search will be integrated into Sentient Chat, the company’s consumer-facing AI chatbot. The rollout will begin with early testers, followed by weekly feature updates ahead of a full public launch within the next two months. Despite limited funding compared to major AI players, Sentient developed ODS using decentralized principles and a lean budget. The company says this levels the playing field against centralized AI models backed by billions in funding. “ODS proves that open-source AI can compete with closed-source technology for reasoning architecture and search level,” the company stated in its release.",News|AI|Polygon,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MATIC|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-02 16:12:40

Ripple ( XRP ) was trading at $2.10, down over 37% from its highest level this year. The decline has brought its market cap to $126 billion, making it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. The biggest XRP news was that Kraken, a top American crypto exchange, listed Ripple USD, ( RLUSD ), its stablecoin. The listing gives RLUSD access to over 13 million customers across the U.S. and other countries. RLUSD has been growing steadily since its launch a few months ago. Its market cap has jumped to a record high of $243 million. Most importantly, unlike many larger stablecoins, there are signs that RLUSD is being actively used in payments and trading. Its 24-hour volume consistently tops $70 million, while other stablecoins like Ondo US Dollar Yield, USDD, Frax, and PayPal USD rarely cross $50 million. Since its December launch, RLUSD has handled over $10 billion in volume.

XRP price is hanging on a thread XRP price chart: Source: crypto.news There are signs that XRP price is hanging on a thread. On the daily chart, it is hovering just above the crucial support level at $1.910 which is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. This price is also notable as the neckline of a head and shoulders chart pattern. A head and shoulders pattern is a well-known bearish reversal signal, marked by a peak (the head), two smaller highs (the shoulders), and a neckline. A drop below this neckline would suggest further downside, potentially toward the $1.50 support level, which aligns with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, often referred to as the “golden ratio,” where rebounds tend to occur. On the positive side, bulls could return and push the price higher in the near term. The H&S pattern would be invalidated if XRP breaks above the shoulders area at $3.

Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Ripple are all poised for volatility. With market movements on the horizon, investors are keen to know what to expect. Dive in to discover the top price predictions and see which of these digital assets could experience significant growth. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Recent Dip Amid Bullish Six-Month Rally Last month showed a decline of about 10.83% while the six-month performance was marked by a 38.32% gain. The figures reflect a recent short-term weakness offset by a robust longer-term recovery. A one-week drop of 3.81% adds to the picture of temporary price pressure during an otherwise healthy uptrend over half a year. Current price action trades between roughly $73,940 and $93,783 with immediate support near $65,370 and resistance around $105,055. Bears are active as momentum and oscillator indicators lean negative. A sideways trend is evident with opportunities for both timely buying near support levels and cautious selling if prices push past resistance levels. Ethereum Faces Continued Pressure with Recent Price Decline Ethereum dropped around 26% in the past month and nearly 21% over the last six months. The price declines indicate a persistent downtrend that has affected the coin consistently during these periods. Volatility has increased, and negative sentiment continues to impact market sentiment, making price recovery challenging. Currently, Ethereum trades between $1538 and $2325.85, with key resistance levels at $2829.45 and $3616.37 and support near $1255.61 and $468.69. Negative indicators, including a low RSI of 39.44, show that bears remain dominant. Traders might look for opportunities around support levels while implementing stop-loss orders to manage risks effectively. XRP Roller Coaster: 6-Month Surge Meets Short-Term Pullback XRP experienced a significant drop of nearly 30% in the past month, with a notable decline of about 15% in just one week. This recent downturn reflects a wave of selling pressure among traders. In contrast, over the last six months, XRP has risen dramatically by almost 300%, showcasing strong momentum and resilience despite the latest pullback. Current prices are fluctuating between $1.66 and $2.77, with resistance nearby at $3.45 and support around $1.23. The short-term indicators show a bearish trend, yet a clear direction is missing. Traders might find opportunities by observing price movements within these levels, considering buying near support if there is a bounce and selling as prices approach resistance. Conclusion In April, Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Ripple are expected to experience notable price movements. Market trends suggest that BTC, ETH, and XRP may see heightened activity. Investors should stay alert to potential shifts in these key coins. Keeping a close eye on market signals can help in navigating the expected changes. The month could bring unique opportunities for those tracking these cryptocurrencies. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Proof-of-reserve audits are onchain cryptographic verifications that a custodian, crypto firm, or stablecoin issuer has the digital assets it claims to hold. These proof-of-reserve audits use zero-knowledge tech and Merkle Trees — a data structure used to verify onchain information — as an alternative to audit reports or attestations widely used in the crypto industry. Despite proof-of-reserve technology not yet tracking liabilities against reserves, the system promises to be better than the current system of audits that do not use real-time, onchain data. First Digital’s audit report of reserves as of Feb. 28, 2025. Source: First Digital Tal Zackon, founder of the Tres Finance auditing and reporting platform, previously told Cointelegraph that current attestations and third-party audit reports only represent ""snapshots"" of reserves that can be manipulated, exploited, or misconstrued. Stablecoin issuers will likely need to adopt proof-of-reserve tools as the tokenized fiat equivalents become more integrated into global capital markets and critical financial infrastructure such as stock exchanges, escrow services, and clearinghouses. This integration will require stablecoin issuers to provide up-to-date, real-time data, which may need to be updated several times per minute as opposed to the monthly audit reports that are typically released by firms to attest to asset reserves.

The cryptocurrency briefly surpassed the $1,900 mark but was unable to maintain momentum and is fighting to remain above it now. This price drop follows a broader trend of market volatility, which has raised concerns about its price trajectory. This decline in price may be linked to shifting investor sentiment, as on-chain data suggests a notable reduction in large Ethereum transactions. Ethereum Whales Are Pulling Back According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s latest findings , there has been a significant decline in large Ethereum transactions since February 25, with a reported drop of 63.8%. This decrease was indicative of a notable reduction in whale activity on the network, which suggests that large-scale investors may be pulling back or reallocating their holdings. Interestingly, whales sold 760,000 ETH in the last two weeks alone. This downturn in whale activity coincides with the actions of a long-term Ethereum holder who recently liquidated their remaining assets. Lookonchain’s update revealed that an Ethereum OG sold their remaining 2,001 ETH, which is worth around $3.82 million, on April 2nd. The investor originally purchased 5,001 ETH for $1.38 million at $277 per coin back in 2017 and held through Ethereum’s bull run, even when prices soared to $4,878. Over the past month, however, they began selling and realized a total profit of $8.66 million in the process. At its peak, the investor’s unrealized gains reached as high as $23 million. All Eyes on Pectra’s Mainnet Launch Despite the successful finalization of Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade on the Hoodi testnet, the network has struggled to maintain a meaningful rally. Now, all eyes are on the highly anticipated upgrade on mainnet, which combines improvements from the Prague and Electra proposals. It is set to go live on the Ethereum mainnet on April 30, with a tentative activation scheduled for slot 11,599,872. There is still optimism that the mainnet launch could generate renewed investor interest and potentially trigger a more significant price movement. The timeline for the upgrade is still subject to final approval, with confirmation expected at the next All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) meeting.

Addressing lawmakers at an April 2 hearing, Waters said Trump had used his position as president to leverage “multiple crypto schemes” for profit, including a US dollar-pegged stablecoin launched by World Liberty Financial (WLFI) — the firm backed by his family. The California lawmaker pointed to Trump’s memecoin launched in January, his plans to establish a national cryptocurrency stockpile, and “his own stablecoin,” referring to WLFI’s USD1 token launched in March. Rep. Maxine Waters addressing the House Financial Services Committee on April 2. Source: GOP Financial Services “With this stablecoin bill, this committee is setting an unacceptable and dangerous precedent, validating the president and his insiders’ efforts to write rules of the road that will enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else,” said Waters, adding: “Trump likely wants the entire government to use stablecoins from payments made by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to Social Security payments, to paying taxes. And which coin do you think Trump would replace the dollar with? His own, of course.” Waters does not stand alone in her criticism of Trump’s crypto ventures , with many lawmakers and experts across the political spectrum suggesting potential conflicts of interest. Committee Chair French Hill, who spoke on stablecoins before Waters, also reportedly said that the Trump family’s involvement in the industry makes legislation “more complicated.” “If there is no effort to block the President of the United States of America from owning his stablecoin business [...] I will never be able to agree on supporting this bill, and I would ask other members not to be enablers,” said Waters. Related: Crypto has a regulatory capture problem in Washington — Or does it? Representative Bryan Steil, who introduced the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy, or STABLE Act, did not immediately address Waters’ concerns about Trump’s stablecoin but referred to establishing safeguards for consumers.

Ripple (XRP) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are two projects that have risen above the noise, each telling a different story about the potential for a $5.00 market value in 2025. XRP is at a pivotal point, standing on the verge of a bearish breakdown or a bullish comeback. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting records in its own presale, with Phase 4 going quickly as investors secure profits ahead of the next price rise. Ripple (XRP) — Turning Point Ripple (XRP) is once again at a crossroads. A bearish head-and-shoulders pattern has emerged on Ripple (XRP) daily chart, which threatens to Ripple (XRP) down to $1.50 if support levels fail. Losing the $2.00 threshold could spark a larger Ripple (XRP) drop, to as low as $1.07, according to analysts. But not all signals are dire. The bearish setup dissolves if Ripple (XRP) reclaims $3.00, nonetheless, potentially triggering the rally toward $15.00, according to some estimates. The bulls vs bears tug-of-war keeps Ripple (XRP) volatile. The recent price action flash freeze at the 20-day EMA ($2.36) with the RSI is hovering near neutral, suggesting a mixed Ripple (XRP) price sentiment. For investors, Ripple (XRP) is still a high-risk, high-reward play — its next big move will decide whether it flares out, or skyrockets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Pumps Lead Up To Presale The uncertain future of Ripple (XRP) allows Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to follow a strategic path of development. The presale tokens of the project earned $6,000,000 in funding while attracting more than 7,700 investors to lock their tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands at $0.025 before it undergoes additional price increases according to its Phase 4 status. Stage 5 of the pricing structure will increase MUTM to $0.03 dollars per token to enable a 20% profit gain for initial buyers. The main opportunity within Mutuum Finance emerges from its tokenomics system. Phase 4 investors will secure a substantial 140% profit when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launches at $0.06 during its debut. From a projection based analysis it should climb to $1.50 or more in the next time frame because of its lending structure and token buying system. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out from typical speculative tokens since it offers real utility functions including decentralized borrowing and lending features and generates income from mtTokens. Why Phase 4 Matters The clock is ticking for investors to buy at the current price. Once Phase 4 sells out, the 20% price increase triggers, and the time frame for maximum returns shrinks. In investing in tokens early backers don’t just buy a token, then expecting a future listing on an exchange—this is an opportunity for them to lock in this position prior to exchange listings and trains of ecosystem growth. The Mutuum Finance team is conducting a smart contract audit with CertiK, will allay confidence. Upon completion, results will be disseminated through official Mutuum Finance (MUTM) channels, adding credibility to the project. Both Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and also XRP have their paths to $5.00. The price of XRP is tied to macroeconomic trends and regulation, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) price will follow presale demand and platform usage. Mutuum Finance makes a strong case for investors looking for near term returns with less volatility. Don’t Miss the Next Phase Timing is everything in the crypto space, and early movers are rewarded. The completion of 4th phase of Mutuum Finance becomes good news near its cap with its next price increase being a surety. Lock & load now before prices go even higher. Ripple (XRP) to defy bears, or is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the real deal? One thing’s for sure—2025 will be a pivotal year for both.

Switzerland has long favored cash, with the average person holding around $10,481 in bills and coins. It’s been a cultural norm, valued for privacy and ease. But a new survey from the Swiss National Bank appears to show that debit cards have now edged out cash as the most common way to pay. The survey found that in 2024, 35% of in-store purchases in Switzerland were made with debit cards, overtaking cash, which made up 30%. That’s a big jump from 2017, when only 21% of payments were made with cards, and 70% were still in cash. For years, the Swiss held onto their cash-based culture, even as digital payments became more popular elsewhere. But now experts say the shift to cashless payments isn’t all that surprising. In an interview with Bloomberg, Alexander Koch, an economist at Raiffeisen Switzerland, said international comparisons “show that German-speaking countries in particular are very attached to cash, unlike the Netherlands and Scandinavia.” He also noted that the pandemic “has accelerated the move away from it also here.” Opportunity for Swiss stablecoin Despite the growing trend of digital payments, Switzerland remains one of the world’s top holders of cash. The country is ranked second for the largest average cash holdings per person, next only to Luxembourg. Yet, the shift away from cash continues. The SNB’s October announcement that public transport operators are planning to reduce cash acceptance further underscores this trend. In an interview with crypto.news, Dominic Weibel, head of research at Bitcoin Suisse AG, suggested that Switzerland’s increasing adoption of cards to cash “signals a broader openness to digital forms of money.” “While crypto payments remain niche today, the transition to digital means of payments creates fertile soil for utility, especially given that 8% of the global population now own crypto. Worldline already supports crypto at +85,000 merchants, and cities like Lugano for instance are accepting Bitcoin or stablecoins for everyday transactions.” Dominic Weibel Weibel also pointed to cities like Lugano, where Bitcoin ( BTC ) and stablecoins are already being accepted for everyday transactions, as a sign of growing acceptance. “We expect adoption to develop from a novel concept into broader optionality in the retail domain, although at a relatively slower pace than in other countries where debasing domestic currencies catalyse demand for tokenized dollars.” Dominic Weibel You might also like: UAE and Switzerland lead as premier locations with no crypto tax, research finds The SNB’s survey also revealed that 18% of payments in the country were made via mobile payment apps, while credit cards accounted for 14%. Addressing the growing acceptance of mobile payments, Weibel sees a significant role for stablecoins and tokenized assets in Switzerland’s evolving landscape, saying that stablecoins are “positioned to capture the largest piece of the cake since they remove the volatility headache linked to crypto assets.” “While dollar denominated stablecoins currently sport 99% market penetration, there is substantial opportunity for a Swiss stablecoin. The increasing adoption of mobile payment apps like TWINT already indicate the willingness to embrace novel payment technology.” Dominic Weibel The next logical step, Weibel argues, is tokenized Swiss francs that can “plug into both mobile apps to streamline payments while unlocking novel functionality like instant settlement, smart contract automation and the opportunities of decentralized finance.” No rush with CBDC Despite the country’s increasing reliance on digital payments, the SNB has made it clear that it does not intend to rush the introduction of a central bank digital currency, particularly as it remains cautious about the potential costs and privacy concerns associated with digital money. As Thomas Moser, a senior economist at the SNB, explained in a 2021 interview with finews, the central bank is wary of replacing cash with CBDC as “risks outweigh the benefits compared to the existing systems.” Moser further emphasized that one key factor in Switzerland’s reluctance to introduce the so-called e-franc is its focus on data protection, noting that “one advantage of cash is that you can use it to pay completely anonymously.” “If, on the other hand, you pay digitally, a lot of data is generated. Not only financial data but also data about what you buy and where you are at any given time.” Thomas Moser As cash usage declining in Switzerland, Weibel pointed to the recent developments in Swiss banks, such as UBS’s issuance of digital bonds and the active running of the SNB’s wholesale CBDC pilot. He pointed put that institutional engagement with blockchain infrastructure is “demonstrating clear acceleration,” adding that Bitcoin Suisse AG expects this trend to “manifest further across multiple institutional verticals in the months and years ahead.” Read more: Exclusive: Nexo expands card to Switzerland, Andorra",Feature|Exclusive|CBDC|Switzerland,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-02 17:30:00

The analyst also explained why he believes that XRP could witness such a parabolic surge. Why The XRP Price Could Surge 44x In an X post , Javon Marks asserted that the XRP price could 44x from its current level. He explained that in 2017, XRP broke out of a pennant pattern and surged wildly towards its first target at $0.0609 before using it as a light resistance and breaking well above on a run towards the meeting of its second. The analyst revealed that XRP recently broke out of a larger pennant pattern, surging widely towards its first target at $3.317 before using it as a light resistance. He added that next up can be a break well above this first target at $3.317 and a run towards the meeting of the second target, which is currently at $99. Marks noted that $99 is currently over 4,331% away, meaning that the XRP price could 44x from here. In the short term, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has revealed what lies ahead for Ripple’s coin , predicting that it could revisit the lows around $1.9 to $1.7 and then test the upper range at $2.80 to $3.00. A retest of this $3 range could ultimately lead to a breakout from this light resistance, as mentioned by Javon Marks. XRP would then rally to a new all-time high (ATH), which could eventually pave the way to the $99 target. The Altcoin Is Approaching A Critical Breakout Zone Crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that the XRP price is approaching a critical breakout zone. She noted that after testing the .786 Fib support at $2.05 over the last few days, the altcoin is now bouncing strongly again, with the price heading right back into the first big test at $2.17. The analyst remarked that this level has acted as key resistance before, and while the structure is looking bullish, the altcoin is not in the clear just yet. She went on to outline two scenarios, which she laid out on her accompanying chart. The first scenario is the bullish case. Here, the analyst stated that if the $2.05 low was the final bottom, then XRP is now building a new impulsive trend. She added that a clean breakout above $2.25 would be a major sign of strength. Meanwhile, a break above $2.36 and hold would officially invalidate any idea of one final move lower, as it would confirm that Wave 1 is in. The second scenario CasiTrades outlined is the bearish case. She claimed that if the XRP price struggles to flip $2.17 and $2.25 to support, then the altcoin could still be inside a final subwave 5 down toward the $2 region. The analyst remarked that $2.26 would be a short-term confirmation, while a break above $2.36 would confirm a trend reversal and that XRP is heading for new highs. The Bitcoin price is currently rallying and hit $87,000 today, which is bullish for altcoins like XRP. However, all eyes are still on the effects of Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs as they could significantly impact the crypto market.

The desk was a wooden cubicle in a lab at Northumbria University, in northern England, where a young AI researcher began his PhD track. This was in 2015. The researcher was Ben Fielding, who had built a large machine stuffed with early GPUs to develop AI. The machine was so loud it annoyed Fielding’s lab-mates. Fielding crammed the machine beneath the desk, but it was so big he had to awkwardly stick his legs to the side. Fielding had some unorthodox ideas. He explored how “swarms” of AI — clusters of many different models — could talk to each other and learn from each other, which might improve the collective whole. There was just one problem: He was handcuffed by the realities of that noisy machine beneath his desk. And he knew he was outgunned. “Google was doing this research as well,” Fielding says now. “And they had thousands [of GPUs] in a data center. The things they were doing weren’t crazy. I knew the methods... I had lots of proposals, but I couldn’t run them.” Ben Fielding, CEO of Gensyn, is a speaker at Consensus 2025 in Toronto. Jeff Wilser is the host of The People’s AI: The Decentralized AI Podcast and will host The AI Summit at Consensus 2025. So a decade ago, it dawned on Fielding: Compute constraints would always be an issue. In 2015, he knew that if compute was a hard constraint in academia, it would absolutely be a hard constraint when AI went mainstream. The solution? Decentralized AI. Fielding co-founded Gensyn (along with Harry Grieve) in 2020, or years before Decentralized AI became fashionable. The project was initially known for building decentralized compute – and I’ve spoken with Fielding about this for CoinDesk and on panel after panel at conferences – but the vision is actually something wider: “The network for machine intelligence.” They’re building solutions up and down the tech stack. And now, a decade after Fielding’s noisy desk annoyed his lab-mates, the early tools of Gensyn are out in the wild. Gensyn recently released its “RL Swarms” protocol (a descendant of Fielding’s PhD work) and just launched its Testnet — which brings blockchain into the fold. In this conversation leading up to the AI Summit, at Consensus in Toronto , Fielding gives a primer on AI Swarms, explains how blockchain snaps into the puzzle, and shares why all innovators -- not just tech giants — “should have the right to build machine learning technologies.” This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. Congrats on the testnet launch. What’s the gist of what it is? Ben Fielding: It’s the addition of the first MVP features of blockchain integration with what we've launched so far. What were those original features, pre-blockchain? So we launched RL [Reinforcement Learning] Swarm a few weeks ago, which is reinforcement learning, post-training, as a peer-to-peer network. Here’s the easiest way to think about it. When a pre-trained model goes through reasoning training – like DeepSeek-R1 – it learns to critique its own thinking and recursively improve against the task. It can then improve its own answer. We take that process one step further and say, “It’s great for models to critique their own thinking and recursively improve. What if they can talk to other models and critique each other's thinking?” If you get many models together in a group that can all talk to each other, they can start learning how to send information to the other models… with the overall goal of improving the entire swarm itself. Gotcha, which explains the name “Swarm.” Right. It’s this training method which allows many models to kind of combine, in parallel, to improve the outcome of a final meta-model that you could create from those models. But at the same time, you have every single individual model just improving on its own. So if you were to come along with a model on a MacBook, join a swarm for an hour and then drop back out again, you would have an improved local model based on the knowledge in the swarm, and you would have also improved the other models in the swarm. It’s this collaborative training process that any model can join and any model can do. So that's what RL Swarm is. Okay, so that’s what you released a few weeks ago. Now where does blockchain come in? So the blockchain is us moving forward some of the lower-level primitives into the system. Let’s just pretend that someone doesn’t understand the phrase “lower-level primitives.” What do you mean by that? Yeah, so I mean, very close to the resource itself. So if you think about the software stack, you've got a GPU stack in a data center. You've got drivers on top of the GPU. You've got operating systems, virtual machines. You've got all this stuff going up. So a lower-level primitive is the closest to the bottom foundation in the tech stack. Am I getting that right? Yes, exactly. And the RL Swarm is a demonstration of what's possible, basically. It's just a somewhat hacky demo of doing really interesting large-scale, scalable machine learning. But what Gensyn's been doing for the past four-plus years, realistically, is building infrastructure. And so we're in this period now where the infrastructure is all at that v0.1 sort of beta level. It's all done. It's ready to go. We have to figure out how to show the world what's possible when it's quite a big shift to the way people think of machine learning. It sounds like you guys are doing a lot more than decentralized compute, or even infrastructure? We have three main components that sit underneath our infrastructure. Execution – we have consistent execution libraries. We have our own compiler. We have reproducible libraries for any hardware target. The second piece is communication. So assume you can just run a model on any device in the world that's compatible, can you get them to talk to each other? If everybody opts into the same standard, everybody can communicate like TCP/IP from the internet, basically. So we build those libraries and RL Swarm is an example of that communication. And then, finally, verification. Ah, and I’m guessing this is where blockchain comes in… Imagine a scenario where every device in the world is executing consistently. They could link models together. But can they trust each other? If I connected my MacBook to yours, yes, they could execute the same tasks. Yes, they could send tensors back and forth, but do they know that what they send to the other device is actually happening on the other device or not? In the current world, you and I would probably sign a contract to say, yes, we agree that we'll make sure our devices do the right thing. In the machine world, it needs to happen programmatically. So that's the final piece we build, cryptographic proofs, probabilistic proofs, game theoretic proofs to make that process entirely programmatic. So that's where the blockchain comes in. It gives us all of the benefits of blockchain you can imagine, like persistent identity, payments, consensus, etc. And so what we're doing with the testnet now is taking RL Swarm and the primitives of the other infrastructure and we're adding in the blockchain components and saying, ‘Hey, when you join a swarm now, you have a persistent identity, which exists out there on a decentralized ledger.’ In the future you’ll have the ability to make payments, but right now, you have that trust consensus mechanism where we can terminate disputes. So, it's kind of an MVP of the future Gensyn infrastructure, where we’re going to add in components as we go. Give us a tease of what’s coming down the pipeline? When we reach main-net, all of the software and infrastructure is live against blockchain as the source of trust, payments, consensus, etc., identity. This is the first step of that. It's adding identity in and saying when you join a swarm, you can register as the same person. Everyone knows who you are without having to check some centralized server or website somewhere. Now let’s get wild and talk further in the future. What does this look like one year from now, two years from now, five years from now? What’s your North Star? Sure. The ultimate vision is to take all of the resources that sit under machine learning and make them instantaneously programmatically accessible to everyone. Machine learning is heavily constrained by its core resources. This creates this huge moat for centralized AI companies, but it doesn't need to exist. It can be open-sourced if we can build the right software. So our view is Gensyn builds all of the low-level infrastructure to allow that to get as close to open-source as it possibly can. People should have the right to build machine learning technologies.",Tech|CT2025,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|WALLET|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 17:42:50

To read full editions, subscribe . When it comes to crypto gaming, is there any point in taking on the risk that comes with building a “AAA” game — or should studios just focus on simpler mobile games with dynamic economies instead? Crypto founders at Ronin and Avalanche clashed over the issue on X this week. In light of Off The Grid ’s GUN token launch on Monday and perceived success as a blockchain game thus far, Ava Labs founder and CEO Emin Gün Sirer declared: “AVAX won gaming for sure. If you’re developing a AAA game, there’s only one proven platform to build on.” “AAA” is a gaming industry buzzword with no official definition attached, but it typically refers to games that cost $25 million to $40 million or more to make and come from larger studios with substantial marketing budgets. Off The Grid studio Gunzilla Games has its own dedicated, private Avalanche L1 chain called Gunz. The chain is nearing 500 million total transactions since its launch, according to Avascan data as of Wednesday morning. GUN’s future price will be difficult to predict given the slated long-term unlocks and added supply to come, as some have pointed out . The token currently sits at a $32 million market cap, and its price is down 54% from its all-time high. But only 6% of the token’s total supply is currently in circulation. Ronin, which made a name for itself as a gaming chain with its flagship Axie Infinity back in 2021, has taken a markedly different approach to crypto gaming. They’ve chosen to focus on mobile gameplay and game economies instead of on graphics, allowing them to keep budgets small while making the best games possible given those restrictions. “AAA Web3 gaming is a waste of money,” wrote Ronin cofounder and chair Aleksander Larsen in response to Sirer on Wednesday morning. “Come to $RON and let’s figure out the hard economic problems of web3 gaming together. $AVAX is focusing on the wrong thing and the token holders will suffer as a consequence,” Larsen continued, adding: “Congrats on your victory” with a salute emoji. Is Avalanche focusing on the wrong thing? For one, the chain has other types of games that aren’t “AAA,” like Spellborne, a pixelated magic game. Then there’s the question of objectives for each game — as well as each one’s target audience. Every crypto game will likely have a substantial cohort of players who are there just to “farm” or extract as much value as possible because of a crypto game’s play-to-earn elements, like Pixels founder Luke Barwikowski has found with his Ronin-based pixelated MMORPG. But should higher-fidelity graphics be the goal for crypto games — which result in much higher costs and risk? Two years ago, with the likes of Shrapnel, Off The Grid, and other ambitious projects splashing onto the blockchain gaming scene, pushing for a “AAA” game was trendy. But with VC firms pulling back on the inflated funding rounds of the 2021 post-pandemic boom, the number of crypto games with AAA plans has declined significantly since 2020. Last year, AAA titles made up less than 1% of crypto games, while indies made up over 90% of the total, per Game7 research. That ratio largely matches the broader gaming industry: Roughly 98% of Steam games are classified as indie. Across both crypto gaming and the broader gaming industry, more releasing titles have been indie. This may be due to broader economic factors, including the waves of mass layoffs and studio shutdowns we’ve seen for years now across the gaming industry. Mobile games also make up a large portion of the broader gaming pie, as 49% of games are mobile titles, according to data from analytics firm Adjust published last year. I think there’s substantially less room for multiple “AAA-budget” games in the crypto space specifically because you’re competing with the likes of Call of Duty and Fortnite and require much higher levels of continued capital and revenue. Whether AAA crypto games want to admit it or not, they’re in the same bracket as multibillion-dollar giants like Microsoft and Epic Games when it comes to PC player choice. Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War, for example, released in 2020 and reportedly cost Activision $700 million to make. Many typical gamers still aren’t going to get behind NFTs in video games, as we saw back in 2021 with smaller titles like the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise. And we’ve seen this many times since with players’ mainly negative response to Ubisoft’s and Square Enix’s respective blockchain gaming endeavors. Smaller games like mobile titles, however, aren’t at a major advantage. While 83% of mobile games are expected to fail , those lower-budget games come at a lower cost to studios. The market has corrected to fit more realistic expectations — including expectations around funding. Can the crypto industry fund more than one AAA game at a time? I’m not sure. Ronin is doing well in its niche, and Off The Grid is a rare breakout of a game for the blockchain gaming sector. There’s definitely room for both to succeed — and I think they’ll continue to attract completely different types of gamers to their titles. Get the news in your inbox.

Analysts suggest Ethereum may start outperforming Bitcoin if Gold corrects. Crypto markets eye macroeconomic signals as traders reposition for Q2. Gold smashed through the $3,100 mark recently; however, some analysts believe this rally could signal the start of a significant market shift, not just further gains for the metal itself. Market expert Michael van de Poppe suggests Ethereum (ETH) could outperform Bitcoin (BTC) if Gold pulls back sometime in April. This prediction may sound ambitious, considering ETH’s recently lagging price momentum. Yet it is not entirely unfounded based on historical market patterns.

Recent fluctuations in the top crypto prices have taken their toll on meme coins, leading to whales plunging into panic mode. After the weekend sell-offs, the meme coin market cap fell 3.6% to $49.7 billion, below the $50 billion mark. Whales Exit Top Meme Coins Over the past week, large whales dumped massive meme coin holdings as fear gripped traders. This followed uncertain macro events and general bearish sentiments to present on-chain metrics. According to Lookonchain , a PEPE whale sold 438B tokens worth approximately $3 million. The whale made the sale at a $434k loss due to increased selling pressure. In the last 24 hours, it was recorded that a PEPE trader went long with 10x leverage and is down over $3.36 million. This crunch from the meme coin market continues to affect bullish attempts in the same time frame. Similarly, another PEPE whale sold 150B tokens worth $1.14 million. This string of outflows sent the price down 9.2% in seven days. At the time of writing, PEPE price currently trades at $0.0000068, a 4% drop in the last 24 hours. The asset has also seen a decline in trading volumes, impacting new users. Like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB are also caught in the meme coin decline. These assets nosedived over the last 30 days wiping out previous strong positions. This year, DOGE holders projected a massive run to $1 ahead of the cycle peak but expectations have waned. The asset’s price stands at $0.1625, declining 8% last week and 4.4% today. Similar numbers are also seen in SHIB price although the community rally continues. Overall, whale interest in meme coins has significantly declined this year leaving confidence at yearly lows. Can Bulls Swing Into Action Last year, the total market cap of meme coins soared above $70 billion following heightened institutional interest in the crypto market. Meme coins are highly volatile and swing on a larger market bull run as a communing buzz. For most industry watchers, an altcoin recovery is a major factor for a meme coin drive. This could fuel several meme tokens like DOGE and SHIB to Q4 2024 highs and eventually more gains. On the flip side, the current market cap below $50 billion could pose a huge resistance to signals of a rebound as present sentiment points to fear over optimism.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|PEPE|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|PEPE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-02 17:47:47

In a post on X, Zhang described such proposals as bad for the network’s long-term growth. According to Zhang , imposing tariffs on Ethereum L2s to generate fees on the mainnet will damage the network’s future. In his opinion, this strategy is only ideal for centralized organizations, not decentralized networks like Ethereum. He said: “Tariffing L2s is one of the most toxic ideas for Ethereum’s future. It trades long-term scalability and ecosystem growth for short-term revenue — a strategy fit for centralized corps, not credibly neutral platforms.” Zhang’s comments come in response to the growing calls from some sectors of the Ethereum community who believe the network is struggling because Layer-2 networks are extracting value from the mainnet without giving anything back. Those who hold this view point to the decline in activity and fees on the mainnet even as the L2 grows in value. Interestingly, several people hold this view, including Sonic (formerly Fantom) co-founder Andre Cronje , who noted that L2s are why Ethereum has become inflationary again. Crypto entrepreneur Nic Carter also criticized the proliferation of tokens on Ethereum as the cause of the decline in ETH value. Ethereum has seen its activity and fees tank after introducing blobs in 2024. Most of the activity and fees now happen on the L2 network, while the mainnet only serves as a data availability and settlement layer. This has significantly hurt ETH, with the token already down 43% this year. Stakeholders, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, propose that L2s should support L1 with a higher percentage of their fees. ETH’s future is as a store of value However, Zhang believes many people do not judge Ethereum using the right metric. According to him, Ethereum should not assessed by its revenue and activity because the network is not meant to be accruing all the value. Instead, it’s a hub bringing several ecosystems together. Zhang said: “Measuring ETH’s value by Ethereum’s revenue misses the point. ETH’s real strength isn’t in protocol fees — it’s in becoming the hub asset across thousands of roll-up ecosystems. That’s the future.” In his view, ETH’s long-term potential is to be a store of value asset rather than a regular cryptocurrency. He explained that this will only happen if Ethereum continues its development as a roll-up hub, which will increase its adoption and usage of ETH. He said: “Every aligned L2 expands Ethereum’s surface area and social consensus. A thousand scalable roll-ups with ETH as the center > any monolithic chain.” The crypto founder also noted that Ethereum is not designed to be a vertically integrated network like Solana, which has SOL as its main asset but is limited in scalability. Thus, ETH value is to be a dominant asset across all the L2s, and its value will keep increasing as Ethereum continues to enable L2 networks instead of extracting value from them. However, Zhang warned that the network could risk losing its position if it imposes taxes on L2. Others seem to agree with this view. Lurebian on X noted that Ethereum is presently the best choice for L2, but that could change if it imposes taxes on these roll-up networks. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

According to a new update from the firm, it has integrated the stablecoin into its flagship tech solution, Ripple Payments. This move has been one of the major milestones of the RLUSD stablecoins lately, with a specific target for enterprise adoption. Ripple Labs and the RLUSD Gameplan With the new integration, the payments firm has initiated RLUSD cross-border payments. This move will grant the stablecoin direct exposure to billions of dollars in liquidity. According to the firm, the Ripple USD token is now available to select customers to facilitate payment flow. Per the announcement , RLUSD now helps power the payment flow of BKK Forex and iFlow. The blockchain payments firm reiterated the use cases of the stablecoin in the new update. The company said it helps to facilitate the settlement of cross-border payments and access liquidity for remittance. While evolving, the firm confirmed its ultimate game plan to feature RLUSD in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. The firm said its stablecoin will provide collateral for tokenized real-world assets and securities offerings in the long term. Ripple USD Milestone and Growing Adoption As of this writing, the stablecoin has recorded an impressive milestone in its circulating supply. According to the Ripple Stablecoin Tracker, the firm just minted another 50,000,000 RLUSD on the XRP Ledger. After consistent Ripple USD minting, the coin has seen its market capitalization cross the $240 million milestone. While it still has a long way to go before it catches up with ecosystem rivals like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, its growth since its launch last December is impressive. Considering its leaning toward the XRP ecosystem, the stablecoin has gained a listing on Margex , adding to its list of supporting global exchanges. The adoption of the token is notably driving demand for it. Its regulated status in the United States is largely considered a positive boost for the stablecoin. Stablecoin Issuers and Ecosystem Trends Beyond the Ripple USD stablecoin, other major players in the ecosystem have been in the news lately. As reported earlier by CoinGape, Circle filed for IPO in the US, a move the USDC issuer has been planning for over a year. Also, Tether has continued to diversify its business interests over the past few months. Tether acquired 8,888 BTC earlier this week, complementing its buy-ins into the agriculture and digital media industries. Whether Ripple Labs will trail its rivals in this aspect remains unknown, but for now, the firm said its product fosters trust in digital currencies.

In a move that’s sending shockwaves through the digital asset space, decentralized stablecoin protocol Usual has just dropped a bombshell. They’ve announced a mind-blowing $16 million bug bounty program in collaboration with blockchain security titans, Sherlock. Yes, you read that right – $16 million! This isn’t just another bug bounty; it’s the Mount Everest of crypto bug bounties, potentially even dwarfing anything the broader tech world has seen, according to reports from The Block. Let’s dive into why this is a game-changer for crypto security and what it means for you. Why a $16 Million Bug Bounty? Understanding the Crypto Security Stakes So, why such a colossal sum? Well, in the wild west of decentralized finance (DeFi), security isn’t just important – it’s everything. Think about it: DeFi protocols are entrusted with billions of dollars in user funds. A single, undetected vulnerability can lead to catastrophic losses, eroding trust and setting back the entire ecosystem. Usual protocol, boasting over $880 million in Total Value Locked (TVL), understands this implicitly. They’re not just playing it safe; they’re making a bold statement about their commitment to user safety and the integrity of their platform. This massive bug bounty isn’t just about finding flaws; it’s about proactively building an impenetrable fortress around their protocol. Consider these key points to grasp the magnitude of this initiative: Record-Breaking Reward: $16 million is unprecedented in the crypto space and possibly in tech history. This figure underscores the critical importance Usual places on security. Targeted Critical Vulnerabilities: This bounty isn’t for minor glitches. It’s laser-focused on “critical vulnerabilities” – the kind that could cause a major drain or complete freeze of funds without needing external triggers. We’re talking about the big kahunas of bugs. Sherlock Partnership: Usual isn’t going it alone. They’ve teamed up with Sherlock, a respected blockchain security firm known for its expertise in vulnerability detection and responsible disclosure. This partnership adds another layer of credibility and effectiveness to the program. Proactive Security Posture: Usual has already undergone multiple audits. This bug bounty is an additional, proactive step, demonstrating a ‘belt and suspenders’ approach to security. They’re not just reacting to threats; they’re actively seeking them out. The Crucial Role of Bug Bounties in DeFi Security Bug bounties are not a new concept, but they are absolutely vital in the world of DeFi security . Imagine DeFi protocols as complex digital fortresses. Audits are like security consultants inspecting the fortress’s blueprints and visible defenses. But bug bounties are like opening the gates to ethical hackers – inviting them to stress-test every nook and cranny, to find the hidden weaknesses that audits might miss. Here’s why bug bounties are so essential for DeFi: Crowdsourced Security: Bug bounties leverage the collective intelligence of the global hacking community. You’re not relying on a single audit team but potentially thousands of eyes scrutinizing your code. Continuous Security: Unlike audits, which are point-in-time assessments, bug bounties are ongoing. As protocols evolve and codebases change, the bounty program remains active, providing continuous vigilance. Incentivized Discovery: The financial incentive motivates ethical hackers to dedicate time and effort to find vulnerabilities. A large bounty, like Usual’s, attracts top-tier talent, significantly increasing the chances of uncovering hidden flaws. Responsible Disclosure: Bug bounty programs encourage ethical hackers to report vulnerabilities responsibly, giving projects time to fix issues before they can be exploited maliciously. Community Trust: Publicly announcing a substantial bug bounty builds trust within the community. It signals that a project is serious about security and values user safety above all else. Navigating Blockchain Vulnerabilities: What Kind of Bugs Are We Talking About? When we talk about “critical vulnerabilities” in the context of blockchain vulnerabilities and bug bounties, what exactly are we looking for? These aren’t your run-of-the-mill software glitches. Critical vulnerabilities in DeFi can be catastrophic, leading to: Smart Contract Exploits: Flaws in the smart contract code that govern the protocol’s logic. These can be exploited to drain funds, manipulate balances, or disrupt operations. Re-entrancy Attacks: A classic DeFi vulnerability where a malicious contract re-enters a function before the first invocation is completed, potentially allowing for repeated withdrawals. Oracle Manipulation: Exploiting vulnerabilities in oracles (external data feeds) to manipulate prices or other critical data, leading to financial exploits. Logic Errors: Flaws in the intended logic of the smart contracts, even if the code itself is technically sound. These errors can lead to unintended consequences and financial losses. Access Control Issues: Vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access to sensitive functions or data, potentially enabling malicious actors to take control of the protocol. Sherlock’s definition of “critical bugs” – those causing major loss or freeze of funds without external conditions – clearly targets these high-impact vulnerabilities. It’s about preventing the kind of exploits that can make headlines for all the wrong reasons and shatter user confidence. Usual Protocol: A Deep Dive into DeFi Innovation Let’s take a moment to understand Usual protocol better. While the news is dominated by the bug bounty , it’s worth recognizing what Usual is and why security is so paramount for them. Usual is a decentralized stablecoin protocol. In essence, they aim to create stablecoins – cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar – in a decentralized and transparent manner. Key aspects of Usual protocol likely include: Decentralization: Unlike centralized stablecoins, decentralized stablecoins aim to minimize reliance on central entities, enhancing transparency and reducing censorship risks. Stability Mechanisms: Usual likely employs sophisticated mechanisms to maintain the peg of their stablecoin, potentially involving algorithmic adjustments, collateralization, or a combination of approaches. Community Governance: As a decentralized protocol, Usual may incorporate community governance, allowing token holders to participate in decision-making processes. Interoperability: Like many DeFi projects, Usual likely aims for interoperability, allowing their stablecoin to be used across various blockchain platforms and DeFi applications. With a TVL of over $880 million, Usual has rapidly become a significant player in the DeFi space.

The consolidation introduces a unified identity for the protocol and coincides with the launch of a new native token, $OVER. As part of the transition, the project has also unveiled a new primary domain and implemented full Account Abstraction integration to enhance the platform’s user experience. With over four years of development, Overtime has established itself as a fully onchain sportsbook offering functionality comparable to traditional offchain platforms. Built on the Ethereum network, the protocol emphasizes transparency, security, and immutability. Overtime’s operational history includes: Over $200 million in volumes Support for over 100 sports and leagues 50,000 active users More than 10,000 unique betting markets Users can access the new Overtime domain here: https://www.overtime.io/ A Decentralized Alternative to Traditional Sports Betting Overtime distinguishes itself from traditional bookmakers by operating a fully decentralized, permissionless sportsbook platform. Anyone can seamlessly access Overtime with a simple connection without the barriers of traditional restrictive betting limits, arbitrary bans, or withheld payouts. Since its inception, Overtime has organically become the primary driver of Thales DAO growth. Recognizing this growth, the DAO’s community unanimously approved (via Thales Improvement Proposal 238) the full merger of Thales DAO to the branding of Overtime. Comprehensive Onchain User Experience Enabled by Full Account Abstraction With this launch, Overtime is also introducing a new concept: Overtime Accounts —an onchain smart account designed to abstract wallet and EVM network complexities. Overtime Accounts use Particle Network for the seamless creation of wallets via Social Logins, and Biconomy’s SDK to handle the smart-account functionalities, enabling frictionless transactions through its Paymaster, Bundler, and Session Keys infrastructure. After creating an Overtime Account, users can deposit supported collateral into their designated address to access Overtime’s onchain sportsbook interface. The platform supports features such as parlays, system bets, same-game parlays (SGPs), futures, and live betting. Transactions are executed through an account abstraction framework, removing the need for manual confirmations or the use of ETH to cover gas fees. Overtime’s user experience has been designed to minimize blockchain-related complexities, allowing users to engage with the platform’s sportsbook features without requiring technical knowledge of underlying blockchain processes. The interface offers a streamlined experience comparable to traditional web applications while maintaining the transparency and self-custody benefits provided by the Ethereum network. A new Overtime UX is available here: https://www.overtimemarkets.xyz/ The new Overtime DAO token: $OVER The new $OVER token will have a new total supply of 69.42M, compared to the original 100M of the THALES token. This means that 30.58M THALES tokens will be burned in preparation for the migration to $OVER. All THALES token holders will be able to migrate their $THALES to $OVER token at a 1:1 ratio on the new overtime.io domain. This aligns with the new sustainable tokenomics designed to foster growth and focus it entirely on the $OVER token. The new $OVER token will serve multiple utilities: $OVER as Betting Collateral: By using $OVER token as collateral on Overtime, users will enjoy improved odds (2% better than baseline odds) compared to other collaterals. This boosts $OVER token usage and aligns token holders with platform users. Buyback & Burn: All fees from Overtime will flow directly towards $OVER token buybacks, focusing the entire growth of the project towards the token. Burning the buybacks reinforces deflationary token dynamics. Governance Token: Holding $OVER grants voting power within Overtime’s decentralized governance structure. The $OVER token is built using Chainlink’s CCT token standard for easy and secure cross-network bridging using Chainlink’s CCIP. The token will be live and liquid on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base across prominent decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, Velodrome, and Aerodrome. How Overtime works Overtime innovations are a testament to its industry leadership: Onchain Parlays, System Bets, and SGPs: With its cutting-edge smart contract technology, Overtime brings advanced sportsbook features onchain. Live Betting: With the Merkle Tree-based core architecture paired with robust Chainlink oracle infrastructure, Overtime has managed to bring Live Betting onchain without the risks of frontrunning and toxic flow. Permissionless Liquidity Providing: Overtime Liquidity Pools allow anyone to deposit USDC, ETH, and BTC collateral to gain exposure to platform performance and act as a counterparty pool against the traders. Onchain Free Bets infrastructure: Anyone can wrap their tokens and send them as Overtime Free Bets. Overtime’s open Free Bets solution is a cutting-edge tool for user rewards and onboarding. A global movement Overtime represents an onchain revolution, a real-life example of how a traditional industry is improved by going onchain. It is a fair, permissionless, and globally accessible powerhouse that is bound to organically dethrone all classic offchain platforms. Unlike traditional sportsbooks that may restrict users based on performance, Overtime operates on a fully transparent and onchain infrastructure. The platform’s design ensures that participation is governed by smart contracts, removing the ability to impose user-specific limitations. Engagement is determined solely by the interaction between users and the underlying liquidity smart contracts. To date, Overtime has distributed cryptocurrency-based incentives, rewards, and competition payouts amounting to several million dollars in value. Participation in Overtime’s promotional campaigns and airdrops is open to all users, subject to eligibility criteria and regional availability. About Overtime Overtime is a fully onchain sportsbook designed for accessibility, allowing users to connect via social accounts or EVM-compatible wallets. The platform supports multiple cryptocurrencies and provides fiat onramp options through credit card payments. Overtime replicates the core functionalities of traditional sportsbooks while operating through decentralized infrastructure. The protocol does not implement user bans or individualized restrictions, enabling open access to place bets and withdraw funds. Throughout each season, users may be eligible for various forms of incentives such as cryptocurrency airdrops, free bet credits, and other rewards. Additionally, participants have the option to contribute to the platform’s liquidity pool, effectively taking on the role of liquidity providers.

Trading over the weekend triggered a new wave of outflows with the futures market weakening already low sentiments. In the last 48 hours, several large holders have sold the asset, leading to a 5% price drop. Liquidation Imbalance Triggers Selloff Per Coinglass data, XRP liquidation imbalance in the futures market stood at 1,178% amid a thickened bear plot. About $229 million worth of assets was liquidated in 24 hours, a similar pattern experienced in previous dips. The wider crypto market has also traded downward, but outflows remain limited. On the other hand, XRP has seen larger sales, resulting in a 5% daily decline. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.16 with its market cap down to $126 billion. Last week, XRP bulls attempted a short-term comeback to wipe out accumulated losses. While volumes spiked, the market’s bearishness soon clouded traders’ drive. Outflows in the last 14 days are up to 15% showing little signs of a rebound. In the same period, several large holders have dumped holdings backing other altcoins or simply to limit losses. On-chain data shows 29,532,534 XRP worth approximately $69.8 million transferred to Coinbase coupled with others. Movements to centralized exchanges point to an imminent sale due to the ease of transfers as opposed to other custodians. These large movements affect asset prices and sentiment as traders gauge exchange reserves as an important signal. A major factor behind the fall came after traders confirmed a bear flag pattern on daily charts. With the price crash below $2.15, traders recorded growing fears citing institutional decline. On the flip side, bulls await the approval of spot XRP ETFs in the United States to bolster demand. Like Bitcoin, an approval could send the asset’s price to levels not seen in years. Wider Market Panic Stalls XRP Although XRP recorded more losses in the last 24 hours compared to top crypto by market capitalization, some traders insist on a rebound higher than other altcoins. Ethereum is down 2%, trading at $1,900, and has faced several losses in March. The asset dropped below the $2k mark shortly after a slight rally wiping out gains in the process. Most crypto users expect XRP to lead altcoins into a major rally in Q2 2025. Solana also saw slight losses and trades at $126, while meme coins took the biggest hit due to high volatility.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-02 18:01:22

So far, Bitcoin has rallied into the uncertainty and is up 2.4% on the day, breaking the $87,000 level after losing it six days ago. According to popular pseudonymous crypto analyst Rekt Capital, BTC’s price action suggests an imminent “trend shift” if the flagship digital asset can break immediate resistance. Says the trader, “Bitcoin has increased by +$2000 in the past hour Which means that BTC is getting close to positioning itself for a future breakout beyond the 21-week EMA Still plenty of time until the Weekly Close but if one occurs above $87650 -> trend shift.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Rekt also says he’s looking for a daily close and a post-breakout retest of a diagonal resistance before running higher. Source: Rekt Capital/X And fellow popular crypto analyst DonAlt also posted on the social media platform X that he is eyeing a rally for Bitcoin. The pseudonymous trader tells his 662,000 followers that BTC is getting ready to run – as long as President Trump turns a bit softer on his tariff stance this week. “BTC still looks hella cute. Just need Trump to ease on us a lil bit and this thing runs.” Source: DonAlt/X At time of writing, BTC is trading at $87,103.

Comprehensive Onchain User Experience Enabled by Full Account Abstraction With this launch, Overtime is also introducing a new concept: Overtime Accounts —an onchain smart account designed to abstract wallet and EVM network complexities. Overtime Accounts use Particle Network for the seamless creation of wallets via Social Logins, and Biconomy’s SDK to handle the smart-account functionalities, enabling frictionless transactions through its Paymaster, Bundler, and Session Keys infrastructure. After creating an Overtime Account, users can deposit supported collateral into their designated address to access Overtime’s onchain sportsbook interface. The platform supports features such as parlays, system bets, same-game parlays (SGPs), futures, and live betting. Transactions are executed through an account abstraction framework, removing the need for manual confirmations or the use of ETH to cover gas fees. Overtime’s user experience has been designed to minimize blockchain-related complexities, allowing users to engage with the platform’s sportsbook features without requiring technical knowledge of underlying blockchain processes. The interface offers a streamlined experience comparable to traditional web applications while maintaining the transparency and self-custody benefits provided by the Ethereum network. A new Overtime UX is available here: https://www.overtimemarkets.xyz/ The new Overtime DAO token: $OVER The new $OVER token will have a new total supply of 69.42M, compared to the original 100M of the THALES token. This means that 30.58M THALES tokens will be burned in preparation for the migration to $OVER. All THALES token holders will be able to migrate their $THALES to $OVER token at a 1:1 ratio on the new overtime.io domain. This aligns with the new sustainable tokenomics designed to foster growth and focus it entirely on the $OVER token. The new $OVER token will serve multiple utilities: $OVER as Betting Collateral: By using $OVER token as collateral on Overtime, users will enjoy improved odds (2% better than baseline odds) compared to other collaterals. This boosts $OVER token usage and aligns token holders with platform users. Buyback & Burn: All fees from Overtime will flow directly towards $OVER token buybacks, focusing the entire growth of the project towards the token. Burning the buybacks reinforces deflationary token dynamics. Governance Token: Holding $OVER grants voting power within Overtime’s decentralized governance structure. The $OVER token is built using Chainlink’s CCT token standard for easy and secure cross-network bridging using Chainlink’s CCIP. The token will be live and liquid on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base across prominent decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, Velodrome, and Aerodrome. How Overtime works Overtime innovations are a testament to its industry leadership: Onchain Parlays, System Bets, and SGPs: With its cutting-edge smart contract technology, Overtime brings advanced sportsbook features onchain. Live Betting: With the Merkle Tree-based core architecture paired with robust Chainlink oracle infrastructure, Overtime has managed to bring Live Betting onchain without the risks of frontrunning and toxic flow. Permissionless Liquidity Providing: Overtime Liquidity Pools allow anyone to deposit USDC, ETH, and BTC collateral to gain exposure to platform performance and act as a counterparty pool against the traders. Onchain Free Bets infrastructure: Anyone can wrap their tokens and send them as Overtime Free Bets. Overtime’s open Free Bets solution is a cutting-edge tool for user rewards and onboarding. A global movement Overtime represents an onchain revolution, a real-life example of how a traditional industry is improved by going onchain. It is a fair, permissionless, and globally accessible powerhouse that is bound to organically dethrone all classic offchain platforms. Unlike traditional sportsbooks that may restrict users based on performance, Overtime operates on a fully transparent and onchain infrastructure. The platform’s design ensures that participation is governed by smart contracts, removing the ability to impose user-specific limitations. Engagement is determined solely by the interaction between users and the underlying liquidity smart contracts. To date, Overtime has distributed cryptocurrency-based incentives, rewards, and competition payouts amounting to several million dollars in value. Participation in Overtime’s promotional campaigns and airdrops is open to all users, subject to eligibility criteria and regional availability. About Overtime Overtime is a fully onchain sportsbook designed for accessibility, allowing users to connect via social accounts or EVM-compatible wallets. The platform supports multiple cryptocurrencies and provides fiat onramp options through credit card payments. Overtime replicates the core functionalities of traditional sportsbooks while operating through decentralized infrastructure. The protocol does not implement user bans or individualized restrictions, enabling open access to place bets and withdraw funds. Throughout each season, users may be eligible for various forms of incentives such as cryptocurrency airdrops, free bet credits, and other rewards. Additionally, participants have the option to contribute to the platform’s liquidity pool, effectively taking on the role of liquidity providers.

Recent reports indicate that a noteworthy 377.78 BTC, valued at approximately $32 million, was moved to a new, previously unknown wallet. This significant Bitcoin transfer has ignited curiosity and speculation within the crypto community, prompting questions about Bhutan’s strategic crypto holdings and future plans. Let’s delve into what this move could signify and why it’s capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. What Triggered Bhutan’s Bitcoin Transfer? The initial alert came from PeckShieldAlert, a well-regarded blockchain security firm, which reported the transaction on X (formerly Twitter). The sheer volume of Bitcoin moved – 377.78 BTC – is not insignificant, especially considering Bhutan’s known, albeit somewhat secretive, involvement in the crypto space. This Bitcoin transfer immediately raises several questions: Why now? Was this transfer planned, or was it a reaction to recent market conditions or internal strategic shifts? Why a new wallet? Moving such a large sum to a new address suggests potential security upgrades, portfolio restructuring, or perhaps even operational changes within Bhutan’s crypto management strategy. What’s Bhutan’s overall crypto strategy? This transaction offers a glimpse into Bhutan’s continued engagement with cryptocurrencies, but the full scope of their strategy remains largely opaque. Bhutan and Bitcoin: A History of Crypto Engagement While often perceived as a tranquil kingdom focused on Gross National Happiness, Bhutan Bitcoin history is surprisingly intertwined with the world of digital currencies. It’s been reported that Bhutan has been involved in Bitcoin mining operations for several years, leveraging its abundant and relatively inexpensive hydroelectric power. This foray into mining positioned Bhutan as an early adopter in the crypto space, although their activities have been kept largely under wraps. Here’s a quick look at Bhutan’s known crypto engagements: Aspect Details Bitcoin Mining Reports suggest Bhutan began mining Bitcoin as early as 2015, utilizing renewable energy sources. Investment Strategy It’s speculated that mined Bitcoin was not immediately sold but held as a strategic reserve or investment. Transparency Bhutan’s crypto operations have been characterized by a lack of transparency, making definitive statements challenging. Given this background, the recent Bitcoin transfer could be interpreted as a routine portfolio management activity, or it might signal a more significant shift in their approach to digital assets. The lack of official statements from the Royal Government of Bhutan leaves room for considerable speculation and analysis. Deciphering the Crypto Wallet Move: Security or Strategy? The decision to move a substantial amount of Bitcoin to a new crypto wallet address is a noteworthy security practice. In the world of cryptocurrencies, wallet security is paramount, especially when dealing with large holdings. Here are some potential reasons why Bhutan might have opted for a new wallet: Enhanced Security: New wallets can offer improved security protocols, protecting against potential vulnerabilities in older wallets. Organizational Restructuring: The transfer could be part of an internal restructuring of asset management, separating holdings for different purposes or departments. Privacy Concerns: While blockchain transactions are transparent, using new wallets can add a layer of obfuscation, making it slightly harder to track the entire history of the funds. Cold Storage Upgrade: This could be a move to a more secure cold storage solution, further safeguarding the Bitcoin holdings from online threats. Understanding the nuances of crypto wallet management is crucial in interpreting such transactions. For institutions and governments holding digital assets, robust security measures are non-negotiable. The Broader Context: Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Bhutan’s institutional Bitcoin involvement aligns with a growing trend of institutions recognizing and incorporating Bitcoin into their portfolios. Initially, Bitcoin was largely driven by retail investors, but over the past few years, we’ve witnessed increasing participation from corporations, hedge funds, and even nation-states. This institutional adoption brings several benefits to the crypto ecosystem: Increased Legitimacy: Institutional involvement adds a layer of legitimacy and maturity to the Bitcoin market. Market Stability: While still volatile, increased institutional holding can contribute to greater market stability over the long term. Price Discovery: Institutional trading activity can enhance price discovery and market efficiency. Wider Adoption: As institutions embrace Bitcoin, it paves the way for broader mainstream adoption and acceptance. However, institutional Bitcoin adoption also brings challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and the need for sophisticated custody solutions. Bhutan’s move, while not explicitly stated as institutional investment, certainly falls under the umbrella of state-level engagement with Bitcoin. Stay Tuned for More Bitcoin News and Bhutan Updates The Bitcoin news cycle is ever-evolving, and developments like Bhutan’s wallet transfer underscore the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency landscape. While the exact reasons behind this move remain unclear, it serves as a reminder of the significant, and often unseen, activities occurring behind the scenes in the crypto world. As we await further information or potential statements from the Royal Government of Bhutan, the crypto community will continue to analyze and speculate on the implications of this $32 million Bitcoin transfer. Will this be a precursor to a more open crypto strategy from Bhutan? Or is it simply a routine security measure? Only time will tell. For now, this shocking transfer has certainly piqued interest and reinforced the notion that even seemingly quiet nations are playing a part in the global Bitcoin narrative.

One popular analyst highlighted the 200-day MA and the 50-day MA as critical reversal points. Can Bulls Regain Control? Bitcoin (BTC) became the talk of the town at the start of the year when its price hit a new all-time high of almost $110,000. This happened in mid-January, but since then, the asset has been on a downfall . Currently , BTC trades at around $86,500, representing an 6% decline on a monthly scale. BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko According to some analysts , though , the bull cycle might kick in at full speed again under some important conditions. The X user Ali Martinez recently claimed that BTC faces the 200-day Moving Average (MA) at $86,200 and the 50-day MA at $88,300 as “key resistance ahead.” He assumed a breakout above these levels might “shift momentum back to the bulls.” Although bitcoin is currently above the first target, it still needs to close north of it. Gert van Lagen also chipped in, telling his over 115,000 followers on X that BTC “is continuing its bull market after bouncing off the neckline” of a four-year-old Head and Shoulders (H&S) formation. He believes the price could surge to a new ATH of a whopping $300,000 in the following months, but a weekly close below $74,400 might invalidate the potential rally. For their part, CRYPTOWZRD predicted that a “successful bullish breakout” of the $85K resistance area may be followed by a surge to as high as $91,500. On the other hand, a rejection could result in a crash to $78,200 and even lower. Other Projections Another well-known industry participant who recently touched upon the matter is BitMEX’s co-founder, Arthur Hayes. He thinks the US Federal Reserve will eventually resume the quantitative easing (QE) monetary policy due to mounting political and economic pressure. In his view, this renewed liquidity injection will drive BTC’s price higher. The policy usually occurs when interest rates are low and involves purchasing government bonds or other financial assets to stimulate economic activity. While the FED kept the benchmark unchanged following its previous FOMC meeting, there is a solid chance it could implement a cut in its June gathering .

On April 2, the National Cryptocurrency Association released the largest-ever survey of American cryptocurrency holders. It showed that 21% of U.S. adults, or around 55 million people, are using digital assets. Conducted in partnership with Harris Poll, the report offers a fresh look at how crypto is being used across different demographics and income levels. Ownership skews younger, with 67% of holders under 45, but the study also found notable adoption among older Americans as 15% are over 55. Women now make up nearly a third of all holders (31%). Somewhat surprisingly, crypto is more common in the construction sector (12%) than in financial services (7%). “We know that millions of real individuals are using crypto,” said Stuart Alderoty, President of the NCA. “This data tells us that people from all backgrounds are engaging with crypto in many ways, and not only are they excited about the future, they’re also already benefiting from it today.” You might also like: ‘Liberation Day’ will be an ‘atomic bomb’ for crypto: pro Crypto as a tool for education, finance, and fun The report found that crypto’s appeal extends beyond generating returns.

Nearly 40% use crypto to make purchases while 9% transact with it daily. Most holders (81%) want to deepen their understanding of crypto, especially around security, regulation, and blockchain technology. Sixty-four percent support government regulation while 67% warn it could stifle innovation. Many users see crypto’s societal potential, citing its role in financial inclusion (45%), digital transaction efficiency (45%), and global cooperation (33%). According to Alderoty, “We are excited to continue learning more about who [crypto holders] are and how they are using crypto in their daily lives so we can best support them.” You might also like: Digital shift in Swiss economy shows ‘substantial opportunity’ for Swiss stablecoin, Bitcoin Suisse says",News|crypto|Crypto assets|Cryptocurrency,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-02 18:15:16

This new product will satisfy the increasing number of investors seeking tax-efficient ways to invest in cryptocurrencies. Fidelity Debuts Crypto IRA with BTC, ETH, and LTC In a report, Fidelity Investments has noted the growing client demand for solutions that would enable investment in cryptocurrencies via retirement accounts. The new commission-free crypto IRA is for the residents of USA who are above 18 years old, allowing them to participate in buying the three standard cryptocurrencies employed in the market, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, as well as Litecoin. These assets are managed by Fidelity Digital Assets, and to minimize the threats of online activities, the digital assets are stored in cold wallets. The crypto IRA is offered in many types of Individual Retirement Account categories such as the traditional IRAs, Roth IRA, and the rollover IRA. This makes it easy for investors to select the retirement account that they prefer, depending on whether they want to adjust contributions to recognize current taxes or take distributions in retirement without incurring taxes. This strategy by Fidelity is significant because it will enable investors to invest in cryptos without having to pay additional fees that can be subtracted from their potential earnings. Growing Demand for Crypto Investment Options Fidelity’s decision to roll out this crypto IRA especially comes at a time when clients and financial advisors are embracing tax-efficient client product solutions. According to TMX VettaFi, 57% of advisors’ poll that are invested in actively trading said they are willing to boost their exposure to cryptocurrency ETFs. While some of the advisors took a global equity approach to investing in crypto through an ETFs, others are going directly to the cryptocurrencies for their clients. This is particularly in line with the new trend in the financial market in which many people are considering cryptocurrencies as long-term assets. With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum becoming more widely accepted in common markets, investors are looking for ways to include these currencies in their retirement portfolios, which is where Fidelity plans on coming in with this product. Secure Custody and Storage Solutions A major selling point of Fidelity’s crypto IRA is its emphasis on security. The digital assets are stored securely in cold wallets, which are offline storage solutions that offer protection against hacking and other cyber threats. Fidelity Digital Assets, a division dedicated to managing digital assets, ensures that all stored cryptocurrencies are kept safe and are easily accessible for investors. Cold wallet storage is widely regarded as one of the safest methods to store digital currencies, particularly because it eliminates exposure to online vulnerabilities. Fidelity’s commitment to secure, custodial services offers peace of mind to investors who are concerned about the safety of their digital assets. Expanding Fidelity’s Crypto Offerings Fidelity Investments has long been a key player in the digital asset space, offering various crypto-related financial products such as ETFs. In addition to the new crypto IRA, the company recently filed to list a Solana ETF on the Cboe Exchange. These efforts reflect Fidelity’s commitment to expanding its presence in the cryptocurrency market and offering a broad range of investment options for both individual investors and institutional clients. The company is also exploring new potential products, including stablecoins, to meet the evolving needs of the market. As the adoption of digital currencies continues to grow, Fidelity is positioning itself to be at the forefront of this shift, providing its clients with secure, regulated, and tax-advantaged solutions for investing in cryptocurrencies. By offering a crypto IRA, Fidelity is catering to investors who want the benefits of both crypto exposure and tax-efficient retirement planning.

This achievement highlights the network’s growing adoption and its ability to handle large-scale transaction volumes efficiently. On March 31, 2025, Shibarium officially recorded its one-billionth transaction, marking a major milestone in its development. The network achieved this feat in just 593 days, or approximately one year and seven months, making it one of the fastest blockchains to reach this benchmark. In comparison, Bitcoin, the world’s first and most established blockchain, took 15 years to surpass one billion transactions. This demonstrates Shibarium’s rapid adoption and the active participation of its user base. Despite experiencing technical setbacks in its early days, such as a temporary outage shortly after launch, the network has remained operational and continued to grow steadily. Daily Transaction Volume and Other Key Metrics Shibarium has maintained a high transaction volume , recently processing approximately 4 million transactions in a single day. As of now, the total number of transactions on the network stands at 1,001,311,027 (1.001 billion). In addition to transaction volume, other key metrics further illustrate Shibarium’s progress. The network has generated a total of 10,233,246 blocks, with an average block time of 5.0 seconds, ensuring fast and efficient processing. Furthermore, 193,929,845 blockchain addresses have interacted with the network, showcasing its widespread usage. Current Network Activity and User Engagement While the total number of registered accounts on Shibarium has reached 248,608, the number of actively engaged accounts has fluctuated. At present , only 917 accounts are active, representing a significant decline of 89.01% from the previous day’s total of 8,346 active users. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Despite this drop in active users, the overall transaction count and block production indicate that the network remains highly functional. The fluctuations in daily user activity may be influenced by various factors, including market conditions and evolving user behavior within the ecosystem. Future Prospects Shibarium’s ability to surpass one billion transactions in such a short period underscores its potential as a robust Layer-2 scaling solution for the ecosystem. With continued adoption and potential improvements to its infrastructure, the network could further solidify its position among leading blockchain platforms. Moving forward, it will be important to monitor how Shibarium maintains user engagement and continues to scale. The network’s rapid growth suggests it could play an increasingly significant role in blockchain adoption and decentralized finance applications in the coming years.

It’s crucial to conduct your own thorough research on each of these projects before casting your vote. Understanding their whitepapers, tokenomics, teams, and roadmaps will empower you to make an informed decision. Remember, your vote contributes to shaping the future landscape of crypto listings on Binance. How to Participate in the Crypto Exchange Voting Process Participating in the crypto exchange voting process is straightforward. Here’s a step-by-step guide to ensure you can cast your vote effectively: Eligibility: Ensure you have a verified Binance account. You typically need to have completed KYC (Know Your Customer) verification to participate in such campaigns. Access the Voting Page: Navigate to the official Binance website and look for the “Vote to List” campaign section. This is usually prominently featured on the homepage or within the announcements section. Understand the Voting Period: Note the voting timeframe. For this Season 2, voting is open from April 2nd at 13:30 UTC to April 9th at 12:59 UTC. Make sure to cast your vote within this window. Review the Projects: Carefully examine each of the candidate projects. Binance typically provides brief descriptions and links to project websites or whitepapers. Conduct your own research as mentioned earlier. Voting Mechanism: Votes are usually cast using BNB, the native token of the Binance ecosystem. The exact mechanism might involve committing a certain amount of BNB to your chosen project. Details will be provided on the voting page. Cast Your Vote: Once you’ve decided, follow the instructions on the voting page to cast your vote for your preferred project. Monitor the Results: After the voting period concludes, Binance will announce the project with the most votes. Keep an eye on Binance’s official channels for the announcement. Remember, participation in the Binance Vote to List campaign is not just about voting; it’s about engaging with the crypto community and contributing to the selection of potentially valuable and innovative projects for the wider ecosystem. Benefits of Community Crypto Listing Campaigns Why are community crypto listing campaigns like Binance’s Vote to List beneficial? They offer a multitude of advantages for various stakeholders: Democratization of Listing: It shifts the power of token selection, at least partially, to the community, making the process more inclusive and less centralized. Community Engagement: These campaigns foster greater engagement between users and the exchange. It encourages users to research projects, participate actively, and feel more connected to the Binance ecosystem. Project Visibility: For the participating projects, even if they don’t win, the campaign provides significant exposure to a massive audience of potential investors and users. Discovery of Promising Projects: The community’s collective intelligence can help identify and surface promising projects that might have been overlooked through traditional listing processes. Increased Transparency: By involving the community, the listing process becomes more transparent. Users can see which projects are being considered and understand the community’s preferences. Enhanced Ecosystem Growth: Listing promising community-backed projects can contribute to the overall growth and diversification of the Binance ecosystem and the broader crypto market. These benefits highlight why community-driven initiatives are becoming increasingly popular in the crypto space. They represent a move towards greater decentralization and user empowerment. Potential Challenges and Considerations While token listing campaigns offer numerous advantages, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Potential for Manipulation: There’s always a risk of vote manipulation, although exchanges like Binance implement measures to mitigate this. Users should be aware of this possibility. Informed Voting: It’s crucial for voters to be well-informed about the projects. Without proper research, voting might be based on hype or superficial factors rather than fundamental value. Project Viability Post-Listing: Winning a vote doesn’t guarantee a project’s long-term success. Users should still conduct due diligence before investing in any newly listed token. Fair Representation: Ensuring fair representation for all types of projects, including smaller or less well-marketed ones, can be a challenge. Expectations Management: It’s important to manage community expectations. Not every voted project will necessarily be a massive success, and listings are just one step in a project’s journey. Addressing these challenges proactively is key to ensuring the long-term effectiveness and integrity of community voting campaigns. Actionable Insights: Maximize Your Participation To make the most of this Binance listing competition and similar community voting events, consider these actionable insights: Do Your Research: Thoroughly research each project. Don’t just rely on surface-level information. Read whitepapers, understand tokenomics, assess the team, and analyze the project’s roadmap. Engage with Project Communities: Join the Telegram groups, Discord servers, and social media channels of the projects you are interested in. Ask questions and understand the community sentiment. Consider Long-Term Potential: Think beyond short-term gains. Evaluate the long-term viability and potential impact of each project in the crypto ecosystem. Diversify Your Choices: If you have multiple votes, consider diversifying your choices based on your research and risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with announcements and updates from Binance regarding the voting process and the candidate projects. Vote Responsibly: Cast your vote thoughtfully and responsibly, considering the potential impact on the crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: Your Vote, Your Crypto Future Binance’s Vote to List Season 2 is more than just a competition; it’s a powerful demonstration of community empowerment within the cryptocurrency space. By participating in this crypto exchange voting , you’re not just casting a vote; you’re actively shaping the future of token listings and contributing to a more decentralized and community-driven crypto ecosystem.

Dragoin ($DDGN) has just launched its public presale, and the buzz is undeniable. With a Game of Thrones-inspired theme, a play-to-earn Telegram game, and a price entry point so low it almost feels like a glitch, Dragoin is already making waves. And the window to get in early? It’s open—but not for long. If you’ve been watching from the sidelines as DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE took off, this is your wake-up call. Dragoin isn’t just another meme coin riding on hype—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem that’s turning heads with its gamified experience, smart tokenomics, and a real chance at massive returns. Have You Missed the Early Stages of the Presale? The good news: No, you haven’t. But time is short. The Dragoin presale is live at just $0.0000292 , and with a launch price set at $0.002 , early buyers in Stage 1 are staring down a potential 6,700% ROI . That’s not a typo. A $100 buy-in today could potentially be worth over $6,700 by launch—assuming demand continues on its current trajectory. As each stage of the 25-stage presale fills up, the token price rises. This means every moment you wait is a moment where someone else grabs a cheaper entry. This isn’t just about FOMO—it’s about opportunity cost. Why Dragoin Is Blowing Up Game of Thrones Meets Crypto: Dragoin leans into meme culture with style. Each presale stage is named after an iconic moment from Game of Thrones—“The Red Wedding,” “The Battle of Winterfell,” and more—making the buying journey as thrilling as the show itself. It’s not just branding—it’s viral storytelling with crypto fuel. Telegram-Based Game with Real Rewards: The Dragoin mini-game lets users control dragons directly from Telegram. No app installs, no wallet integrations upfront. Just pure gameplay, where every move through obstacles earns $DDGN tokens . It’s easy, addictive, and rewarding—a killer combo in a space that thrives on user engagement. Built for Growth: Dragoin is deployed on Ethereum with support for ETH, BNB, and USDT. The team plans to list on top-tier decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, followed by centralized exchanges post-launch, providing liquidity and trading options for all levels of users. Dragoin’s Burn Mechanism Sets It Apart Here’s where things get even hotter: any unsold tokens will be permanently burned before launch . That means no hidden reserves, no inflation, no second chances. Once a presale batch sells out, it’s gone. Once the token burns, that supply is off the market forever. In a world where scarcity creates value, Dragoin is turning the flame all the way up. This burn mechanism doesn’t just protect value—it multiplies it for those who got in early. The Presale Stats You Shouldn’t Ignore Total Supply: 200 billion $DDGN Presale Allocation: 100 billion (50%) Current Stage Price: $0.0000292 Launch Price: $0.002 Maximum Potential ROI (Stage 1 to Launch): ~6,700% Number of Presale Stages: 25 Current Stage: 1 Blockchain: Ethereum Token Burn: All unsold tokens before launch Access Game: Telegram Combine that with Dragoin’s play-to-earn mechanics, and you’re not just holding a token—you’re part of a live, interactive experience that pays. Dragoin Isn’t Just a Coin—It’s an Ecosystem The roadmap is ambitious but grounded: Q2 2025: Presale launch, community growth, and marketing blitz Q3 2025: Full rollout of the Telegram game Q4 2025: Major exchange listings and gameplay expansion Dragoin’s strength lies in its simplicity and scalability. New users don’t need to be DeFi experts or NFT collectors. They just need Telegram, a wallet, and a dragon to fly. With referral contests, governance votes, and leaderboard battles, Dragoin is creating more than just a token—it’s building a community of meme-fueled investors, gamers, and thrill-seekers. Final Thoughts: Don’t Be Late to the Burn Dragoin isn’t promising magic. It’s offering a calculated shot at high ROI in a format that meme coin buyers love: fun, fast, and full of community energy. The mechanics are built for virality, the tokenomics are designed for scarcity, and the game is already playable on a platform you’re probably using every day. So, if you’re still asking whether Dragoin is worth it, the better question might be: Will you buy before the burn—or just watch from the ashes?

In a research note published today, Kendrick began his review of AVAX with an ambitious price target trajectory: $55 by the end of 2025, $100 in 2026, $150 in 2027, $200 in 2028, and $250 by the close of 2029. That would imply a more than tenfold increase from its current value. According to Kendrick, one of the key features that sets Avalanche apart from others is its unique scaling model. Unlike Ethereum or Solana, Avalanche uses a system of subnets, or sidechains, to increase scalability and efficiency. Related News: BREAKING: FDUSD Team Makes Official Statement After Decline Another critical factor supporting Avalanche’s growth is the increased developer participation following a major upgrade of the network in December, which reduced the cost of setting up a subnet to nearly zero, potentially driving greater adoption and innovation in the ecosystem. With a current market cap of $9 billion, Avalanche is the 15th largest cryptocurrency. However, when measured by total value locked (TVL), it stands as the tenth largest blockchain. Kendrick argues that Avalanche’s relatively smaller size compared to industry giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum puts it in a good position to experience exponential growth even with incremental advancements. *This is not investment advice.

The U.S. Congress has begun reviewing a new Stablecoin Bill, which could further drive adoption of RLUSD and XRP by providing a clearer regulatory framework. Can XRP Price Reach $20 If It Gains 15% Monthly? At press time on April 2, XRP is trading at $2.13 with a market capitalization of $124 billion. If XRP were to gain 15% per month consistently, here’s how long it would take to reach the $20 milestone. Projected XRP Price at 15% Monthly Growth Q2 2025 (April – June): $3.24 Q3 2025 (July – September): $4.93 Q4 2025 (October – December): $7.50 Q1 2026 (January – March 2026): $11.40 Q2 2026 (April – June 2026): $17.34 Q3 2026 (July – September 2026): $26.37 XRP is projected to cross the $20 mark by July 2026 if it maintains consistent 15% monthly growth. While this optimistic XRP price projection appears unlikely in 2025, the introduction of RLUSD, the push for an XRP ETF , and regulatory progress, could provide strong positive catalyst as the year unfolds. However, strategic investors may remain cautious, as market volatility and unforeseen regulatory hurdles could impact this bullish forecast.

This pivotal development not only cements Kraken’s foothold in the North American market but also arrives at a crucial juncture, especially following competitor Gemini’s recent departure from Canada in late 2024, as reported by Cointelegraph. For Canadian crypto enthusiasts and investors, this news is a significant indicator of the evolving regulatory environment and the enduring presence of major players like Kraken in the Canada crypto market . Why Kraken’s Canada License is a Game Changer? Obtaining a restricted dealer license in Canada is not merely a procedural step; it’s a powerful statement of commitment and strategic foresight. Here’s why this development is being hailed as a game changer: Regulatory Compliance and Trust: The restricted dealer license signifies that Kraken has met stringent regulatory requirements set by Canadian authorities. This compliance fosters greater trust and confidence among Canadian users who prioritize security and regulatory oversight in their crypto dealings. Market Stability Amidst Shifts: Gemini’s exit from the Canadian market created a void and some uncertainty. Kraken stepping up and securing this license reassures the Canadian crypto community of market stability and continued access to diverse trading platforms. Enhanced Service Offerings: With this license, Kraken is positioned to potentially expand its service offerings within Canada, catering more comprehensively to the needs of Canadian traders and investors. This could include a wider range of digital assets, advanced trading features, and localized customer support. Strategic Market Expansion: Canada represents a significant and growing market for cryptocurrencies. Kraken’s investment in obtaining this license highlights its strategic focus on expanding its global footprint and tapping into key markets with robust regulatory frameworks. Navigating Cryptocurrency Regulation in Canada: Kraken’s Proactive Approach The Canadian regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is evolving, aiming to balance innovation with investor protection. Kraken’s successful acquisition of the restricted dealer license demonstrates a proactive and adaptable approach to navigating these regulations. Let’s delve into the intricacies of cryptocurrency regulation in Canada and how Kraken is positioning itself: Regulatory Aspect Implication for Crypto Exchanges Kraken’s Approach Restricted Dealer Status Allows operation under specific conditions, requiring compliance with securities laws. Proactively sought and obtained, demonstrating commitment to legal frameworks. KYC/AML Compliance Mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures to prevent illicit activities. Robust KYC/AML protocols are already in place, aligning with global standards and Canadian requirements. Investor Protection Regulations designed to protect investors from fraud and market manipulation. License acquisition itself is a step towards investor protection, further enhanced by Kraken’s security measures and transparent operations. Provincial Variations Canada’s regulatory framework involves both federal and provincial oversight, creating complexities. Kraken’s license navigates these complexities, ensuring compliance across relevant jurisdictions. What Does This Mean for the Canada Crypto Market? Kraken’s license isn’t just a win for the exchange; it’s a positive signal for the entire Canada crypto market . Here’s a breakdown of the potential impacts: Increased Investor Confidence: A major international exchange like Kraken securing regulatory approval boosts overall investor confidence in the Canadian crypto market. It signals legitimacy and maturity. Attraction of More Businesses: Kraken’s success can pave the way for other reputable crypto businesses to seek regulatory compliance in Canada, fostering a more competitive and dynamic market. Innovation and Growth: With a clearer regulatory pathway, companies are more likely to invest in innovation and expand their services in Canada, leading to growth in the digital asset sector. Wider Adoption of Digital Assets: Increased confidence and market stability can contribute to the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology among Canadians. Kraken’s Commitment to Canada and the Future of Digital Assets The appointment of Cynthia Del Pozo as Kraken’s North America general manager further underscores the exchange’s commitment to the region. Managing over CA$2 billion in assets for Canadian users already, Kraken’s deepened presence signifies a long-term vision for its operations in Canada. For Canadian users, this translates to: Continued Access to a Leading Platform: Canadians will continue to have access to Kraken’s robust trading platform, known for its security, diverse asset offerings, and competitive fees. Potential for Enhanced Services: With the regulatory framework in place, Kraken is better positioned to introduce new and improved services tailored to the Canadian market. Stronger Market Presence: Kraken’s increased focus on Canada means a more engaged and responsive presence, potentially leading to better customer support and community engagement initiatives. This strategic move by Kraken reinforces the positive trajectory of the Canadian cryptocurrency space. As digital asset license approvals become more common for established players, the Canadian market is solidifying its position as a welcoming and regulated environment for crypto innovation. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for Kraken and Canada’s Crypto Future Kraken securing a restricted dealer license in Canada is more than just a regulatory milestone; it’s a resounding affirmation of the Canadian crypto market’s potential and Kraken’s unwavering commitment to its Canadian user base. In a landscape often characterized by regulatory uncertainty, Kraken’s proactive approach sets a positive precedent, fostering trust, stability, and growth within the burgeoning Canadian digital asset ecosystem.

The document states that “Ripple protocol contains main trends relevant for designing a Green and inclusive financial system” and links its development to research conducted for the United Nations Environment Programme. This connection suggests that XRP and Ripple’s technology could be important components in the evolution of digital payments, offering sustainable and accessible financial solutions. “The Ripple protocol contains the main trends relevant to designing the Green and Inclusive financial system proposed by the United Nations.” Ripple United Nations The highest levels of the financial system. pic.twitter.com/nITcU7HDQO — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) April 1, 2025 Ripple’s Connection to Global Financial Trends The document highlights Ripple’s alignment with modern financial trends, including disintermediation, technological innovation, and network systems such as SWIFT and Bitcoin. The mention of the United Nations’ involvement suggests that Ripple may play a role in shaping financial systems that prioritize sustainability and inclusivity. Additionally, the text acknowledges Ripple’s role in defining virtual currency classifications, distinguishing between centralized and non-centralized virtual currencies, and their impact on Anti-money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations. By integrating these elements, Ripple supports financial institutions rather than replacing them. It provides a gateway between traditional banking and emerging digital finance, allowing institutions to benefit from established financial structures and modern blockchain efficiencies.

Bitcoin introduced decentralized digital currency but lacks the efficiency required for large-scale financial operations. SWIFT, a trusted global banking network, is slow and costly compared to modern blockchain solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL) addresses these limitations by offering faster transaction speeds, lower fees, and improved scalability for cross-border payments. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has called SWIFT’s system outdated , and the company plans to usher in a new era of international payments through XRP. Implications for the Future of Digital Finance The document suggests that the financial sector must determine whether digitalization will replace traditional banking infrastructure. While concerns remain over security risks and regulatory challenges, the text argues that Ripple’s experience with financial institutions positions it as a strong candidate for the job of integrating digital assets into global payment systems. XRP’s ability to facilitate interoperability between banks, reduce transaction costs, and enhance financial inclusion aligns with broader trends in economic modernization. If widely adopted, it could reshape the financial landscape , offering a solution that balances regulatory compliance with blockchain efficiency.

42815382,https://blockworks.co/news/trump-to-unveil-tariff-policy-plans,1743621300,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Trump gears up to unveil ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs,https://blockworks.co/news/trump-to-unveil-tariff-policy-plans,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . President Trump is slated to reveal his long-promised reciprocal tariff policies at 4 pm ET from the White House Rose Garden. Just hours from the event, we still know very little. Trump and his team were working on the plans late into Tuesday evening, according to people familiar. We do know, though, that Trump in the past has floated imposing additional levies on copper, lumber and pharmaceuticals. I wrote yesterday about why I’m personally most interested in hearing about a copper tariff — the US currently imports about 50% of the amount we use, and the metal is in just about everything. Trump has also said he plans to slap tariffs greater than or equal to all foreign levies placed on goods other countries import from the US. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said yesterday that whatever is announced on Wednesday afternoon will go into effect “immediately.” In addition to the new policies, Trump’s 25% tariff on imported cars will start just after midnight tonight. Imported auto parts will be taxed at the same rate starting in May. S&P Global estimates that roughly 46% of cars sold in the US in 2024 were imported. Ahead of the auto tariffs, General Motors on Tuesday announced that its Q1 sales were more than 16% higher than last year, a signal Americans may be planning their car purchases before prices increase. It’s worth noting that while the discourse around tariffs has unsurprisingly revolved around the potential impact on consumer prices, the policies could also have a significant effect on growth. Goldman Sachs this week upped its odds of a recession in the next year from 20% to 35%. Analysts said tariffs are expected to lead to a slowdown in business expansion and investments. To be fair, the Trump administration has admitted that tariff policies are going to cause some “ short-term pain .” But they still maintain that these levies are the way to bring back domestic manufacturing. Those against the plan argue that it could take years for businesses to bring operations back onshore and the impact on consumer spending may have long-term effects on the economy. Liberation Day comes after Republicans held on to two open Florida House seats in Tuesday’s special elections, although the party won with a much narrower margin than they had in November. This could present some challenges for the GOP come midterms. As Americans (and the world) await what Trump will say, several lawmakers on Capitol Hill are already playing defense. Former Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell has joined Democrat Sen. Tim Kaine’s efforts to block Trump’s tariffs on Canada. In a Truth Social post Wednesday, Trump called McConnell and other Republicans who have said they’ll back Kaine’s resolution “disloyal.” The president added that those supporting the effort to block his Canadian tariffs are “playing with the lives of the American people” as the levies are aimed at curbing fentanyl trafficking. Alongside McConnell are fellow Republicans Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Rand Paul. We’ll be watching for any additional Congressional efforts to block tariffs after Trump’s announcement today.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/whopping-640-million-xrp-increase-heres-the-significance/,"The XRP Ledger has experienced a significant surge in on-chain activity, with transactions reaching 647 million XRP in a single day on March 31. This level of transaction volume, totaling nearly $647 million, is the highest recorded in recent weeks. The sudden increase has fueled speculation about potential market movements, particularly given the token’s current position on the price chart. Price Movement and Technical Indicators The asset has shown signs of recovery, rebounding from the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to trade at approximately $2.18. This represents a 1.39% increase over the past 24 hours. The rebound followed a brief drop to $2.06 after the asset faced rejection near the $2 support level. Importantly, this recovery aligns with a long-term upward trendline, indicating that buyers continue to defend key price levels. Despite this positive momentum, the token remains within a descending triangle pattern, a formation that suggests potential resistance ahead. Currently, the price is testing critical resistance at the intersection of the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs. A decisive breakout above $2.30 could signal the end of the downtrend and pave the way for further upward movement. On-Chain Activity and Market Implications Large spikes in transaction volume often precede significant price fluctuations. The recent surge in XRP transfers suggests increased activity among large holders, institutional investors, or internal transactions within the XRP Ledger. While the specific reason for the increased transaction volume remains uncertain, the impact on price dynamics is evident. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If the token maintains its current momentum and successfully breaks out of the descending pattern, bullish targets could be set at $2.50 and $2.80. However, failure to surpass resistance could lead to a price retracement, with the asset potentially testing the $1.95-$2.00 range. The substantial rise in on-chain transactions, combined with technical price movements, indicates that the token could be approaching a period of heightened volatility. Traders and investors will be closely monitoring price action in the coming days to determine whether the asset can sustain its recovery or face renewed selling pressure.

At a House Financial Services Committee markup hearing on April 2, Maxine told lawmakers that Trump had used his role in office to run what she called “multiple crypto schemes,” and pointed to a fresh stablecoin launched by World Liberty Financial, a company backed by Trump’s family. Maxine said Trump’s team dropped the USD1 token in March, just months after his meme coin launch in January, and slammed the former president for pushing what she described as personal crypto ventures straight from the White House. She said: “Trump likely wants the entire government to use stablecoins from payments made by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to Social Security payments, to paying taxes. And which coin do you think Trump would replace the dollar with? His own, of course.” Waters slams Trump’s financial ties as committee debates stablecoin bill Maxine, who serves as the committee’s top Democrat, warned that a new stablecoin bill would only open the door for more of this kind of behavior. “With this stablecoin bill, this committee is setting an unacceptable and dangerous precedent, validating the president and his insiders’ efforts to write rules of the road that will enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else,” said Maxine. She linked the whole push to Trump’s inner circle and said it could change how the U.S. financial system works. The committee is reviewing amendments to the STABLE Act, along with new bills targeting illegal financial activity in crypto and attempting to block the creation of a U.S. central bank digital currency. The markup hearing is a required step before moving these proposals to a vote in the House of Representatives. Crypto industry faces stablecoin wars as Trump sits in the middle While the Trump controversy dominated the political side, crypto companies kept making moves. On the same day, Circle dropped its S-1 filing with plans to go public on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker CRCL. The company is aiming for a $4 billion to $5 billion valuation, which is lower than expected. Wyatt Lonergan from VanEck Ventures said this might be the start of a “stablecoin war,” with everyone from crypto firms to big banks trying to put out their own tokens. Wyatt said the market will want answers on where the industry is going and how stablecoins will actually be used at scale. Ripple added more fuel to the fight as Jack McDonald, the company’s SVP of Stablecoins, posted on X that the company’s new RLUSD token was now fully integrated into Ripple Payments, its international payments tool. Jack wrote: “As promised, RLUSD is now integrated into Ripple Payments — our cross-border payments solution with near-global coverage through 90+ payout markets, and instant connections to banks, FIs, payment service providers, exchanges and many more around the world.” Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of Binance, jumped in with a comment at Jack that said: “Stablecoin war, I mean healthy competition, just getting started,” with a laughing emoji.

Currently, Bitcoin is emerging from a ten-week downtrend that began on Jan. 20 when the price peaked at $110,000. A decisive close above the trendline might lead to continued bullish momentum for Bitcoin in the coming days. Bitcoin 1-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Bitcoin spot traders drive the rally Throughout March, spot traders on Binance and Coinbase held opposite stances in the market. Binance traders were aggressive BTC sellers, while Coinbase showed significant spot bids around the $80,000 price level. This dynamic contributed to the sideways price action during the majority of March. Fast forward to April, and spot traders on major exchanges have collectively turned bullish over the past three days. Binance, Coinbase spot buyers data. Source: Aggr.trade Data from aggr.trade highlights that Coinbase and Binance spot bids are driving positive action for BTC. The buying pressure is particularly high on Coinbase, with spot bids increasing as high as $7.98 million over the past few hours. Likewise, Dom, a crypto markets analyst, pointed out that Bitcoin’s current rally is possibly due to Binance sellers tapering off. The analyst said, “BTC has been able to breathe ever since the Binance selling tapered off. We are even seeing some spot buying from them for the first time in over a week.” Related: Bitcoin breaks $86K as US tariff 'Liberation Day' risks 11% BTC price dip Bitcoin flips key resistance at $84K to $85K From a technical perspective, Bitcoin has flipped an important resistance range between $84,000 and $85,000 into support. Likewise, the cryptocurrency has attained a bullish position above the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day exponentially moving averages (EMAs). Bitcoin 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView However, based on the external liquidity levels between $87,700 and $88,700, which formed the previous highs, BTC prices might struggle to break this range immediately. Consolidation between the green box (as illustrated in the chart) is likely a net positive, which might fuel BTC’s $90,000 retest for the first time since March 7. On the flip side, an immediate correction to the current support at $84,000 and $85,000 could possibly discourage bulls, and short sellers might take control of price action. Bullish invalidation could be on the cards if BTC price closes below $85,000 over the next few days. With markets bracing for further market volatility ahead of President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, Bitcoin price is expected to react further during today’s White House press conference at 4 pm Eastern Time.

U.S. President Donald Trump is set to reveal his “Liberation Day” tariff plan at 4 p.m. ET, potentially altering decades worth of trade relations with partners like China, Mexico, and Canada. The specifics of the levies remain unconfirmed, but proposed measures include delayed 25% tariffs and new duties on commodities such as lumber, copper, and microchips. The tariff uncertainty, as expected, is leaving markets in limbo. “Markets are already attempting to price in the event, but the exact details remain unknown,” Bitfinex analysts said in a statement sent to crypto.news. Read more: Crypto markets react to Trump’s Liberation Day According to Bitfinex, if Trump’s announcement lands within consensus expectations, that is tariffs in the 12–20% range and focused on a few countries, markets may react positively in the short term. In that case, risk assets like equities and Bitcoin ( BTC ) could stage a brief rally, especially if retaliation is delayed or absent. “This would validate the ‘buy the rumour, sell the news’ dynamic that’s common during large, well-telegraphed macro events,” the analysts said. “Bitcoin, which has already corrected significantly from its highs, may also benefit from this reduced uncertainty.” However, if the tariffs exceed expectations and are broad-based or accompanied by aggressive rhetoric, Bitfinex expects renewed de-risking. “We could see a continuation of the downtrend that’s played out since February,” analysts warned. “Bitcoin remains heavily correlated to macro and equity indices and may follow equities lower.” Key market signals to monitor The analysts highlighted several indicators to watch following the announcement: Bitcoin’s current trading range of $78,000–$88,000; spot ETF outflows as a gauge of institutional confidence; and equity performance, particularly in tech and consumer sectors. Altcoins may underperform, leading to a spike in Bitcoin dominance. “Today’s announcement is one of the most important catalysts of Q2,” Bitfinex noted. “Volatility is expected to remain elevated for the next 24–48 hours.” You might also like: ‘Liberation Day’ will be an ‘atomic bomb’ for crypto: pro",News|Bitcoin|Bitfinex|crypto|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-02 19:28:23
42815302,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145627,1743622206,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Move: Alabama Greenlights State Bitcoin Investment in Bold Crypto Embrace,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/alabama-bitcoin-crypto-investment/,"In a potentially game-changing move for state finances and the broader cryptocurrency landscape, Alabama has officially given the nod to Bitcoin and digital assets. Yes, you read that right! The state has passed a bill allowing its treasurer to strategically invest certain public funds into the exciting world of cryptocurrencies, including the king of crypto itself, Bitcoin. This isn’t just another headline; it’s a significant leap towards mainstream adoption and could set a precedent for other states to follow. Let’s dive into what this revolutionary development means for Alabama and the future of state-level cryptocurrency investments. Why is Alabama Exploring State Crypto Investment Now? So, what’s driving Alabama’s decision to venture into the somewhat uncharted territory of state crypto investment ? It boils down to a few key factors, all pointing towards a more diversified and potentially more lucrative investment strategy for the state’s coffers. Here’s a breakdown: Diversification Beyond Traditional Assets: For years, state treasuries have primarily relied on traditional investment avenues like bonds, stocks, and real estate. However, in today’s rapidly evolving financial landscape, diversification is key. Adding digital assets like Bitcoin to the mix can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk by introducing assets with low correlation to traditional markets. Seeking Higher Returns: With interest rates often hovering at low levels, the search for yield is constant. Cryptocurrency investment , while inherently volatile, offers the potential for significantly higher returns compared to many traditional fixed-income investments. Alabama might be looking to capitalize on the growth potential of the crypto market to boost state revenue. Future-Proofing State Finances: The world is becoming increasingly digital, and digital assets are playing a larger role in the global economy. By embracing cryptocurrencies, Alabama could be positioning itself at the forefront of financial innovation and preparing its economy for the future. It’s about being proactive and not being left behind as the financial world evolves. Responding to Public Demand and Technological Advancements: There’s a growing public interest in and acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the underlying technology, blockchain, is rapidly advancing and finding applications across various sectors. Alabama’s move could be seen as a recognition of these trends and a step towards embracing technological progress. Essentially, Alabama is taking a bold step to modernize its investment strategy, seeking to enhance returns and diversify its portfolio in a world increasingly influenced by digital technologies. But what exactly are the potential upsides? Unpacking the Potential Benefits of Alabama’s Bitcoin Investment The decision to allow Alabama Bitcoin investment is not taken lightly, and it’s likely underpinned by the anticipation of several significant benefits. Let’s explore some of the potential advantages for the state: Enhanced State Revenue: If cryptocurrency investment performs well, it could translate directly into increased revenue for the state. This additional income could be used to fund crucial public services like education, infrastructure, and healthcare, ultimately benefiting Alabama residents. Attracting Tech Innovation and Talent: Being a crypto-friendly state can send a powerful message to the technology and innovation sectors. It can attract blockchain companies, crypto startups, and talented professionals to Alabama, boosting the state’s economy and creating new job opportunities. A Hedge Against Inflation (Potentially): Bitcoin, in particular, is often touted as a potential hedge against inflation due to its limited supply. While this is still a debated topic, some argue that allocating a portion of state funds to Bitcoin could offer a layer of protection against inflationary pressures on traditional currencies. Demonstrating Forward-Thinking Governance: By embracing digital assets , Alabama is projecting an image of a state that is progressive, adaptable, and willing to explore new frontiers in finance. This can enhance the state’s reputation and attract investment from both traditional and new economy sectors. Setting a Precedent for Other States: Alabama’s move could inspire other states to consider similar legislation. If successful, it could pave the way for wider adoption of Bitcoin for states and cryptocurrencies within public investment portfolios across the nation. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge that venturing into cryptocurrency legislation and investment is not without its challenges. What hurdles might Alabama face on this journey? Navigating the Challenges of State-Level Crypto Investments While the potential benefits of Alabama Bitcoin investment are enticing, it’s equally important to consider the challenges and risks associated with investing public funds in such a volatile and nascent asset class. Here are some key hurdles Alabama will need to navigate: Challenge Description Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its extreme price swings. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can experience significant drops in value in short periods, potentially leading to losses for the state’s investment portfolio. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in the United States. Changes in federal or state regulations could impact the legality, taxation, and operational aspects of holding and managing digital assets . Security and Custody Risks: Securing and storing cryptocurrencies is a complex undertaking. State treasuries will need to implement robust security measures to protect against hacking, theft, and loss of funds. Choosing reputable and secure custody solutions is paramount. Lack of Expertise and Infrastructure: Managing cryptocurrency investment requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure that state treasuries may currently lack. Building internal expertise or partnering with external specialists will be essential. Public Perception and Skepticism: There is still a degree of public skepticism and misunderstanding surrounding cryptocurrencies. Alabama will need to effectively communicate the rationale behind its investment strategy and address public concerns to maintain transparency and trust. Overcoming these challenges will require careful planning, robust risk management strategies, and a commitment to education and transparency. How does Alabama’s approach compare to what other states or entities are doing in the crypto space? Alabama’s Move in the Context of Global Crypto Adoption Alabama is not entirely alone in exploring the possibilities of state crypto investment , although it is certainly among the early pioneers in the US. Globally, and even within the United States, there’s a growing trend of governments and institutions showing interest in or even adopting cryptocurrencies in various capacities. Let’s look at some examples: Miami, Florida: Mayor Francis Suarez has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin and has taken steps to make Miami a crypto hub. While Miami is a city, not a state, its initiatives, such as exploring paying city employees in Bitcoin and holding Bitcoin on the city’s balance sheet, demonstrate a similar forward-thinking approach. Colorado: Colorado has been accepting cryptocurrency for tax payments since 2022, showcasing a practical application of digital assets at the state level. El Salvador: On a national level, El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. While this move has been controversial, it highlights the potential for governments to embrace cryptocurrencies in significant ways. Switzerland and Zug: The Swiss canton of Zug has become known as “Crypto Valley” due to its crypto-friendly regulations and ecosystem. While not direct state investment, it demonstrates how regions can foster crypto innovation and attract businesses. Alabama’s move aligns with this broader trend of exploring the potential of cryptocurrencies. It’s a signal that digital assets are moving beyond the fringes and entering the realm of mainstream finance and even public investment strategies. What are the practical next steps for Alabama to make this a success? Actionable Insights: Charting the Course for Alabama’s Crypto Investment Strategy For Alabama to successfully navigate this new frontier of state crypto investment and maximize its potential benefits while mitigating risks, several key steps are crucial: Develop a Comprehensive Investment Policy: Alabama needs to establish clear guidelines and policies governing its cryptocurrency investment activities. This policy should address risk tolerance, asset allocation, due diligence processes, security protocols, and compliance requirements. Establish Robust Risk Management Frameworks: Given the volatility of the crypto market, a strong risk management framework is essential. This should include strategies for monitoring market risks, managing custody risks, and mitigating potential losses. Invest in Education and Expertise: State treasury staff need to be educated on the intricacies of cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and digital asset management. Investing in training and potentially hiring or consulting with crypto experts will be vital. Choose Secure Custody Solutions: Selecting reputable and secure custodians for storing and managing digital assets is paramount. Thorough due diligence should be conducted on potential custody providers to ensure the safety of state funds. Prioritize Transparency and Communication: Open and transparent communication with the public about the state’s cryptocurrency investment strategy is crucial for building trust and managing expectations. Regular reporting on performance and risk management efforts should be implemented. Start with a Measured Approach: It’s prudent for Alabama to begin with a relatively small allocation to digital assets and gradually increase exposure as they gain experience and confidence in managing this new asset class. By taking these proactive steps, Alabama can position itself to be a leader in state-level cryptocurrency legislation and investment, potentially reaping significant rewards while managing risks responsibly. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Future of Finance Alabama’s decision to allow state Bitcoin investment is more than just a minor policy change; it’s a revolutionary signal of the growing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system. It reflects a bold vision for the future of state finances, one that embraces innovation and seeks to capitalize on the potential of digital assets . While challenges undoubtedly lie ahead, Alabama’s proactive approach could serve as a catalyst for other states to explore similar strategies, potentially ushering in a new era of diversified and digitally-savvy public investment. The world will be watching closely to see how this bold experiment unfolds and the precedent it sets for the future of Bitcoin for states .

To support trading of iShares Digital Assets ETPs. However, the asset manager will not be allowed to: Onboarding new retail customers for crypto-related services. Operating automated crypto-to-fiat exchange services without explicit regulatory approval. A New Era for Crypto in the UK BlackRock joins firms like Coinbase, which also received FCA registration earlier this year, with a broader UK crypto regulatory framework on the horizon that could further shape how traditional financial institutions interact with digital assets.

Even the biggest L2 chains are not burning any ETH, adding to the network’s inflation. L2 chains are still running on Ether (ETH) virtually for free. The extremely low gas price conditions and no demand for block fees means the daily burn of ETH has slowed down even more. The outflow of revenues for Ethereum is just one of the factors affecting the network. DeFi is also shifting toward L2 and other chains, as Ethereum now carries just 51.3% of all value locked, down from over 53% in the past week. Ethereum carried over 60% of TVL in 2024, starting a trend of outflows from DeFi and DEX activity. A handful of L2 have indeed managed to take some of the traffic off Ethereum, but have left the L1 in a weakened state, with all metrics going down in the first quarter of 2024. Ethereum gains even smaller rent payments from L2 During peak times in 2024, L2 chains led to the burn of 261 ETH per day, adding to the extremely low network inflation. In 2025, a total of around 602 ETH gets burned every day, but the blob fee contract is not among the leading gas burners. Blob fees now burn 17.91 ETH in a whole week, as L2s does their best to avoid paying blob fees. Even on busy days, L2 protocols pay only a few thousand dollars to the Ethereum L1, with fees often going down to zero. L2 paid near zero fees to Ethereum in the past few weeks. | Source: GrowThePie Currently, the busiest network is still Base, with the biggest number of on-chain users and activity. The chain still pays $6.41K on a busy day, with near-zero payments in the past week. Base has more than $109K in daily revenues, most of it retained for the chain’s own validators and app producers. Even Arbitrum paid less than $400 per day for all of its activity, despite being one of the top L2s with the biggest DeFi sector. The low rent from L2 coincides with an ongoing period of low gas fees for Ethereum. Currently, fees are back down at $0.02 for basic transactions, though rising to $0.48 for swaps. Ethereum is still widely used for stablecoins, which have flowed out of Arbitrum. Ethereum is still used to transfer USDT directly, to avoid additional bridging fees. Are L2 cannibalizing Ethereum? The initial launch of L2 chains led to significant token burns, with up to 10K ETH destroyed per day. The early stage of L2 also led to airdrop point farming, which boosted volumes temporarily. L2 did manage to achieve cheap transactions, taking some of the volume off Ethereum. However, the chains continued to extract value from end users while paying back as little as possible to Ethereum. Additionally, years after introducing L2 scaling, most chains are still relatively centralized. Only Arbitrum and Optimism have a Stage 1 status with partially decentralized transaction approval. All other chains rely on a centralized transaction sequencer, which poses risks for attacks or censorship. L2 chains are also rarely cross-compatible and require a complex and risky ecosystem of bridging. Most L2 claim they are Ethereum maximalists, but only tap the available liquidity while running as an independent business chain. Most L2 also have varying use cases, with some specializing in specific forms of DeFi. For now, L2 chains are extremely fragmented and often create cultures and communities widely diverging from the ideas of Ethereum. Most of the activity is still concentrated within the top 5 L2 chains, while there is a total of 152 new networks that have the option to post on the Ethereum chain. The different types of L2 include optimistic rollups, ZK rollups, Validium, Optimum chains and legacy chains with no proofs such as Polygon. Legacy chains such as ImmutableX and Polygon are key to the Web3 ecosystem, while newer chains have negligible activity and in some cases, only carry assets worth less than $1,000. The launch of new L2 was often tied to fundraising and token sales, but the past few years showed that demand for those types of chains is still extremely limited.

Leon pointed out that institutional investors and financial advisors invested heavily in Bitcoin ETFs in the first quarter of 2025. Even though Bitcoin price was struggling, falling by 13%, the investment funds raked in over $1 billion in inflows. However, retail traders lost interest due to volatility and broader market challenges. Big investors remained confident, focusing on long-term momentum, especially with the President Trump administration supporting Bitcoin . Leon believes Bitcoin ETFs could see over $3 billion in inflows in the second quarter of 2025. The Role of Arbitrage in ETF Inflows The large inflows into Bitcoin ETFs were not just from investors looking to buy Bitcoin at a low price. A big portion of it came from a trading strategy called arbitrage strategies . In this strategy, institutions buy Bitcoin ETFs while still betting against Bitcoin’s futures prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). This allows investors to earn returns without worrying about Bitcoin’s price swings. This trading strategy was very profitable in late 2024, and even in early 2025, it remained better than the risk-free investment. However, the return has now dropped to around 5%, which could reduce the amount of money flowing into ETFs through arbitrage. Still, many experts think Bitcoin ETF adoption is just getting started. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, believes that as more big investors get comfortable with Bitcoin, Bitcoin ETFs may see more inflows throughout the year. Experts Believe Institutional Adoption Will Grow While institutions have started investing in Bitcoin ETFs, their current allocations are still small compared to their overall ETF investments. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently noted that most Bitcoin ETF investments still come from retail investors. However, Fink believes that may change soon as the U.S. government and regulators take a more favorable stance on Bitcoin. At a recent ETF conference in Las Vegas, a survey found that 57% of financial advisors plan to increase their allocations to crypto ETFs this year. Bitcoin as a Safe Haven in an Uncertain Economy Another factor that could drive Bitcoin ETF inflows in Q2 2025 is economic uncertainty. When fears about a possible recession increase, Bitcoin could become more attractive as “digital gold.” David Siemer, CEO of Wave Digital Assets, believes big investors will keep putting money into Bitcoin this year. He said some short-term traders might sell if prices stay low, but long-term investors will continue buying. He also pointed out that institutions’ interests are growing, which could increase demand for Bitcoin ETFs in the coming months.

By actively participating in policy discussions and advocating for sensible regulations, the Sei Development Foundation hopes to contribute to a U.S. regulatory framework that supports the long-term growth and success of the crypto industry. This proactive approach to crypto policy is essential for unlocking the full potential of decentralized technologies. Unlocking Institutional Adoption of Crypto Institutional adoption is often seen as the next major catalyst for the widespread growth of the crypto market. The Sei Development Foundation understands this and has made it a key priority. But what exactly does institutional adoption mean, and how will the foundation facilitate it? What is Institutional Adoption? Institutional adoption refers to the integration of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology into the operations and investment strategies of large financial institutions, corporations, and other organizations. This includes: Investment in Crypto Assets: Institutions allocating capital to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, either directly or through investment products. Integration of Blockchain Technology: Corporations utilizing blockchain for various applications, such as supply chain management, payments, and data security.

Addressing Regulatory Concerns: Working to clarify regulatory uncertainties and advocate for sensible regulations that encourage institutional adoption while ensuring compliance and risk management. By actively working on these fronts, the Sei Development Foundation aims to pave the way for greater institutional adoption , unlocking new levels of growth and maturity for the crypto market. Why a Nonprofit Structure for Crypto? The decision to establish the Sei Development Foundation as a nonprofit organization is a strategic one, reflecting a commitment to the broader crypto ecosystem and its long-term sustainability. But what are the advantages of a nonprofit structure in this context? Mission-Driven Focus: A nonprofit structure prioritizes mission over profit. The foundation’s primary focus is on supporting crypto development , advancing crypto policy , and driving institutional adoption , rather than generating profits for shareholders. This aligns with the ethos of the decentralized crypto movement. Attracting Donations and Funding: Nonprofit status can make it easier to attract donations and funding from individuals, corporations, and other foundations who share the mission. This can provide a more sustainable and diverse funding base for the foundation’s initiatives. Enhanced Credibility and Trust: Operating as a nonprofit can enhance the foundation’s credibility and trustworthiness, particularly when engaging with policymakers and institutions. It signals a commitment to public benefit and long-term impact. Tax Advantages: Nonprofit organizations often benefit from certain tax exemptions, which can allow them to allocate more resources directly to their mission-related activities. By choosing the nonprofit route, the Sei Development Foundation signals its long-term commitment to the crypto space and its dedication to serving the broader community. This structure allows it to operate with a clear mission focus, attract diverse funding, and build trust and credibility – all crucial factors for achieving its ambitious goals. A Bold Step Forward for Crypto The launch of the Sei Development Foundation is more than just another industry development; it’s a significant step forward for the entire crypto ecosystem. By focusing on crypto development , proactive crypto policy engagement, and driving institutional adoption , the foundation is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of decentralized technology.

On March 31st, the firm filed to establish a trust entity in Delaware under filing number 10148820, as confirmed by public records on the state’s official website . This development serves as a preliminary measure before a formal application is submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If approved, the VanEck BNB ETF would become the first US-based ETF to track the price of Binance Coin, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. While BNB-related products, such as the 21Shares Binance BNB ETP, are available in international markets, no similar ETF exists in the US. VanEck previously introduced spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in January and July 2024, respectively, after obtaining SEC approval. It also registered standalone ETFs for Solana and Avalanche in Delaware. Meanwhile, the latest filing did not immediately impact BNB’s market performance. In fact, the cryptocurrency is trading at approximately $605, with a 1.36% decline in the past 24 hours and a 4.3% drop over the past week. BNB witnessed modest gains after President Donald Trump’s financial venture, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), announced the launch of USD1, a USD-backed stablecoin built on the BNB Chain, last week. It briefly surged to about $620 on March 25th, followed by another uptrend above $640 three days later before declining again.

42815735,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/?p=41850,1743623227,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png,"Bill Miller IV Reveals Firm’s Investment in GME, Touts Bitcoin Treasury Strategy",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/bitcoin-for-corporations/bill-miller-iv-reveals-firms-investment-in-gme-touts-bitcoin-treasury-strategy,"Bitcoin Magazine Bill Miller IV Reveals Firm’s Investment in GME, Touts Bitcoin Treasury Strategy In a recent interview , Bill Miller IV outlined his firm’s investment approach in a rapidly shifting macro environment, spotlighting GameStop as a new position and reiterating strong conviction in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) as the blueprint for Bitcoin treasury strategy. For Miller, corporate Bitcoin strategy is more than a hedge—it’s a signal of innovation, adaptability, and capital efficiency. Strategy: Solving Corporate Finance Problems with Bitcoin Miller praised Strategy’s transformation from software company to capital allocator focused on Bitcoin. He emphasized that the company isn’t just investing in Bitcoin—it’s solving traditional corporate finance challenges through Bitcoin-backed innovation. Strategy continues to create access to Bitcoin across the capital stack, offering various instruments with different risk profiles—from equity to convertible notes. While some view the firm’s market premium as excessive, Miller sees it as deserved. He framed Strategy’s persistent accumulation of Bitcoin through share issuance as an intelligent response to monetary debasement and a model that others have yet to replicate effectively. He also noted that the rebrand from MicroStrategy to Strategy marked a shift not just in name, but in purpose—cementing the company’s identity as a Bitcoin development company. Not Every Company Can Be Strategy—But Many Can Start According to Miller, there’s a growing list of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets—more than 70 by his count—but his firm only invests in a select few. He emphasized that his team evaluates each one on its own merits, with a value-oriented lens and a clear focus on the core business. While not every company can become a Bitcoin development company like Strategy, Miller believes many can and should adopt Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. He described Bitcoin as a way for companies to preserve the purchasing power of their excess capital, especially in light of monetary policies designed to erode fiat value over time. He emphasized that companies facing secular challenges—such as declining core businesses or structural industry shifts—may find in Bitcoin a meaningful way to preserve relevance and shareholder value. New Position: GameStop Signals Memetic and Strategic Potential Miller confirmed a new starter position in GameStop, explaining that the decision was driven by the company’s recent capital raise and signs that it may be exploring a Bitcoin strategy. Though the position is small, it reflects his firm’s broader interest in companies that show signs of innovation and unorthodox capital allocation. He highlighted Ryan Cohen’s role at GameStop as a potentially powerful catalyst, pointing to Cohen’s cultural influence and willingness to think outside traditional finance norms. The ability to shape narratives, Miller suggested, is increasingly important in a world where memetics and capital markets are intertwined. He sees potential for GameStop to follow a path similar to Metaplanet or Strategy—retail businesses that have embraced Bitcoin in response to broader existential challenges. Bitcoin as the Rational Response to Monetary Debasement Miller made the case for Bitcoin adoption as a response to ongoing monetary debasement. He explained that if policymakers openly target 2% annual inflation—or more—then it is rational for companies and individuals to move an equivalent portion of their fiat-denominated capital into Bitcoin. He stressed that this isn’t a speculative move but a fundamental capital preservation strategy. The key, he noted, is holding Bitcoin over the long term and recognizing it as a way to transfer value into the future with a lower risk of purchasing power erosion. Miller also noted that more companies are waking up to this logic, especially as regulatory clarity improves. He expects adoption to continue accelerating and sees the current period as a pivotal moment for CFOs and corporate treasurers to take action. A Call to Forward-Thinking Financial Leaders For Miller, Bitcoin isn’t a temporary trade—it’s a long-term solution to structural problems in fiat finance. He believes corporate leaders who ignore this trend risk falling behind. The momentum, he says, is clear: more public companies are entering the space, and early adopters are beginning to outperform. Strategy remains the benchmark. GameStop, Metaplanet, and others may follow. But the broader takeaway is this: in a competitive, inflationary world, companies that fail to evolve risk irrelevance. Bitcoin offers a path forward—one rooted in long-term thinking and strategic capital deployment. Disclaimer: This content was written on behalf of Bitcoin For Corporations .

42815906,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145636,1743623434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Jupiter Verify: Secure Solana Tokens & Elevate Crypto Trust,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/jupiter-verify-solana-token-trust/,"In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance (DeFi), navigating the ocean of tokens can feel like traversing uncharted waters. How do you know which tokens are trustworthy and which might be… well, less so? If you’re a user of Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), especially Jupiter, you’re in for some fantastic news! Jupiter has just launched Jupiter Verify , a groundbreaking system designed to inject a hefty dose of crypto trust into the Solana ecosystem. Let’s dive into how this exciting development is set to change the game. What is Jupiter Verify and Why Does Token Verification Matter? Jupiter, a leading DEX on Solana, has officially announced the arrival of Jupiter Verify through their X account. This isn’t just another feature; it’s a comprehensive token verification system built to address a critical need in the DeFi space: user confidence. In essence, Jupiter Verify is all about making it easier for you to distinguish between credible Solana tokens and those that might raise a red flag. But why is this so important? Think about it. The beauty of DeFi lies in its open and permissionless nature. Anyone can launch a token, which is incredible for innovation. However, this also opens the door to potential risks. Without proper vetting, users can fall prey to scams, rug pulls, or simply projects that lack legitimacy. This is where token verification steps in, acting as a beacon of safety and transparency. Jupiter Verify aims to solve this problem head-on by providing clear signals about the credibility of tokens listed on their DEX. This isn’t about Jupiter becoming a gatekeeper, but rather about empowering users with the information they need to make informed decisions. It’s about fostering a safer and more reliable trading environment on Solana. Decoding the Tiers: How Jupiter Verify Enhances DEX Security Jupiter Verify isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. It’s a tiered system, offering varying levels of assurance based on different verification methods. Let’s break down each tier to understand how they contribute to enhanced DEX security and user trust: Blue Chip Verification: The Gold Standard Imagine the ‘blue checkmark’ of the crypto world, but with even more substance. Blue Chip verification is reserved for established and reputable projects on Solana. Think of tokens from well-known protocols, projects with significant community backing, and a proven track record. This tier signifies a high level of trust and is likely to include projects that have demonstrated longevity and reliability. Community Assisted Verification: Power to the People This is where the community gets directly involved in shaping the verification landscape. Community Assisted verification leverages the collective wisdom of the Jupiter and Solana ecosystems. Through a transparent and collaborative process, community members can contribute to the evaluation of tokens, highlighting projects they believe are legitimate and valuable. This approach harnesses the power of decentralized vetting, making verification more robust and inclusive. Social ID Verification: Connecting Real Identities In a space often characterized by pseudonymity, Social ID Verification introduces an element of real-world accountability. Projects undergoing this level of verification link their token to verified social media identities and potentially other forms of public identification. This doesn’t necessarily guarantee project success, but it adds a layer of transparency and reduces the anonymity that can sometimes shield malicious actors. It’s about building bridges between the on-chain world and real-world identities to enhance DEX security . C.A.T. Report (Cautionary Assessment & Transparency): Transparency First The C.A.T. Report tier is all about transparency and providing users with crucial information, even if a token doesn’t fit neatly into the other verification categories. This report will likely highlight key risk factors, potential concerns, and important details about a token’s background and operations. It’s about equipping users with a ‘buyer beware’ approach, but with the necessary information to make informed decisions. Think of it as a detailed risk assessment, empowering users to navigate the token landscape with their eyes wide open. Benefits of Jupiter Verify: A Win-Win for Solana? The introduction of Jupiter Verify is poised to bring a wave of positive changes to the Solana ecosystem. Let’s explore some key benefits: Increased User Trust and Confidence: At its core, Jupiter Verify is about building trust. By providing clear verification tiers, users can more easily identify credible tokens, leading to increased confidence in the Solana DeFi space as a whole. This is crucial for attracting new users and fostering wider adoption. Reduced Risk of Scams and Rug Pulls: While no system is foolproof, Jupiter Verify significantly raises the bar for nefarious actors. The verification process makes it harder for scam tokens to gain traction and provides users with signals to avoid potentially risky projects. This contributes directly to improved DEX security . Support for Legitimate Projects: Jupiter Verify isn’t just about weeding out bad actors; it’s also about highlighting and supporting legitimate projects. Verification badges can serve as a mark of quality, attracting more users and investors to projects that have undergone scrutiny and met certain standards. Enhanced Transparency and Accountability: The system promotes transparency through its tiered approach and the inclusion of community and social ID verification. The C.A.T. Report further emphasizes transparency by providing detailed information about tokens, empowering users with knowledge. Community Empowerment: The Community Assisted Verification tier directly involves the community in the verification process. This decentralized approach leverages the collective intelligence of the Solana ecosystem, making the verification process more robust and aligned with community values. Navigating the Challenges: Is Token Verification a Silver Bullet? While Jupiter Verify is a significant step forward, it’s important to acknowledge that no system is without its challenges. Token verification is not a silver bullet that will eliminate all risks in DeFi. Here are some potential challenges to consider: The Evolving Nature of Scams: Scammers are constantly adapting their tactics. Verification systems need to be dynamic and continuously evolve to stay ahead of sophisticated scams and rug pull attempts. Subjectivity in Community Verification: While community involvement is a strength, it can also introduce subjectivity. Ensuring fairness, preventing manipulation, and establishing clear guidelines for community-based verification will be crucial. Resource Intensity of Verification: Implementing and maintaining a comprehensive verification system requires resources. Jupiter will need to dedicate ongoing effort to ensure the system remains effective and up-to-date. False Sense of Security: It’s crucial to avoid creating a false sense of security. Verification is a valuable tool, but users must still conduct their own due diligence and understand the risks involved in DeFi. Jupiter Verify should be seen as an aid to informed decision-making, not a guarantee of safety. Jupiter Verify in Action: Real-World Examples (Hypothetical) Let’s imagine how Jupiter Verify might play out in practice: Scenario Jupiter Verify Tier User Action Trading a well-established Solana token like $SOL or $RAY. Blue Chip Verification Trade with high confidence, knowing the project is well-vetted. Exploring a promising new community token with active social channels. Community Assisted Verification Review community feedback and DYOR (Do Your Own Research) while considering the positive community signals. Considering a token from a project with publicly known developers. Social ID Verification Evaluate the developers’ reputation and project details alongside the added transparency of social ID. Encountering a newer, less-known token with a C.A.T. Report. C.A.T. Report Carefully review the C.A.T. Report, understand the highlighted risks, and proceed with caution if interested. These are just hypothetical examples, but they illustrate how Jupiter Verify can provide users with a framework for assessing token credibility and making more informed trading decisions on the Solana DEX. Actionable Insights: How to Leverage Jupiter Verify So, how can you, as a Solana user, make the most of Jupiter Verify ? Familiarize Yourself with the Tiers: Understand what each verification tier signifies and what level of assurance it provides. Look for Verification Badges: When browsing tokens on Jupiter, pay attention to the verification badges associated with each token. Utilize Community Resources: Engage with the Jupiter and Solana communities to gather insights on Community Assisted Verified tokens. Review C.A.T. Reports: If a token has a C.A.T. Report, take the time to read it carefully and understand the potential risks. Combine Verification with Your Own Research: Jupiter Verify is a valuable tool, but it shouldn’t replace your own due diligence. Always conduct thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency. Conclusion: A Giant Leap for Crypto Trust on Solana Jupiter’s launch of Jupiter Verify marks a significant step forward in enhancing crypto trust and DEX security within the Solana ecosystem. By introducing a tiered verification system, Jupiter is empowering users with the tools and information they need to navigate the token landscape with greater confidence. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of Jupiter Verify – increased user trust, reduced risk, and support for legitimate projects – are undeniable. This initiative not only benefits Jupiter users but also contributes to the overall maturation and credibility of the Solana DeFi space. It’s a positive development that signals a growing commitment to user safety and transparency in the ever-evolving world of decentralized finance. Trust is paramount in crypto, and Jupiter Verify is a powerful tool in building and reinforcing that trust.

In a new interview on the Bankless YouTube channel, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev says that crypto asset tokenization will boost the US stock market the same way stablecoins are helping establish the dominance of the US dollar. “Tokenization of securities, which we’re very excited about, allows you to have ownership in companies… Stablecoins are viewed rightly as an area that could increase demand among individuals overseas as governments become prone to diversifying away from holding treasuries. So in the same way that stablecoin legislation can kind of push forward US dollar dominance, I think tokenized securities can really push forward US company dominance in the global market.” Tenev notes that by tokenzing securities on global blockchains, investors outside the US will be able to invest in American securities in a matter of clicks – rather than go through the cumbersome process of traditional banks and trading platforms. “It’s very difficult to invest in a US company if you’re overseas, and so in the same way that stablecoins made it easy to get dollars, tokenized securities will [grant] easy access to US companies, so we’re excited about that. I think that’s good for the companies [and] good for people outside the US because they’ll have access to these effective wealth building tools, which is another way to diversify if they have [a] loss of purchasing power due to local currencies that are devaluing sharply. So I think that’s exciting, and I think it’s also good for entrepreneurs and capital formation. If you make it easier to raise capital in the US by tapping into a global crypto market, you get a lot more interesting companies.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

To read full editions, subscribe . We already revisited the Dan Tapiero quote about an imminent “crypto IPO, M&A, SPAC boom.” And I wrote about the possible “feeding frenzy” coming on the M&A side. Then late yesterday, Circle, the issuer of stablecoin USDC, laid out plans for an IPO . “The confluence of traditional financial infrastructure and blockchain innovation, as exemplified by companies like Circle, presents compelling opportunities for institutional investors,” Offchain Labs’ Ira Auerbach said in a statement. It seems optimism around stablecoin growth (and the potential for legislation) would signal high interest in Circle. Not to mention the potential for the broader tokenization segment . But it’s worth noting that while Circle’s 2024 revenue was $1.7 billion, it paid $908 million in distribution costs to Coinbase. Circle’s net income for last year was $156 million. Its competitor Tether, meanwhile, reported a profit of $13 billion in 2024. Looking at another publicly-traded crypto company: Coinbase’s 2024 net income was $2.6 billion (on $6.6 billion in revenue). Meaning Circle’s net profit margin was nearly five times less than Coinbase’s, Dom Kwok pointed out on X. Kwok, a former analyst at Blackstone and Goldman Sachs, added: “If the Fed lowers rates later this year (as expected), Circle’s metrics will only weaken further.” After all, the S-1 notes that 99% of Circle’s revenues come from reserve interest income, which is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. Circle explains in the filing that the emergence of yield-bearing digital assets “represents an additional source of competition, particularly in light of the current high interest rate environment.” Hence, probably, why Circle acquired tokenized money market fund issuer Hashnote to help market participants more easily move between cash and yield . There will be plenty to monitor here as to when we could see Circle stock on the New York Stock Exchange, and at what valuation . Stay tuned. Get the news in your inbox.

DOGE dropped nearly 11% to $0.17, its lowest since early November, while ADA fell 8% to $0.744, though it remains up 7% for the month. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending platform, is gaining significant attention. MUTM tokens are available during their Phase 4 presale which are priced at $0.025. A strong investor backing emerged through the acquisition of more than 7700 buyers who have raised $6 million during the presale process. Investors participating in Mutuum Finance Phase 4 token purchase earn 140% profit at $0.06 at exchange launch. MUTM could hit $1 soon after launch. Dogecoin and Cardano Face Market Pressure, But ADA Holds Long-Term Potential Dogecoin (DOGE) has struggled in recent weeks, dropping 11% to $0.17, its lowest since early November, as speculative momentum weakens. While DOGE still enjoys strong community backing, its price remains highly dependent on market hype. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) has also faced a recent downturn, slipping 8% to $0.744. However, unlike DOGE, ADA has shown resilience, maintaining a 7% gain for the month. Analysts predict that ADA could climb as high as $3.80 in 2025, fueled by ongoing network developments and institutional interest, making it a more promising long-term investment compared to the meme-driven volatility of DOGE. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates in Phase 4 The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale is in progress while the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of hyper-inflated meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 4 of the presale has surpassed $6 million total shares and attracted more than 7700 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.025 during Phase 4 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Investors who bought in Phase 4 obtained 140% growth from their investment once MUTM launches. The current cost of MUTM attracts investors to buy during Phase 5 since it will undergo another pricing increase to 0.03. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders receive dependable income while borrowers get secure financing opportunities through this system. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Security takes precedence in this ecosystem through combination with open-source smart contracts along with third-party audits to establish complete transparency. The MUTM token holders benefit from both price growth potential and earn passive income while receiving investments through a strategic buyback system that strengthens long-term token value. Mutuum Finance aims to increase accessibility and liquidity by implementing multi-chain expansion which will include EVM and non-EVM blockchain support. Dogecoin and Cardano may be struggling, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly rising as a powerhouse in decentralized lending. With over $6 million raised and more than 7700 investors onboard, its Phase 4 presale at $0.025 presents a rare opportunity before the price jumps to $0.03 in Phase 5. Investors stand to gain 140% ROI at launch, with analysts eyeing a $1 target post-listing. As DeFi continues to grow, now is the time to secure MUTM tokens and be part of the next big financial shift.

By 2028, SPX may achieve a peak price of $2.19 and an average trading price of $2.06. In 2031, the target price for SPX is between $3.29 and $3.57, with an average price of $3.43. SPX6900 (SPX) functions primarily on the Ethereum network. The token was created as a meme to entertain wider audiences. It has no real connection with stocks, equities, or securities. SPX6900 generates interest through spot trading, market speculation, or perpetual and leveraged trading, the latter are not recommended for non-professionals because of their high risk. Early users confess to its credibility and remarkable price performance; however, the meme token still holds the interest of many investors. Starting as a non-serious venture, the SPX6900 coin established itself as one of the most high-ranking coins of the year 2024. It was initiated as a useless token but ultimately ended up earning profits in the millions. For example, over a month, SPX earned up to 9000% of return following its ascent through September 2024.

Specifically, he warned that ETH could still drop to as low as $1,400 before it finds a bottom. Ethereum May Still Drop To As Low As $1,400 In a TradingView post, Kledji stated that Ethereum may drop to $1,400, providing a bearish outlook for the altcoin, which has underperformed other top cryptocurrencies. The analyst noted that ETH lost nearly 12% of its value within just three days after breaking out of its recent pattern last Friday. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Says Bears Will Continue To Dominate Ethereum Price, Here’s For How Long He further mentioned that Ethereum’s movement and the rest of the crypto market are closely tied to Bitcoin. As such, this ETH crash is likely to happen, seeing as the flagship crypto has dropped to $81,300 and is already showing signs of further decline. Klejdi highlighted in his accompanying chart that ETH will likely consolidate near its current level before continuing to move lower. However, the chart showed that the move to this $1,400 target will likely happen this month. In the meantime, the analyst believes it would be wise to wait for Ethereum’s price to form another bearish pattern before entering a trade. He again reaffirmed that there is a strong possibility that ETH may extend its drop to $1,400. Ethereum whales are already capitulating ahead of this projected price crash. Onchain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed an ETH OG that has sold off all its holdings. This investor bought 5,0001 ETH while trading at $277 in 2017 and didn’t sell when the altcoin hit its ATH during the last bull run. The whale started selling last month, possibly giving up on Ethereum making a comeback anytime soon. ETH Will Still Reach New Highs Crypto analyst Virtual Bacon is still confident that Ethereum will reach new highs. He noted that ETH is back at its key bear market breakout zone, retesting the $1,700 and $2,100 range. He predicts that the altcoin will continue to chop around this range in the short term. However, he remarked that Ethereum tends to catch up fast once the US Federal Reserve pivots and global liquidity turns. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Forms Megaphone Bottom Not Seen Since 2020, Here’s What Happened Last Time Crypto analyst Crypto Patel affirmed that Ethereum’s biggest run is coming. He stated that Q2 to Q4 of this year will be life-changing for ETH. The analyst added that this could be the cycle top window and advised market participants not to miss it. Crypto Patel advised that they should accumulate between $1,900 and $1,300 with the target of between $7,000 and $10,000 in mind. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $1,850, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Coinbase has been attempting to leverage FOIA to uncover instances of the FDIC asking banks to freeze crypto services, known as “pause letters,” but the top US crypto exchange says the regulator hasn’t been complying with its information requests. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, claims the pause letters were part of “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” an alleged attempt by Biden Administration government regulators to stifle the crypto industry. The exchange hired the law firm History Associates, which filed a motion in January asking a federal court to intervene. The following month, the court paused the FDIC’s deadline to respond to History Associates’ amended FOIA complaint “so that the parties could engage in a biweekly, informal information-sharing process,” according to the law firm. Coinbase’s legal representation has requested information regarding the FDIC’s response to its FOIA requests, specifically concerning the regulator’s policy or practice of “failing to conduct complete searches of all relevant databases and failing to take adequate steps to preserve responsive documents.” In a new motion filed this week, History Associates now says the FDIC is “unwilling to cooperate” with these FOIA requests. “The only viable path forward is for the case to resume and proceed to litigation of the merits.” Last month, the FDIC released redacted documents related to its supervision of crypto-related activities, which include pause letters sent to 24 banks as well as communications and records involving other regulated institutions. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) subsequently sent a letter to FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill requesting unredacted copies of the documents.

42816245,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145648,1743624029,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary AI GPUs: Parasail’s On-Demand Fleet Outshines Oracle Cloud,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-gpus-parasail-oracle-cloud/,"Is the future of AI infrastructure destined to mirror the centralized cloud model dominated by giants like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud? Parasail, a groundbreaking startup, dares to challenge this notion, asserting that AI’s trajectory will be distinctly different. They’re betting big on a decentralized, flexible approach, and their claim? Parasail’s fleet of on-demand GPUs is now larger than Oracle’s entire cloud offering. Let’s dive into how Parasail is shaking up the AI hardware landscape and offering a compelling alternative. Challenging the Cloud Giants: Why Parasail Believes in Decentralized AI GPUs? For years, the internet’s backbone has been controlled by a handful of hyperscale cloud providers. But Parasail’s founders, Tim Harris and Mike Henry, envision a different future for AI GPUs . They believe the compute power required for AI is inherently more adaptable and can thrive in a horizontal, distributed environment. Harris, also CEO of Swift Navigation, emphasizes, “We didn’t want a world where AI was controlled from soup to nuts by the hyperscalers.” Parasail’s core offering is simple yet powerful: providing companies with access to a vast network of on-demand GPUs , including top-tier Nvidia models like H100, H200, A100, and 4090, at competitive prices. This model directly addresses the growing demand for specialized AI hardware without the hefty costs and rigid structures of traditional cloud providers. The Parasail Advantage: What Makes Their On-Demand GPU Model Different? In a market crowded with AI infrastructure vendors, from hyperscalers to nimble startups, Parasail believes its unique technology sets it apart. Here’s what gives them an edge: Aggregation and Flexibility: Parasail doesn’t own all the GPUs. Instead, they’ve built a sophisticated platform that aggregates GPU resources from numerous providers. This creates a massive, flexible pool of on-demand GPUs that can scale to meet diverse customer needs. Cost Efficiency: By leveraging a distributed model and focusing solely on GPU access, Parasail claims to offer significant cost savings compared to incumbents. This is crucial for companies looking to experiment with and deploy AI models without breaking the bank. Simplicity and Speed: Parasail focuses on simplifying access to complex AI hardware . As CEO Mike Henry, former CPO of Groq, points out, companies are struggling to keep pace with the rapid advancements in AI models. Parasail aims to make accessing the necessary compute power as easy as “a click of a button.” Navigating the AI Infrastructure Landscape: Is Demand for AI GPUs Sustainable? Parasail’s bold claim and business model hinge on the continued explosive growth of AI and the sustained demand for AI GPUs . While the AI sector is booming, there are also whispers of potential market corrections and shifts in infrastructure needs. Microsoft, for example, has reportedly canceled some data center contracts, suggesting that predictions of insatiable cloud infrastructure demand might be slightly exaggerated. However, Parasail remains bullish. Tim Harris states, “We see literally no end [to] the demand.” He argues that the bottleneck isn’t the desire to use AI, but rather the complexity and difficulty in accessing the necessary resources – AI GPUs , data centers, and optimization tools. Parasail aims to remove these hurdles, making AI adoption more accessible for a wider range of businesses. Parasail’s Journey So Far: Key Milestones Despite being a relatively young company, Parasail has made significant strides: Founded in 2023, Platform Launch in 2024: From conception to platform launch in under two years demonstrates rapid execution. $10 Million Seed Funding: Securing seed funding from reputable firms like Basis Set Ventures and Threshold Ventures validates investor confidence in their vision. Early Customer Traction: Already working with companies like Elicit, Weights & Biases, and Rasa indicates strong early adoption and market interest. Can Parasail Truly Disrupt the Cloud Infrastructure Paradigm? Parasail’s ambition is clear: to democratize access to AI GPUs and prevent the concentration of AI power in the hands of a few hyperscalers. Their claim of having a larger on-demand GPU fleet than Oracle Cloud is a powerful statement of intent. To truly disrupt the cloud infrastructure landscape, Parasail needs to: Scale Operations: Continue to expand their network of GPU providers and ensure seamless service delivery as demand grows. Maintain Competitive Pricing: Sustain their cost advantage while delivering top-tier performance and reliability. Innovate and Adapt: Stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving AI hardware and software ecosystem. Conclusion: A New Horizon for AI Infrastructure? Parasail presents a compelling vision for the future of AI hardware and cloud infrastructure . By championing a decentralized, on-demand model for AI GPUs , they are not only challenging the status quo but also potentially unlocking new levels of innovation and accessibility in the AI space. Whether they can truly reshape the industry remains to be seen, but Parasail has undoubtedly thrown down the gauntlet, signaling a significant shift in how we think about AI compute.

Just 48 hours after unveiling Keynote 3, the project brought in $5 million, pushing its presale total over $210 million. The spike didn’t come from hype alone—it came from clear signs of real progress. The Beta Testnet is live, having already processed over 1.2 million transactions, supported by a growing network of more than 100 community-run nodes. Unlike many Layer 1 chains that delay functionality, BlockDAG is offering usable features well ahead of its mainnet launch. Now in Batch 27, BDAG is priced at $0.0248, with over 19 billion tokens already sold. As both institutional and individual investors jump in, the chance to get in early may be slipping away. Keynote 3 Outlined a Real Working Roadmap This wasn’t just another promotional pitch. Keynote 3 laid out clear updates and timelines, giving potential buyers confidence in the direction BlockDAG is taking. Highlights included: The official rollout of the Beta Testnet, already processing at scale A live block explorer, plus user-friendly Token/NFT creation tools and test dApps Full DeFi features—staking, swaps, lending, and bridges—planned at mainnet A goal of 1,000+ dApps onboarded by 2026 10+ CEX listings confirmed after the mainnet launch What really stood out was the clarity of the presentation. CEO Antony Turner summed it up best: “We are not here to take shortcuts. We are here to redefine the standard for blockchain technology.” That statement echoed across social media—and the funding surge that followed speaks volumes. Global Partnerships Are Expanding BlockDAG’s Reach The growth story here isn’t limited to blockchain circles. BlockDAG has secured headline partnerships with both Inter Milan and the UFC, gaining exposure far beyond crypto-native audiences. Rather than depending on paid influencers or speculative hype, BlockDAG is stepping into mainstream visibility through cultural and entertainment platforms. It’s a more grounded approach—and one that’s already attracting users. The X1 Miner App now has over 800,000 downloads, while the Tap Miner game has more than 400,000 signups. What’s important here is that people are already using the ecosystem—not just watching from the sidelines. That level of pre-mainnet interaction is still rare in this space. Hitting $1 Is Starting to Look More Realistic The idea of BDAG reaching $1 no longer feels like a long shot. With the token currently priced at $0.0248, early buyers could see up to 40x gains if projections come true. And the foundation for that growth is already in place: A live testnet with solid transaction volume Confirmed DeFi features at launch Multiple exchange listings ready A global miner base with 16,600+ ASIC units sold A growing holder base of over 170,000 wallets This is no longer a project trying to prove it can scale—it’s a network that’s already showing how it will. As Turner said to close the keynote: “This isn’t just about what we’ve built so far—it’s about what comes next.” That future is already attracting capital. The $5M inflow in just two days shows confidence in where BlockDAG is heading. And with a $600 million presale target in sight, momentum seems to be on its side. With Real Progress, Strong Numbers, & Active Users, Timing Matters BlockDAG has moved beyond the idea stage. It has a working testnet, a strong brand presence, thousands of users, and a growing number of miners helping secure the network. It’s not just preparing for mainnet—it’s already building toward it. At $0.0248, the current presale price may not last. The ecosystem is taking shape quickly, and as more features go live and exchanges open up trading, the value proposition becomes harder to ignore. For those still on the fence, the signals are getting louder: this project has users, traction, and tech. And it’s gaining speed. The next batch will likely come. But whether it comes at this price—that’s another story.

Why Dragoin ($DDGN) Could Be the Breakout Meme Coin of the Year,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-best-crypto-presale-of-2025-why-dragoin-ddgn-could-be-the-breakout-meme-coin-of-the-year/,"The crypto space is once again heating up—and this time, the buzz is all about Dragoin ($DDGN) , a meme coin that’s combining play-to-earn gaming, Game of Thrones-style storytelling, and powerful presale mechanics. With over 25 stages in its presale structure and a current batch price of $0.0000292, Dragoin is setting itself apart with both its creative angle and massive ROI potential. Dragoin isn’t your average meme coin. While most meme projects rely purely on hype, Dragoin brings an actual use case: an interactive Telegram-based game where players control dragons, dodge obstacles, and collect $DDGN tokens in real-time. This game-centric model transforms Dragoin into more than just a token—it becomes part of an evolving gaming ecosystem. It’s simple to access (directly in Telegram), rewarding (earn tokens while playing), and addictively competitive, with leaderboards and referral bonuses encouraging active participation. A Presale Engineered for Growth The Dragoin presale features 25 individual stages, each inspired by major battles and events from Game of Thrones. Early participants are already seeing the value: the current Stage 1 batch price sits at just $0.0000292, with a launch price of $0.002, giving early buyers a potential ROI of over 6,700%. Here’s a breakdown of Dragoin’s tokenomics: Total Supply: 200 billion $DDGN Presale Allocation: 50% (100 billion) Ecosystem: 30% (60 billion) Liquidity: 15% (30 billion) Team: 5% (10 billion, locked for 2 years) To add fuel to the fire, any unsold tokens will be permanently burned before launch, tightening supply and increasing value for holders. Security, Utility, and Community-Driven Growth Dragoin’s smart contract is renounced—ensuring true decentralization, and reducing risk of developer manipulation. With the game and ecosystem running on Ethereum, it offers a secure, fast, and well-supported infrastructure. Liquidity will initially launch via platforms like Uniswap, with additional exchange listings coming post-launch. Dragoin also integrates community governance features, allowing holders to vote on project decisions. Active contributors earn rewards through referral campaigns and leaderboard contests—giving the Dragoin community real power over the platform’s future. What Makes Dragoin a Standout in 2025? Massive Presale Potential: Early buyers at $0.0000292 can benefit from huge returns as Dragoin marches toward its $0.002 launch. Real Utility: A fun, engaging, and rewarding game that lives in Telegram—no downloads, just play. Deflationary Design: Token burning ensures scarcity, increasing demand as adoption grows. Secure Ecosystem: Built on Ethereum with a renounced smart contract and upcoming DEX listings.

The world of Bitcoin ETFs is buzzing with activity as Ark Invest’s 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) has just made a significant move. Data from the blockchain sleuths at Arkham Intelligence reveals a massive Bitcoin transfer : a whopping 1,097 BTC, valued at approximately $94 million, has been shifted from ARKB to a Coinbase-labeled address. This substantial transaction, occurring just moments ago, has the crypto community wondering – what’s behind this notable shift of Bitcoin ETF holdings? Decoding the $94 Million Bitcoin Transfer: ARKB and Coinbase in the Spotlight Let’s break down what we know. Around 11 minutes prior to this news breaking, 1,097 Bitcoin were transferred from the ARKB Bitcoin ETF to an address identified as belonging to Coinbase . This information, brought to light by Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics platform, offers a peek into the on-chain activities of major crypto players. But why is this noteworthy, and what could it mean for the cryptocurrency market ? Here’s a quick rundown of the key players involved: ARKB (ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF): This is the spot Bitcoin ETF managed by Ark Invest and 21Shares. Launched in January 2024, it allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Coinbase : A leading cryptocurrency exchange and custodian. Coinbase provides custody services for many institutional clients, including Bitcoin ETF providers. Arkham Intelligence: A blockchain analytics firm that provides insights into cryptocurrency transactions and entities. Their data is crucial for understanding on-chain movements like this Bitcoin transfer . Why Would ARKB Transfer Such a Large Amount of Bitcoin to Coinbase? This is the million-dollar question, or rather, the $94 million question! While we can only speculate without official statements from ARKB or Coinbase , here are some plausible explanations for this Bitcoin transfer : Custody and Rebalancing: Coinbase is a known custodian for many Bitcoin ETFs , including potentially ARKB. This transfer could be a routine movement for custody purposes or to rebalance their holdings. ETFs need to manage their Bitcoin reserves to match investor demand and redemptions. Trading and Liquidity: Coinbase is also a major exchange. ARKB might be moving Bitcoin to Coinbase to facilitate trading activities. This could be for various reasons, such as managing liquidity, executing large trades, or responding to market fluctuations. Operational Needs: There could be other operational reasons for the transfer that are internal to ARKB and their service providers. These could include security protocols, fund management strategies, or compliance requirements. It’s important to note that large Bitcoin transfers between wallets associated with ETFs and exchanges aren’t necessarily alarming. They are often a normal part of ETF operations. However, given the size of this transfer and the current market climate, it’s definitely something worth paying attention to. Impact on the Cryptocurrency Market: Should We Be Concerned? The immediate impact on the cryptocurrency market from this single Bitcoin transfer is likely to be minimal. However, it does raise broader questions and points to consider: ETF Activity as a Market Indicator: Movements of Bitcoin by Bitcoin ETFs are increasingly being watched as potential indicators of institutional activity and market sentiment. Large inflows into ETFs are generally seen as bullish, while significant outflows or transfers could be interpreted differently depending on the context. Transparency of On-Chain Data: This event highlights the transparency of blockchain technology. Tools like Arkham Intelligence allow us to track these large transactions and gain insights that were previously unavailable in traditional financial markets. This transparency is a key feature of the cryptocurrency market . Institutional Adoption Continues: The fact that a Bitcoin ETF like ARKB is managing and moving such large amounts of Bitcoin underscores the growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. ETFs are providing a regulated and accessible pathway for institutions and traditional investors to enter the cryptocurrency market . While this Bitcoin transfer itself may not trigger immediate market volatility, it serves as a reminder of the significant role Bitcoin ETFs now play in the cryptocurrency market . Monitoring these ETF flows and activities can provide valuable signals about the evolving landscape of digital assets. Key Takeaways: What Does This ARKB Bitcoin Transfer Mean for You? So, what should you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, take away from this Bitcoin transfer ? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain data and news sources like Arkham Intelligence to track significant Bitcoin transfers and ETF activities. Understanding these movements can provide valuable context for market analysis. Context is Key: Don’t jump to conclusions based on a single transaction. Large Bitcoin transfers are often part of normal ETF operations. Look for patterns and trends rather than reacting to isolated events. Bitcoin ETFs are Here to Stay: This event reinforces the growing importance of Bitcoin ETFs in the cryptocurrency market . They are becoming a significant factor influencing supply, demand, and market dynamics. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Dynamic World of Bitcoin ETFs The transfer of 1,097 BTC from ARKB to Coinbase is a fascinating snapshot into the inner workings of Bitcoin ETFs and the broader cryptocurrency market . While the exact reasons behind this particular Bitcoin transfer remain speculative, it underscores the scale of institutional involvement in Bitcoin and the increasing transparency offered by blockchain analytics. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, monitoring these on-chain activities will become even more crucial for understanding market trends and making informed investment decisions. The world of Bitcoin ETFs is dynamic and ever-evolving, and events like this remind us to stay vigilant and informed in this exciting space.

The company has introduced a new individual retirement account (IRA). This newly introduced initiative lets investors add cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC) to their portfolios. This new offering was launched through Fidelity’s Web3-focused subsidiary, Fidelity Digital Assets. As digital assets continue to grow in popularity, Fidelity aims to provide a fresh, modern way for individuals to secure their financial future through crypto. Fidelity Provides New Crypto Channel to Save for Retirement With Fidelity’s crypto for IRAs, U.S. citizens who are at least 18 years old can now include cryptocurrencies in their retirement plans. Three types of accounts are available for these investments: Roth IRAs, Traditional IRAs, and Rollover IRAs. Fidelity revealed that each account has different benefits but gives investors flexibility depending on their financial goals and tax strategies. With Fidelity’s Crypto for IRAs program, investors can add digital currencies to their retirement portfolios instead of just stocks and bonds. While many investors and countries see digital currencies as a good option for pension funds, the Brazilian government is against the idea. Brazil’s top financial authority, the National Monetary Council (CMN), recently ruled that certain pension funds can no longer be invested in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. The government believes these investments are too risky for retirement savings. Crypto Assets Mainstream Adoption Grows The decision to offer cryptocurrency in retirement accounts shows how digital currencies are becoming more mainstream. Even though digital assets are still relatively new compared to traditional ones. They have gained much interest from investors and financial institutions. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are some of the most well-established and widely used cryptocurrencies in the digital market. By allowing these digital assets in retirement portfolios, Fidelity is helping investors diversify their savings and benefit from crypto’s growing popularity. Fidelity Takes a Step Toward Financial Innovation Fidelity’s launch of crypto for IRAs comes as more companies introduce new ways for people to invest in digital assets . Recently, Volatility Shares launched exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on Solana’s (SOL) performance . Likewise, other firms are also looking into funds that track Litecoin, Binance Coin (BNB), and even smaller tokens like PENGU. Fidelity’s move shows that the company is committed to staying ahead by offering investment options that meet customers’ changing needs. Investors will learn how to manage their crypto investments safely with the help and education of the asset manager.

Among those countries, China will be hit with a 34% reciprocal tariff, the European Union 20%, Vietnam 46% and Taiwan 32%. “Foreign nations will finally be asked to pay for the privilege of access to our market, the biggest market in the world,” Trump said Wednesday afternoon during remarks from the White House Rose Garden. “We’re right now the biggest market in the world.” Trump said his team determined the “worst offenders” by considering levies, “currency manipulation and trade barriers” foreign nations place on US exports. China, Trump claimed Wednesday, charges a total of 67% on US imports. They made a chart. pic.twitter.com/hQQlDj7Rs3 — Ben Strack 🟪 (@strack_ben) April 2, 2025 In an effort to bring automobile manufacturing back onshore, a 25% tariff on car imports — which Trump first announced last week — will go into effect tonight at midnight. The administration says additional levies on auto parts will be rolled out in May. “Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country, and you see it happening already,” Trump said. “We will supercharge our domestic industrial base, we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers.” Critics of the policies say tariff hikes will lead to higher prices and reduced consumer spending, which in turn will lower business expansion and investments. Analysts from Goldman Sachs raised their recessionary odds for the next year from 20% to 35% earlier this week. After a relatively flat day of trading Wednesday as investors waited for this afternoon’s announcement, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed in the green, gaining 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Futures, however, dipped into the red. The S&P 500 slipped almost 2% in after-hours while the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.7%. Bitcoin and ether, on the other hand, fell in the moments after Trump’s announcement, losing about 2.4%. Markets had likely priced in reciprocal tariffs between 15% and 20%, Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye said Wednesday. The Trump administration was tight-lipped about the policies leading up to Wednesday’s announcement. The president was still finalizing plans late Tuesday evening, according to people familiar.

42818142,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145663,1743627605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BREAKING: FCA Approves BlackRock & Galaxy Digital for Crypto Services – A Major Win for UK,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fca-approves-blackrock-galaxy-crypto/,"Exciting news for crypto enthusiasts in the UK and beyond! The financial landscape is shifting as the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has given the nod to two major players in the financial world to operate as crypto asset firms. This landmark decision paves the way for significant developments in the availability and legitimacy of crypto services within the UK market. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the future of digital assets. Why is FCA Approval a Game Changer for Crypto Services? The FCA approval is not just another regulatory tick-box; it’s a powerful signal of growing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance. For firms like BlackRock and Galaxy Digital, securing this approval is crucial for several reasons: Enhanced Credibility: FCA approval brings a layer of regulatory oversight and trust. It assures investors and the broader public that these firms operate under established guidelines, reducing perceived risks associated with the often-unregulated crypto space. Market Access: This approval allows BlackRock and Galaxy Digital to offer a wider range of crypto services to UK clients, tapping into a significant market eager for regulated crypto investment opportunities. Institutional Adoption Catalyst: When established financial giants like BlackRock receive FCA backing for crypto services , it encourages other institutions to consider and adopt digital assets, accelerating overall market maturity. Investor Protection: FCA regulated firms are bound by rules designed to protect consumers. This means investors engaging with BlackRock and Galaxy Digital for crypto services benefit from safeguards not always available in unregulated crypto platforms. Think of it like getting a quality stamp on a product. The FCA’s approval process is rigorous, ensuring firms meet certain standards in areas like anti-money laundering, security, and consumer protection. This stamp of approval can significantly boost investor confidence and broaden the appeal of crypto services . BlackRock Crypto Expansion: Spot Bitcoin ETPs on the Horizon For BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, FCA approval is particularly significant as it clears the path for the rollout of its European spot Bitcoin ETP (Exchange Traded Product). What does this mean for you? Easier Access to Bitcoin: A spot Bitcoin ETP makes investing in Bitcoin simpler and more accessible for institutional and retail investors alike. It trades on regulated exchanges just like traditional stocks, removing the complexities of directly buying and storing Bitcoin. Broader Investment Options: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETP will offer investors in Europe a regulated and potentially more secure way to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without needing to navigate crypto exchanges or wallets. Increased Market Liquidity: The entry of a major player like BlackRock into the Bitcoin ETP market can significantly increase liquidity and trading volumes, potentially leading to a more stable and mature Bitcoin market. BlackRock’s move is a strong endorsement of Bitcoin’s staying power as an asset class. Their foray into crypto services , starting with a Bitcoin ETP , could be a watershed moment, attracting a wave of institutional capital into the crypto space. Galaxy Digital’s London Expansion: Derivatives and Investment Banking in Crypto Galaxy Digital, a crypto-focused financial services firm founded by Michael Novogratz, has also secured FCA approval . This license is set to empower Galaxy Digital to significantly expand its operations in London, a global financial hub. Their focus will be on: Derivatives Trading: The license enables Galaxy Digital to offer a wider range of cryptocurrency derivatives trading services in London. Derivatives, like futures and options, allow sophisticated investors to manage risk and speculate on price movements in the crypto market. Investment Banking Services: Beyond trading, Galaxy Digital can now offer investment banking services in London, catering to companies in the digital asset space. This could include services like fundraising, mergers and acquisitions advisory, and strategic consulting, all tailored for the crypto industry. Institutional Focus: Galaxy Digital’s expansion in London underscores the growing institutional interest in crypto. Their services are primarily aimed at institutions looking to engage with digital assets in a more structured and regulated manner. Galaxy Digital’s enhanced presence in London signals the increasing sophistication and institutionalization of the crypto market. Their ability to offer derivatives and investment banking crypto services in a major financial center like London is a testament to the sector’s maturation. The Ripple Effect: How FCA Approval Boosts Crypto Adoption The combined FCA approval for BlackRock and Galaxy Digital sends a powerful message: the UK is serious about becoming a hub for responsible crypto innovation. This regulatory green light is expected to have several positive ripple effects: Increased Investor Confidence: Regulatory clarity reduces uncertainty and boosts investor confidence in the crypto market. This can attract more capital, both institutional and retail, into digital assets. Attracting Talent and Innovation: A supportive regulatory environment like the UK’s can attract crypto companies, talent, and innovation. This can lead to the development of new crypto services and technologies within the UK. Global Regulatory Influence: The FCA’s approach can serve as a model for other jurisdictions considering crypto regulation. A clear and balanced regulatory framework in a major financial center like London can influence global standards. Mainstream Acceptance: As traditional financial institutions like BlackRock embrace crypto services under regulatory approval, it further normalizes and mainstreamizes cryptocurrencies in the eyes of the public and financial industry. In essence, the FCA approval acts as a catalyst, accelerating the integration of crypto into the traditional financial system and fostering a more mature and regulated digital asset market. Navigating the New Landscape of Crypto Services: Key Takeaways This development is undoubtedly exciting, but what should you, as someone interested in crypto, consider? Do Your Research: While FCA approval adds a layer of security, always conduct your own due diligence before investing in any crypto services or products, including Bitcoin ETP s. Understand the risks involved. Understand the Products: Familiarize yourself with the specifics of products like Bitcoin ETP s and crypto derivatives before investing. Ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Stay Informed: The crypto regulatory landscape is constantly evolving. Keep up-to-date with developments from the FCA and other regulatory bodies to make informed decisions about crypto services . Consider Professional Advice: If you are unsure about navigating these new crypto services , especially complex products like derivatives, consider seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for Crypto in the UK The FCA approval for BlackRock and Galaxy Digital to offer crypto services is a monumental step forward for the crypto industry in the UK. It signifies a maturing market, increasing regulatory acceptance, and greater accessibility for both institutional and retail investors. As BlackRock gears up for its European Bitcoin ETP rollout and Galaxy Digital expands its derivatives and investment banking offerings in London, the UK is positioning itself as a key player in the global crypto landscape. This is not just good news for crypto firms; it’s a positive development for the entire financial ecosystem, promising innovation, growth, and a more inclusive financial future.

Table of Contents Can XRP break above $3 in 2025? Pi coin stops downward movement after securing a major listing Rollblock starts $100k giveaway for its investors Can RBLK surge to $1 this cycle? As the crypto market faces a sharp downturn, many XRP and Pi coin holders are actively searching for more promising opportunities to protect and grow their capital. This growing demand for high-upside alternatives has led a wave of investors to Rollblock – a rising GameFi altcoin that’s quickly gaining traction for its unique approach to blockchain gaming. With $11.1 million already secured during its presale, Rollblock has established itself as a serious contender in the space. Its rapid momentum and strong fundamentals are fueling expectations that it could become the largest GameFi presale of 2025. If this pace continues, some investors believe a breakout above the $1 mark could follow shortly after. You might also like: Why Rollblock could be a safer investment right now compared to SUI and Cardano Can XRP break above $3 in 2025? XRP is trading near $2 after a 13% drop over the past week, putting the asset at a key support level. The price briefly bounced to $2.11 from $2.03, but it’s still unclear if XRP can hold above the $2 mark. Daily trading volume surged 35% to over $4 billion, yet open interest in XRP futures remains flat – showing uncertainty and a lack of strong trader conviction. On-chain metrics paint a mixed picture. TradingView data shows that XRP’s Market Value to Realized Value ratio has fallen below its 200-day moving average, a bearish sign often leading to further downside. However, some analysts suggest this may signal early accumulation, especially with XRP options volume jumping 125%, indicating growing bets on a move toward $2.50. Ripple’s ongoing SEC lawsuit adds more uncertainty. While both parties have agreed not to pursue cross appeals, a final resolution remains elusive. Some expect a settlement by August, but timelines vary. With technical and legal factors in flux, XRP’s next move depends on whether bulls can defend $2 and regain momentum – or if selling pressure takes over. Pi coin stops downward movement after securing a major listing Pi coin is trading near $0.71 after a sharp 22% drop in the past week, hovering just above its all-time low of $0.62. TradingView data paints a bearish picture, with the Average Directional Index climbing above 25 – signaling a strengthening downtrend. At the same time, Pi coin’s Chaikin Money Flow remains in negative territory, reflecting continued capital outflows and low investor confidence. Although the CMF has shown a slight uptick, hinting at minor inflows, it hasn’t been enough to reverse sentiment. Pi coin’s recent failure to reclaim $0.87 as a support level has only added to the downward pressure. While the recent listing on BTCC Exchange brought a short-lived spike in interest, it has yet to translate into sustained buying momentum from Pi coin investors. One factor that may help stabilize the token is the significant amount of Pi coin currently locked – more than 124 million tokens . This reduced circulating supply could help ease sell pressure and create the conditions for a potential rebound, especially if broader market sentiment improves. Rollblock starts $100k giveaway for its investors The online gaming industry is set to surpass $150 billion in revenue by 2025, but rising fraud – up 64% in the past two years – continues to plague the sector. Rollblock is addressing this issue by building a fully secure, blockchain-based gaming platform on Ethereum. Rollblock hosts over 8,000 AI-powered games, including live casino tables and sports betting. Each result is recorded on-chain, ensuring transparency and eliminating the risk of tampering. This focus on trust and performance is driving rapid adoption. Rollblock raised over $1 million in March through its presale and added 15,000 new players. Deposits and activity surged, catching the attention of key web3 influencers like YouTuber Freddie Finance, who praised the project’s potential. To fuel further growth, Rollblock launched a $100,000 RBLK giveaway. Ten winners will receive $10,000 each, with extra entries earned through simple community tasks like posting, inviting friends, or sharing memes. Can RBLK surge to $1 this cycle? RBLK is the core utility token of the Rollblock ecosystem, used for transaction fees, staking, and generating passive income. With a fixed supply of one billion tokens, RBLK is among the first deflationary assets in GameFi. Rollblock’s revenue model boosts its value – up to 30% of platform revenue goes to token buybacks, with 60% of the repurchased tokens burned and 40% given to stakers. Currently priced at $0.062, RBLK has surged 520% from its $0.01 presale launch. As momentum builds, many investors see $1 as a realistic target by the end of 2025, outperforming web3 giants like Pi coin and XRP.

Since his endorsement, Ethereum (ETH) has plunged 50%, raising concerns about the impact of public figures on digital assets. While some view Eric Trump’s involvement as a bullish sign, others see it as a harbinger of volatility. The sudden downturn has sparked intense debate, with ETH holders scrambling to assess the long-term implications. ETH Holders Reeling After 50% Price Collapse ​In a surprising twist for ETH holders, Ethereum’s (ETH) value has nosedived by 50% since Eric Trump’s pro-crypto endorsement earlier this year. The son of former President Donald Trump took to social media on February 3, 2025, proclaiming , “In my opinion, it’s a great time to add $ETH.” At that time, Ethereum (ETH) was trading around $2,877, but it plummeted to approximately $1,439 in March, leaving many ETH holders in shock.​ After Eric Trump’s endorsement, Ethereum (ETH) briefly surged to $2,900, only to erase those gains and tumble to new lows. This volatility has left investors questioning the impact of high-profile endorsements like Eric Trump’s and the future trajectory of Ethereum (ETH), as indicated in a post by pseudonymous X user, Emperor. The financial impact of Eric Trump’s endorsement has been severe for ETH holders. Portfolios have been halved in value, and the once-promising outlook for Ethereum (ETH) now appears uncertain. Some investors are liquidating their holdings to mitigate further losses, while others are adopting a wait-and-see approach, hoping for a market rebound. The psychological toll is also significant, with many questioning their investment strategies and the future viability of Ethereum (ETH).​ As the crypto market grapples with these challenges, ETH holders remain on edge, hoping for a reversal of fortunes in the coming months. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Gains Momentum Amid Market Turmoil Despite Ethereum’s (ETH) plummeting price, whales are loading up the cryptocurrency alongside an emerging AI token, WallitIQ (WLTQ ). This new crypto trading platform uses predictive analytics to harness the power of machine learning to forecast price fluctuations based on historical trends, sentiment analysis, and trading volume.

Rather than relying on passive security measures, WallitIQ (WLTQ) certifies that every asset remains safeguarded around the clock. However, crypto transactions often have trust issues, but WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Escrow Connect feature changes the game. This AI-powered mechanism guarantees that obligations are met before funds or assets are released, reducing the risk of fraud and eliminating counterparty concerns. Early investors in the presale gain privileged access to this groundbreaking feature on its recently launched beta platform.

The Trust, at the center of the fiasco, says it is fully solvent while accusing Sun of sensationalism. First Digital Trust Refutes Allegations Of Insolvency First Digital Trust has released a statement debunking allegations of financial impropriety and insolvency. According to the statement, First Digital Trust says it is completely solvent while accusing Justin Sun of falsehood. The Trust has been at the center of a whirlpool of a liquidity crisis involving TrueUSD (TUSD) with Justin Sun stepping in to stabilize the stablecoin with a capital injection. The Tron founder launched a tirade against the Hong Kong-based trust, accusing it of financial mismanagement including unauthorized trade finance loans. “The recent allegations by Justin Sun against First Digital Trust are completely false,” read the statement. The Trust disclosed that its FDUSD stablecoin is solvent and backed by US Treasury Bills. Per the statement, the legal dispute surrounding TUSD has nothing to do with FDUSD, accusing Sun of a smear campaign. First Digital Trust says it has not had the opportunity to defend itself in court, accusing Sun of launching social media attacks. “This is a typical Justin Sun smear campaign to try to attack a competitor to his business,” added First Digital Trust. Justin Sun Maintains His Stance Justin Sun remains firm in his resolve that First Digital Trust is insolvent while urging investors to cut ties with FDUSD. He warns that the Trust founder Vincent Chok will face the full wrath of the justice system. “First Digital Trust (FDT) is in fact insolvent,” said Sun. “If you have any relationship with it, please cut off contact as soon as possible to protect your assets.” Following his accusations, FDUSD lost its peg and traded at a low of $0.88, a steep drop before crawling to $0.98. The loss of $130 million from its market capital has rattled investors with critics taking swipes over its de-pegging. The Tron founder has covered every blade of grass in recent days, buying $75M of the Trump memecoin. Last week, Justin Sun weighed in on TRX’s halving proposal , supporting a proposal to mirror Bitcoin’s pattern.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A $27.53m leveraged PEPE position stirs concerns over crypto instability, while WallitIQ offers risk management solutions. A $27.53 million leveraged PEPE position on Hyperliquid has sparked concerns about broader crypto market instability. The whale who opened the position has already faced substantial losses, with the risk of liquidation looming.

This trade was initiated on the Hyperliquid platform, but within days, the position showed signs of strain, with the trader experiencing a loss of over $3 million. The price of PEPE had begun to decline, and the whale faced the risk of liquidation if it fell below $0.005219.

42818468,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145664,1743628202,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Ripple Stablecoin RLUSD Integration Transforms XRP Payment Platform,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ripple-rlusd-stablecoin-payment-platform/,"In a groundbreaking move that signals a significant leap forward for the crypto payment landscape, Ripple has officially integrated its much-anticipated RLUSD stablecoin into its own robust payment platform. This strategic integration, first reported by The Block, marks a pivotal moment for Ripple and the broader digital asset ecosystem, promising to streamline transactions and enhance efficiency for users worldwide. But what exactly does this mean for Ripple, its clients, and the future of cross-border payments? Let’s dive into the details and explore the transformative potential of this integration. Unveiling RLUSD: Ripple’s Bold Stablecoin Venture For those unfamiliar, RLUSD is Ripple’s foray into the stablecoin market – a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically mirroring the US dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether, stablecoins offer the stability of traditional currencies with the speed and efficiency of blockchain technology. Ripple’s decision to launch RLUSD and integrate it into their payment platform is a clear indication of their commitment to expanding their offerings and catering to the growing demand for stable and reliable digital currencies. This move directly addresses a crucial need in the market: a stable and compliant digital asset for enterprise-grade payment solutions. Why is Ripple Integrating its Own Stablecoin? The integration of Ripple stablecoin RLUSD into its payment platform is a strategic masterstroke for several compelling reasons: Enhanced Payment Solutions: By incorporating RLUSD, Ripple is offering its clients a natively integrated stablecoin solution. This eliminates the need for third-party stablecoin integrations, simplifying processes and potentially reducing costs associated with using external stablecoins. Clients can now leverage the speed and efficiency of Ripple’s platform with the price stability of RLUSD. Streamlined Cross-Border Payments: Cross-border payments are often plagued by delays, high fees, and complexities. RLUSD , as a stablecoin on Ripple’s platform, is designed to mitigate these issues. Its inherent stability reduces exchange rate volatility risks, making international transactions smoother and more predictable for businesses and individuals alike. Increased Platform Utility: Integrating Ripple stablecoin directly boosts the utility of Ripple’s payment platform. It becomes a more attractive option for businesses seeking comprehensive payment solutions, encompassing both traditional and digital asset functionalities. This integration can attract new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. Direct Control and Compliance: Having its own stablecoin gives Ripple greater control over the payment ecosystem. It allows them to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and tailor RLUSD to meet the specific needs of their enterprise clients. This control is crucial in the evolving regulatory landscape of digital assets. Real-World Applications: How Clients are Already Using RLUSD Ripple has already announced that several of its key clients are actively utilizing RLUSD for payment services. This is not just a theoretical integration; it’s a practical solution being deployed in the real world. Let’s look at the examples provided: BKK Forex: As a cross-border payment provider, BKK Forex is leveraging RLUSD to facilitate faster and more efficient international money transfers. The stability of RLUSD is particularly beneficial in volatile currency markets, ensuring that the value of transactions remains consistent throughout the process. iSend: Another cross-border payment provider, iSend, is also incorporating RLUSD into its services. This adoption further validates the utility of stablecoin integration for international remittances and payments. The use of RLUSD can help iSend offer more competitive and reliable services to its customers. Ripple has also indicated that more clients will soon be able to offer services using RLUSD. This suggests a growing momentum and broader adoption of Ripple’s stablecoin within its network. Benefits of Using RLUSD for XRP Payment Platform Users For users of Ripple’s XRP payment platform , the integration of RLUSD brings a host of advantages: Benefit Description Price Stability RLUSD, being pegged to the US dollar, offers price stability, reducing the risk of volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies. This is crucial for businesses seeking predictable transaction values. Faster Transactions Leveraging Ripple’s payment platform, RLUSD transactions are processed quickly and efficiently, significantly faster than traditional banking systems. Lower Transaction Fees Digital asset transactions on Ripple’s platform are generally associated with lower fees compared to conventional cross-border payment methods. Enhanced Transparency Blockchain technology provides transparency and traceability for RLUSD transactions, enhancing trust and accountability. Regulatory Compliance As Ripple develops and manages RLUSD, it is expected to adhere to stringent regulatory standards, providing a compliant stablecoin option for businesses operating in regulated environments. Challenges and Considerations for RLUSD Adoption While the integration of Ripple stablecoin RLUSD is overwhelmingly positive, there are some challenges and considerations to keep in mind: Regulatory Scrutiny: Stablecoins, in general, are under increasing regulatory scrutiny globally. Ripple will need to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape to ensure RLUSD’s compliance and widespread acceptance. Ongoing clarity from regulatory bodies will be crucial for long-term success. Market Competition: The stablecoin market is already crowded with established players like USDT and USDC. RLUSD will need to differentiate itself and demonstrate clear advantages to gain significant market share. Ripple’s strong enterprise focus and existing client base offer a solid foundation for this. Adoption Hurdles: While early adoption is promising, broader adoption of RLUSD will depend on educating the market and demonstrating its practical benefits to a wider range of businesses and users. Continued successful use cases and positive client experiences will be key. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Future? The integration of stablecoin integration by Ripple is more than just a product update; it’s a strategic move that positions Ripple at the forefront of the evolving digital payment ecosystem. Here are some actionable insights: For Businesses: Explore the potential of RLUSD for your cross-border payment needs. If you are already using Ripple’s platform or considering it, RLUSD integration offers a compelling reason to delve deeper. Assess how RLUSD can streamline your international transactions and reduce costs. For Crypto Enthusiasts: Keep a close watch on the adoption and performance of RLUSD. Its success could set a precedent for other enterprise-focused stablecoins and further legitimize the use of digital assets in mainstream finance. This is a development that could significantly impact the future of crypto payments. For the Industry: Ripple’s move underscores the growing importance of stablecoins in the crypto ecosystem. It highlights the trend of established crypto companies expanding their offerings to include stable and regulated digital assets. This trend is likely to continue, shaping the future of finance and payments. Conclusion: A Transformative Step for Ripple and Crypto Payments Ripple’s integration of RLUSD into its payment platform is a transformative step that holds immense potential. It simplifies cross-border payments, enhances platform utility, and provides a compliant stablecoin solution for enterprise clients. While challenges remain, the early adoption by clients like BKK Forex and iSend is a strong indicator of RLUSD’s value proposition. As Ripple continues to roll out RLUSD to more clients, we can expect to see a significant impact on the efficiency and accessibility of global payments. This integration not only strengthens Ripple’s position in the market but also propels the broader adoption of stablecoins as a cornerstone of the future financial landscape. The era of seamless, stable, and efficient digital payments is rapidly unfolding, and Ripple is undoubtedly playing a leading role.

The same day, Tesla’s stock jumped by 5.9% after the article came out, even though the company is dealing with its worst vehicle delivery numbers since 2022. Politico had said that Trump expected Elon to walk away from his government duties within weeks and focus again on his companies. The story quickly reached Tesla investors, who had been questioning Elon’s commitment to the electric vehicle company as sales continued to drop and new product plans remained unclear. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to the story directly on X, saying: “This ‘scoop’ is garbage. Elon Musk and President Trump have both publicly stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at DOGE is complete.” Court blocks D.O.G.E from digging into private data At the same time that this media drama was happening, the Trump administration was dealt a legal blow in federal court. On Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit dismissed the administration’s appeal to lift a temporary restraining order that blocks DOGE staff from getting into the Social Security Administration’s sensitive data systems. The court said it didn’t have jurisdiction over the appeal and sent the case back to the district court, where it began. The plaintiffs, which include several large unions and retiree advocacy groups, say they will file a motion for a preliminary injunction later this week. President Donald Trump with Elon Musk. Creator: Brandon Bell | Credit: AP The temporary restraining order was originally issued by federal Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander on March 20. Her ruling banned DOGE employees and contractors from accessing federal systems that store private data, including Social Security numbers, home addresses, health records, employer and employee earnings, and tax documents. The judge also ordered DOGE to delete all private data it had collected that wasn’t properly anonymized. The legal complaint against the Trump administration was filed by three major organizations: the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, the American Federation of Teachers, and the Alliance for Retired Americans. They argued that letting DOGE access the Social Security database would put tens of millions of Americans at risk. Richard Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, said in a written statement: “We are pleased the 4th Circuit agreed to let this important case continue in district court. Every American retiree must be able to trust that the Social Security Administration will protect their most sensitive and personal data from unwarranted disclosure.” Democracy Forward, a national legal organization, is representing the plaintiffs. The group said the Trump administration didn’t follow normal legal procedures when it appealed the restraining order, and the court’s decision to throw it out proves that. Liz Huston, speaking on behalf of the White House, said Trump still plans to fight in court. In a short emailed statement, she wrote, “The president will continue to seek all legal remedies available to ensure the will of the American people is executed.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Ripple announced on April 2 that, besides integrating its stablecoin into the company’s cross-border payments system, it has also launched RLUSD on Kraken, a well-established American digital asset exchange. RLUSD Now Live On Kraken Kraken now joins a growing list of other platforms already supporting Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, including LMAX Digital, Zero Hash, Bitstamp, and Bullish. Ripple has revealed plans to work with international entities to boost the short-term U.S. government bond-backed cryptocurrency’s reach and accessibility. “Ripple has enabled RLUSD cross-border payments in its flagship payments solution,” the firm posited in the press release . “RLUSD is being used in the payment flow with select customers, including cross-border payment providers BKK Forex and iSend to improve their cross-border treasury operations.” The merge will give the Ripple USD stablecoin direct exposure to billions of dollars in liquidity. https://twitter.com/JackMcDonald/status/1907471011441963118 Ripple USD Milestone And Growing Adoption Since its debut in December 2024 on Ripple’s XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains, RLUSD’s market capitalization is nearing $250 million. “We’re seeing the market cap continue to grow,” Jack McDonald, Ripple’s senior vice president of stablecoins, said, adding that RLUSD’s growth is “outpacing our internal projections” with adoption spanning several financial sectors. Ripple is also partnering with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) considering stablecoins for more streamlined aid distribution, McDonald added. The stablecoin market has become a key topic of discussion lately as lawmakers in the United States prepare to vote on stablecoin legislation. Moreover, Trump family-backed crypto initiative, the World Liberty Financial, is also rolling out its own U.S. dollar-pegged token on Ethereum and the BNB Chain. While Tether’s USDT remains the clear leader in terms of adoption and utility, as stablecoin usage surges and regulatory clarity improves, Wall Street behemoths like Bank of America may be encouraged to also introduce their own tokens.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-02 21:10:45

Some traders believe that the downturn is partially connected to the deflating memecoin market, which, while not exclusive to the Ethereum network, significantly reduced activity across the decentralized applications (DApps) ecosystem and broader crypto space. Ether is currently 44% down year-to-date, and derivatives metrics indicate that traders are far from bullish and show little confidence in a strong recovery in the near term. Proof of this can be found in the premium on Ether futures relative to spot markets. While the figure rose to 4% on April 2, up from 2% on March 31, it is still below the neutral 5% threshold. This data indicates that Ether investors remain far from turning bullish, despite the strengthening support at the $1,800 price level. Ether 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch To assess whether whales and market makers lack confidence in Ether’s performance, one should analyze the ETH options market. Under neutral conditions, the 25% delta skew should be balanced between call (buy) and put (sell) options, typically ranging from -6% to 6%. Deribit ETH 30-day options 25% delta skew (put-call). Source: Laevitas.ch The Ether delta skew metric has retreated from the 9% level seen on March 31, yet the current 7% reading suggests that risk-aversion sentiment remains strong. The rising cost of hedging indicates that whales fear further downside for ETH, suggesting it may take longer for traders to regain confidence. Ethereum adoption remains strong despite DApps revenue drop It’s easy to attribute much of Ether’s price decline to the 49% drop in Ethereum DApps revenue between January and March. However, while the reduced network activity limits the influx of new users and dampens overall demand for ETH, its advantages over traditional financial markets and its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) remain unchanged. The stablecoin holdings on Ethereum are nearing an all-time high of $124.5 billion, and Ethereum is still the undisputed leader, with $49 billion in total value locked (TVL). This data suggests significant potential for ETH adoption, particularly as new use cases emerge, such as structured products and more complex DeFi applications leveraging synthetic assets. Despite the early struggles of metaverse applications, declining interest in memecoins , and the sharp downturn in non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace activity, the Ethereum network continues to expand. ETH funding rate neutral as ETFs dampen retail trading enthusiasm Instead of focusing solely on how professional traders are positioned, it is also valuable to assess retail investors’ sentiment. Perpetual futures (inverse swaps) typically follow spot prices closely, as leverage imbalances are corrected through a fee known as the funding rate, which is charged every eight hours. In neutral markets, this rate fluctuates between 0.1% and 0.3% over a seven-day period. Ether 8-hour perpetual futures funding rate. Source: Laevitas.ch The ETH perpetual funding rate has been neutral since March 31, indicating that retail traders are not attempting to catch a falling knife. A key factor behind this lack of enthusiasm is the spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw $37 million in net outflows over the past two weeks. While derivatives data is often backward-looking and does not necessarily signal further ETH price declines, sentiment could shift quickly given the positive momentum from the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial investment in ETH and Eric Trump’s vocal support for Ether . For the time being, professional traders and retail investors remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook.

One of the most talked-about developments right now involves Hedera and the upcoming launch of HashSphere. Built by Swirlds Labs, HashSphere is a permissioned DLT expected to roll out in Q3 2025, and it’s already in beta testing with Australia Payments Plus. That’s not just hype. Australia Payments Plus operates major infrastructure in the country’s financial system and sits on Hedera’s governing council. With stablecoins inching toward the mainstream thanks to regulatory pushes like the Genius Act, HashSphere could be a game-changer. Immutable X is also making noise in the gaming sector. The fantasy MMORPG RavenQuest, created by Tavernlight Games, just launched the QUEST token directly into its live ecosystem. Built on Immutable zkEVM, the token isn’t waiting around for theoretical use cases—it’s already powering a growing in-game economy. QUEST is proving that utility tokens tied to real-time platforms are no longer speculative assets but live, breathing parts of user experience. But the most potential crypto in the market right now? That title might belong to Qubetics ($TICS). While others are still ironing out cross-chain kinks or rolling out whitepapers, Qubetics is laser-focused on delivering what blockchain actually promised years ago: seamless interoperability, actual use cases, and financial systems that work for people in real-time. From global businesses to individual users, Qubetics is building a tech stack that plays well with others—and builds the foundation for the next-gen decentralized economy. Qubetics ($TICS): The Most Potential Crypto for Real-World Interoperability Qubetics is already proving it’s not here to play catch-up. The protocol is engineered for multi-chain operability, solving one of blockchain’s longest-standing headaches. Businesses and professionals need more than single-chain silos—they need networks that communicate, sync, and collaborate. Qubetics makes that happen. Whether it’s financial systems communicating across regions or digital tools talking across chains, Qubetics delivers. This makes the protocol particularly useful for enterprise operations, fintech services, and digital-first startups that need reliability without sacrificing decentralization. For professionals and individuals alike, the ability to plug into an interoperable ecosystem with minimal friction is a serious advantage. Presale Momentum, Early ROI, and Analyst Predictions Qubetics is in Stage 28 of its crypto presale , and things are heating up fast. Over 506 million $TICS tokens have already been sold to more than 24,200 early adopters , with a total raise of $15.8 million so far. Tokens are currently priced at $0.1430 , offering a significant entry point for community members still looking to get in. Those who got in at Stage 1 when the price was just $0.01 are now looking at a 1330% return —not future gains, but real-time ROI. And it’s not too late. Participants jumping in at Stage 28 still stand to gain serious traction if the project hits analyst projections. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, that’s a 599% ROI . At $5, the number explodes to 3396% , and at $6, that return stretches to 4095% . Analysts are eyeing potential upside beyond that too—with projections of $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch , which equates to ROI as high as 10,388% . Qubetics isn’t betting on speculation—it’s delivering infrastructure that works now, with a presale that’s proving just how much backers believe in it. Hedera (HBAR): Bridging Public and Private Finance Hedera is locking in its role as a compliance-friendly, enterprise-grade network. With the development of HashSphere—a permissioned version of Hedera’s public ledger—regulators and institutions are watching closely. Swirlds Labs is steering the tech, while Australia Payments Plus serves as the flagship beta tester. The play here is stability, compliance, and cross-network interoperability. With financial giants like Australia Payments Plus backing the tech, Hedera positions itself as a go-to for stablecoin interoperability and enterprise-grade deployment. Rob Allen of Australia Payments even noted that HashSphere’s appeal lies in its enhanced privacy, transparency, and its ability to interact seamlessly with both Hedera and external layer-1s. For those searching for the most potential crypto to serve both public and private blockchain layers, Hedera’s trajectory is worth noting. Immutable X (IMX): Powering Play-to-Earn With Live Utility Gaming isn’t just entertainment anymore—it’s a booming economic engine. And Immutable X is positioning itself right at the core of this digital shift. With RavenQuest launching the QUEST token on Immutable zkEVM, it’s clear that real-time utility is no longer optional. The MMORPG released on PC back in March, and now the ecosystem has its own live, fully-integrated token. The QUEST token is not waiting around for listings or speculative hype. It’s fueling gameplay, powering economies, and building loyalty. This makes Immutable X one of the most potential crypto networks in gaming right now. With its Ethereum layer-2 design, it offers scalability without sacrificing the security backbone that Ethereum is known for. For community members bullish on GameFi or looking for long-term application-based blockchain platforms, Immutable X is a solid bet. Conclusion: Where Utility Meets Opportunity The most potential crypto in 2025 won’t be the ones promising change—it’ll be the ones already making it happen.

The token has now recorded a 20% drop within one week as overall crypto market sentiment remains bearish. PI has continued forming lower lows, with bears intensifying pressure across multiple timeframes. The sustained decline has also caused Pi Coin to fall from CoinMarketCap’s top 25 rankings. This sharp pullback highlights the token’s growing vulnerability in the ongoing market correction. Pi Network Price Drops Slips $0.70; Is ATL on the Horizontal? Pi Network price has slipped beneath $0.70, nearing its all-time low of $0.6152 recorded in February 2025. The current price marks a 77% drop from the token’s all-time high of $2.98, which was reached just over a month ago. Since then, PI has shed more than $14 billion in market value, falling from nearly $20 billion to just $4.66 billion. The ongoing decline is driven by consistent supply pressure. More than 1.5 billion tokens are expected to enter circulation within the next year. This will increase the total supply to 8 billion tokens, with monthly unlocks peaking at 233 million in July. Despite significant community traction, PI remains absent from major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and Bybit. The lack of top listings continues to weigh on sentiment, alongside ongoing concerns about token utility and inflation. Pi Network’s slide shows no immediate signs of reversing as selling pressure persists and liquidity challenges mount. Is Pi Coin Price Heading to $0.50? The latest Pi Coin price has dropped to $0.6729, nearing a key support level of $0.65 on the 4-hour chart. The decline continued a broader downtrend after Pi lost its footing near $1. Sellers have held control for weeks, and bulls struggle to regain momentum. The MACD indicator remains in negative territory. The signal line sits above the MACD line. This suggests a weak momentum crossover attempt, but the trend still leans bearish. The RSI has hovered near the oversold region. At the time of writing, the RSI stands at 32.03, showing limited buying strength. If bears break below $0.65, the next key level lies at $0.61. This is a critical psychological and structural support area. Below this, the Pi Network price prediction would enter uncharted territory and may create a fresh all-time low. Source: TradingView A recovery would face resistance around $0.7. Reclaiming this level may open a path to $0.8000. However, only a sustained close above $0.9 would confirm a trend reversal and invalidate the current bearish pattern.

You can’t miss the bold claims plastered on billboards – ‘Stop Hiring Humans’ and ‘Hire AI SDRs’ – as you drive into San Francisco. While some AI sales rep startups are indeed experiencing rapid growth, the initial hype is facing a reality check, leaving some venture capitalists with reservations. Actively AI, a startup shaking things up, just raised a significant $22.5 million, betting on a different approach: AI Sales Superintelligence . Is the AI SDR Dream Faltering? Exploring AI SDR Failure Anshul Gupta, co-founder of Actively AI, doesn’t mince words. He suggests that the early promises of AI sales tools haven’t quite materialized. In a candid conversation with Bitcoin World, Gupta stated that traditional AI sales reps have essentially “failed”. Why? Because they’ve been hyper-focused on “pure volume” – essentially blasting out communications to as many potential customers as possible, hoping something sticks. It’s a spray-and-pray approach that often lacks the nuance and strategic thinking of top human sales professionals. This perceived AI SDR Failure is opening doors for companies like Actively AI to propose smarter, more targeted solutions. Actively AI’s Funding Fuels a New Vision for Sales AI Founded in 2022, Actively AI is positioning itself as a disruptor in the AI sales space. Their recent Actively AI Funding round, totaling $22.5 million ($17.5M Series A led by Bain Capital Ventures and a previously undisclosed $5M seed from First Round Capital), is a strong signal that investors are intrigued by their alternative strategy. Instead of just automating outreach, Actively AI focuses on building custom ‘reasoning’ models. These models are designed to analyze vast amounts of company data and pinpoint the highest-value prospects – essentially mimicking the strategic thinking of elite human salespeople. Here’s a breakdown of Actively AI’s approach: Reasoning-Driven AI: Actively AI leverages advanced ‘reasoning’ technology, a cutting-edge AI technique that enables models to elaborate on their logic and verify their decisions. This is a step beyond simple automation. Custom Models: They don’t offer a one-size-fits-all solution. Actively AI builds bespoke reasoning models tailored to each client’s specific data and sales goals. Focus on High-Value Prospects: The aim isn’t just volume, but quality. Actively AI helps businesses identify and prioritize the leads most likely to convert, maximizing efficiency and ROI. Proven Results: Actively AI claims impressive results, citing examples like fintech giant Ramp, which reportedly generated tens of millions in additional revenue using their platform. The Power of Reasoning AI Models in Sales The rise of Reasoning AI Models is a significant trend in the AI world. It represents a shift from AI simply reacting to data to AI actively thinking and problem-solving. Reasoning AI forces models to not just find patterns, but to understand *why* those patterns exist and make more informed decisions as a result. Think of it as moving from rote memorization to genuine comprehension for AI. This approach is particularly powerful in sales, where understanding customer needs and predicting buying behavior requires more than just surface-level data analysis. Actively AI utilizes a blend of in-house developed models and established reasoning models from AI powerhouses like OpenAI and Anthropic. This hybrid approach allows them to leverage the best of both worlds – proprietary technology and cutting-edge advancements in the broader AI research community. The founders’ backgrounds at Stanford, particularly CEO Mihir Garimella’s expertise in active learning (a field closely related to reasoning), further strengthens Actively AI’s position in this space. Sales Tech Innovation: Is Reasoning the Next Big Thing? Actively AI’s funding round highlights a broader trend: the boom in reasoning models is expanding beyond foundational AI labs to innovative startups. We’re seeing a wave of Sales Tech Innovation driven by this technology. Just last week, Taxo, another startup, secured $5 million in funding for its ‘reasoning engine’ aimed at streamlining healthcare paperwork, demonstrating the versatility of this approach across different industries. Taxo reported reaching $1 million ARR in just six months, hinting at the rapid growth potential of reasoning-powered solutions. While Actively AI remained tight-lipped about their exact ARR, they did mention a tenfold growth in just nine months, suggesting they are on a similar trajectory. The question remains: is reasoning-powered AI truly the game-changer it promises to be, or is it simply the latest buzzword in the ever-evolving world of AI sales tools? Reasoning AI is still relatively nascent, gaining serious traction only in late 2023 with advancements like DeepSeek. However, the early signs, and the investor enthusiasm, are certainly compelling. For now, the promise of ‘GTM Superintelligence’ is capturing attention and investment, signaling a potential shift in how we approach AI in sales.

Traders and investors are watching closely to see whether ADA can bounce back to $0.70 or face further declines towards $0.60. Crypto Market Volatility Drives ADA’s Recent Price Action Over the past few days, Cardano’s price has seen moderate fluctuations. After dipping to a low of $0.663, ADA price briefly rebounded to reach highs of $0.69. Despite these ups and downs, the cryptocurrency closed on the green side, which points to at least some of the buying pressure. The price action states that a general bullish trend was seen where most of the cryptocurrencies moved up, then down. Overall market has remained very unstable and traders have been seen transferring their positions by buying during any falling. Consequently, ADA’s price was able to remain somewhat stable and maintain its position above some important support levels. The 24-hour chart indicates that Cardano’s price is currently sitting just above the $0.68 mark, up by 0.90%. Nevertheless, it is down by about 7.87% in the past week, which hints at poor performance in reversing the downtrend. ADA Price Support and Resistance Levels to Watch Traders are paying close attention to ADA’s key support and resistance levels. The nearest support level is $0.63, which, if broken, will imply further decline in the value, or a possible reversal of the trend if the price retests this level. If Cardano goes below this level, the subsequent level of support may be between $0.60 and $0.61. Any move below $0.63 looks reasonably bearish, and opens the possibility of ADA testing these particular lows. ADA/USD 1-day price chart (Source: tradingView) On the other hand, Cardano must clear its resistance levels to regain bullish momentum. The daily moving averages at $0.73 (200-day moving average) and $0.75 (50-day moving average) are important barriers to watch. As of now, the RSI stands at 46.27, just below the neutral level of 50. An RSI below 50 means that ADA is not yet in a bullish trend, although it could be in the reclaiming process if only the buying pressure rises. At the moment, the MACD Is show a bearish outlook as the MACD line is below the signal line. However, there are signs of weakening bearish momentum, as the histogram shows increasing green bars. This suggests that while the market is still in a bearish phase, ADA may soon experience a bullish reversal if the MACD crosses into positive territory. Moreover, ADA’s price action also forms a Falling Wedge pattern, which is typically considered a bullish reversal pattern despite the death cross formed ealier today threatening a 25% ADA price dip. Analyst Outlook for Cardano’s Price Movement Crypto analysts are mixed in their outlook for Cardano in the short term. Some experts predict that ADA could continue to trade within its established range between $0.63 and $0.75. However, a breakout above the $0.75 resistance could set the stage for a stronger upward move, with some even setting a target of $1 for the next few weeks. Moreover, according to a TradingView analysis shared, Cardano price has been following an established ascending channel pattern over the years. This pattern has historically led to significant price surges when ADA moved between its upper and lower trendlines. In the past, a similar channel saw ADA rise from $0.20 to over $2.70 in 2021. Source: TradingView The TradingView chart suggests that if ADA continues to follow this pattern, it could see significant upside potential in the long term. Analysts believe ADA might push towards $50.48 by the end of 2025, as it follows this channel’s upward trajectory. Such a move would require continued market optimism and strong demand for ADA. On the flip side, analysts like Ali Martinez warn that Cardano is at a critical juncture. If ADA fails to reclaim the $0.70 to $0.80 support zone, it could see a deeper correction. Some experts suggest that ADA might test the lower $0.30s, though this scenario would require a more severe breakdown from current levels.

I'm Ben Schiller. In this issue: Vana launches token standard Hashgraph to debut private blockchain ASICs will look more like servers An interview with Gensyn’s Ben Fielding This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol , our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Network News VANA’S DATA-BACKED TOKEN STANDARD: Crypto enthusiasts might have heard of the ERC-20 token standard, which provides guidelines to ensure that tokens created on the Ethereum smart contract blockchain are compatible and can interact with other tokens and applications within the network. A similar standard for data-backed tokens, called VRC-20, has now emerged. Vana, an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain that helps users monetize personal data by bundling it into DataDAOs for AI model training, introduced the new standard early this week to boost trust and transparency in the market for data-backed digital assets. The VRC-20 standard design includes specific criteria such as fixed supply, governance, and liquidity rules while ensuring real data access by tying tokens to actual data utility. Additionally, it promotes continuous liquidity through rewards that ensure market stability. ""This isn’t speculation. This is real financialization of data,"" Vana noted on X. Vana launched its mainnet in December, with VANA as its native cryptocurrency. Since then, the network has onboarded over 12 million data points through multiple DataDAOs, reflecting strong demand for user-owned data. DataDAOs or data liquidity pools are decentralized marketplaces that bring data on-chain as transferable digital tokens. DLPs are where data is contributed, tokenized and made ready for use in applications such as AI model training. — Omkar Godbole Read more . HASHGRAPH LINES UP Q3 PRIVATE CHAIN: Hashgraph, the blockchain development firm focusing on the Hedera ( HBAR ) network, is building a private, permissioned blockchain for enterprises in highly regulated industries with plans to debut in the third quarter of 2025. HashSphere, built with Hedera's technology, aims to bridge private and public distributed ledgers, ensuring compliance with regulations while maintaining interoperability, the company said Monday . Hashgraph is looking to provide services to asset managers, banks and payment providers seeking secure, low-cost cross-border transactions with stablecoins.While public blockchains offer security and transparency, enterprises in industries like finance and payments often face compliance challenges, particularly with know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. HashSphere addresses this by restricting access to verified participants, enabling firms to develop tokenized assets, AI-powered services and other blockchain-based products while meeting regulatory standards. The network also integrates Hedera’s existing tools, including the Token Service for managing digital assets and the Consensus Service for recording transactions with trusted timestamps. The platform is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to deploy decentralized applications using Solidity and other EVM languages. — Kris Sandor Read more . ASICS TO BE MORE LIKE SERVERS: In the beginning, there were only CPUs, then GPUs, for bitcoin mining. Then came the mighty ASIC in 2013, and with it, the “shoebox” form factor that has become emblematic of the bitcoin mining industry. What comes next? ASIC manufacturers are increasingly betting on a hydro-cooled server rack design to become a substantial portion of bitcoin mining fleets, leaning into the “direct-to-chip” cooling for further efficiency gains. Last September, Bitmain announced its model U3S21EXPH developed in a partnership with Hut 8. Its U3 design means that one unit takes up three spaces in a traditional server rack. MicroBT soon followed with its M63 Hydro series, as did Bitdeer’s Sealminer A2 Hydro unit. Following suit, Auradine released its server rack model, the AH3880, this March. Its U2 design, which occupies two server slots, is a bit smaller, but it packs more hashrate per unit of space at 600 TH/s (or 300 TH/s per slot) versus Bitmain’s 860 TH/s (286.66 TH/s per slot). The benefit of a server rack ASIC lies in standardization. Bitcoin miners are increasingly marching in step with the traditional datacenter industry, and that industry could see 40% adoption of direct liquid-to-chip cooling by 2026, according to data center developer Cyrus One. If miners adopt this design, then theoretically, they can optimize their supply chains by converging on server designs that are becoming best practice in the big-boy data center sector. — Colin Harper, Blockspace Read more . GENSYN CEO BEN FIELDING: Ten years ago, when he was still a young AI researcher beginning his PhD track, Ben Fielding explored how “swarms” of AI — clusters of many different models — could talk to each other and learn from each other, which might improve the collective whole. There was just one problem: He was handcuffed by the realities of that noisy machine beneath his desk. And he knew he was outgunned by Google and other Big Tech. Compute constraints would always be an issue, he realized. The solution? Decentralized AI. Fielding co-founded Gensyn (along with Harry Grieve) in 2020, or years before Decentralized AI became fashionable. The project was initially known for building decentralized compute, but the vision is actually something wider: “The network for machine intelligence.” They’re building solutions up and down the tech stack. And now, a decade after Fielding’s noisy desk annoyed his lab-mates, the early tools of Gensyn are out in the wild. Gensyn recently released its “RL Swarms” protocol (a descendant of Fielding’s PhD work) and just launched its Testnet — which brings blockchain into the fold. Fielding talked with Jeff Wilser about AI Swarms, how blockchain snaps into the puzzle, and shares why all innovators — not just tech giants — “should have the right to build machine learning technologies.” — Jeff Wilser Read more . In Other News Web3 lacks a dedicated memory layer, making its current architecture inefficient and difficult to scale. Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) offers a solution by enhancing data propagation and storage efficiency in decentralized systems. Implementing RLNC can address Web3's scalability challenges by optimizing memory and data access without compromising decentralization, says Muriel Médard, co-founder of Optimum. Read her op-ed here . Ripple, an enterprise-focused blockchain service closely tied to the XRP Ledger (XRP), said on Wednesday it has integrated its stablecoin to the company's cross-border payments system to boost adoption for Ripple USD (RLUSD). Select Ripple Payments customers including cross-border payment providers BKK Forex and iSend are already using the stablecoin to improve their treasury operations, the company said. Ripple plans to further expand the token's availability of its token to payments customers. RLUSD reached a $244 million market capitalization, growing 87% over the past month. — Kris Sandor reports . Regulatory and Policy The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped or paused over a dozen ongoing cases (and lost one) since U.S. President Donald Trump retook office just over two months ago and appointed Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair.

Like many altcoins, LINK has struggled to recover in the face of broader macroeconomic instability and a hostile market environment fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump’s unpredictable policy decisions. Tariffs, trade tensions, and volatile global sentiment have created significant headwinds for high-risk assets, and Chainlink has been no exception. Related Reading: XRP MVRV Ratio Dips Below The 200-Day MA – Trend Shift Underway? Despite the recent weakness, some analysts believe a turnaround may be near — but only if LINK can hold its current support levels. A strong defense here could lay the foundation for a meaningful recovery rally in the weeks ahead. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared new insights on X, highlighting a potentially bullish setup forming on Chainlink’s chart. According to Martinez, LINK is currently consolidating within a triangle pattern, which often precedes major moves. He notes that this structure could be setting up for a significant price move, with a breakout potentially imminent. As LINK coils tighter within this pattern, traders are watching closely. A confirmed breakout from this zone could spark a strong directional move — and possibly mark the beginning of Chainlink’s next major trend. Chainlink Struggles Below Key Levels as Triangle Pattern Signals Imminent Move Chainlink is currently trading below critical resistance levels after losing nearly 30% of its value since late February. The sharp drop has left bulls in a defensive position, struggling to hold prices steady and spark a meaningful recovery. The $13 mark now stands as a crucial support level — a zone that must hold to preserve market structure and investor confidence. A decisive defense of this area could provide the foundation needed for a recovery rally. While selling pressure has dominated in recent weeks, bears have so far failed to break LINK below its current demand zone. This has led to cautious optimism among traders, who see a potential reversal if buyers can defend key levels and reclaim momentum. If LINK maintains support above $13 and gains strength, a push toward higher liquidity zones could quickly follow. However, risks remain. US President Donald Trump’s unpredictable economic policies, especially on tariffs and trade, continue to shake financial markets and drive uncertainty. Crypto, as a high-risk asset class, remains particularly vulnerable to this kind of volatility. Martinez’s technical analysis noted that Chainlink is consolidating within a triangle pattern — a structure that often precedes significant price movements. According to Martinez, this setup could result in a 35% breakout, with $16 identified as the level to watch closely for confirmation. If bulls can reclaim that level, a powerful move higher may follow. For now, all eyes are on the $13 support and the triangle’s upper boundary as Chainlink coils tighter and prepares for its next major move. A breakout — in either direction — appears imminent.

Bulls Hold Support But Battle Key Resistance Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $13.5 after several days of consistent selling pressure, struggling to gain momentum below the critical $16 mark. The current level now acts as a short-term support zone, and bulls must defend it to avoid further downside. A successful hold above this price could offer a foundation for recovery, but the path forward remains challenging. To shift sentiment and reignite bullish momentum, LINK must reclaim the $17.20 level — an area that aligns closely with both the 200-day moving average (MA) and the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). These indicators have historically marked key trend reversals, and a clean breakout above them would signal strength returning to the market. If bulls manage to push LINK above the $18 mark, a strong rally could follow, possibly retesting higher resistance levels and restoring confidence in the broader trend. However, if LINK fails to reclaim these levels in the near term, it risks slipping into a consolidation phase or even experiencing a deeper correction.

42819572,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=704533,1743629434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42819572.jpeg,"Fidelity launches crypto IRAs, allowing retirement investment in Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fidelity-launches-crypto-iras/,"Fidelity Investments has introduced an individual retirement account (IRA) that permits private investors to invest in cryptocurrencies under its web3-focused subsidiary, Fidelity Digital Assets. According to the company’s website, investors can add virtual assets to their retirement portfolio through Fidelity Crypto for IRAs . However, only Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin are the assets available now. Fidelity launches crypto IRAs to quench its growing desire to make cryptocurrency investments There are three types of account registrations for IRAs: Fidelity Crypto Rollover IRA, Fidelity Crypto Traditional IRA, and Fidelity Crypto Roth IRA. Access to these accounts is also restricted. The restrictions indicate that an investor must be a citizen of the United States and at least 18 years old. A Fidelity representative stated that the firm was committed to offering investment products and solutions to respond to its customers’ ever-evolving needs and interests and providing education and support. Moreover, reliable sources previously reported that the introduction of Fidelity’s IRAs with a crypto focus came after the introduction of a number of digital asset investment vehicles, including Volatility Shares’ two exchange-traded funds that track the performance of Solana and proposed funds that track Litecoin, BNB, PENGU, and other tokens. Based on market capitalization, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin rank first, second, and twenty-third, respectively. Before introducing these IRAs, Fidelity Investments had previously concentrated on the token market Fidelity and competitors race to enter the stablecoin market Fidelity Investments was also reviewing the tokenized U.S. Treasury market and testing its own stablecoin in March. This move started after Fidelity filed a request to launch a tokenized version of its U.S. dollar money market fund a few days ago. In addition, an insider said Fidelity Digital Assets was testing a stablecoin it had developed. However, another source cited Fidelity Investments—a $5 trillion asset manager with a crypto focus—as saying it did not currently plan to launch the token. Additionally, the cryptocurrency custodian BitGo introduced its USDS stablecoin in January, and the Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial decentralized finance project announced on March 25 that it would introduce a USD1 stablecoin that is dollar-pegged. Thus, it is worth noting that stablecoins have seen increased usage and expansion among cryptocurrency owners since they were first introduced in 2014. Several companies, including Fidelity, with a background in launching dollar-backed tokens in the United States, are competing to enter the space ahead of lawmakers’ efforts to establish clearer rules for stablecoin issuers. President Trump similarly called for “simple, common-sense rules” for stablecoins at a New York crypto conference. He said the tokens would aid “the dominance of the U.S. dollar.” Last month, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the bipartisan Genius Act, legislation that would create new stablecoin regulations. However, the bill isn’t expected to gain much support in the Senate. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The ever-vocal Justin Sun has dropped a bombshell, alleging that First Digital Trust (FDT), a Hong Kong-based crypto custodian, is facing insolvency. This explosive claim has sent ripples through the crypto community, especially concerning the stability of TrueUSD (TUSD) reserves. Let’s dive into the details of this developing story and understand what it means for you and the broader crypto landscape. Urgent Allegations of FDT Insolvency by Justin Sun In a startling announcement via X (formerly Twitter), Justin Sun, the influential founder of Tron (TRX), didn’t mince words. He directly accused First Digital Trust (FDT) of being insolvent. According to Sun, this insolvency has led to a critical situation where FDT is reportedly unable to process client fund redemptions. This is a serious allegation that immediately raises concerns about the security of assets held by FDT and the overall health of the crypto custodian sector. Sun didn’t stop there. He urged users who have assets with FDT to take immediate and decisive action to safeguard their funds. This call to action underscores the urgency and potential severity of the situation. But what exactly are the implications of FDT insolvency , and why is Justin Sun so concerned? Hong Kong Crypto Regulation Under Scrutiny Justin Sun’s accusations go beyond just FDT. He directly questioned the robustness of Hong Kong crypto regulation . Sun pointed out what he believes are “significant loopholes” in Hong Kong’s trust licensing approval process. He further criticized the internal risk management within Hong Kong’s financial system, suggesting systemic weaknesses that need immediate attention. Here are the key points Sun raised regarding regulatory concerns: Licensing Loopholes: Sun claims the current licensing process for crypto trusts in Hong Kong has significant vulnerabilities. This could allow undercapitalized or poorly managed entities to operate within the system. Risk Management Deficiencies: He alleges weaknesses in the internal risk management frameworks of Hong Kong’s financial institutions, potentially leading to inadequate safeguards for client assets. Systemic Implications: Sun’s concerns extend to the broader financial system in Hong Kong, suggesting that these issues are not isolated to just one entity. Sun called for immediate intervention from regulators and law enforcement agencies to address these issues. He stressed the need for prompt action to prevent further losses and to protect Hong Kong’s standing as a global financial hub. The stakes are high, and the implications could be far-reaching. TUSD Liquidity Crisis and the $500 Million Question The unfolding situation with FDT has direct consequences for TrueUSD (TUSD). Reportedly, around $500 million of TUSD reserves are currently facing a TUSD liquidity crisis due to FDT’s alleged problems. This is a substantial amount, and any disruption to TUSD’s liquidity can impact its peg to the US dollar and potentially trigger wider market instability. To understand the connection, it’s crucial to know the players involved: Entity Role Techteryx Issuer of TrueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin. First Digital Trust (FDT) Manages the reserves that back TUSD. With FDT facing insolvency, the management of TUSD reserves is thrown into question. If FDT cannot fulfill its obligations, it directly impacts the accessibility and liquidity of these reserves, hence the current crisis. Justin Sun’s Emergency Funds and Crypto Custodian Risk In a move that highlights the severity of the situation, Justin Sun is reported to have provided emergency funds to mitigate the immediate liquidity crunch. While the details of these funds are still emerging, this action suggests a significant intervention to stabilize the situation and potentially prevent a more widespread fallout. This incident throws a spotlight on crypto custodian risk . Custodians like FDT play a critical role in the crypto ecosystem by holding and managing digital assets on behalf of clients. Their solvency and operational integrity are paramount. The FDT situation raises crucial questions about the risks associated with entrusting assets to custodians and the due diligence required when selecting these services. Here are some key takeaways regarding crypto custodian risk: Counterparty Risk: Relying on a custodian introduces counterparty risk – the risk that the custodian may fail to meet its obligations, as alleged in the FDT case. Regulatory Oversight: The effectiveness of regulatory oversight of crypto custodians is brought into question. Are current regulations sufficient to protect client assets? Transparency and Audits: The need for greater transparency and independent audits of custodians becomes even more critical to ensure accountability and build trust. Diversification: Users might need to consider diversifying their custodial arrangements to mitigate risks associated with a single point of failure. What Should Crypto Users Do? Actionable Insights The Justin Sun-FDT situation serves as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in the crypto space. Here are some actionable insights for crypto users: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments regarding FDT and TUSD. Monitor official announcements and credible news sources. Assess Custodial Risks: If you use custodial services, understand the risks involved. Research the custodian’s regulatory compliance, financial health, and security practices. Consider Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your holdings and custodial arrangements if possible. Due Diligence: Before using any crypto service, conduct thorough due diligence. Don’t rely solely on marketing materials; look for independent reviews and verifiable information. Self-Custody: For those comfortable with the responsibility, consider self-custody of your crypto assets using hardware wallets or secure software wallets. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Regulation and Custody Justin Sun’s allegations against First Digital Trust (FDT) are a serious development that demands close attention from the crypto community, regulators, and users alike. The potential insolvency of a crypto custodian and the ensuing TUSD liquidity crisis highlight the vulnerabilities within the current system. The questions raised about Hong Kong crypto regulation are critical and need to be addressed urgently to maintain trust and stability in the market. This situation serves as a powerful wake-up call, emphasizing the need for robust regulatory frameworks, transparent custodial practices, and vigilant risk management in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency.

RSR, which is already listed on major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Upbit, has been added to the listing roadmap with its version on the Base network. The Base network is a layer-2 blockchain created by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase itself. The Reserve Right project can be described as a DeFi token, with the aim of overcollateralizing its stablecoins (RTokens) through staking and governing them through proposing and voting on changes to their structure. The altcoin, which was launched before 2020, is trading 94% lower than its all-time high. RSR, which currently has a market cap of $357 million, saw its peak in price during the 2021 bull run, but its peak in market cap was $1.4 billion last April. *Not investment advice.

42819541,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145692,1743630035,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent AI Safety Paper: DeepMind’s AGI Warning Sparks Critical Skepticism,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/deepmind-agi-safety-paper-skepticism/,"In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, where breakthroughs seem to happen daily, Google DeepMind has dropped a bombshell – a comprehensive 145-page paper dedicated to AGI safety . For those in the crypto space keeping an eye on technological disruptions, this is big news. Why? Because the implications of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could reshape everything, including the digital landscape we’re building with blockchain and cryptocurrencies. But is this detailed report enough to quell the growing concerns, or will it only fuel the fire of skepticism? DeepMind’s Deep Dive into AGI Safety: What’s the Alarm? DeepMind’s extensive paper tackles a subject that’s been brewing in the AI community for years: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). AGI, in simple terms, is AI that can perform any intellectual task a human being can. While some dismiss it as science fiction, major players like Anthropic are sounding the alarm, warning that AGI isn’t a distant dream but a looming reality. DeepMind, echoing these concerns, predicts AGI could arrive as soon as 2030 and highlights the potential for “severe harm,” even mentioning “existential risks” – scenarios that could, in the most extreme case, wipe out humanity. Key takeaways from DeepMind’s AGI safety paper: AGI by 2030: DeepMind anticipates “Exceptional AGI” within this decade, defined as AI surpassing 99% of skilled adults in non-physical and metacognitive tasks. Severe Harm Potential: The paper warns of significant dangers, including extreme, though vaguely defined, “existential risks.” Recursive AI Improvement: DeepMind acknowledges the plausibility of AI systems enhancing themselves, leading to potentially uncontrollable intelligence growth. This isn’t just another tech paper; it’s a stark warning from one of the leading AI labs about the potential downsides of their own creations. For crypto enthusiasts, understanding these risks is crucial as AI and blockchain technologies increasingly converge. AI Risk Mitigation: DeepMind’s Approach vs. Competitors Interestingly, DeepMind’s paper doesn’t shy away from comparing its AI risk mitigation strategies with those of other major AI labs, Anthropic and OpenAI. According to the paper, DeepMind emphasizes “robust training, monitoring, and security” more strongly than Anthropic. They also express reservations about OpenAI’s optimism in automating AI alignment research – the crucial process of ensuring AI goals align with human values. Furthermore, DeepMind casts doubt on the near-term emergence of superintelligent AI – AI surpassing human capabilities in all domains, a concept OpenAI recently shifted its focus towards. DeepMind suggests that without “significant architectural innovation,” superintelligence may not be on the immediate horizon, if ever. DeepMind’s Comparative Stance on AI Safety: Approach DeepMind Anthropic OpenAI Emphasis on Robust Training, Monitoring, Security High Lower (as per DeepMind) – Automation of Alignment Research Skeptical – Bullish (as per DeepMind) Near-term Superintelligence Doubtful – Focus Shift (from AGI) This comparative analysis highlights the varying perspectives within the AI industry on managing potential dangers, a discussion that’s vital for anyone concerned about the future impact of advanced technologies. Artificial General Intelligence: A Real Threat or Just Hype? Despite DeepMind’s detailed report, skepticism about the imminence and even the definition of Artificial General Intelligence persists. Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at AI Now Institute, argues that the very concept of AGI is too vaguely defined to be scientifically evaluated. This raises a crucial question: are we chasing a phantom threat, or is the danger very real? Matthew Guzdial, an AI researcher at the University of Alberta, further challenges a key concern raised in DeepMind’s paper – recursive AI improvement. Guzdial states that there’s no evidence to support the idea of AI autonomously and exponentially improving itself, a concept central to singularity arguments. Expert Skepticism on AGI and Recursive Improvement: AGI Definition Concerns: Experts like Heidy Khlaaf question the scientific rigor of the AGI concept itself. Recursive Improvement Doubts: Matthew Guzdial points out the lack of empirical evidence for AI’s self-improvement leading to runaway intelligence. This skepticism is important. In the crypto world, we’re used to navigating hype cycles and distinguishing between genuine innovation and overblown promises. A critical approach to claims about AGI, even from major labs, is warranted. The Danger of Recursive AI Improvement: A Double-Edged Sword? DeepMind’s paper emphasizes the potential peril of “recursive AI improvement,” where AI systems become capable of designing even more advanced AI. This feedback loop, they argue, could lead to unforeseen and potentially harmful levels of intelligence. While Matthew Guzdial remains skeptical about its immediate feasibility, the concept itself raises valid concerns. Imagine AI not just automating tasks, but automating its own evolution – the implications are staggering. However, even if full recursive self-improvement is distant, a related and perhaps more immediate risk is AI reinforcing its own errors. Sandra Wachter, an Oxford researcher, highlights the danger of AI models learning from their own “hallucinations” or inaccurate outputs proliferating online. As generative AI floods the internet with AI-generated content, future AI models risk being trained on data polluted with inaccuracies, creating a cycle of misinformation. Concerns around AI Self-Improvement and Data Pollution: Recursive Improvement Risks: Even if not immediately likely, the concept of AI designing smarter AI raises long-term safety questions. AI Hallucination Feedback Loop: A more present danger is AI models learning from inaccurate AI-generated content, perpetuating and amplifying errors. Impact on Truth and Search: As chatbots become search tools, the risk of users being misled by convincingly presented “mistruths” increases. For the crypto community, which values verifiable truth and decentralization, the prospect of AI-driven misinformation and the erosion of reliable data sources is particularly concerning. It underscores the need for robust verification mechanisms and critical evaluation of AI-generated information. Navigating AGI Safety : DeepMind’s Proposed Path Forward Despite the skepticism, DeepMind’s paper doesn’t just raise alarms; it also proposes solutions. They advocate for developing techniques to: Restrict access for bad actors: Preventing malicious entities from controlling or exploiting hypothetical AGI. Improve AI understanding: Developing methods to better comprehend how AI systems make decisions and take actions – crucial for accountability and control. Harden AI environments: Creating secure and controlled environments in which AI operates to limit potential harm. DeepMind acknowledges that these are nascent areas of research with many “open problems.” However, they stress the urgency of addressing these AI safety challenges proactively. Their core message is clear: the transformative potential of AGI demands responsible development and careful planning to mitigate potential “severe harms.” The AGI Debate: Unsettled and Urgent Ultimately, DeepMind’s extensive paper, while comprehensive, is unlikely to definitively resolve the ongoing debates surrounding AGI . The questions of when, or even if, true Artificial General Intelligence will arrive, and what the most pressing AI risk factors are, remain open and hotly contested. What is clear is that the conversation is crucial, and DeepMind’s contribution serves as a vital catalyst for continued discussion and research. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, these discussions are not abstract academic exercises. The technologies we are building and investing in are converging with AI in profound ways. Understanding the potential benefits and, crucially, the potential risks of advanced AI is essential for navigating the future of technology and ensuring a safe and prosperous digital world.

The three accounts — a tax-deferred traditional IRA and two Roth IRAs (one is a rollover) — permit the buying and selling of Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), and Litecoin ( LTC ). While there are no fees to open or maintain the accounts, Fidelity charges a 1% spread on the execution price of crypto buy and sell transactions. The crypto IRAs are offered by Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary of Fidelity that has traditionally offered institutional investors the opportunity to buy and sell crypto. The broadening of its client base may be another signal of the changing crypto landscape in the United States, which has seen the adoption of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and multiple companies, including stablecoin issuer Circle , filing for an initial public offering. Fidelity states that, for security, it holds the majority of its crypto in cold storage, which consists of crypto wallets not connected to the internet . Related: Bitcoin ETFs for retirement planning: A beginner’s guide BTC and ETH exposure already offered for retirement accounts While the direct purchase of cryptocurrencies in an IRA has never been strictly prohibited, few IRA providers have allowed such purchases, according to Investopedia. Therefore, Fidelity’s new IRAs may signal a change in the environment. Still, for enthusiasts of BTC and ETH, there have been other options since 2024, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of those corresponding coins. Since the debut of those ETFs, investors in the US have been able to gain exposure to crypto markets from their retirement accounts — depending on the brokerage. There has also been the rise of Bitcoin IRAs , which are self-directed retirement accounts that offer tax advantages. Some crypto companies offer digital-asset-specific IRAs like BitIRA, where individuals can add altcoins such as LTC to their retirement portfolios.

For years, cryptocurrency enthusiasts have dreamed of seamlessly integrating digital assets into their long-term savings. Now, that dream is becoming a reality. Leading financial giant Fidelity has just dropped a game-changer into the crypto space: a no-fee crypto IRA . Yes, you heard that right – zero fees to invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin within a tax-advantaged retirement account! Let’s dive into what this monumental announcement means for you and the future of crypto investing. What Exactly is a Crypto IRA and Why is Fidelity’s No-Fee Offering a Big Deal? For those new to the concept, a crypto IRA is essentially a retirement account that allows you to hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, within the familiar structure of an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). This is significant because traditional IRAs offer substantial tax benefits, helping your investments grow more effectively over time. Think of it as combining the explosive potential of crypto with the time-tested advantages of retirement savings. Now, why is Fidelity’s entry so noteworthy? Several reasons make this a landmark moment: No-Fee Structure: This is the headline grabber. Many existing crypto IRA providers charge hefty fees, eating into your potential returns. Fidelity’s no-fee model democratizes access to crypto IRAs , making it far more appealing to a broader audience. Reputable Institution: Fidelity is a financial powerhouse with decades of experience and a sterling reputation. Their involvement lends immense credibility to the crypto IRA space, potentially attracting more mainstream investors who may have been hesitant before. Direct Crypto Investment: Fidelity’s offering allows for direct investment in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. This is different from some indirect crypto exposure through stocks or ETFs. You’re holding the actual digital assets within your IRA. Tax Advantages: By utilizing Roth, traditional, or rollover IRA structures, investors can benefit from tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (traditional), maximizing the long-term potential of their Bitcoin IRA and other crypto holdings. Delving Deeper: Fidelity’s Crypto IRA – Key Features and Benefits Let’s unpack the specifics of Fidelity’s groundbreaking crypto IRA offering: Supported Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin Currently, Fidelity’s platform supports investment in three of the most established and widely recognized cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC): The original cryptocurrency and the undisputed market leader. Often seen as digital gold and a store of value. Ethereum (ETH): The leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum is not just a currency but a powerful ecosystem. Litecoin (LTC): An early altcoin designed for faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to Bitcoin. Often referred to as the “silver” to Bitcoin’s “gold.” While the initial offering is focused on these three, the crypto landscape is constantly evolving. It remains to be seen if Fidelity will expand the list of supported cryptocurrencies in the future, potentially including other prominent assets or emerging tokens. Robust Security: Cold Storage for Peace of Mind Security is paramount when dealing with digital assets. Fidelity addresses this concern head-on by employing cold storage for all crypto assets held within their IRAs. Cold storage means that your Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are kept offline, significantly reducing the risk of hacking and theft. This is a crucial feature, especially for long-term retirement savings where security and peace of mind are non-negotiable. Think of it like storing physical gold in a vault versus keeping it in your pocket. Cold storage is the digital equivalent of a highly secure vault, ensuring the safety of your Ethereum IRA and other crypto holdings. Flexible IRA Options: Roth, Traditional, and Rollover Fidelity’s crypto IRA supports the three main types of IRAs, providing flexibility to suit different financial situations and retirement goals: Roth IRA: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal for those who anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. A Roth Bitcoin IRA allows your crypto gains to grow tax-free and be withdrawn tax-free in retirement. Traditional IRA: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investment gains are tax-deferred until retirement. Suitable for those who want to reduce their current taxable income and are comfortable paying taxes in retirement. A traditional Ethereum IRA provides tax-deferred growth on your crypto investments. Rollover IRA: Allows you to roll over funds from other retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s, into a crypto IRA without triggering immediate tax consequences. This can be a strategic option for consolidating retirement savings and diversifying into digital assets. Choosing the right IRA type depends on your individual circumstances and tax planning. Consulting with a financial advisor is always recommended to determine the most suitable approach for your retirement strategy. Why the Demand for Tax-Advantaged Crypto Options is Surging The rising demand for tax-advantaged crypto options is no surprise. Several factors are driving this trend: Mainstream Adoption of Crypto: Cryptocurrencies are moving beyond the fringes and becoming increasingly mainstream. As more people become familiar and comfortable with digital assets, they naturally seek ways to integrate them into their broader financial plans, including retirement. Desire for Portfolio Diversification: Investors are constantly looking for ways to diversify their portfolios and reduce risk. Cryptocurrencies, with their low correlation to traditional assets like stocks and bonds, offer a compelling diversification opportunity. Including a Bitcoin IRA or Ethereum IRA can enhance portfolio diversification. Long-Term Growth Potential: Many believe that cryptocurrencies, despite their volatility, have significant long-term growth potential. Investing in a tax-advantaged crypto account allows investors to capitalize on this potential while mitigating tax liabilities. Regulatory Clarity (Slowly Emerging): While regulatory frameworks are still evolving, there is a growing trend towards clearer regulations around cryptocurrencies. This increasing clarity provides more comfort and confidence for institutional players like Fidelity to enter the market and for individuals to invest in tax-advantaged crypto solutions. Navigating the Crypto IRA Landscape: Potential Benefits and Challenges Investing in a crypto IRA , especially through Fidelity’s no-fee platform, offers a range of potential benefits, but it’s also crucial to be aware of the challenges: Potential Benefits: Tax Advantages: The most significant benefit is the tax-advantaged nature of IRAs. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth. This can significantly boost your long-term returns on crypto investments. Long-Term Growth Potential: Cryptocurrencies, despite volatility, have the potential for substantial long-term growth. A crypto IRA allows you to participate in this growth within a retirement savings framework. Portfolio Diversification: Adding crypto to your retirement portfolio can enhance diversification and potentially reduce overall portfolio risk. Accessibility and Convenience: Fidelity’s platform provides a user-friendly and accessible way to invest in crypto IRAs , backed by a trusted financial institution. Potential Challenges: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. The value of your Bitcoin IRA or Ethereum IRA can fluctuate significantly, especially in the short term. Long-term investment horizons are crucial for mitigating volatility risk. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the crypto market and crypto IRAs . Security Risks (Though Mitigated by Fidelity’s Cold Storage): While Fidelity employs cold storage, security risks in the crypto space are ever-present. It’s essential to understand the inherent risks associated with digital assets. Complexity: Cryptocurrencies and IRAs can be complex topics. Investors need to educate themselves and potentially seek professional financial advice to navigate this space effectively. Is a Fidelity No-Fee Crypto IRA Right For You? The decision to invest in a Fidelity crypto IRA depends on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Here are some considerations: This Might Be For You If: You are a long-term investor with a high-risk tolerance. You believe in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. You are looking for tax-advantaged ways to invest in crypto for retirement. You are comfortable with the volatility and regulatory uncertainties associated with crypto assets. You want to diversify your retirement portfolio beyond traditional assets. This Might Not Be For You If: You are risk-averse and uncomfortable with market volatility. You are close to retirement and cannot afford significant investment losses. You do not understand cryptocurrencies or are not willing to educate yourself. You are looking for short-term gains or day-trading opportunities (IRAs are for long-term retirement savings). Taking the Plunge: How to Get Started with a Fidelity Crypto IRA If you’ve decided that a Fidelity crypto IRA aligns with your investment strategy, here are the general steps to get started (refer to Fidelity’s official website for the most up-to-date and specific instructions): Open a Fidelity Account: If you are not already a Fidelity customer, you will need to open an account. Choose Your IRA Type: Decide whether a Roth, traditional, or rollover IRA is the most suitable for your needs. Fund Your IRA: You can contribute funds to your IRA through various methods, such as bank transfers or rollovers from other retirement accounts. Navigate to the Crypto IRA Section: Once your account is set up and funded, navigate to the section within Fidelity’s platform dedicated to crypto IRAs . Select Cryptocurrencies: Choose the cryptocurrencies you want to invest in (currently Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin). Place Your Trades: Execute your trades to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin within your IRA. Monitor Your Investments: Regularly monitor the performance of your crypto IRA and make adjustments as needed based on your investment strategy and market conditions. Actionable Insight: Before investing, thoroughly research Fidelity crypto IRA offering on their official website, understand the terms and conditions, and consider consulting with a qualified financial advisor to ensure it aligns with your overall financial plan. Conclusion: A Revolutionary Step Towards Crypto Retirement Fidelity’s launch of a no-fee crypto IRA is a monumental step forward for the cryptocurrency industry and for individual investors seeking to incorporate digital assets into their retirement savings. By offering a secure, tax-advantaged, and fee-free way to invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, Fidelity is breaking down barriers and making crypto IRAs more accessible than ever before. While challenges and risks remain inherent in the crypto market, this move signals a significant maturation of the space and opens up exciting new possibilities for building a diversified and future-proof retirement portfolio. The era of tax-advantaged crypto retirement savings is truly upon us, and Fidelity is leading the charge.

Trading volumes increased more than 13% from the first quarter of 2024, largely due to a surge in transactions, from around 1.8 million to some 5.5 million in Q1 2025, Curve said. The strong Q1 volumes come amid overall declines in the cryptocurrency market, with the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies dropping by more than 20% in the year-to-date as of March 31, according to data from CoinGecko. Curve’s total value locked (TVL) over time. Source: DefiLlama Related: Curve Finance launches ‘Savings crvUSD’ yield-bearing stablecoin Changing DeFi Landscape Launched in 2020, Curve has taken numerous steps in the past year to keep pace with the changing decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. In June 2024, Curve adopted crvUSD, its stablecoin, for fee distribution to tokenholders , replacing an older model that paid holders in shares of the 3crv liquidity pool. In November, Curve partnered with Elixir , a blockchain network, to help onboard BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, to DeFi. By the end of 2025, Curve plans to consolidate its lending markets into a single user interface and provide borrowers with more time to close positions before they are liquidated, it told Cointelegraph. Curve founder Michael Egorov said in March that he expects many decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to evolve into bespoke platforms for stablecoins pegged to various currency denominations. ""Exchanges between stablecoins of different denominations like the euro, US dollar, and others are not yet properly solved. How to provide liquidity without losing money, but while earning a lot of money, is kind of an open question that I think will be solved soon,” Egorov said. Despite the rise in transactions, the total value locked (TVL) on Curve’s platform is approximately $1.8 billion as of April 2, according to data from DefILlama, down from highs of roughly $2.5 billion at the start of the year. Curve’s native token, Curve DAO ( CRV ), has a market capitalization of approximately $640 million at this writing, marking a more than 40% decline in the year-to-date, according to data from Cointelegraph.

However, despite renewed optimism, many investors are eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE—a new project that’s not just gaining momentum but is projected to deliver up to 40x returns before Ethereum completes its next major breakout. Ethereum Shows Signs of Recovery, But Faces Resistance at $2,100 ETH is currently trading at $1,901 , with analysts pointing to a potential bull run if the asset can reclaim key resistance levels. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is signaling a possible reversal, while trading volumes are climbing—suggesting an increase in buying pressure. However, despite the uptick in activity, Ethereum is still grappling with reduced on-chain demand. Network fees have fallen to a five-year low , a concerning sign that reflects declining usage. This mirrors Ethereum’s 53% price drop during the November 2024 rally. Unless Ethereum can reclaim the $2,100 level—a resistance point that would put over 12.3 million ETH back in profit and more than $26 billion at risk—its bullish momentum may remain limited. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Already Raised $4.8 Million, Phase 6 Nearing 95% Sellout While Ethereum battles resistance and uncertain fundamentals, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly emerging as one of the fastest-growing and safest investment opportunities of 2025. The project has already raised over $4.8 million , with Phase 6 of the presale 95% sold out . Unlike many new crypto projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE has undergone a full audit by Hashex Blockchain Audit , one of the most trusted names in smart contract security. This level of transparency and security has boosted investor confidence, making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the few projects combining growth potential with peace of mind. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Deliver a 40x ROI Faster Than Ethereum With Ethereum’s price needing to break above $2,100 just to maintain momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a different kind of opportunity. Early backers are getting in at a low entry price during the presale, with analysts projecting that the token could hit the $1 milestone in 2025. That translates to a potential 40x return for investors who act now—far more than what Ethereum is expected to generate in the same timeframe. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s momentum isn’t built on hype alone. Its robust tokenomics, strategic roadmap, and fully audited smart contract make it one of the most compelling projects in the current market landscape. In a time when safety and high upside are rare to find together, MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers both.

Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is experiencing explosive investor demand, rapid fundraising success, and has ticked every box for security and sustainability. Investors looking for the next big opportunity—before the market goes mainstream—are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE. And with the presale moving fast, the window to get in early is quickly closing.

In the last 24 hours SOL crashed from $138 to $131, wiping out gains from a mid-March rally. Technical charts show a bearish rejection at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level ($146.5) and warn of potential declines toward $110—or even $100—if selling momentum picks up. In the meantime, another Solana competitor, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is taking advantage of investor hunger for high-growth alternatives. Currently in phase 4, MUTM has raised $6 million with 7,700 holders and has been projected returns of 25,230% after launching. Solana’s Fall from Grace Deepens Market structure on Solana tips select bears. The token’s failure to overcome the $146.5 resistance level resulted in a 5% intraday drop, adding to a 16% monthly decline. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and other momentum indicators rest near neutral regions, however, dissipating relative buying volume reveals bears control both the hourly and daily charts. Artemis data shows daily transactions and active addresses—two important metrics for network utility—have plummeted since January, after the demand for Solana-based meme coins cooled. The $130 support level now is closely watched by traders, with a breakdown potentially validating short-term bear targets around $100. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Ferocious Momentum As the native SOL digital currency of Solana has faltered, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform for DeFi is becoming a magnet for capital seeking explosive gains. The phase 4 presale with a token price of $0.025 is selling out fast, before a 20% price increase to $0.03 is introduced in phase 5. There is a potential 140% return for early participants at launch when MUTM is listed at $0.06 on exchanges. The real attraction, though, comes in post-launch predictions. Using a peer-to-peer lending model that generates demand using revenue-driven buybacks, experts predict MUTM to soar to $6.30—a 25,230% increase from its current presale price. Such growth trajectory mirrors presale performance: since fundraising began 7,700 holders have been onboarded, powered by the platform’s real-world utility in decentralized lending and borrowing. Mutuum Finance Mechanics Drive Long-Term Demand Mutuum Finance stands out with structural tokenomics that use mechanisms that align incentives between users. Its lending protocol mints mtTokens — interest-earning, asset-backed tokens representing user deposits — which accrue value over a period of time and can be traded on DeFi platforms. For instance, 20% of platform fees are used to purchase MUTM tokens in the free market and redistribute them to stakers. This establishes perpetual buy demand, shielding the token from severe sell pressure. Security is a top priority still, obviously, and Mutuum’s smart contracts are currently being audited by Certik. Confident that the results of the audit, once they have been finalized, will be released publicly, restoring investor confidence. Fourth Round of Presale Almost Sold Out Investors have few days remaining to snag MUTM for $0.025 before phase 4 ends. 20% price up-shift is next stage minimizes window for maximizing pre-launch gains. So, also considering historical data, presale tokens commanding strong utility with a buyback mechanism frequently have better post-listing performance compared with other speculative competitors. Mutuum’s new wave DeFi, transparent tokenomics, and aggressive demand drivers configures it to ride this trend. For those who have been sidelined by Solana’s instability, MUTM represents a strategic pivot toward calculated, high-yield opportunities. Act Before Phase 4 Closes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is revolutionizing DeFi invest through real world utility and mathematically backed growth. As such, with the Certik audit already at its final stages and exchange listings on the horizon, the project is ready to build off its $6 million presale foundation to create a multi-chain lending hub. For investors looking for a safer alternative amidst Solana’s recent uncertainty, they can join the presale through Mutuum’s official platform. With phase 4 adding more and more investors, it means you risk the highest entry point before a possible 25,230% surge if you delay things.

Circle files for Initial Public Offering planned for April USDC ( USDC ) stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1 to go public later this month on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “CRCL.” Its Form S-1 registration statement didn’t detail the number of shares it would offer or what its initial public offering target price would be, but it did shed some light on the firm’s financials. The filing shows Circle’s revenue last year was $1.67 billion in revenue for 2024, a 16% year-on-year bump, while its 2024 net income was $155.6 million — a 41.8% fall from 2023.

It’s a similar story in XRP price analysis, where bulls are holding ground but struggling to push beyond $2.48. While both cryptos test familiar levels, BlockDAG (BDAG) is shaking things up. In its latest AMA, the team revealed a $60,000 Testnet Incentive Campaign,for its Beta Testnet. The prize pool will be shared among 30 wallets based on mining, activity, and holdings. With the presale already crossing $210 million, the campaign is giving BlockDAG even more momentum as it pushes toward its $600 million target. Ethereum (ETH) Price Needs a Clean Break Above $2,100 The Ethereum (ETH) price recently climbed back above $2,000, briefly touching $2,104 before settling near short-term resistance. ETH remains above $2,020 and is supported by a trendline around $2,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. To keep climbing, bulls need to push past resistance levels at $2,080 and $2,100. If they succeed, Ethereum could aim for $2,200 or higher. But if the move stalls, there’s a risk of a pullback toward $2,025 or even $2,000. If that support fails, ETH could revisit the $1,950 zone in the near term. XRP Price Analysis: Bulls Hit a Wall Near $2.48 The latest XRP price analysis shows the coin is finding resistance near $2.50. XRP had managed to rise above $2.40 and $2.42 but lost steam and slipped below a key support line at $2.43. Right now, if XRP can’t regain momentum and push past $2.48, the next stop could be around $2.40, with further downside toward $2.35. On the flip side, a move above $2.50 could kick off another rally, with $2.55 and even $2.65 possible if buying pressure builds. BlockDAG Unveils $60K Incentive Campaign Ahead of Beta Testnet Launch BlockDAG’s most recent AMA came with a big update: a $60K Testnet Incentive Campaign tied to the launch of its Beta Testnet. The initiative is clearly designed to gear up for the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE), focusing on testing and real user engagement instead of hype. The campaign will reward 30 users based on three categories—top wallet activity, top BDAG miners, and wallet balances. It’s a smart way to test how the network handles transactions, smart contracts, and user interaction under pressure. This move gives the team vital performance data ahead of mainnet launch. And judging by the buzz, it”s already hitting the right note. The presale has soared past $210 million, with 18.9 billion BDAG coins already sold. Now in batch 27, the price has surged 2,380%—from just $0.001 to $0.0248. That kind of growth is making headlines, and more buyers are starting to view BlockDAG as the best crypto coin to buy ahead of major exchange listings. With a $600 million goal on the horizon, and interest accelerating, buyers are moving quickly to grab BDAG while they still can. Summing Up! The Ethereum (ETH) price is still hanging around $2,000, but unless it clears $2,100, it’s tough to call the next move. Similarly, XRP price analysis suggests a waiting game, with buyers needing to step up before it can breach $2.48. In contrast, BlockDAG is creating waves with its $60K testnet giveaway. But this isn’t just another promo—it’s a chance to stress-test the network and reward users for real activity. Only 30 wallets will win, and with the Beta Testnet live on March 28, the race is on. As the presale inches closer to the $600 million mark, the window to grab BDAG at its current price is narrowing fast. For those looking to get in early, this may be the best time to move.

Sun also called for regulators to step in and take action to prevent further losses and save Hong Kong’s reputation as a financial power. “First Digital Trust (FDT) is effectively insolvent and unable to fulfill client fund redemptions. I strongly recommend that users take immediate action to secure their assets. There are significant loopholes in both the trust licensing process in Hong Kong and the internal risk management of its financial system. I urge regulators and law enforcement to take swift action to address these issues and prevent further major losses. Hong Kong’s reputation as a global financial center is at stake, and similar financial fraud incidents must never happen again.” FDUSD dipped to about $0.949 earlier in the day but has since recovered and is trading for $0.982 at time of writing, a decrease of 1.27% during the last 24 hours. In response, the FDUSD has denied Sun’s claims and will pursue legal action to defend its reputation. “The recent allegations by Justin Sun against First Digital Trust are completely false. This dispute is with TUSD and not with FDUSD. First Digital is completely solvent. Every dollar backing FDUSD is completely, secure, safe and accounted for with US-backed T-Bills. The exact ISIN numbers of all of the reserves of FDUSD are set out in our attestation report and clearly accounted for. This is a typical Justin Sun smear campaign to try to attack a competitor to his business. As we told the reporter at CoinDesk, we have not yet had the opportunity to defend ourselves and instead of letting the TUSD matter be dealt with in court, Justin has instead resorted to a coordinated social media effort to try to damage FDUSD as a business competitor. FDT will pursue legal action to protect its rights and reputation.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to Alphractal, altcoins remain in the accumulation phase, and a potential Altcoin Season could emerge if Bitcoin (BTC) stumbles. The firm noted that the crypto market has been in a downtrend since October 2024, with sentiment turning increasingly pessimistic since December. Despite this, Alphractal predicts a market revival between April and May, even if BTC suffers further declines. The firm also highlighted the potential for new crypto launches in 2025, particularly in the GameFi and DeFi sectors, which could gain traction by mid-year. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Announces to List a New Altcoin with Experimental Label BTC recently surpassed $85,000, but Alphractal’s analysis shows that whales are increasingly opting for short positions over long positions.

42820506,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145703,1743631813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Defying Price Drops: Bitcoin ETFs Poised for a $3 Billion Inflow Surge in Q2,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etfs-q2-inflow-surge/,"Despite a rollercoaster ride in the crypto market, particularly for Bitcoin (BTC), there’s a silver lining emerging from an unexpected corner: Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). While Bitcoin experienced a 13% price dip in the first quarter of 2025, Bitcoin ETFs have shown remarkable resilience, attracting over $1 billion in inflows. This surprising trend has industry analysts buzzing, with projections hinting at an even more substantial surge in the second quarter. Are we witnessing a paradigm shift in how institutions are engaging with crypto, or is this a fleeting phenomenon? Let’s dive deep into the factors fueling this ETF enthusiasm and what it could mean for the future of crypto investment. Why are Bitcoin ETFs Bucking the Trend? In the volatile world of cryptocurrency, market sentiment can shift in the blink of an eye. The first quarter of 2025 saw its fair share of market jitters, contributing to a notable drop in Bitcoin’s price. Yet, amidst this price downturn, Bitcoin ETFs stood out as beacons of investor confidence. How did they manage to attract such significant capital during a period of price weakness? Several factors are at play: Institutional Appetite is Growing: Experts like Bitwise analyst Juan Leon point to a clear increase in institutional demand for crypto exposure. Bitcoin ETFs offer a regulated and accessible gateway for institutions to enter the Bitcoin market without the complexities of direct crypto ownership and custody. Easing Regulatory Concerns: The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs themselves signal a significant shift in regulatory acceptance. This newfound clarity provides a more comfortable investment environment for larger financial players who were previously hesitant due to regulatory uncertainty. Beyond Arbitrage: While some Q1 inflows might have been attributed to arbitrage strategies, analysts believe the underlying driver is deeper. The long-term investment thesis around Bitcoin and its potential as a store of value is gaining traction, particularly among traditional financial institutions. $3 Billion Inflows on the Horizon: Is it Realistic? Juan Leon’s projection of up to $3 billion in ETF inflows for Q2 is ambitious, but it’s grounded in the observed trends and market dynamics. The initial success of Bitcoin ETFs in Q1, despite unfavorable price action, has laid a strong foundation. Here’s a closer look at why this Q2 forecast holds weight: Sustained Institutional Interest: The initial wave of institutional adoption is likely just the tip of the iceberg. As institutions become more familiar with Bitcoin ETFs and witness their performance, allocations are expected to increase. Financial Advisor Integration: The integration of Bitcoin ETFs into financial advisor portfolios is still in its nascent stages. As advisors become more educated and comfortable with these products, they will increasingly recommend them to clients seeking diversified investment strategies. Declining Arbitrage Yields: While arbitrage may have played a role in initial inflows, the decreasing yields from such strategies suggest that future inflows will be driven more by genuine long-term investment interest in crypto investment through ETFs. The Power of Institutional Demand in Crypto Investment The narrative around crypto investment is evolving. It’s moving beyond retail-driven hype cycles towards a more mature phase characterized by institutional participation. Institutional demand is a game-changer for several reasons: Factor Impact of Institutional Demand Capital Inflows Institutions manage significantly larger pools of capital compared to retail investors. Their entry into the Bitcoin market via ETFs can lead to substantial and sustained inflows. Market Stability Institutional investors typically have longer investment horizons and less prone to panic selling during market downturns. This can contribute to greater market stability and reduced volatility over time. Legitimacy and Maturity Increased institutional participation enhances the legitimacy and maturity of the cryptocurrency market, attracting further investment and broader adoption. Product Innovation Institutional interest drives innovation in crypto investment products, leading to the development of more sophisticated and diversified offerings beyond just Bitcoin ETFs. Navigating Regulatory Clarity in the Crypto ETF Landscape Regulatory clarity has been a long-standing hurdle for the cryptocurrency industry. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in certain jurisdictions marks a significant step forward in this regard. However, the regulatory landscape remains complex and varies across different regions. Here’s what investors should consider regarding regulatory clarity and Bitcoin ETFs : Jurisdictional Differences: Regulations surrounding crypto assets and ETFs differ significantly between countries. Investors need to be aware of the specific regulations in their jurisdiction and where the ETF is domiciled. Ongoing Regulatory Evolution: The regulatory environment for crypto is constantly evolving. Staying informed about new developments and potential changes is crucial for investors in Bitcoin ETFs . Impact on Market Access: Increased regulatory clarity can broaden market access for both institutions and retail investors, fostering greater participation and liquidity in the crypto ETF market. What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin and Crypto? The strong ETF inflows amidst price weakness paint a compelling picture of the evolving crypto landscape. It suggests a growing decoupling of ETF investment from short-term price fluctuations, indicating a more fundamental, long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. This trend could signal: Greater Market Resilience: Increased institutional participation via ETFs could make the Bitcoin market more resilient to price shocks and speculative bubbles. Accelerated Adoption: Easier access through ETFs can accelerate the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as investment assets. A New Era for Crypto Investment: We may be entering a new era where crypto investment is increasingly integrated into traditional financial portfolios, driven by institutional demand and facilitated by regulated products like ETFs. Conclusion: The Unstoppable Rise of Bitcoin ETFs? The resilience of Bitcoin ETFs in attracting substantial inflows despite price corrections is a powerful testament to the maturing crypto market. The projected $3 billion inflow for Q2, driven by rising institutional demand and improving regulatory clarity , underscores the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term investment. While the crypto market will undoubtedly continue to experience volatility, the increasing role of ETFs and institutional investors suggests a more stable and fundamentally driven future for Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. The Defiant performance of Bitcoin ETFs signals a paradigm shift, hinting at a future where crypto becomes an integral part of mainstream finance. Keep a close watch on these inflow trends – they could be the leading indicator of the next major bull run in the crypto space.
