Just a year after sparking excitement and raising funds through a community-driven crowdfunding initiative, the project has announced a complete reversal, leaving many wondering what went wrong. Are you curious to know the inside scoop on why the Dogwifhat logo won’t be lighting up the Vegas skyline after all? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story. What Happened to the Dogwifhat Las Vegas Sphere Dream? The ambitious plan to project the Dogwifhat logo onto the Las Vegas Sphere was initially met with enthusiastic support from the memecoin community. Spearheaded by the pseudonymous organizer @GamesMasterFlex, the project aimed to take crypto advertising to new heights, leveraging the Sphere’s unparalleled visual impact. However, recent updates indicate a significant change of direction. According to a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), @GamesMasterFlex announced the shelving of the Sphere advertising project. This news has been confirmed by Decrypt and has sent ripples through the Dogwifhat community and the broader crypto space. But what exactly led to this sudden change of heart? Unpacking the WIF Refund and Project Shelving The announcement of the project’s cancellation was coupled with the promise of a full WIF refund to contributors. This move, while likely disappointing for those who were excited about the Sphere campaign, is being seen by many as a responsible and community-centric approach. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: Project Shelved: The Las Vegas Sphere advertising campaign for Dogwifhat is officially off the table. Full Refunds: Contributions made to the crowdfunding campaign will be returned to donors. Reason Unclear: As of now, the specific reasons behind the decision to abandon the project remain somewhat vague. The announcement from @GamesMasterFlex provided limited details beyond the project being shelved. Community Reaction: The community’s reaction is mixed, with some expressing disappointment but largely appreciating the transparency and commitment to refunding contributions. The lack of a detailed explanation for the cancellation has naturally fueled speculation within the crypto community. Was it logistical challenges, financial hurdles, or perhaps a strategic shift in marketing focus for Dogwifhat ? As we await further clarification, it’s worth considering the potential factors that might have played a role. Potential Challenges in Crypto Advertising on the Las Vegas Sphere While the idea of showcasing a memecoin like Dogwifhat on the Las Vegas Sphere is undeniably attention-grabbing, executing such a campaign comes with its own set of challenges. Let’s explore some potential hurdles that might have contributed to the project being shelved: Challenge Description Potential Impact on Dogwifhat Project Cost Advertising on the Las Vegas Sphere is known to be exceptionally expensive. Budget constraints or unexpected cost increases could have made the project financially unviable. Logistics and Regulations Coordinating advertising on a venue like the Sphere involves complex logistics and regulatory approvals. Potential bureaucratic delays or unforeseen regulatory hurdles could have stalled the project. Market Volatility The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. Fluctuations in the value of Dogwifhat or SOL could have impacted the project’s funding and feasibility over the past year. Shifting Priorities Project priorities and marketing strategies can evolve in the fast-paced crypto world. Dogwifhat team might have decided to reallocate resources to other marketing initiatives or project developments. It’s important to note that these are just potential challenges. The official reason for shelving the Las Vegas Sphere campaign and issuing the WIF refund is yet to be fully disclosed by the project organizers. Memecoin Marketing and the Power of Community The Dogwifhat Sphere campaign, even in its cancellation, highlights the unique and often unconventional marketing strategies employed in the memecoin space. These projects often thrive on community engagement and virality, and the initial enthusiasm for the Sphere idea is a testament to this. While the crypto advertising landscape is still evolving, memecoins like Dogwifhat demonstrate the power of grassroots movements and community-driven initiatives to generate buzz and attention. Here are some key takeaways about memecoin marketing: Community Focus: Memecoin marketing heavily relies on building and engaging a strong online community. Viral Potential: The goal is often to create viral moments and trends that spread rapidly across social media. Unconventional Approaches: Memecoins are known for embracing unconventional and often humorous marketing tactics. Risk and Reward: Memecoin marketing can be highly effective in gaining attention quickly but also carries inherent risks due to market volatility and project lifecycles. What’s Next for Dogwifhat and Crypto Advertising? While the Las Vegas Sphere dream might be on hold, the Dogwifhat story is far from over. The project still boasts a vibrant community and continues to be a prominent player in the memecoin arena. The decision to issue a WIF refund and shelve the Sphere campaign could even be seen as a strategic move to re-evaluate and potentially pivot towards new marketing avenues. As for crypto advertising in general, the industry is constantly experimenting with new and innovative ways to reach audiences. From social media campaigns to partnerships and sponsorships, the strategies are diverse and ever-evolving. The Dogwifhat Sphere saga serves as a reminder of both the ambitious spirit and the inherent uncertainties within the crypto space. Conclusion: Lessons from the Dogwifhat Sphere Setback The cancellation of Dogwifhat’s Las Vegas Sphere advertising campaign is undoubtedly a setback for those who were eagerly anticipating it. However, it also offers valuable lessons about the realities of ambitious projects in the fast-paced and unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. The commitment to a WIF refund demonstrates a level of responsibility and community focus that is commendable. As Dogwifhat moves forward, it will be interesting to see what new strategies and initiatives they pursue to maintain their momentum and engage their dedicated community. The world of memecoin marketing continues to be a fascinating space to watch, full of surprises and unexpected turns.

42772663,https://timestabloid.com/?p=62545,1743546536,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"ChatGPT Explains Why XRP Price Has Fallen, Despite Multiple Positive Announcements",https://timestabloid.com/chatgpt-explains-why-xrp-price-has-fallen-despite-multiple-positive-announcements/,"Software engineer and crypto enthusiast Vincent Van Code recently shared a tweet analyzing why XRP’s price declined despite multiple positive developments. His post included a conversation with ChatGPT. He asked why XRP’s price fell from $2.50 to $2 before recovering slightly to $2.16, despite major bullish announcements. The AI’s response covered several factors, with Van Code emphasizing point three, which referenced market manipulation. I asked ChatGPT why price of XRP has fallen, despite multiple positive announcements.. no 3 was the kicker, even it knows the price is manipulated, to SHAKE OUT RETAIL. Must read Prompt: There have been dozens of XRP pro announcements from FDIC. to case settlement, you name… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) March 30, 2025 The tweet suggests that XRP’s price action does not align with expectations, given the stream of favorable news, including FDIC-related announcements and the resolution of legal matters. ChatGPT outlined six primary reasons for this disconnect. Market Dynamics and Sentiment One explanation given was the common market phenomenon of “buy the rumor, sell the news.” This occurs when investors anticipate good news and price it in beforehand. Once the news becomes official, traders may take profits, leading to a selloff instead of further gains. This behavior is common in both traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets. The second factor was the broader market sentiment. Even when XRP has positive news, overall market conditions influence its ability to gain traction. Bitcoin’s price movements, macroeconomic factors like inflation concerns, and regulatory uncertainty can weigh down altcoins, including XRP. Even strong developments may not drive price increases if the general market environment is unstable. Influence of Whales and Liquidity Strategies Van Code highlighted ChatGPT’s mention of price manipulation as a significant takeaway. The AI pointed out that XRP has a history of being influenced by large holders and institutions who may intentionally push the price lower to shake out retail investors. These liquidity strategies, often employed by market makers and institutional traders, create psychological pressure on smaller investors. The suggestion that price movements may not always be driven by logical fundamentals but rather by deliberate strategies is the key focus of the tweet. Another factor mentioned was the lack of new retail money entering the market. Even with positive announcements, its price may struggle to rise if no fresh capital flows into XRP. A significant increase requires not just existing traders cycling through positions but new participants willing to buy at higher prices. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Lingering Effects of Legal Issues and Supply Considerations The AI also pointed to the residual effects of the SEC lawsuit. While the case was largely resolved in Ripple’s favor, regulatory uncertainty has left a lasting impact. Institutional investors remain cautious, while some exchanges have yet to integrate XRP trading without restrictions. These factors contribute to sentiment issues that can suppress price growth. Finally, token supply dynamics were identified as another potential reason. Ripple holds a substantial amount of XRP and distributes tokens through monthly unlocks and over-the-counter (OTC) sales. While these distributions are part of a structured plan, they can introduce selling pressure, affecting price stability. Van Code’s tweet highlights the frustration within the XRP community regarding price movements that do not seem to reflect ongoing positive developments. The response from ChatGPT outlined multiple reasons why the price may not have reacted as anticipated, with market dynamics, sentiment, liquidity strategies, and supply considerations all playing a role. The emphasis on whale manipulation as a possible factor underscores concerns that price movements in the crypto market are not always organic. Whether this is a temporary consolidation phase before a larger breakout remains uncertain. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

42772458,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145380,1743546620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Claim: Researchers Expose OpenAI’s GPT-4o Training on Paywalled Books,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-gpt4o-paywalled-books-claim/,"Is OpenAI, the giant behind ChatGPT, embroiled in another data sourcing controversy? A new report from the AI Disclosures Project is making waves with a serious accusation : OpenAI may have trained its advanced GPT-4o model using copyrighted, paywalled books from O’Reilly Media without permission. This revelation intensifies the ongoing debate about AI training data ethics and the boundaries of copyright in the age of artificial intelligence. For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals following the AI revolution, this news raises critical questions about data transparency and the future of content creation. Unpacking the Copyright Infringement Claim Against OpenAI The core of the accusation revolves around the source of data used to train sophisticated AI models like GPT-4o. Think of AI models as incredibly complex learning machines. They digest massive amounts of information – text, images, code – to identify patterns and generate outputs based on prompts. When you ask ChatGPT to write a poem or create an image, it’s drawing upon this vast knowledge base to produce its response. It’s not creating something entirely new, but rather intelligently remixing and extrapolating from what it has learned. While many AI labs, including OpenAI, are exploring AI-generated synthetic data to augment their training datasets, relying solely on synthetic data presents challenges. Performance can degrade, and the models may lose touch with the nuances of real-world data. This is where the controversy around AI training data sourcing becomes critical. The AI Disclosures Project, spearheaded by Tim O’Reilly and Ilan Strauss, suggests that OpenAI’s latest model, GPT-4o , exhibits a strong understanding of content from paywalled O’Reilly books. This is particularly concerning because O’Reilly Media, a prominent publisher of technical and business books, does not have a licensing agreement with OpenAI. Key findings from the AI Disclosures Project paper: GPT-4o’s Superior Recognition: The research indicates that GPT-4o demonstrates a significantly higher recognition of paywalled O’Reilly book content compared to OpenAI’s earlier model, GPT-3.5 Turbo. DE-COP Method: The researchers employed a technique called DE-COP, a “membership inference attack,” to assess whether AI models have prior knowledge of specific texts from their training data. This method tests if a model can distinguish between original human-written text and AI-paraphrased versions. Extensive Testing: Over 13,000 paragraph excerpts from 34 O’Reilly books were used to probe the knowledge of GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and other OpenAI models. Paywalled Content Recognition: The results strongly suggest that GPT-4o “recognized” a far greater amount of paywalled O’Reilly book content than its predecessors. GPT-4o and the Mystery of Paywalled Books: What Does It Mean for Copyright? The paper highlights a stark contrast between GPT-4o and older models like GPT-3.5 Turbo. While GPT-3.5 Turbo showed more familiarity with publicly accessible O’Reilly book samples, GPT-4o excelled in recognizing content behind paywalls. This raises serious questions about how OpenAI sourced its AI training data for its most advanced model. According to the research, “GPT-4o [likely] recognizes, and so has prior knowledge of, many non-public O’Reilly books published prior to its training cutoff date.” However, the researchers acknowledge that this isn’t definitive proof of copyright infringement . They concede that their method isn’t foolproof and that OpenAI could have indirectly accessed the book excerpts through user interactions with ChatGPT – users might have copied and pasted snippets of paywalled content into the platform. Furthermore, the study didn’t analyze OpenAI’s newest models, leaving open the possibility that data sourcing practices may have evolved. Why Does AI Training Data Matter in the Crypto and Tech World? For those in the cryptocurrency and broader tech space, the implications of this copyright infringement claim are significant: Data Ethics and Transparency: The crypto world champions decentralization and transparency. Questions around AI data sourcing mirror these concerns. Where AI models get their data and how ethically it’s obtained are crucial for building trustworthy AI systems. Impact on Content Creators: If AI models are trained on copyrighted material without proper licensing, it undermines the rights of content creators – authors, artists, musicians, and more. This could stifle creativity and innovation in the long run. Legal Battles and Regulatory Scrutiny: OpenAI is already facing multiple lawsuits regarding its data practices. This new report will likely add fuel to the fire, potentially leading to stricter regulations around AI training data and copyright . Future of AI Development: The search for high-quality AI training data is intensifying. AI companies are exploring various avenues, including licensing deals, synthetic data generation, and even hiring domain experts to inject knowledge directly into AI systems. The resolution of the copyright infringement debate will significantly shape the future landscape of AI development. OpenAI’s Stance and the Broader Industry Trend OpenAI has publicly advocated for more flexible rules regarding the use of copyrighted data for AI training . They argue that access to a wide range of data, including copyrighted material, is essential for developing powerful and beneficial AI models. The company does have licensing agreements with some publishers and offers opt-out mechanisms for copyright holders, though these are often criticized as insufficient. The trend of AI companies seeking higher-quality AI training data is undeniable. OpenAI has even hired journalists to refine its models’ output, and the industry is seeing a rise in AI firms recruiting experts across various fields to infuse specialized knowledge into AI systems. While OpenAI does pay for some training data through licensing deals, the O’Reilly paper underscores the ongoing tension between AI development and copyright law. As OpenAI navigates multiple lawsuits and increasing scrutiny, this new report from the AI Disclosures Project adds another layer of complexity to the copyright infringement debate. OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment, leaving the allegations unanswered for now.

The case challenges our assumptions about wealth and exposes risky behavior behind online allure. It sparks debate on how financial pressures can distort personal values and family ties. Andre Rebelo, an Australian crypto investor and former partner of Instagram influencer Grace Piscopo, was sentenced to 25 years in prison on April 1 in Perth after being found guilty of murdering his mother in 2020. Andre Rebelo Sentenced for Killing Mother in High-Profile Case Rebelo was convicted of murdering his mother, Colleen, after an eight-week trial where his siblings and ex-girlfriend testified. Colleen Rebelo was found dead in the shower of her suburban home in Perth on May 25, 2020, by her son. Authorities did not determine an exact cause of death, though some reports suggested possible asphyxiation. Andre Rebelo — the ex-partner of social media influencer Grace Piscopo — must have carried out some form of violent act against his mother when he killed her but exactly what he did may never be known. https://t.co/LrhqdfCWEB — The West Australian (@westaustralian) March 31, 2025 “You killed your own mother, in a particularly egregious and shocking nature,” Justice Bruno Fiannaca said. “This is a crime that right minded people would regard with horror, murdering your mother was the ultimate betrayal of her trust and everything she gave,” he added. Debt and Financial Motives Behind Andre Rebelo’s Crime According to The Sydney Morning Herald , Colleen’s therapist, Narina Sidhu, alerted police shortly following her client’s death that Rebelo had repeatedly contacted her about signing a life insurance claim in his mother’s name. Authorities found that Rebelo had created the policies himself and forged documents to claim up to AUD $1 million (around USD $627,000). Prosecutors said Rebelo and Piscopo had accumulated nearly AUD $100,000 (about USD $62,000) in debt due to their spending habits, which may have influenced Rebelo’s actions. The investigation did not uncover clear details about Rebelo’s cryptocurrency investments , but prosecutors focused instead on his financial struggles and motive. Social Media Activity and Final Sentencing Piscopo, who shares a child with Rebelo and has since separated from him, did not attend the sentencing. Two days before the sentencing, Piscopo shared a beach photo from Bali on Instagram, captioned “paradise.” Rebelo will be eligible for parole in 2047, after serving at least 25 years.

42772743,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145381,1743547216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark STABLES Act: Coinbase CEO’s Urgent Plea for Crypto Regulation Support,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stables-act-crypto-regulation-coinbase/,"Is the U.S. finally on the verge of establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets? Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes we might be. In a significant move, Armstrong has publicly urged bipartisan support for the STABLES Act, labeling its upcoming markup by the House Financial Services Committee as a potentially “historic moment” for the crypto industry. Let’s dive into why this act is so crucial and what it could mean for the future of crypto in the United States. Why is the STABLES Act a Landmark for Crypto Regulation? The STABLES Act , or the “Eliminating Backlogs Act of 2023”, is not new, but its renewed momentum is capturing significant attention. Brian Armstrong’s vocal support amplifies its importance, especially as the crypto industry navigates a complex and often unclear regulatory landscape. But what exactly makes this act so pivotal? Clarity for Stablecoins: The core focus of the STABLES Act is to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reserve asset like the U.S. dollar, are crucial for everyday crypto transactions and the broader DeFi ecosystem. Current regulations are fragmented, creating uncertainty for businesses operating with stablecoins. Federal Oversight: The act proposes to bring stablecoin issuers under federal oversight, potentially treating them more like traditional financial institutions. This could involve stricter requirements for reserves, audits, and consumer protection, aiming to build trust and stability in the stablecoin market. National Framework: A federal framework could preempt state-level regulations, creating a more unified and less burdensome environment for stablecoin issuers to operate across the U.S. This national approach is highly desired by industry leaders who seek consistent rules rather than a patchwork of state laws. Brian Armstrong’s Urgent Call for Support: A Pivotal Moment Brian Armstrong’s engagement is not just a casual endorsement; it’s an urgent call to action. His recent activity on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting both the STABLES Act and the Senate’s progress on the GENIUS Act, underscores the industry’s push for comprehensive crypto regulation . Why is his voice so important right now? Industry Leadership: As the CEO of Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., Armstrong’s opinion carries significant weight. His advocacy can influence both lawmakers and the broader public perception of crypto regulation. Timing is Critical: With the House Financial Services Committee markup approaching, Armstrong’s public appeal is strategically timed to maximize pressure on lawmakers to consider and support the STABLES Act. This is a crucial window of opportunity to shape the future of digital assets regulation. Bipartisan Push: Armstrong specifically called for bipartisan support, recognizing that for any legislation to pass and be effective, it needs to transcend partisan divides. Crypto regulation is not a Republican or Democrat issue; it’s an issue of innovation and economic competitiveness for the U.S. Beyond STABLES: The GENIUS Act and a Broader Vision for Digital Assets Armstrong also mentioned the Senate’s progress on the GENIUS Act. While the STABLES Act focuses on stablecoins, the GENIUS Act represents a broader effort to establish a comprehensive digital asset framework . How do these pieces fit together? Act Focus Significance STABLES Act Stablecoin regulation, federal oversight of issuers. Provides immediate clarity and stability to a critical segment of the crypto market. GENIUS Act Broader digital asset regulatory framework, potentially covering various types of cryptocurrencies and crypto activities. Aims to create a more comprehensive and future-proof regulatory environment for the entire digital asset ecosystem in the U.S. Both acts are vital components of building a robust and innovation-friendly regulatory landscape for crypto in the U.S. Armstrong’s mention of both signals a holistic approach, advocating for both immediate needs (stablecoin clarity) and long-term vision (comprehensive framework). What are the Potential Benefits of Clear Crypto Regulation? Why is this regulatory push so important for the future? Clear crypto regulation offers numerous benefits, not just for crypto companies but for the entire U.S. economy: Increased Investment and Innovation: Regulatory clarity reduces uncertainty, making it more attractive for institutional investors and traditional businesses to enter the crypto space. This influx of capital and talent can fuel innovation and growth. Consumer Protection: Robust regulations can protect consumers from fraud and scams, fostering greater trust in digital assets and encouraging wider adoption. Economic Competitiveness: A clear and sensible regulatory framework can position the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset space, attracting businesses and talent while preventing innovation from moving overseas. Mainstream Adoption: As regulations become clearer and more established, cryptocurrencies and digital assets can move closer to mainstream adoption, integrating further into the traditional financial system. Armstrong in D.C.: Actionable Insights and What’s Next Brian Armstrong’s presence in Washington, D.C., this week is not merely symbolic. It represents direct engagement and lobbying efforts ahead of the crucial August recess. What actionable insights can we glean from this situation? Direct Engagement Matters: Armstrong’s meetings with lawmakers demonstrate the importance of direct industry engagement in shaping policy. Crypto leaders need to be actively involved in discussions and negotiations. Education is Key: Part of Armstrong’s mission is likely to educate lawmakers about the nuances of crypto and the potential benefits of well-crafted regulation. Bridging the knowledge gap between the tech industry and policymakers is crucial. Momentum Building: The simultaneous progress on the STABLES Act and the GENIUS Act, coupled with industry advocacy, suggests a growing momentum towards comprehensive crypto regulation in the U.S. This is a space to watch closely. Conclusion: A Historic Opportunity for Digital Assets? The upcoming House Financial Services Committee markup of the STABLES Act, combined with the ongoing Senate discussions on the GENIUS Act, truly represents a historic opportunity for the United States to define its stance on digital assets . Brian Armstrong’s urgent appeal for bipartisan support is a powerful reminder that the time for decisive action is now. Whether this moment will indeed be “historic” depends on the choices lawmakers make in the coming weeks and months. The crypto community, and indeed anyone interested in the future of finance and technology, will be watching closely.

The establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as a “digital Fort Knox” is part of Bitcoin’s growing role as a long-term store of value in federal financial strategy. This transparency may influence global crypto adoption and market dynamics, as this marks a turning point for both regulation and institutional confidence in digital assets. Following President Donald Trump’s recent executive order, the US Department of the Treasury and federal agencies are expected to disclose their Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency holdings on April 5. The announcement is anticipated to reveal whether assets such as XRP, Solana, and Cardano, previously mentioned by Trump, are included in the government’s digital asset reserves. How Much Crypto Does the U.S. Really Own? Treasury Set to Reveal Holdings President Trump signs executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. White House crypto czar David Sacks says the reserve will start with 200K BTC already owned by the gov, with plans for budget-neutral accumulation. BTC price dips 3%… https://t.co/4e2bJH7c72 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 7, 2025 Trump’s executive order issued on March 6 mandated the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile. According to a presidential document published on March 11, all federal agencies were given 30 days to report their digital asset holdings to the Treasury Secretary. The directive also requires the establishment of two new offices to oversee these assets, with the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve specifically designated for Bitcoin acquired through civil or criminal forfeiture. Unlike other holdings, Bitcoin in this reserve will not be sold, positioning it as a long-term store of value akin to a “digital Fort Knox.” April 5th (this Saturday) the USA must complete a full audit of the nation’s bitcoin holdings. Depending on what we learn, might answer many of the open questions about the recent price action. — David Bailey $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) March 31, 2025 The forthcoming disclosure is expected to clarify the scope of the government’s crypto holdings, which could have broader implications for the market. David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc, noted that the audit results might help explain Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations. “Depending on what we learn, it might answer many of the open questions about the recent price action,” Bailey said. Bitcoin’s price has been highly volatile since the announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Concerns over trade tensions and recession risks have contributed to a 10% decline, with Bitcoin dropping from over $92,000 to around $82,000. According to data from Arkham Intelligence , the US government currently holds approximately 198,012 BTC, valued at around $16 billion. White House crypto czar David Sacks stated that the government has accumulated roughly 400,000 BTC through asset forfeitures over the past decade. However, about half of that (195,000 BTC) was sold, generating $366 million. If those holdings had been retained, their value today would exceed $17 billion. U.S. States Push Bitcoin Legislation Amid Federal Crypto Transparency Efforts As federal agencies prepare to disclose their crypto holdings, U.S. states are making aggressive moves to integrate Bitcoin into their financial systems. While this federal transparency initiative unfolds, individual states aren’t waiting to forge their own paths forward. According to Bitcoin Laws, at least 23 states have introduced Bitcoin reserve bills, with 35 proposals still under consideration. Kentucky recently took a big step, with Governor Andy Beshear signing the “Bitcoin Rights” bill (HB 701) into law . This legislation grants residents the right to self-custody Bitcoin and supports crypto mining, reinforcing Kentucky’s position as a major mining hub. Kentucky is currently responsible for 11% of the U.S. Bitcoin hash rate. NEW: North Carolina Bitcoin Investment Bill House Bill 506 would create a new independent NC Investment Authority headed by the Treasurer. The NCIA would have authority to invest 5% of various state funds in digital assets. pic.twitter.com/YuYmI8YyY2 — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) March 25, 2025 Other states are following suit. Oklahoma’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB 1203) cleared the House with a 77-15 vote and is now awaiting Senate approval. If passed, it would allow state funds to be allocated to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Meanwhile, Arizona lawmakers advanced two key bills, SB 1373 and SB 1025, permitting the state treasurer to invest up to 10% of reserve and pension funds into Bitcoin. North Carolina is also exploring crypto investments, with multiple bills proposing to allocate up to 10% of state funds to digital assets. If enacted, these measures could provide long-term financial protection against inflation while reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in public finance. According to Bitcoin Laws, if these state initiatives proceed, they could result in up to $23 billion in Bitcoin purchases, potentially adding 247,000 BTC to government reserves. The upcoming federal crypto disclosure represents an interesting moment in US financial policy. As federal agencies prepare to reveal their holdings while states increasingly incorporate Bitcoin into their financial frameworks, the nation appears to be at a crossroads. The transparency initiative could legitimize cryptocurrencies as a mainstream asset class and potentially influence global adoption patterns. Regardless of whether this signals the beginning of a new era where digital assets become integral to national financial strategy, the April 5 disclosure will undoubtedly provide crucial insights into the government’s long-term vision for cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How could the U.S. Treasury’s crypto holdings transform global perceptions of Bitcoin? The U.S. could legitimize Bitcoin as a strategic asset by publicly holding it, potentially influencing other nations to adopt similar reserves and accelerating Bitcoin’s mainstream acceptance. What does this disclosure mean for state-level Bitcoin reserve initiatives? Federal transparency might encourage states to expand their Bitcoin legislation, which could directly create a unified national approach to integrating digital assets into public finance. How might this influence institutional investment in cryptocurrencies? A federal endorsement of crypto holdings could ignite institutional confidence, drive inflows into digital assets, and foster broader market participation. Of course, this all depends on broader macroeconomic forces and other factors.

The first quarter of this year has witnessed an unprecedented surge in crypto-related mergers and acquisitions (M&A), signaling a major evolution within the digital asset space. Buckle up as we delve into the details of this explosive growth and explore what it means for investors, businesses, and the future of cryptocurrency. Crypto M&A Transactions Reach Unprecedented Heights The numbers are in, and they’re staggering. According to a recent report from M&A consulting firm Architect Partners, as highlighted by Blockworks, the world of Crypto M&A has just experienced its most active quarter ever. We’re talking about a whopping 62 deals finalized in just the first three months of the year! To put this into perspective, this figure nearly doubles the 33 transactions recorded in Q3 of last year. This dramatic increase underscores a significant acceleration in consolidation and strategic partnerships within the crypto industry. What’s Fueling this Cryptocurrency Acquisitions Frenzy? So, what’s behind this dramatic uptick in Cryptocurrency Acquisitions ? Several factors are likely contributing to this surge: Market Maturation: The crypto market is maturing. Early-stage projects are evolving, and established companies are looking to expand their reach and capabilities. M&A provides a faster route to growth than organic expansion. Strategic Consolidation: In a competitive market, companies are merging to gain a competitive edge, consolidate market share, and eliminate redundancies. This is a natural progression as the industry matures. Access to Talent and Technology: Acquiring companies can provide access to valuable talent, cutting-edge technology, and intellectual property that would be costly and time-consuming to develop in-house. Bull Market Confidence: Optimism surrounding the future of crypto, fueled by recent market uptrends and institutional adoption, is likely encouraging companies to make strategic moves and invest in growth through acquisitions. Preparation for the Next Bull Run: Companies are positioning themselves for the anticipated next bull run. Expanding through Crypto Mergers and acquisitions now allows them to capitalize on future market growth. The Prediction: An M&A Boom Alongside Crypto IPOs Adding further credence to this trend, Dan Tapiero, founder of cryptocurrency investment firm 10T Holdings, anticipated this very scenario. Speaking at Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit last month, Tapiero predicted an imminent M&A Boom Crypto wave, coinciding with the activation of crypto-related initial public offerings (IPOs). This prediction appears to be materializing even sooner than some might have expected, given the Q1 figures. Tapiero’s insight highlights a crucial point: the crypto industry is moving towards greater institutionalization and integration with traditional financial markets. M&A activity is a key indicator of this evolution, paving the way for a more structured and mature crypto ecosystem. Benefits of Crypto Mergers and Acquisitions: Why It Matters The surge in Crypto Investment Boom through M&A isn’t just about numbers; it has tangible benefits for the entire crypto ecosystem: Benefit Description Increased Innovation Mergers can combine complementary technologies and talent, fostering innovation and accelerating the development of new crypto products and services. Enhanced Market Stability Consolidation can lead to stronger, more resilient companies, reducing market fragmentation and potentially contributing to greater market stability in the long run. Wider User Adoption Larger, more established entities resulting from mergers can have greater resources for marketing and user acquisition, potentially driving wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. Improved Regulatory Compliance Larger companies often have more resources to navigate the complex regulatory landscape, leading to better compliance and increased investor confidence. Investor Confidence Boost Increased M&A activity signals a maturing market, attracting more institutional and traditional investors who see crypto as a viable and evolving asset class. Navigating the Challenges of Crypto Acquisitions While the outlook for crypto M&A is bright, it’s important to acknowledge the potential challenges: Valuation Complexity: Valuing crypto companies can be complex due to the nascent nature of the industry, fluctuating token prices, and varying business models. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape in different jurisdictions adds complexity to cross-border M&A deals. Integration Hurdles: Integrating different company cultures, technologies, and teams can present significant challenges post-acquisition. Talent Retention: Retaining key talent from acquired companies is crucial for successful integration and value realization. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market can impact deal valuations and post-acquisition performance. Examples of Crypto M&A in Action While specific details of the 62 Q1 deals are still emerging, we can look at past examples to understand the types of Cryptocurrency Acquisitions happening in the space. These include: Exchanges Acquiring Infrastructure Providers: Major exchanges might acquire custody solutions or blockchain analytics firms to enhance their service offerings and security. NFT Marketplaces Merging: Consolidation in the NFT space could see larger marketplaces acquiring smaller, niche platforms to expand their reach and NFT categories. DeFi Protocols Combining Forces: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols might merge to create more comprehensive and robust financial ecosystems. Traditional Finance Entering Crypto: We could see traditional financial institutions acquiring crypto firms to gain a foothold in the digital asset market and offer crypto-related services to their clients. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors So, what does this Record Crypto M&A activity mean for you? Keep an Eye on M&A News: Stay informed about merger and acquisition announcements in the crypto space. These deals can signal shifts in market dynamics and identify emerging leaders. Research Acquired Companies: Pay attention to companies being acquired. Their technologies and teams might become integral to larger crypto ecosystems. Consider Investing in Consolidating Sectors: Sectors experiencing consolidation through M&A could present investment opportunities as stronger, more competitive entities emerge. Understand the Long-Term Implications: M&A activity points towards the long-term maturation and institutionalization of the crypto market. This trend could lead to greater stability and broader adoption. Conclusion: A New Era of Crypto Evolution The explosive growth in crypto M&A during Q1 is not just a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful indicator of the crypto industry’s evolution. As the market matures, strategic consolidation and acquisitions will likely become even more prevalent. This wave of mergers and acquisitions promises to reshape the crypto landscape, fostering innovation, enhancing market stability, and paving the way for wider adoption. The future of crypto is being built through strategic alliances and powerful combinations, and the Q1 M&A figures are just the beginning of this exciting new chapter.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-projects-xrp-price-to-702-heres-the-timeline/,"Crypto analyst and social media figure CryptoSensei posted a tweet that presented a speculative future price trajectory for XRP. The tweet included a video in which an individual used a pen to tap on various projected price levels, outlining what appeared to be a trading strategy from the present time into 2026. WATCH THE PEN MOVE! $2.13 $3.40 → $7.60 $29.50 → $702.50 $XRP #XRP #Ripple pic.twitter.com/nAJwkzWe7x — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) March 30, 2025 Breakdown of CryptoSensei’s Price Projection The video began by showing XRP’s current price at €2.40 before moving to three days later, where the asset was depicted at €2.13 with a signal to buy. One week later, XRP was projected at €7.60 with an indication to sell. Two weeks into the future, the price was marked at €3.40, with another buy signal. The next target was set at €29.50 in seven months, again with a recommendation to buy. The final projection is extended to 2026, displaying a price of €705.50 with the word “Rich” written alongside it. The numbers in the caption, although in a different currency, reflected the price points highlighted in the video, reinforcing the suggested pattern of accumulation and selling. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reaction The post attracted responses from XRP holders and cryptocurrency traders. Some showed enthusiasm, and others expressed skepticism. One response from a user named The Real Sazkuach stated: “So if I draw some lines and tap my pen real hard, then this lends credence to my guess of future value? Fucking ridiculous.” This comment conveyed criticism of the methodology presented in the video, questioning the legitimacy of the predictions based on visual cues rather than technical analysis or fundamental factors. Broader Context XRP has been a focal point in the cryptocurrency space due to its association with cross-border payments and ongoing regulatory discussions. Price predictions for the asset have varied widely, with some analysts forecasting significant long-term appreciation and others remaining cautious. CryptoSensei’s projection aligns with a more optimistic outlook, but its validity remains uncertain. Market participants have historically been drawn to speculative forecasts, particularly in the volatile cryptocurrency sector. While some traders may interpret such projections as potential scenarios, others emphasize the importance of research, historical trends, and external market influences when considering future price movements.

The buzz is building as Hut 8 Mining, a prominent name in the Bitcoin mining arena, has teamed up with an investment group boasting ties to the Trump family. Together, they’re charting a course to launch American Bitcoin Corp. onto the public market through an Initial Public Offering (IPO). This bold move is not just about raising capital; it’s a strategic play to redefine the future of Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure. Are you prepared to witness the dawn of a new era in crypto? What’s the Buzz Around this Bitcoin IPO? The news, initially reported by Bloomberg, details the ambitious plan for American Bitcoin Corp. to go public. This isn’t just another company entering the market; it’s a venture born from the collaboration of Hut 8 Mining and a significant investment group linked to Donald Trump’s sons. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot has articulated a vision of synergy, aiming to forge two distinct yet interconnected public entities. One will concentrate on the bedrock of energy and infrastructure, while the other will laser-focus on Bitcoin mining operations and reserve management. The ultimate goal? A vertically integrated powerhouse poised to dominate the Bitcoin space. Let’s break down what makes this Bitcoin IPO so noteworthy: Strategic Separation: Hut 8 is aiming to split its operations into two publicly traded companies. This allows for focused management and potentially unlocks greater value in each sector. Vertical Integration: By controlling both energy/infrastructure and Bitcoin mining, American Bitcoin Corp. aims for greater efficiency, cost savings, and resilience. Trump-Linked Investment: The involvement of a group connected to the Trump family adds a layer of political and potentially influential backing to the venture. Capital Raise: The IPO is designed to inject significant private capital into American Bitcoin Corp., fueling its growth and expansion plans. Hut 8 Mining: A Strategic Power Play? For Hut 8 Mining, this move appears to be a calculated step towards optimizing its business structure and capitalizing on the burgeoning Bitcoin mining industry. Splitting into two specialized companies could offer several advantages: Aspect Energy & Infrastructure Company Bitcoin Mining & Reserves Company Focus Developing and managing energy resources and infrastructure crucial for Bitcoin mining. Operating Bitcoin mining facilities and managing Bitcoin reserves. Potential Benefits Attract investors interested in energy and infrastructure assets; potentially more stable revenue streams. Attract investors focused on Bitcoin and crypto assets; direct exposure to Bitcoin price movements. Synergy Provides stable, cost-effective energy for the mining company. Guaranteed demand for energy and infrastructure services. This strategic separation allows each entity to pursue its specific goals more effectively and attract different types of investors. The energy and infrastructure arm can focus on innovation in sustainable energy solutions for mining, while the Bitcoin mining company can concentrate on maximizing hash rate and Bitcoin accumulation. Why is Trump Crypto Group’s Involvement Significant? The involvement of an investment group with ties to the Trump family injects a unique dimension into this Cryptocurrency IPO. While the specifics of the group and their exact roles are still unfolding, the Trump name carries significant weight, particularly within certain political and economic circles. Here’s why their participation is generating considerable interest: Brand Recognition: The Trump name is globally recognized and can attract media attention and investor interest. Political Influence: Depending on the level of involvement and future political endeavors, this could signal a growing acceptance or even advocacy for Bitcoin within certain political spheres. Investor Network: The Trump network could bring in a new wave of investors who might not have previously considered Bitcoin ventures. Potential for Controversy: The Trump association could also attract controversy and scrutiny, both positive and negative, impacting public perception and market sentiment. It remains to be seen how deeply the Trump-linked group will be involved and what long-term implications their participation will have on American Bitcoin Corp. and the broader crypto industry. However, it undeniably adds a layer of intrigue and complexity to this IPO. Benefits of Investing in a Bitcoin Venture IPO Considering an investment in a Bitcoin Venture IPO like American Bitcoin Corp. presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. Let’s explore some potential benefits: Early Access: IPOs offer the chance to invest in a company at its initial public offering price, potentially before broader market awareness drives up valuation. Growth Potential: Bitcoin mining and related infrastructure are growth sectors, and a vertically integrated company like American Bitcoin Corp. could be well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. Diversification: Investing in a Bitcoin-focused company can provide portfolio diversification, especially for those seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency market without directly holding Bitcoin. Transparency of Public Markets: Publicly traded companies are subject to regulatory scrutiny and reporting requirements, potentially offering greater transparency compared to private crypto ventures. However, it’s crucial to remember that IPOs and crypto investments are inherently risky. Thorough due diligence and understanding your risk tolerance are paramount before making any investment decisions. Challenges and Considerations for American Bitcoin Corp. While the Bitcoin IPO of American Bitcoin Corp. is generating excitement, it’s essential to acknowledge the potential challenges and considerations: Bitcoin Price Volatility: The profitability of Bitcoin mining is heavily dependent on Bitcoin’s price, which is known for its volatility. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving and can pose risks to mining operations. Competition: The Bitcoin mining industry is competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Energy Costs: Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive, and fluctuating energy prices can impact profitability. Execution Risk: Successfully splitting into two companies and achieving vertical integration is a complex undertaking with execution risks. Investors should carefully assess these challenges and conduct thorough research into American Bitcoin Corp.’s business plan, management team, and financial projections before considering an investment. Actionable Insights: Is this Bitcoin IPO for You? The American Bitcoin Corp. IPO represents a fascinating development in the crypto space, merging established Bitcoin mining expertise with potentially influential backing. For investors considering this opportunity, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research: Thoroughly investigate Hut 8 Mining, the Trump-linked investment group, and the details of American Bitcoin Corp.’s business plan and IPO prospectus. Assess Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Understand your own risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Consider Long-Term Potential: Evaluate the long-term prospects of Bitcoin mining and the potential for vertical integration to create a sustainable competitive advantage. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Stay informed about evolving cryptocurrency regulations, which could impact the industry and American Bitcoin Corp.’s operations. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a financial advisor to determine if this IPO aligns with your investment goals and risk profile. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin Ventures? The planned IPO of American Bitcoin Corp. by Hut 8 Mining and a Trump-linked group marks a potentially groundbreaking moment for the Bitcoin industry. This venture embodies a strategic vision of vertical integration and specialized focus, aiming to create a robust and resilient Bitcoin mining operation. The involvement of the Trump network adds an intriguing layer of political and economic dynamics. While challenges and risks remain inherent in the crypto space, this IPO signals a maturing market and the increasing sophistication of Bitcoin ventures.

The significant milestone attained by Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain of Shiba Inu, could be an indication of the growing adoption of the token within the cryptocurrency space. Related Reading: Could XRP Actually Reach $10,000? Expert Weighs In Shiba Inu Milestone: 1 Billion Transactions Reports disclosed that in less than two years, Layer-2 blockchain Shibarium has already made a mark in the crypto space after the token has processed its 1 billionth transaction. Meme coin Shiba Inu only introduced Shibarium in August 2023 and four months before celebrating its second anniversary, its transaction volume has surpassed the 1 billion mark. Analysts said that Shibarium achieved the incredible feat of 1 billion transactions yesterday, March 31, noting that the Layer-2 blockchain was able to reach that level after recording four million transactions daily. As of writing, Shiba Inu’s blockchain has reached the record level with a current transaction volume of over 1.001 billion. Market observers believed that Shibarium’s achievement suggested that the blockchain can handle high transaction volumes, which they attributed to the token’s robustness and the active participation of the blockchain community. Faster Than Bitcoin Crypto analysts said that other blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have already processed more than a billion transactions. However, they noted that what makes Shibarium’s achievement stand out is the speed at which it reached that remarkable feat. Market observers compared Shibarium with other established blockchains that attained the same mark. They explained that Shibarium’s journey to attain 1 billion transactions is unique because the Layer-2 blockchain achieved it faster than the other blockchains. For example, Bitcoin needed 15 years to reach 1 billion transactions, while Shibarium did it in less than two years. Over 193 Milion Addresses Aside from the milestone in transactions, the popular L2 blockchain also has more than 193.93 million blockchain addresses that have interacted with Shibarium since it was introduced in 2023. According to Shibariumscan, Shiba Inu’s blockchain network boasted a total of 10.23 million mined blocks, with an average block time of 5.0 seconds.

42773531,https://coingape.com/?p=246937,1743548485,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Rep French Hill Rejects Proposal for Interest on Stablecoin Holdings,https://coingape.com/rep-french-hill-rejects-proposal-for-interest-on-stablecoin-holdings/,"During a briefing on April 1, Representative French Hill addressed the ongoing discussions surrounding the regulation of stablecoins. One key aspect that has garnered attention is the proposal to allow consumers to earn interest on their stablecoin holdings. However, Hill rejected this proposal, stating that there is no consensus among lawmakers to support it. The debate has become a point of focus as the U.S. Congress moves closer to passing new legislation for stablecoins. French Hill Points Lack of Consensus Among Lawmakers Rep. French Hill, who represents Arkansas, made it clear that there is currently no agreement on the proposal for consumers to earn interest on stablecoins. In his remarks, Hill acknowledged the concerns of those advocating for this change but emphasized the lack of consensus among both the House and Senate. “I hear the point of view but I don’t think that there’s consensus among the parties or the houses on having a dollar-backed payment stablecoin pay interest to the holder of that stablecoin,” Hill stated during the briefing. French Hill comments come as part of ongoing discussions on the “STABLE Act” (H.R. 2392), which seeks to regulate stablecoins in the U.S. The legislation, in addition, aims to provide clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers and establish a framework for how these digital assets can be used in financial transactions. However, the bill, as it stands, does not include provisions for stablecoin holders to earn interest. The STABLE Act and Recent Amendments The latest version of the STABLE Act, referred to as the Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute (ANS), was made available on the Financial Committee’s website on the morning of April 2, 2025. This updated version of the bill includes recent amendments and additions. The ANS will serve as the basis for the upcoming markup session set for April 3, 2025. Despite calls from industry advocates for a more modern approach that includes interest-bearing stablecoins, the STABLE Act does not appear to have embraced these proposals. Critics argue that the legislation, as it stands, limits the potential benefits of stablecoins by restricting consumer access to interest. Those pushing for change believe that this missed opportunity may hinder the growth and development of the stablecoin market. Industry Advocacy for Interest-Bearing Stablecoins Subsequently, the debate over stablecoin interest is not limited to policymakers. Industry leaders and cryptocurrency advocates have voiced their concerns over the current legislative direction. For example, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, unlike French Hill has argued that stablecoins should be allowed to pay interest to their holders, similar to how savings accounts offer returns to consumers. Armstrong highlighted the potential benefits of allowing consumers to earn onchain interest, stating that it would democratize access to higher yields and provide more financial opportunities for the general public. “Consumers deserve a bigger piece of the pie. Opening the door for onchain interest will force us all to up our game for the ultimate benefit of consumers,” Armstrong said in a recent statement. He additionally emphasized that by enabling interest-bearing stablecoins, both the U.S. economy and global consumers would benefit from increased access to financial resources.

Even though the recent price weakness is often linked to the escalating US-led global trade war, several factors had already been weighing on investor sentiment long before President Donald Trump announced the tariffs. Some market participants claimed that Strategy’s $5.25 billion worth of Bitcoin purchases since February is the primary reason BTC has held above the $80,000 support. But, regardless of who has been buying, the reality is that Bitcoin was already showing limited upside before President Trump announced the 10% Chinese import tariffs on Jan. 21. Gold/USD (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph The S&P 500 index hit an all-time high on Feb. 19, exactly 30 days after the trade war began, while Bitcoin had repeatedly failed to hold above $100,000 for the previous three months. Although the trade war certainly affected investor risk appetite, strong evidence suggests Bitcoin's price weakness started well before President Trump took office on Jan. 20. Spot Bitcoin ETFs inflows, strategic Bitcoin reserve expectations and inflationary trends Another data point that weakens the relation with tariffs is the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw $2.75 billion in net inflows during the three weeks following Jan. 21. By Feb. 18, the US had announced plans to impose tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, while the European Union and China had already retaliated. In essence, institutional demand for Bitcoin persisted even as the trade war escalated. Part of Bitcoin traders’ disappointment after Jan. 21 stems from excessive expectations surrounding President Trump’s campaign promise of a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile,” mentioned at the Bitcoin Conference in July 2024. As investors grew impatient, their frustration peaked when the actual executive order was issued on March 6. A key factor behind Bitcoin’s struggle to break above $89,000 is an inflationary trend, reflecting a relatively successful strategy by global central banks. In February, the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose 2.5% year-over-year, while the eurozone Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 2.2% in March. Investors turn more risk-averse following weak job market data In the second half of 2022, Bitcoin’s gains were driven by inflation soaring above 5%, suggesting that businesses and families turned to cryptocurrency as a hedge against monetary debasement. However, if inflation remains relatively under control in 2025, lower interest rates would favor real estate and stock markets more directly than Bitcoin, as reduced financing costs boost those sectors. US CPI inflation (left) vs. US 2-year Treasury yield (right). Source: TradingView Related: Coinbase sees worst quarter since FTX collapse amid industry bloodbath The weakening job market also dampens traders’ demand for risk-on assets, including Bitcoin. In February, the US Labor Department reported job openings near a four-year low. Similarly, yields on the US 2-year Treasury fell to a six-month low, with investors accepting a modest 3.88% return for the safety of government-backed instruments. This data suggests a rising choice for risk aversion, which is unfavorable for Bitcoin. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s price weakness stems from investors' unrealistic expectations of BTC acquisitions by the US Treasury, declining inflation supporting potential interest rate cuts, and a more risk-averse macroeconomic environment as investors turn to short-term government bonds. While the trade war has had negative effects, Bitcoin was already showing signs of weakness before it began.

A breakout from a falling wedge signals bullish momentum Ripple (XRP) Stabilises at $2 as US Congress Reviews Stablecoin Bill on April 2 The cryptocurrency market witnessed a significant recovery this week, with Ripple’s XRP rebounding 5% from a local bottom of $2 to a high of $2.20 on Tuesday. The sharp 5% XRP price recovery comes as investors anticipate regulatory developments that could boost Ripple’s ecosystem, particularly with the US Congress set to review a new stablecoin bill on April 2. Ripple (XRP) Price Action | XRPUSDT The bill, expected to provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins, could play a crucial role in the adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD, a stablecoin designed to enhance liquidity and efficiency in cross-border payments. In recent weeks, Ripple executives have consistently advocated for regulatory clarity in the stablecoin sector, arguing that well-defined rules will drive institutional adoption of digital assets. Industry experts suggest that the official US stablecoin regulation bill could be pivotal growth driver for XRP price action in April 2025, with RLUSD positioned as a viable option for compliant on-chain settlements. Can Regulatory Clarity Drive XRP Price Rally? If outcome of the US Congress’ Stablecoin bill favors Ripple’s approach, XRP could experience a parabolic price surge, with some analysts predicting a climb toward the $10 mark in April. US Congress’ Financial Services Committee publishes draft version of US Stablecoin bill on Feb 6, 2025 | Source: Financialservices.house.gov Validating this narrative, analysts believe that XRP’s bullish momentum could intensify if the stablecoin bill provides a favorable regulatory environment for RLUSD and other crypto assets tied to Ripple’s payment solutions. Historically, regulatory clarity has been a key driver of price surges for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum , and a similar impact could be seen for XRP. Another major catalyst for XRP price action it the recent closure of its long-standing legal battle with the SEC, which had hindered broader institutional adoption in previous year. However, a pro-crypto stance from Trump’s administration, Ripple is poised to gain further traction in the payment and remittance sectors fruther expanding utility and adoption of the XRP native coin. Meanwhile, macroeconomic factors such as increased institutional interest in digital assets and a growing demand for stablecoin-backed payments could further support XRP’s upward trajectory. As US lawmakers finalize discussions on stablecoin regulations, Ripple’s strategic positioning in the sector could prove instrumental in driving substantial price gains for XRP in April. XRP Price Forecast for April 2025 XRP’s recent price recovery to $2.20 on Tuesday reflects growing optimism surrounding the stablecoin bill review set for April 2. If US Congress establishes clear regulations that favor Ripple’s RLUSD, the resulting institutional confidence and adoption could propel XRP toward the $10 mark in the coming weeks. With regulatory clarity acting as a potential catalyst, investors will be closely monitoring the developments in Washington to gauge XRP’s next big move. Technical indicators also align with a bullish outlook, with XRP’s price recovery to $2.20 signaling renewed buying momentum as traders anticipate regulatory clarity from the upcoming U.S. stablecoin bill review. The chart below shows XRP price recently bounced off the lower Donchian Channel band near $2.02, confirming a strong buying support at that level. XRP Price Forecast The falling wedge pattern, a bullish reversal structure, formed over several days before XRP decisively broke above the upper trendline. This breakout, supported by increased trading volume, indicates a shift in momentum. XRP now targets the $2.21 resistance, with a measured move from the wedge suggesting a rally toward $2.50. The Donchian Channel’s upper boundary at $2.21 aligns with immediate resistance, while the lower boundary at $2.02 marks key support. The RSI at 46.74 shows improving bullish momentum, recovering from oversold conditions. A move above 50 would reinforce upside strength. If XRP sustains momentum above $2.14, the next major target is $2.50. However, failure to hold this level could see a retest of $2.02 support before another breakout attempt.

Rather than immediate selling pressure, these moves could indicate a strategy to consolidate holdings during volatile times. The concentration of tokens in fewer hands may alter future network governance and influence. Improved tracking and clearer communication of such movements could help restore investor trust. The Neo Foundation denied involvement in recent NEO token sales following a 35.85% drop in price between March 24 and April 1, prompting concern across the crypto community. In a statement released after the sharp downturn, the foundation clarified that neither it nor its development arm, Neo Global Development (NGD), had sold any NEO tokens. It also ruled out any transactions by founders or core team members. The group has since begun tracking the origins of large transactions that coincided with the decline. Neo Foundation Investigates Mystery Wallet After NEO Transfer to Binance Between March 24 and April 1, the price of NEO fell from roughly $8 to $5, alarming many long-time holders. In response, the Neo Foundation and NGD launched an internal investigation to uncover the source of the volatility. Their analysis revealed significant activity tied to a Neo Legacy address that had accumulated approximately 11.8 million NEO between 2017 and 2021. The address reportedly moved over 11.1 million NEO to the Neo N3 blockchain in 2021. From there, the tokens were distributed through various wallets across several years before ending up at a Binance deposit address. We’d like to address the recent $NEO price volatility and share our investigation results. Neither Neo Foundation, Neo Global Development, Neo Founders, nor any team members were involved. We deeply value the trust and support of our community, and we’re here to navigate… https://t.co/fskCRKhezK — Neo Smart Economy (@Neo_Blockchain) April 1, 2025 Starting on March 24, 2025, around 9.25 million NEO — about 13.2% of the total circulating supply — began moving through intermediary wallets to Binance. These transfers were estimated at approximately $60 million, based on an average price of $6.50 per token. Although the timing matches the price decline, the foundation stated that the connection remains speculative. “It’s important to note that the activity of this address and the price changes are merely a correlation-based speculation,” the Neo Foundation stated. It added, “While the timing of these transfers aligns with the observed price drop, we cannot confirm a direct causal relationship at this stage.” The wallet in question still holds 2 million NEO. The Neo Foundation is now working with blockchain analytics firms and exchanges to trace the tokens further. “We understand the concerns this volatility and these large-scale transfers have caused within the Neo community, and we share your desire for clarity and stability,” the foundation stated. As the Neo Foundation continues its probe, it has pledged to keep the public informed and to maintain its commitment to the long-term stability of the ecosystem. Neo Foundation Responds as Crypto Market Volatility Intensifies NEO’s decline unfolded during a wider crypto sell-off, where altcoins and memecoins were hit by sudden liquidations on April 1. Act I The AI Prophecy (ACT) dropped nearly 60%, wiping out $96 million in value. Several meme tokens, such as HIPPO, BROCCOLI, and KISHU, followed suit with double-digit losses. Binance updated leverage & margin tiers on tokens like $ACT — and a whale got liquidated for $3.79M at $0.1877. Since then, the price of $ACT has plunged more than 50%. https://t.co/MT0EgNW8ib pic.twitter.com/CRuTR9bwSh — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 1, 2025 According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, Binance’s adjustments to its leverage and margin tiers triggered a wave of liquidations that contributed to the crash. NEO, sometimes referred to as the “Ethereum of China,” recorded a 30.8% weekly loss before recovering slightly with a 6.7% bounce. Coingecko data shows its daily trading volume has fallen 28.4% to $131 million. Once a dominant player in the blockchain sector, NEO’s market capitalization now sits at $390 million — a long way from its all-time high of $198. As the Neo Foundation continues investigating large NEO transfers to Binance, market watchers are eyeing the next developments closely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could these token movements be part of routine portfolio rebalancing rather than panic selling? Whales often shift tokens as a way to secure assets during turbulence. Such reallocation can be a precaution to manage risk, not necessarily a sign of forced liquidation. What might concentrated token flows to a centralized exchange imply for the network’s governance? When a few holders amass a larger share of tokens, it can shift voting power and decision-making influence—potentially prompting future changes in how the network is managed.

With major stablecoin bills moving through Congress and a pro-crypto administration in place, Armstrong sees this as a crucial moment to shape consumer-friendly policies in the U.S. The discussion comes as World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform tied to Donald Trump’s family, prepares to launch its own stablecoin. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to X on Monday to make a case for why the U.S. should allow stablecoin holders to earn interest similar to a traditional savings account, generating widespread debate on social media. Brian Armstrong Advocates For Stablecoin Onchain Interest According to Armstrong’s March 31 X post, the crypto executive believes that onchain interest would grant stablecoins the opportunity to “function as a form of payment” while offering consumers the ability to directly garner interest themselves. https://t.co/Y7JDtkRK1R — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 31, 2025 Armstrong argues that legislation allowing stablecoin holders to earn interest on stablecoins would democratize “access to the market yield rate” and give “regular people a fair shot at growing and maintaining their wealth.” “Opening the door for onchain interest will force us all to up our game for the ultimate benefit of consumers, and will keep this innovation onshore,” Armstrong continued. “Competition breeds strength and those who innovate will win, as they should.” Critics Push Back On Coinbase CEO’s Policy Proposal Despite the digital asset entrepreneur’s enthusiasm, not everyone in the crypto community was as receptive to his policy ideas. “Why wouldn’t these be tokenized shares in money market funds subject to the securities laws ?” said one user. “Doesn’t this ultimately ask the U.S. government to pay crypto users—in dollars—for making their dollars digital?” asked another. These criticisms have emerged at a time when stablecoins are gaining political attention. World Liberty Financial Announces Stablecoin Venture While the debate over interest-bearing stablecoin continues, the broader stablecoin landscape is evolving rapidly. Armstrong’s arguments come amid news that World Liberty Financial , the crypto platform affiliated with U.S. President Donald Trump and his family, has plans to launch its own stablecoin known as USD1. The timing is noteworthy. With major stablecoin legislation currently moving through the U.S. Congress, critics of the move claim it could potentially affect political decision-making. However, Armstrong indicated that upcoming congressional discussions could serve as a key platform for advancing consumer-friendly stablecoin policy. “We have a huge opportunity in front of us right now with a pro-crypto administration and Congress actively working on new stablecoin legislation,” he said. “We can choose to level the playing field and ensure these laws pave a way for all regulated stablecoins to deliver interest directly to consumers, the same way a savings or checking account can.” As stablecoin legislation advances through Congress and prominent figures like Armstrong advocate for specific features, the debate highlights the growing intersection between traditional finance, digital assets, and public policy. The outcome of these discussions could fundamentally reshape how Americans interact with digital dollars and potentially influence global cryptocurrency adoption patterns. Whether lawmakers will incorporate interest-bearing capabilities into forthcoming regulations remains a pivotal question for the industry’s development in the United States. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What would be the benefits of onchain interest? Allowing stablecoins to pay interest could give consumers access to higher returns than traditional bank savings accounts, expand financial inclusion worldwide, and encourage global adoption of USD-backed assets. What role does Congress play in this? With stablecoin legislation currently being debated in Congress, Armstrong sees this as a key opportunity to shape policies that support onchain interest while keeping financial innovation within the U.S. How is the crypto community reacting? While some support Armstrong’s push for more financial freedom, others question whether stablecoins should be treated differently from other interest-bearing assets regulated under securities laws.

In a new interview on the Wolf of all Streets YouTube channel, Hoskinson says memecoins need to evolve and develop use cases and user bases to avoid going through a ‘dumpening’ – the practice of launching tokens with the sole aim of enriching insiders. “So a memecoin is just like the ascendancy of a celebrity that has 15 minutes of fame. It doesn’t necessarily mean that that celebrity is going to disappear forever, but they’re in a temporary state of popularity. They have to find a way to become sustainable quickly or otherwise the people stop paying attention and they die out. It’s why the 99% of the memecoins will fail, and the ones that succeed, they pivot into ecosystem-building… They have to. It’s the only way they can survive. So typically, you have to build community, you have to start doing things with that community, you have to have a reason for people to be there and continue investing. And it’s really hard because, almost always, the distributions of memecoins are built for insider dump. So the person who issues it, and the insiders who issue it, their only incentive is to pump the price to dump the price. So they have to survive the dumpening.” Hoskinson also warns that memecoins are hurting the crypto industry, as issuers tend to drain capital from market participants instead of helping boost digital asset adoption “What’s happening is you’re moving water from one side of the bathtub to the other side of the bathtub… [and] the drain is open, it goes into the founder’s pocket. So basically, you’re not adding water to the tub, you’re losing water over time… It’s net-net neutral or negative.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While meme coins like Pepe and Official Trump have captured the spotlight with sharp rises and rapid declines, BlockDAG (BDAG) is steadily progressing under real-world conditions. Pepe achieved significant early success fueled by social media, and $TRUMP rose sharply with its political timing—only to encounter issues with volatility and longevity. In contrast, BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet “Primordial” is testing economic scenarios, mining capacity, and user interaction to affirm its network’s scalability. Having accumulated over $210 million and distributed 19 billion coins, it demonstrates potential for lasting stability in a market often swayed by fleeting hype. Pepe Coin Journey: How it Excels Pepe Coin (PEPE), introduced in 2023 as a meme-inspired digital currency, has become a top-performing meme token. Initially fueled by social media excitement and strong community support, PEPE has yielded significant returns for early participants. As of March 29, 2025, the coin has increased more than 300% since its launch. Forecasts indicate it might rise between 450% and 1500% throughout 2025, depending on how the market behaves. For example, a $1,000 early stake in 2024 might now be valued at over $4,000. At present, the coin’s value is approximately $0.00001226, with potential growth expected to reach $0.0000413 by year-end. Moreover, its deflationary mechanism—automatically burning a part of each transaction—plays a crucial role in enhancing its market value. Trump Coin: Political Impact on Crypto Market Launched on January 17, 2025, just before Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration, the $TRUMP meme coin quickly became a major topic of discussion. Within just two days, its market valuation rocketed from $600 million to over $13 billion, and its price surged from $7 to a high of $75 per token—an increase of over 900%. Consequently, early backers saw returns from 300% to 19,000%, with some transforming small bets into fortunes. However, the token’s value has significantly dropped by over 50% from its highest point, currently trading between $12.50 and $14. Future predictions remain hopeful, with potential growth of 289% by the end of 2025, possibly hitting €62.97. Moreover, the Trump Organization holds 80% of the token supply, which stirs concerns about centralization and conflicts of interest. Despite generating more than $350 million through token sales and fees, the coin has faced criticisms over ethical issues and financial losses to the community. Ultimately, the $TRUMP coin illustrates both the immense possibilities and the typical risks associated with politically associated cryptocurrencies. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Evaluates Performance Under Real Conditions BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet “Primordial” serves as a realistic testing environment, mimicking the actual conditions that the mainnet will encounter once operational. It is designed to evaluate the network’s performance including transaction speeds, miner activity, and wallet interactions under genuine economic pressures. The focus extends beyond merely spotting flaws; it’s about assessing the network’s resilience in real operational scenarios. The testnet achieves this through supporting more than 2,000 transactions per second with a DAG-based Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism (GHOSTDAG) that allows for simultaneous block processing, offering a significant edge over conventional blockchain systems. With plans to integrate over 200 mining nodes and tens of thousands of wallets, the testnet is currently verifying large-scale transaction handling, precise token distribution, and the execution of EVM-compatible smart contracts. Additionally, providing incentives for leading miners and active wallets ensures that participation mirrors genuine user interactions. For early participants, the numbers provide reassurance. BlockDAG’s crypto presale has successfully gathered $210 million, with more than 19 billion coins distributed thus far. Now in its 27th batch, the price of BDAG stands at $0.0248 each, showing a 2,380% increase in value from the initial batch. These figures not only indicate a growing interest but also confirm a robust confidence in the network’s scalability. Distinguishing Genuine Progress from Mere Speculation While hype can drive quick spikes in interest and potential short-term gains, it’s the robust infrastructure that maintains lasting appeal. Pepe and Official Trump have demonstrated the effects of hype with rapid increases and sudden drops. In contrast, BlockDAG is validating its technology in a different manner. By rigorously testing its Beta Testnet in scenarios that mirror actual usage, it transcends simple market buzz to prove its technical viability. With solid presale support and observable chain activity, BlockDAG is not just chasing fleeting headlines but is establishing a foundation for sustained operation. In a market filled with transient excitement, BlockDAG emphasizes the importance of building systems that are designed to last rather than merely to impress.

CRO Rises 40%, While ZEC Targets Breakout",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-shakes-the-crypto-market-5m-in-48-hours-cro-rises-40-while-zec-targets-breakout/,"Cronos (CRO) is on the upswing as the SEC concludes its investigation into Crypto.com without charges, resulting in a 40% increase over the week. This development reflects a more supportive regulatory environment, enhanced by Crypto.com’s exploratory deal with Trump Media regarding crypto ETFs. However, despite positive news, there’s ongoing speculation about a potential reintroduction of 70 billion CRO, which could impact the token’s supply stability. Simultaneously, Zcash (ZEC) has risen by 12% in 24 hours, surpassing the crucial $33 support level, and now aims for the $45.63 resistance, signaling potential for a significant reversal after a period of low performance. While CRO and ZEC are finding their footing, BlockDAG (BDAG) has surged ahead with a $5 million increase in just 48 hours following Keynote 3, taking its presale to over $210 million. With a functioning beta testnet and substantial user engagement evidenced by over 800,000 app users, BlockDAG demonstrates effective execution beyond mere planning. CRO Climbs 40% This Week Cronos (CRO) is capturing attention again with a 40% rise this week, following the SEC’s decision to end its inquiry into Crypto.com without penalties. This marks a significant positive shift for the crypto landscape under the new SEC leadership, signaling a more lenient approach to digital assets. The enthusiasm is bolstered by Crypto.com’s tentative agreement with Trump Media to introduce crypto-backed ETFs, which propelled CRO by an additional 10% in just a day. Yet, the excitement is tempered by warnings from on-chain analyst ZachXBT about the possible return of 70 billion CRO tokens to circulation, which raises market integrity concerns. Zcash (ZEC) Surges 12% in a Day—Could This Signal a Major Market Shift? Zcash (ZEC) is regaining momentum with a 12% increase, pushing it back into the top 100 cryptocurrencies. After rallying from a low of $25 to regain the critical $33 support, this could be the start of a new upward trend after extended declines. While the immediate outlook shows mixed signals, the successful breach of a long-term downtrend and positive indicators on the RSI and MACD suggest increasing momentum. Potential buyers should monitor the $45.63 resistance closely. A breakthrough could initiate a wider rally. As one of the foundational privacy-focused coins, ZEC maintains enduring relevance, and current low prices might offer a significant entry point with substantial growth prospects. BlockDAG Secures $5M Rapidly Following Keynote 3 In a remarkable 48-hour period post-Keynote 3, BlockDAG has garnered an impressive $5 million, pushing its presale total beyond $210 million. This significant increase occurred shortly after demonstrating substantial advancements, including a live Beta Testnet with over 1.2 million transactions, robust block explorer capabilities, and comprehensive tools for token and NFT creation, alongside the operation of more than 100 active nodes. Unlike some Layer 1 projects that are still in the planning phase, BlockDAG is actively delivering results, which is catalyzing a strong response from the market. Currently, during Batch 27 of sales, BDAG is priced at $0.0248, with more than 19 billion coins already sold. Complemented by a vibrant community of over 800,000 X1 App users and 16,700+ units sold to miners, along with high-profile partnerships like those with Inter Milan and UFC, it’s clear why analysts are optimistic about BDAG reaching $1 post-listing. With the crypto presale accelerating following Keynote 3, the impending launch of mainnet features, DeFi tools, and new exchange listings is highly anticipated. The recent $5 million raised in just two days is a strong indicator of the potential excitement surrounding BDAG’s official release. This could be an opportunity many will wish they hadn’t missed. Critical Insights While CRO’s recent price jump might look attractive for quick gains, ongoing uncertainties about its token supply and overall market trust could dampen its growth. Meanwhile, Zcash faces its own challenges in sustaining momentum after its initial market recovery, with its long-term viability still to be proven. The future of both projects hinges on upcoming developments, including market sentiment shifts, new partnerships, and their ability to overcome technical resistance levels. In contrast, BlockDAG is turning potential into tangible success. The latest Keynote didn’t just serve as a promotional event but highlighted a project that is already in full swing, with over 1.2 million transactions on its testnet and effective smart contract functionalities, backed by a community that’s actively engaging with its tools. The swift $5 million raised post-Keynote isn’t just excitement; it’s a strong endorsement from both retail and institutional participants. Unlike its peers, BlockDAG isn’t merely waiting for external factors to boost its profile; it’s actively creating its momentum.

Elon brought charts, handed out $1 million checks, and used a packed town hall to accuse Biden of funneling taxpayer funds into what he called a broken system. The rally happened just a day and a half before polls opened in a high-stakes state judicial election. The event grabbed national attention after Elon gave the money to two Wisconsin voters who signed a petition against “activist judges.” That petition followed a ruling from the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which refused to hear a case saying the giveaway was illegal. After the checks, Elon brought up his DOGE associate Antonio Gracias to talk about what they uncovered inside the Social Security Administration. Behind them, a large slide appeared with the words “New Non-Citizen Social Security Numbers Issued.” Antonio explained what it meant. Elon Musk at the rally event. Source: Fox News/Getty Images “We started at the top of the system, mapping the whole system of Social Security to understand where all the fraud was,” Antonio said during the event. “But this is what jumped out at us. When we saw these numbers, we were like, ‘What is this?’” Antonio said that between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2025, noncitizens were issued Social Security numbers in growing numbers. In fiscal year 2024 alone, more than 2 million received them. The year before that, and even in fiscal year 2025 which began in October and runs through this September, the number was around 1 million each year. “This literally blew us away,” Antonio said. “We went there to find fraud and we found this by accident.” Elon’s Social Security overhaul may slow checks and support Jason Fichtner, who served as deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration under President George W. Bush, said things are getting risky. “Now I’m concerned that benefits could get disrupted,” he said. Jason said these new updates aren’t small tweaks—they could block people from getting help at all. Jason joined Kathleen Romig, another former SSA official and now director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in a public op-ed. They wrote that 7,000 workers have been removed from the SSA, and six regional offices have been shut down. That means fewer people to help, longer lines at field offices, and more bugs on the official SSA website. The phone line? It already had long waits before the layoffs. Now it’s worse. Kathleen and Jason said this mess could hit people with disabilities hardest. Delays could leave them waiting so long they die before getting the money they’re owed. “The Social Security Administration is in crisis, and people’s benefits are at risk,” they wrote. Jason also spoke about DOGE’s plan to wipe out COBOL, the old programming language that runs millions of lines of SSA code. DOGE wants to rebuild the entire system in a few months. Jason said that’s reckless. “If you start messing with the system’s code, that could impact those who are currently getting benefits now,” he said. Normally, a change like that would take years. It would start with one state, then move out slowly to other regions. Jason said DOGE isn’t doing that. Instead, they’re forcing everything through in a tight window, with no time for test runs or slow rollouts. Jason said he wasn’t too worried at first. He knew there were service delays, but he didn’t think people’s monthly checks were at risk. But now, with this COBOL plan moving full speed, he said it’s a whole new problem. The Social Security Administration responded by email saying, “There is no validity to these reports.” The White House used the same exact words too, oddly enough.

The company collapsed amid a liquidity crisis and fraud allegations. The news uncovered that Alameda Research, a closely related trading company to FTX, had invested billions of dollars of client funds in dubious investments. As clients flocked to withdraw their cash, FTX had insufficient funds to accommodate the demands, sending investors into chaos and the company’s swift downfall. FTX and Alameda Research collapsed on November 11, 2022. Further investigations indicated that FTX’s founder and chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, had diverted customer deposits. He was charged and convicted of fraud and conspiracy. The European subsidiary, FTX EU, was also impacted. Even with the stricter European oversight, customer assets in the broader FTX bankruptcy were trapped. FTX EU was purchased in January 2025 by Backpack Exchange, a regulated global cryptocurrency platform founded by ex-FTX and Alameda Research staff. The FTX bankruptcy court and the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) gave the acquisition the green light, allowing Backpack to scale its services throughout Europe. As part of the acquisition, Backpack would have handled the distribution of court-eventually approved bankruptcy claims to FTX EU customers, with a target to speed up the restitution process. Backpack Exchange has structured a claims process to facilitate customer restitution Backpack Exchange has created a simple process to recover funds for the affected FTX EU clients. The process starts with identity verification, requiring users to utilize a responsive verification system. The step is live and can be accessed via Backpack’s official claims page. Users who have successfully passed the verification process can then withdraw their funds. Backpack will share instructions as soon as the withdrawal phase goes live CEO Armani Ferrante stated that this is a significant effort and reaffirmed restitution to customers as a central element of building trust and confidence across the industry. Backpack Exchange has also made extensive support accessible across supported channels to assist users in recovery. The community is reacting and sharing feedback on social media The request for the asset recovery process brought different views within the crypto ecosystem. Responses from users on the social media platform have been optimistic and sceptical. “It’s been a really long road for us,” one user posted . Another said, “This is the minimum they could do after all of this time. I hope it will not take long.” Another one stated. The structured claims process is a great step in the right direction to re-attach FTX EU customers’ funds to the company while the company is now where it needed to be from the beginning, in the customer’s hands. As the Backpack Exchange aims to rebalance, however, the gaze of the cryptocurrency community will fall on them to secure their trust for good. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Despite the current rally, it remains unknown how the BTC price will react to the tariffs in the long term. Bitcoin is known to exhibit short-term reversal to macroeconomic uncertainties, a trend many believe may play out again. State of the Donald Trump Reciprocal Tariff One of the most crucial policies in the Donald Trump administration is levying tariffs on key trade partners. While this move is considered a commensurate measure to match what other trade partners are levying on US goods, the aftermath has toppled the market. Almost all big economies, including Russia have received Tariff threat from the US government. This threat is bound to be matched by the countries involved, including Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union. With Trump’s tariff kickstarting on April 2, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has revealed that reciprocal measures will be announced on April 3. This tariff war is poised to offset the mainstream stock market. The signs are already visible in the S&P 500, which has dropped by over 2% in the past five trading days. Similar negative sentiment is seen for the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones. The correlation between Bitcoin price and the mainstream financial market remains a fueling factor behind potential negative shifts in the market moving forward. Bitcoin Price is Yet to Adjust As of writing, the price of Bitcoin has rallied 3.44% in 24 hours to $85,186.47, according to CoinMarketCap data . However, the coin’s price has experienced a unique drawdown over the past week, dropping 2.79%. Since President Trump took office, the price of Bitcoin has experienced a mix of positive and negative sentiments. Amid the positive shifts, the BTC price hit $109,114 ATH on January 20, corresponding with President Trump’s inauguration. Since the all-time high milestone, Bitcoin price has fallen by over 20% to date. With the trade wars forming a headwind for the coin, more volatility is expected in the short term. With the trade war and reciprocal tariffs, inflation will soar again, forcing the Federal Reserve to adjust its interest rate policy. Should rates be slashed to boost the monetary landscape, it can set a basis for more BTC adoption, leading to a price surge in the long term. BTC Price and Key Tailwinds to Watch While April started positively for the top coin, the month still holds uncertainties per the trade war. However, some important tailwinds are at play that may influence market valuation moving forward. The US government’s strategic Bitcoin reserve might serve as a basis for more nation-state adoption in the long term. Institutional investors are also betting on BTC, creating a high demand for the coin. Despite the current volatility, top advocates advise buying now with hopes of a rebound soon.

The analyst warns that this technical formation could trigger a significant price correction for XRP, describing this downturn as the worst-case scenario. Analyst Predicts XRP Price Crash To $1.15 The ‘Charting Guy,’ a pseudonymous crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has unveiled a potential Head and Shoulder pattern formation on the XRP price chart. The analyst has shared insights into the implications of this technical pattern, projecting a potential crash in the XRP price. Related Reading: XRP Price Breakdown below $2: Analyst Reveals Next Major Support As a well-known bearish reversal pattern, the formation of a Head and Shoulder in the XRP price chart suggests a potential shift from an uptrend to a downtrend. Typically, a Head and Shoulder pattern consists of three peaks: the Left Shoulder, Head, and Right Shoulder. However, the Charting Guy has confirmed that XRP’s current pattern formation consists of two right shoulders and one head. Due to this irregularity, the analyst has expressed doubt about the possibility of the pattern playing out. If the Head and Shoulder pattern eventually takes shape, it could lead to a significant drop in the XRP price, potentially bringing it down to as low as $1.15. This price level aligns with a key Fibonacci Golden Pocket retracement zone between 0.618 – 0.786. Notably, the analyst has described this projected price crash as the worst-case scenario for XRP. While he believes a bearish move is possible, the analyst is confident that XRP’s broader market structure is bullish. Moreover, the Charting Guy argues that if XRP does decline to $1.15, it would likely serve as a healthy retracement in an overall bullish trend. He noted that XRP’s price has been holding the $2 level on daily closes, meaning its price action remains strong above support levels. This also indicates the possibility of an uptrend resumption that could yield higher highs and higher lows for XRP. Key Support And Resistance Levels To Watch The Charting Guy’s analysis of XRP’s potential Head and Shoulder pattern formation highlights several critical price levels to watch. Since XRP has consistently closed daily candles above $2, the analyst has determined this level as short-term support. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Begin Part 2 Of Bullish Wave 5 Movement, Here Are The Targets XRP has also been wicking during recent pullbacks in a crucial range between $1.7 and $1.9. As a result, the crypto analyst has revealed that he will be watching this area closely for a potential price bounce. The Golden Pocket retracement zone, which represents the worst-case scenario for the XRP price, is between $1.15 and $1.30. If XRP experiences a deeper price correction, lower support levels have been marked from $1.19 to $0.91. For its resistance levels, the Charting Guy has pinpointed $2.27 as a key price point. Additionally, $3.14 – $3.32 has been identified as an upper resistance range where XRP could rally if bullish momentum resumes.

Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), once the undisputed performers of the blockchain world, are seeing investors turn their attention elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an emerging player in decentralized finance that is capturing market interest at an unprecedented pace. With ETH currently trading at $1,814 and SOL at $126, their growth appears to be tapering, MUTM tokens are available during their Phase 4 presale which are priced at $0.025. A strong investor backing emerged through the acquisition of more than 7700 buyers who have raised $6 million during the presale process. Investors participating in Mutuum Finance Phase 4 token purchase earn 140% profit at $0.06 at exchange launch. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates in Phase 4 The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale is in progress while the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of hyper-inflated meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 4 of the presale has surpassed $5.9 million total shares and attracted more than 7600 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.025 during Phase 4 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Investors who bought in Phase 4 obtained 140% growth from their investment once MUTM launches. The current cost of MUTM attracts investors to buy during Phase 5 since it will undergo another pricing increase to 0.03. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders receive dependable income while borrowers get secure financing opportunities through this system. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Security takes precedence in this ecosystem through combination with open-source smart contracts along with third-party audits to establish complete transparency. The MUTM token holders benefit from both price growth potential and earn passive income while receiving investments through a strategic buyback system that strengthens long-term token value. Mutuum Finance aims to increase accessibility and liquidity by implementing multi-chain expansion which will include EVM and non-EVM blockchain support. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining decentralized lending with its innovative dual-model system, attracting thousands of investors seeking sustainable DeFi solutions. The Phase 4 presale has already raised over $6 million from more than 7,700 buyers, with the token price set to surge from $0.025 to $0.06 at launch, delivering an impressive 140% profit potential. As traditional blockchain giants like Ethereum and Solana experience slowed momentum, savvy investors are securing their positions in MUTM before the next price increase in Phase 5. With its cutting-edge security, automated interest rate adjustments, and multi-chain expansion, Mutuum Finance is primed for long-term success. Don’t miss out on this opportunity and join the presale today and be part of the future of DeFi.

Pineau’s announcement comes just weeks before Meta’s LlamaCon AI conference on April 29, where the company is set to unveil the latest version of Llama. Pineau departs Meta as AI race intensifies under Zuckerberg’s vision In a LinkedIn post, Pineau, who serves as Meta’s Vice President of AI Research, revealed that her last day at the company will be May 30. Her departure comes at a crucial moment for Meta, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made AI a top priority, committing billions of dollars to position the company as a leader in the field, ahead of competitors like OpenAI and Google. According to Zuckerberg, his goal for Meta is to build an AI assistant with more than 1 billion users and artificial general intelligence, which is a term used to describe computers that can think and take actions comparable to humans. “As the world undergoes significant change, as the race for AI accelerates, and as Meta prepares for its next chapter, it is time to create space for others to pursue the work,” Pineau wrote. She noted that she would be cheering from the sidelines, knowing that the firm has all the ingredients needed to build the best AI systems in the world and responsibly bring them into the lives of billions of people. Pineau was one of Meta’s leading AI researchers, having headed the company’s fundamental AI research division, FAIR, since 2023. In this role, she guided the company’s advanced computer science research, much of which has been integrated into its core applications. Pineau reflects on legacy at Meta ahead of key AI milestones and LlamaCon event Pineau began her tenure at Meta in 2017 to lead Meta’s Montreal AI research lab . In addition to her role at Meta, she is a computer science professor at McGill University, where she is a co-director of its reasoning and learning lab. She helped oversee some of the projects, including Meta’s open-source Llama family of AI models and other technologies, such as the PyTorch software for AI developers. Her departure announcement comes a few weeks ahead of Meta’s LlamaCon AI conference at the end of this month. In this event, Meta is expected to provide details on its latest version of Llama. Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, to whom Pineau reported had earlier, noted that Llama 4 will help power AI agents, the latest craze in generative AI. The firm is also expected to announce a standalone app for its Meta AI chatbot. A Meta spokesperson expressed gratitude for Joelle Pineau’s leadership of FAIR and acknowledged her significant contributions as an important advocate for Open Source. They highlighted her role in driving breakthroughs that have advanced both the company’s products and the science behind them. Pineau has not revealed her next role but said she “will be taking some time to observe and to reflect before jumping into a new adventure.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Investors hoped that regulatory reform and policies like a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve would drive prices appreciably higher. But it’s been the opposite. Bitcoin has fallen from highs well above $100,000 at the beginning of the year to a trough in the mid-80,000s for most of March. Crypto prices have suffered from being increasingly correlated with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, which have been hit by macroeconomic uncertainty. Tariffs — surcharges the U.S. places on imports from other countries — have Wall Street worried about a global recession. Crypto investors have been steering clear of crypto assets, which are seen as relatively risky. “This is all about markets’ ‘risk appetite’ which continues to deteriorate, and for the time being drives a wedge between crypto assets and gold, which continues to be the ‘safe haven’ of choice,” said Marc Ostwald, Chief Economist & Global Strategist at ADM Investor Services International. “[That’s] in no small part driven by central bank FX reserve managers, who are seeking to reduce USD exposure, which has long been a source of concern to them.” As the global financial and trade system becomes more fragmented, investors are seeking alternatives to riskier assets, including dollars. For now, that means turning to gold, which is up 18% year-to-date. But that could change, said Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and author of ""The Story of the Blockchain: A Beginner's Guide to the Technology That Nobody Understands."" Bitcoin could be the new gold soon enough. “I think the entire [future] is uncertain and in some ways unknowable, because there are many crosscurrents and both crypto and tariffs are new. Some people argue that crypto is just a risk-on tech asset and would sell off due to tariffs. But bitcoin has found footing in some circles as ‘digital gold’ and the physical variety is soaring on the tariff news. So which will it be?” In other words, economic uncertainty could lead investors to seek out bitcoin just as they have sought out gold in recent months. Another note of positivity: the impact of tariffs on crypto could be “priced in” and the worst might be over already, said Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale, a leading crypto asset management firm. President Trump is due to announce U.S. tariffs on Wednesday, April 2, at 4 p.m. ET—what’s known as “Liberation Day.” According to reports, he’ll lay out “reciprocal tariffs” against 15 countries that have levied tariffs against the U.S., including China, Canada and Mexico. Pandl estimates tariffs have so far taken 2% off economic growth this year. But Liberation Day might actually stop the worst of the pain felt in financial markets. “If we see an announcement [on Wednesday] that is tough but phased, and focused on the 15 countries they seem to be targeting, my expectation is that markets will rally on that news,” Pandl told CoinDesk. “Potentially once we get through this announcement, crypto markets can focus back on the fundamentals which are very positive.” Pandl said announcements like Circle’s IPO wouldn’t be happening if institutions didn’t have a high degree of confidence in the digital assets sector and the policies around it. Moreover, Pandl, a former macro-economist at Goldman Sachs, believes that tariffs will increase the appetite for currencies that aren’t dollars. “I think tariffs will weaken the dominant role of the dollar and create space for competitors including bitcoin. Prices have gone down in the short run. But the first few months of the Trump Administration have raised my conviction in the longer term for bitcoin as a global monetary asset.” Pendl still believes that bitcoin will hit new all-time highs this year, despite current pessimism around prices. “I wouldn’t have quit my Wall Street job if I didn’t think bitcoin will be the winner in the long term,” he said.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 01:28:58

Genesis Global Capital LLC, 23-cv-00287 , filed in the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). This lawsuit alleges that Gemini failed to register its cryptocurrency asset lending program, Gemini Earn, before offering it to retail investors. Gemini and SEC seek 60-day pause in legal battle over Gemini Earn In a joint letter filed on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court, the twins’ Gemini Trust and the SEC asked to hold all deadlines in the civil case over Gemini Earn for 60 days to allow the parties to explore a potential resolution. The letter did not say whether this might entail a settlement, the government agency dropping its case, or some other outcome. Neither Gemini’s nor the SEC’s lawyers immediately responded to requests for comment. In 2023, the regulatory body filed a lawsuit against Gemini, alleging that the exchange and Genesis Global Capital unlawfully raised billions of dollars in cryptocurrency through the Gemini Earn program. The program allowed customers to lend crypto assets, including Bitcoin, to Genesis in exchange for interest payments, with Gemini taking a fee as high as 4.29%. Genesis halted withdrawals in November 2022, the same month Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX cryptocurrency exchange collapsed. Two months later, it filed for bankruptcy. At the time, it held $900 million of assets from about 340,000 Gemini Earn customers. According to the SEC, Genesis and Gemini bypassed disclosure requirements meant to protect investors in creating Gemini Earn. Genesis agreed in March 2024 to pay a $21 million fine to settle, pending the resolution of claims in its Chapter 11 case, without admitting wrongdoing. On the other hand, Gemini continues to deny any wrongdoing in relation to the allegations. SEC shifts crypto regulatory stance under Trump, easing oversight and settling key cases The SEC has eased oversight of the cryptocurrency industry since Donald Trump became president in January. It is widely expected to remain more supportive of it than under the Biden administration. In recent weeks, the watchdog has ended civil lawsuits against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and agreed to settle a case against cryptocurrency company Ripple Labs over the unregistered sale of securities. Many crypto advocates hailed Trump’s election, hoping for more industry-friendly regulation and less regulatory enforcement. The billionaire Winklevoss brothers, Tyler and Cameron, each donated $844,600 to Trump’s 2024 campaign, the maximum allowed under federal law. According to Forbes, the brothers are each worth $3 billion. In a separate matter, Gemini reached a settlement with New York regulators, agreeing to return at least $1.1 billion to its customers.

This decision follows several days of controversy over the building’s status. Although the formal dispute continues in court, the judge stated that the building transfer has already taken place and thus cannot be undone at this time. On Saturday, officials associated with DOGE transferred the USIP headquarters, located in Washington, DC, to the General Services Administration (GSA). Judge Howell wrote that the transfer is “no longer merely ‘proposed’ but done,” which, in her view, made the plaintiffs’ request to block it moot for now. The building also contains office property and fixtures whose ownership the former USIP staff hoped to protect through the legal process. USIP building in Washington, DC. Source: Wikipedia George Foote, a longtime outside general counsel to the institute, has voiced frustration with the situation. In his words, “That’s like letting a burglar break into your house, steal your TV, and have the court say well, there’s no TV to adjudicate, so I can’t do anything about it.” This building has become a focal point of a dispute between the USIP’s former board and staff and members of DOGE. On March 14, the Trump administration dismissed the institute’s 10 voting board members. When USIP staff refused to allow DOGE employees to enter the headquarters, the DOGE group returned with a physical key that a former security contractor had given them. That action allowed DOGE to take physical control of the premises. After that, a series of personnel changes occurred within the institute itself. First, former State Department official Kenneth Jackson was put in place as USIP president. Then, on March 25, DOGE staffer Nate Cavanaugh replaced him. Before that, Cavanaugh had been assigned to the GSA. By last Friday evening, the majority of USIP employees received termination notices, effectively bringing the agency’s work to a standstill. Details from a lawsuit filed on Monday by former USIP staffers against Cavanaugh, DOGE, Donald Trump, and others in the administration show that Cavanaugh sought to transfer the headquarters to the GSA without asking the government to pay anything. In a letter, he told GSA Acting Administrator Stephen Ehikian that the transfer “is in the best interest of USIP, the federal government, and the United States.” In a different letter dated March 29, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought agreed to Ehikian’s request to “set the amount of reimbursement at no cost” for the facility. A court filing from Monday also lays out the Trump administration’s reasoning. Michael Peters, who leads the Public Buildings Service at the GSA, wrote in a transfer request form that “The transfer of the U.S. Institutes [sic] of Peace (USIP) headquarters facility … is a priority of the Trump-Vance administration.” The building’s transfer may not be permanent, at least for now Under the arrangement just approved by Howell, the federal government obtains the USIP building at no cost, even though the structure itself is valued at around $500 million. The institute’s endowment, worth more than $20 million across various bank accounts, still belongs to USIP for the moment. However, that endowment might also face uncertainty later. Judge Howell said there is no immediate need to stop any transfer of funds and that she did not view blocking it as essential to the broader case right now. One major issue is whether the USIP belongs fully to the federal government or operates as an independent agency outside of the executive branch. Lawyers for DOGE have argued in court that the USIP is a “wholly owned government corporation,” giving the GSA permission to take its property. On the other side, attorneys for USIP point to the 1984 United States Institute of Peace Act, which established the institute as an “independent, nonprofit, national institute.” That legislation, in their view, clearly separates USIP from typical federal agencies. They also contend that the headquarters building resulted from extensive private donations, which means it should not be seized as a public asset. Judge Howell has acknowledged that both sides have introduced conflicting arguments and says that “ambiguity persists” because there is very little law on point about how exactly to classify the USIP. Previously, she declined the institute’s request for a temporary restraining order that would have allowed the original board to return to their positions. That denial left the institute under DOGE’s control, at least for the time being. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

You should not overlook this. BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly gaining attention as a high-speed Layer 1 platform backed by a hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work model. With its expanding use cases and appeal to meme coin creators, it’s earning a reputation as the potential “Solana alternative” for 2025. However, what’s pushing it to the forefront isn’t just the technology—it’s the growing trend of meme coin adoption. The numbers highlight the momentum. BlockDAG has already raised over $210 million in its presale, with $5 million collected within just two days after Keynote 3. Now in Batch 27, BDAG is selling at $0.0248, with more than 19 billion coins distributed—showing no signs of slowing. Why Meme Coins Flourish on Layer 1 Chains with the Right Setup Solana’s growth wasn’t only because of its speed. It became a base for meme tokens like BONK, WIF, and SAMO due to cheap fees and quick transactions. But Solana has had issues like network disruptions and weak EVM integration, making DeFi expansion harder. BlockDAG takes these problems into account and brings added functionality. Keynote 3 revealed that BlockDAG’s mainnet will launch with full DeFi capabilities: Swaps: Allowing instant trading of meme coins. Lending & Staking: Letting users earn on idle assets. Bridges: Making it easier to move coins between chains. Governance Modules: Letting communities participate in project direction. Token & NFT Creation Wizard: Helping users launch meme coins quickly without needing to write any code. What sets BlockDAG apart is that it’s compatible with both EVM and WASM. That allows builders from Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems to easily bring their projects over. Meme coins thrive on fast execution, strong community support, and liquidity. BlockDAG brings all three to the table. User Growth Shows Meme Ecosystem Is Already Taking Shape on BlockDAG The base of a meme coin economy is user energy—memes, activities, and online participation. BlockDAG’s network shows strong signs: Over 800,000 users mining BDAG on the X1 Miner App More than 400,000 have joined the Tap Miner game Around 170,000 users have taken part in the presale These aren’t inflated numbers or inactive accounts. They’re real people interacting with the ecosystem and mining BDAG before it reaches centralized platforms. That kind of early activity helped push Solana into the meme coin spotlight. BlockDAG appears to be building similar momentum, with more structure behind it. Meme Coins Need DeFi Tools—BlockDAG Makes Them Accessible For meme coins to last, they must go beyond just hype. With BlockDAG’s tools, meme tokens can function within a full ecosystem. Users can launch a community token, list it on a BDAG-powered DEX, activate staking features, and set up bridges—all without coding. These tools were already shown in action during the Beta Testnet in Keynote 3. This early exposure is drawing attention from outside players, too. BlockDAG has over 10 confirmed exchange listings coming after the mainnet, and there are talks about large-scale backing preparing to enter. At the current price of $0.0248, there’s rising anticipation around BDAG touching the $1 mark. The combined effect of liquidity, staking activity, and listings creates a strong path for price growth. BlockDAG Sets the Stage for Meme Coin Breakouts With more than $210 million already secured during the crypto presale , BlockDAG’s structure is turning heads. Its combination of fast processing, EVM/WASM compatibility, and active participation makes it more than just a tech solution. “It’s about the next phase,” shared CEO Antony Turner during Keynote 3, hinting at the project’s roadmap. What lies ahead could set off a new era of meme coins—this time on a foundation built for performance and community strength. Solana began the trend. BlockDAG is ready to scale it. With high-speed architecture and tools that simplify meme coin development, the potential is growing. At the current price point, the entry looks promising.

However, the price remains confined within specific ranges, and tools like RSI and MACD suggest declining strength. Concurrently, Tether is evolving past its stablecoin persona by buying a 30% share in Be Water Media for $10.8 million. This strategy leans more towards influence than just infrastructure. On another front, BlockDAG (BDAG) is playing a whole new game. With a $210 million fund, over 800,000 miners, and an active hybrid DAG + PoW testnet, BlockDAG isn’t just in the news—it’s creating history. From enhancing smart contract safety to achieving 2,000 transactions per second, it”‘ putting into action what others merely discuss. While ETH and USDT are repositioning themselves, BlockDAG is precisely advancing towards a full Layer-1 debut, potentially transforming the crypto architecture completely. Ethereum Whales Build Up Pre-Pectra—Yet Risks of Breakdown Persist Ethereum whales are intensifying their purchases as the Pectra mainnet upgrade nears, scheduled for April 30. Lookonchain data indicates substantial acquisitions, including a whale who bought over $103 million worth of ETH. Additionally, exchange reserves have diminished by close to one million ETH since early March, suggesting increased accumulation. Despite this positive sentiment, ETH’s price remains subdued. It recently fell below a crucial trendline after failing at $2,069, which heightens the risk of a significant drop towards $1,800 or even $1,200 if a bearish pattern holds. Early indicators from RSI and MACD point to growing weaknesses. While the Pectra upgrade could stimulate network activities, wider economic uncertainties and ETF withdrawals are tempering the momentum. Market watchers should keep an eye on $2,069 and $1,800; the first level to give could dictate Ethereum’s next significant direction. Tether Secures 30% of Be Water Media in $10.8M Transaction Tether has boldly stepped outside the cryptocurrency sphere by securing a 30.4% interest in the Italian media company Be Water for €10 million ($10.8 million). With CEO Paolo Ardoino joining Be Water’s board, Tether is positioning itself to impact the media through storytelling and advanced technology content. This strategic pivot marks Tether’s transition from focusing solely on stablecoins to engaging in film, podcasts, and live media production. While Guido Maria Brera continues to hold the majority stake, Tether’s involvement could redefine how content is produced and distributed across different platforms. As the lines between cryptocurrency and mainstream media continue to merge, this investment places Tether at the forefront of influencing digital narratives. This move is viewed by analysts as part of a broader strategy where crypto entities penetrate traditional sectors to broaden their influence and lessen their dependency on primary offerings. Upcoming regulatory discussions might ensue as the crypto industry further integrates with mainstream sectors. BlockDAG Raises $210M—Could This Redefine Layer-1 Technologies? BlockDAG has successfully raised $210 million through its presale, showcasing its strength in smart Layer-1 design, eclipsing many trend-based crypto initiatives. This platform is engineered for scalability, security, and decentralization from the ground up, steering clear of reliance on secondary patches and Layer-2 solutions. During Keynote 3, the team unveiled modern hybrid architecture combining Proof-of-Work with DAG, allowing simultaneous transaction processing. This framework not only runs a beta testnet but is also geared up for 2,000 transactions per second at launch, with aspirations to expand to 15,000 TPS in the next two years. Security is a paramount feature, with each smart contract rigorously audited by Certik and Halborn, and the treasury safeguarded through multi-party computation, eliminating any single failure points. The system’s inherent real-time threat monitoring and network defenses negate the necessity for supplementary security layers. Already supported by over 800,000 X1 miners and 170,000 holders, and enhanced by an accessible no-code token creation tool, BlockDAG is a testament to robust, integral infrastructure. It integrates functionalities ranging from DeFi to governance seamlessly within a secure Layer-1 environment. As other networks add layers of complexity, BlockDAG demonstrates that a strong foundational build is superior to makeshift solutions. With the mainnet launch imminent, the focus shifts from potential to actual implementation. Key Insights The upcoming reaction to Ethereum’s Pectra mainnet could swing ETH’s value significantly. Tether’s venture into media is bold and shows long-term ambition but lacks immediate benefits to its network, presenting both opportunities and risks. These moves are crucial yet speculative. Keynote 3 introduced a dynamic ecosystem actively developing—featuring DeFi innovations, a treasury secured by MPC, and tools for creating no-code NFTs and tokens, with global hackathons in progress. BlockDAG’s approach eschews dependence on Layer-2 adjustments or external narrative shifts, focusing instead on direct scalability, security, and market adoption. The $210 million milestone in the crypto presale signals robust confidence from over 170,000 holders, distinguishing BlockDAG in a market saturated with transient trends. While Ethereum and Tether are planning their future moves, BlockDAG is already delivering tangible results, establishing its platform one block at a time. The vision for the future of crypto isn’t layered—it’s built on a solid foundation, and BlockDAG’s foundation is firmly in place.

However, as the market evolves, Ethereum is facing a slowdown, leading smart investors to seek higher-growth alternatives. With scalability concerns, high gas fees, and slowing institutional interest, Ethereum’s dominance is being challenged. This has opened the door for new projects with better efficiency, lower costs, and stronger upside potential. One hidden crypto gaining traction among early adopters and institutional investors is RCO Finance (RCOF) , a next-generation crypto designed to deliver explosive returns and real-world utility. Why Ethereum’s (ETH) Growth Is Slowing Ethereum (ETH), once hailed as the backbone of decentralized finance and blockchain innovation, has faced significant challenges recently. Now trading at $1,837, ETH has dropped by over 55% since November, when it rose to $4,106, the closest it has been to its all-time high since 2021. Here’s what is causing this declining performance. Despite hosting over 60% of all DeFi projects, Ethereum is no longer the only major player in the blockchain space. Competitors like Solana , Cardano , and Avalanche have gained traction by offering faster transaction speeds and lower costs. They are increasingly attracting developers and projects that might have otherwise chosen Ethereum. Ethereum’s transaction fees have remained a major pain point for users. Despite layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, the cost of interacting with the Ethereum network remains significantly higher than newer blockchain solutions. This has pushed many developers and users toward more affordable platforms. While Ethereum was once the go-to blockchain for institutional adoption, many investment firms and hedge funds are now exploring newer blockchain ecosystems that offer better speed, lower costs, and advanced financial tools. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Hidden Crypto Smart Money Is Migrating To As Ethereum’s growth slows, smart investors are rotating into undervalued cryptos with stronger short-term potential. RCOF has emerged as one of the top picks for high-growth opportunities, offering a scalable, AI-powered ecosystem with real-world financial integrations. RCO Finance’s core offering is its groundbreaking robo-advisor , an AI-powered trading assistant that is transforming how we interact with the crypto world. Think of it as your personal financial advisor, available 24/7. This tool offers real-time market insights, portfolio management, automated trade execution and tailored investment guidance. The robo-advisor uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical and real-time market data to create personalized investment and trading plans based on a user’s references. This can include your financial goals, risk tolerance, how long you want to invest, and other market preferences. This customization enables you to easily create a profitable portfolio without prior experience. What’s better, the robo-advisor can adjust things should market conditions or your preferences change. Let’s say you initially adopt a conservative investment strategy, focusing on low-risk assets like government bonds, but as you gain confidence and explore opportunities for higher returns, your risk appetite might increase. The robo-advisor can easily adjust your strategy, diversifying your portfolio to include high-performing altcoins like FUNToken (FUN), which has grown by over 185% in the last week. This adaptive framework ensures your investments remain aligned with your evolving goals, offering you the flexibility to capitalize on lucrative opportunities without compromising your financial stability. This crypto is breaking new ground with its real-world asset (RWA) integration. This feature allows investors to access diverse investment options that include digital assets and RWAs like ETFs, commodities, real estate, bonds and more. This ingenious initiative democratizes access to these high-value assets once reserved for a select few. It also bridges the gap between crypto and traditional finance, providing stability to counter the volatility of crypto investments. Many platforms require users to fulfil Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements before they can participate. This approach often forces users to submit sensitive personal documents, undergo identity checks, and navigate tedious approval processes. This can be off-putting for those who value their anonymity and lock out users in restricted regions. RCOF’s KYC-free ecosystem eliminates this burden, allowing users from anywhere worldwide to participate without compromising their personal data. Given the market’s vulnerability to scams and rug pulls, RCOF has taken a proactive approach to ensuring the security and reliability of its platform by undergoing a rigorous SolidProof audit . This meticulous audit shows its smart contracts and codebase are free of vulnerabilities, reassuring users of its trustworthiness and security. Unlike many DeFi projects that hold back their features until after launch, RCOF has boldly unveiled its beta platform during the presale stage, a rarity in the crypto world. This move showcases the platform’s confidence in its technology and allows you to test its cutting-edge features first-hand. This fully functional version has already attracted over 10,000 active users exploring the platform and providing valuable feedback to refine and enhance its features. Want to see the robo-advisor in action? Access the beta platform here . Capitalize on This Opportunity: Invest in RCOF While Ethereum remains a powerful crypto, multiple challenges have caused investor confidence to wane, pushing them to RCO Finance. The combination of AI-driven tools, real-world asset integration, and early-stage growth potential makes it a prime target for those looking for exponential gains. Priced at $0.100 in the 5th stage of the presale , this is your chance to get in on the action while the price is still low. With an estimated launch price between $0.40 and $0.60, your investment could grow by between 300% and 500%. Smart investors are already jumping on this opportunity, with over half of the tokens allocated for this stage already gone. Your window of opportunity is closing fast. Act now, make smart money moves by joining RCOF and position yourself for massive returns.

42779954,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=722182,1743559259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42779954.jpeg,Shifting Sentiment? Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Stay Put Despite Losses,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/shifting-sentiment-short-term-bitcoin-holders-stay-put-despite-losses/,"According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, short-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders are choosing to retain their digital assets despite incurring unrealized losses. CryptoQuant contributor Onchained explained that short-term BTC holders have recorded significantly lower realized losses compared to their unrealized losses. Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Expecting A Price Rally? The first quarter of 2025 has been marked by high price volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin. BTC has dropped from approximately $97,000 on January 1 to around $83,000 at the time of writing, reflecting a decline of more than 15%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Make Big Moves As Bullish Momentum Resurfaces Despite this price pullback, short-term BTC holders continue to hold onto their assets instead of selling at a loss. CryptoQuant contributor Onchained analyzed the Short-Term Holder Net Realized PNL to Exchanges, highlighting a shift in selling behavior. According to the analyst, BTC holders who have owned their coins for one to three months have been the most active sellers in recent days, even at the cost of realizing losses. This is unusual, as short-term investors holding BTC for less than a week are typically the most reactive sellers. However, recent data shows a significant decline in selling pressure to cryptocurrency exchanges. This suggests that BTC holders who purchased their coins in the last six months are opting to hold onto their assets rather than panic sell. This shift in selling behavior among short-term holders could have multiple implications. A decline in selling pressure may indicate a change in investor sentiment, with holders willing to endure short-term losses in anticipation of long-term gains. While the analyst cautioned that this data does not predict future price movements, it does provide valuable insights into market psychology. The analysis states: Are short-term holders finally holding the line? If so, this could reduce downside volatility and set the stage for stabilization, or even a reversal. Onchained concluded that short-term holders currently control 28% of BTC’s circulating supply. If a significant portion of these holdings transitions to long-term holders, it could pave the way for Bitcoin’s price to surge beyond $150,000. Is BTC About To Stage A Comeback? Alongside the decline in short-term BTC selling pressure, several other exchange-related metrics suggest the possibility of an upcoming price surge for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Daily RSI Downtrend, But Analyst Warns Of Strong Resistance Ahead Recently, crypto entrepreneur and market commentator Arthur Hayes claimed that BTC “probably” hit this market cycle’s bottom during its plunge to $77,000 on March 10. However, Hayes noted that the stock market could still experience further pullbacks. While Bitcoin has been in a downtrend for the past few months, gold has surged to multiple new all-time highs (ATHs) due to ongoing global macroeconomic uncertainty. BTC’s poor performance against the precious metal is likely to continue as the US trade tariff threat looms. At press time, BTC trades at $83,953, up 2.2% in the past 24 hours.

Gala Price Prediction and Algorand Rank Among Top Cryptos for Massive Growth,https://thecoinrise.com/qubetics-tics-to-hit-10-gala-price-prediction-and-algorand-rank-among-top-cryptos-for-massive-growth/,"Is crypto still the wild west of finance, or has it evolved into the future of investment? While traditional markets continue to move at a snail’s pace, the crypto world is buzzing with action, shaking up the financial industry with alternative investment opportunities. In this chaotic yet lucrative landscape, three names are turning heads— Qubetics ($TICS), Gala ($GALA), and Algorand ($ALGO). These cryptos have not only captured the attention of serious market players but have also solidified themselves as powerful instruments for wealth generation. Amid the crypto storm, Qubetics is carving its path as the next big thing, with mind-blowing adoption, a red-hot presale, and a utility-focused ecosystem that could redefine cross-border transactions. As Gala strengthens its dominance in blockchain gaming and Algorand continues its mission of high-performance finance, each of these cryptos presents a unique opportunity for top cryptos for massive growth. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics isn’t just a typical digital asset; it’s redefining cross-border transactions with seamless global payments. Imagine sending money to a friend overseas without outrageous fees, slow processing times, or annoying red tape. That’s the power Qubetics ($TICS) brings to the table. At its core, Qubetics is engineered to bridge the gap in international finance, eliminating inefficiencies that have plagued traditional banking systems for decades. Whether it’s businesses paying suppliers across borders, remote freelancers receiving their salaries, or families supporting loved ones in another country, Qubetics is revolutionizing cross-border transactions, making them faster, cheaper, and more accessible. Currently, Qubetics is in its 28th crypto presale stage, having already sold over 504 million $TICS tokens to more than 23,900 holders, raking in a jaw-dropping $15.5 million. Right now, the price of $TICS stands at $0.1430, but analysts are extremely bullish, projecting it to hit $1 (599% ROI), $5 (3,396% ROI), and even $10 (6,892% ROI). Some ultra-bullish estimates even push the price up to $15 post-mainnet launch, delivering an eye-watering 10,388% ROI. Taking it up a notch, a $2,500 investment could yield $17,482 at $1, $87,412 at $5, $174,825 at $10, and a life-changing $262,237 if $TICS reaches $15. These scenarios show why many are calling $TICS one of the most exciting crypto opportunities on the market today. With real-world usability, growing demand, and aggressive expansion, Qubetics positioning itself as the top cryptos for massive growth. Gala ($GALA): Leading the Blockchain Gaming Revolution Gala Games has been the undisputed champion in the blockchain gaming world, delivering a decentralized ecosystem where players own their in-game assets and shape the future of gaming. Unlike traditional gaming platforms where developers hold all the power, Gala flips the script—giving gamers the ability to earn, trade, and fully control their digital items. Since its inception, Gala ($GALA) has amassed a die-hard community and partnerships with major gaming studios, reinforcing its status as the go-to platform for Web3 gaming. Analysts remain bullish on Gala price prediction, expecting significant growth as blockchain gaming adoption accelerates in 2025. While $GALA saw explosive growth during the last bull run, it has proven its resilience, bouncing back stronger with new developments, partnerships, and an ever-expanding metaverse vision. Analysts predict that as more traditional gamers enter the blockchain space, demand for $GALA will surge, making it one of the top cryptos for massive growth in 2025 and beyond. Algorand ($ALGO): The Green Blockchain Powering High-Performance Finance When it comes to scalability, security, and sustainability, few blockchains hold a candle to Algorand ($ALGO). Designed by MIT professor Silvio Micali, Algorand is one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains in existence, making it a prime candidate for global finance applications. What sets Algorand apart is its Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, which eliminates the energy-intensive mining process found in traditional Proof-of-Work blockchains. This makes $ALGO one of the most eco-friendly cryptos, a huge selling point for institutions and businesses looking to adopt blockchain technology without the environmental backlash. With rising adoption, strategic partnerships, and institutional interest, Algorand remains one of the top cryptos for massive growth, ready to explode as global markets shift towards blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Conclusion: Which Crypto Holds the Key to the Future? Qubetics, Gala, and Algorand have all carved out unique niches in the crypto world, offering immense potential for those looking for the top cryptos for massive growth . Whether it’s Qubetics’ mission to revolutionize cross-border transactions, Gala’s dominance in blockchain gaming, or Algorand’s role in high-performance finance, these cryptos are reshaping digital investments. If you’re looking to get in early on a project with sky-high potential, Qubetics stands out as the ultimate frontrunner. With its presale numbers already turning heads and price predictions pointing to a jaw-dropping ROI, now is the time to make a move before $TICS becomes the next big name in crypto.

Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal posted to X on April 1, calling for Congress “to end this litigation-driven, state-by-state approach with a federal market structure law.” Source: Paul Grewal Financial regulators from 10 states launched similar suits against Coinbase in June 2023, on the same day the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the exchange — a lawsuit the SEC dropped last month. Seven suits against Coinbase still active Alabama, California, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington and Wisconsin are the seven states that are still continuing with their lawsuits, which all allege Coinbase breached securities laws with its staking rewards program. Vermont was the first state to end its suit against Coinbase, with its Department of Financial Regulation filing an order to rescind the action on March 13, noting the SEC’s Feb. 27 decision to drop its action against the exchange and the likelihood of changes in the federal regulator’s guidance. The South Carolina Attorney General’s securities division followed Vermont days later, dismissing its lawsuit in a joint stipulation with Coinbase on March 27. Related: South Carolina dismisses its staking lawsuit against Coinbase, joining Vermont Kentucky’s decision to drop its case against Coinbase follows just days after the state’s governor, Andy Beshear, signed a “Bitcoin Rights” bill into law on March 24 that establishes protections for crypto self-custody and exempts crypto mining from money transmitting and securities laws. The axed state-level lawsuits come amid a stark policy change at the SEC, which has dropped or delayed multiple lawsuits against crypto companies that it filed under the Biden administration.

Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) adviser Jamie Collier said in an April 2 report that while the US is still a key target, increased awareness and right-to-work verification challenges have forced North Korean IT workers to find roles at non-US companies. “In response to heightened awareness of the threat within the United States, they’ve established a global ecosystem of fraudulent personas to enhance operational agility,” Collier said. “Coupled with the discovery of facilitators in the UK, this suggests the rapid formation of a global infrastructure and support network that empowers their continued operations,” he added. Google's Threat Intelligence Group says North Korea's tech workers expanded their reach amid a US crackdown. Source: Google The North Korea-linked workers are infiltrating projects spanning traditional web development and advanced blockchain applications, such as projects involving Solana and Anchor smart contract development , according to Collier. Another project building a blockchain job marketplace and an artificial intelligence web application leveraging blockchain technologies was also found to have North Korean workers. “These individuals pose as legitimate remote workers to infiltrate companies and generate revenue for the regime,” Collier said. “This places organizations that hire DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] IT workers at risk of espionage, data theft, and disruption.” North Korea looking to Europe for tech jobs Along with the UK, Collier says the GTIG identified a notable focus on Europe, with one worker using at least 12 personas across Europe and others using resumes listing degrees from Belgrade University in Serbia and residences in Slovakia. Separate GTIG investigations found personas seeking employment in Germany and Portugal, login credentials for user accounts of European job websites, instructions for navigating European job sites, and a broker specializing in false passports. At the same time, since late October, the North Korean workers have increased the volume of extortion attempts and gone after larger organizations, which the GTIG speculates is the workers feeling pressure to maintain revenue streams amid a crackdown in the US. “In these incidents, recently fired IT workers threatened to release their former employers’ sensitive data or to provide it to a competitor. This data included proprietary data and source code for internal projects,” Collier said. Related: North Korean crypto attacks rising in sophistication, actors — Paradigm In January, the US Justice Department indicted two North Korean nationals for their involvement in a fraudulent IT work scheme involving at least 64 US companies from April 2018 to August 2024. The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control also sanctioned companies it accused of being fronts for North Korea that generated revenue via remote IT work schemes.

The motion , which was submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 1, requests that the court postpone all deadlines while further discussions occur. In January 2023, the SEC filed its first lawsuit against Gemini Trust and Genesis Global Capital, claiming they had unlawfully raised billions of dollars through the Gemini Earn program without registering it as a securities offering. The lawsuit was part of the SEC’s broader crackdown on crypto firms under the Biden administration’s regulatory push. Gemini had previously agreed to return $2.18 billion to affected customers as part of a separate settlement with New York regulators. The motion did not specify whether discussions could lead to a settlement, dismissal, or another resolution, but both parties argue that pausing the case serves the public interest and conserves judicial resources. The SEC and Gemini will provide a joint status update within 60 days of the request being approved.

The change in approach has been welcomed by crypto industry players who previously faced strict enforcement under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The Winklevoss twins, founders of Gemini, have also been active supporters of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. They each donated the maximum allowed $844,600 to Trump’s 2024 campaign. Genesis, which managed $900 million from 340,000 Gemini Earn customers before halting withdrawals in November 2022, settled its part of the case in February 2024 by agreeing to a $21 million fine.

According to the April 1 filing , Circle ( USDC ) intends to list its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker “CRCL.” The company’s filing indicates that some current shareholders will also sell shares, even though the quantity and price range of shares have not yet been made public. While sales from current holders will not benefit the business, Circle will profit from shares it sells directly. Major banks like JPMorgan and Citigroup will underwrite the IPO, and there will be a 30-day window for additional share purchases. Information about Circle’s performance can be found in its financial disclosures. The company’s reserve income and total revenue climbed from $1.45 billion in 2023 to $1.68 billion in 2024. Interest on reserves backing USDC accounted for a sizable amount of its profits.

Additionally, the business reported $54.4 million in other income and $4.3 million in losses on digital assets. The money raised from the IPO will go toward possible acquisitions , operational growth, and product development. A three-tiered share structure will be introduced by Circle’s IPO. Each Class A share, which will be offered for sale, has one vote. Co-founders Jeremy Allaire and Patrick Sean Neville own Class B shares, which are limited to 30% of the total voting power but have five votes each. Class C shares are convertible under specific circumstances, but they do not have voting rights. Following the cancellation of a $9 billion SPAC merger in 2021, this IPO marks Circle’s first attempt at a traditional public listing. Circle’s public debut signals its plan to further integrate into the financial sector as stablecoin adoption continues to grow.

The firm has submitted its prospectus to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aiming to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” This move comes at a time when the U.S. government appears to be becoming more favorable toward cryptocurrency and blockchain-based technologies. USDC Issuer Circle Files for IPO Circle’s decision to go public follows years of anticipation. The company first attempted to enter the public markets via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2021. However, this effort was halted due to regulatory concerns and timing issues with the SEC. Since then, Circle has worked to position itself as a more integral player in global finance, including relocating its headquarters from Boston to New York’s One World Trade Center. In 2024, Circle submitted a draft registration statement for its IPO with the SEC, move that has been made in light of the growing influence of stablecoins in the crypto-market. In the case of IPO, it will give Circle access to public funds, and investors a chance to invest in a company that has been active in cryptocurrency for several years now. Financial Performance and IPO Valuation Circle reported a significant increase in its revenue for 2024, with its total revenue reaching $1.68 billion, up from $1.45 billion in 2023. A large portion of this income came from reserve income related to its stablecoin operations. The company’s net income for the year stood at approximately $156 million, though this was a decrease from $268 million in 2023. The IPO is expected to value Circle at between $4 billion and $5 billion, with JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup acting as the lead underwriters. The company’s created stablecoin USDC is now among the biggest and most popular stablecoins available in the cryptocurrency market having a market capitalization of around $60 billion. Regulatory Climate and Crypto-Friendly Shift Circle’s decision to go for the IPO can also be seen as a signal of a change in the regulatory outlook of cryptocurrencies in the US. The current government under the presidency of Donald Trump is more receptive and inclined towards formulating favorable crypto laws. This is a change that has given more assurance to firms in the crypto space such as Circle, which now has a chance to conduct its operations under a friendly regulatory environment. Analysts have noted that the US authorities may introduce legislation regulating stablecoins this year, which will allow Circle to strengthen its position in the market. Such moves also show the increasing role of stablecoins in the context of the company’s cooperation with exchanges like Coinbase that have committed to sharing revenues generated by USDC. But, Circle is not alone in the crypto-related firm trying to list it on the stock exchange. Another big player in the sphere of blockchain, Ripple, is also believed to be considering going public . Although facing continued regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, Ripple has obtained a strong standing in the cryptocurrency market, especially in cross-border payments, which puts the company in the position to possibly mimic Circle.

However, due to market uncertainty, the asset is facing difficulties and struggling to gain momentum. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.67 and has experienced a modest price surge of over 0.50%, which was previously 4.5%. However, due to uncertainty, the token lost its gains. Meanwhile, during the same period, the asset’s trading volume dropped by 20%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Price Prediction According to expert technical analysis, ADA recently visited a key support level of $0.63, which has a history of strong price reversals or rebounds. ADA has always seen strong buying pressure at this level, leading to an upside rally. This time, the asset has formed a Doji candle at the support level on the daily timeframe, hinting at potential upside momentum. Based on recent price action, if ADA remains above the $0.63 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 25% to reach $0.85. However, since the current market isn’t bullish, it would be difficult to see such an upward move. Instead, we may see price consolidation between the $0.63 and $0.70 levels over the next few days. Source: Trading View In addition to this, ADA’s 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is above its current price, indicating that the asset is in a bearish trend and has weak price action. Key Liquidation Levels This bearish trend explains why traders are strongly betting on short positions, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass Data revealed that $0.662 and $0.70 are the levels where intraday traders are highly over-leveraged, having built $5.50 million and $13.60 million worth of long and short positions, respectively, in the past 24 hours.

ETH is now consolidating and facing key hurdles near the $1,920 level. Ethereum started a recovery wave above $1,820 and $1,850 levels. The price is trading above $1,860 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $1,860 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $1,900 and $1,920 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Starts Recovery Ethereum price managed to stay above the $1,750 support zone and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH was able to climb above the $1,820 and $1,850 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $1,880 resistance zone. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,032 swing high to the $1,767 low. However, the bears are active near the $1,920 zone. Ethereum price is now trading above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $1,860 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

The next key resistance is near the $1,920 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,032 swing high to the $1,767 low. The first major resistance is near the $1,970 level. A clear move above the $1,970 resistance might send the price toward the $2,020 resistance. An upside break above the $2,020 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,050 resistance zone or even $2,120 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,920 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,860 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $1,845 zone. A clear move below the $1,845 support might push the price toward the $1,800 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,765 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,710.

Here’s What Experts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-the-xrp-bottom-finally-in/,"The XRP price fell as low as $2.0238 on Monday, potentially forming a local bottom. Since then, the XRP price is up almost 6%, however, the possibility of a deeper retracement remains. Two prominent chartists—CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) and Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy)—have shared their perspectives on whether the token has found its local bottom or if further downside might still be on the table. Is The XRP Price Bottom In? According to CasiTrades’ newly published chart, XRP appears to have tested the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement at $2.05 and is now showing bullish divergences across multiple timeframes—from the 15-minute all the way to the 4-hour chart. CasiTrades notes that these signals are a positive indicator both for short-term bounces and a potential macro recovery. “Was that the bottom for XRP? After reaching the .786 retrace at $2.05, #XRP is printing bullish divergences from the 15min all the way up to the 4hr chart. That’s the kind of signal we want to see for both short-term bottom and macro! The bounce is holding so far! CasiTrades notes. Related Reading: XRP Bull Cycle Could End If This Happens: Analyst The analyst also points to key resistance at $2.25, suggesting that a convincing break above this level with strong momentum would likely negate the need for another retest of support. “If we break above $2.25 with strong momentum, that would invalidate the need for another support retest—a very bullish sign, CasiTrades writes, adding “$2.00–2.01 remains a support if the $2.05 doesn’t hold.” Moreover, she highlights a Fib Time Zone 3 that could span the entire month of April, forecasting a “bullish window” for XRP. According to the chart, once price meets its target, a larger impulse to the upside may follow, with potential resistance lining up at $2.70 and $3.80+. Related Reading: XRP MVRV Ratio Dips Below The 200-Day MA – Trend Shift Underway? Meanwhile, Charting Guy addressed that market chatter has surfaced about a possible head and shoulders pattern on the XRP chart, with a projected breakdown target near $1.15. While acknowledging this bearish formation as a possibility, Charting Guy believes it is unlikely to play out, describing the pattern as “irregular and ugly.” He maintains that XRP’s overall trend is still biased to the upside, characterized by higher highs and higher lows.“ A lot of people are posting this possible head and shoulders that targets $1.15. I personally don’t think it plays out, but it’s a possibility. If it does happen, it’s just a golden pocket backtest and the chart remains bullish overall,” he says. Charting Guy draws attention to the $1.70–$1.90 zone that has repeatedly caught wicks in previous pullbacks, with daily closes managing to reclaim $2 or above. He believes that a final corrective dip to fill the March 11 wick lows—potentially down to around $1.90—could mark the end of the current retracement. Additional support levels are located at the weekly Ichimoku base line at $1.94, the Weekly Supertrend at $1.73 and at the Weekly EMA Ribbon between $1.46 – $1.93. At press time, XRP traded at $2.14.

In a March 31 letter , the coalition of six UK digital economy trade bodies urged Starmer’s special adviser on business and investment, Varun Chandra, for a “greater strategic focus and alignment to deliver investment, growth and jobs” for the crypto industry. The group, which consisted of the UK Cryptoasset Business Council, Global Digital Finance, The Payments Association, Digital Currencies Governance Group, the Crypto Council for Innovation and techUK, noted the US policy shift on crypto under President Donald Trump and his appointment of a crypto czar . Britain’s commitment to an economic trade deal focused on technological cooperation with the US “presents a significant opportunity to mirror the United States’ ambition in fostering leadership in blockchain, digital assets, and other emerging financial technologies,” the letter stated. The group recommended that the UK appoint a blockchain special envoy, similar to the US, to coordinate policy, foster innovation, and position the country competitively in global markets. The trade bodies also called for the development of a dedicated government action plan for crypto and blockchain technology, including a concierge service to attract high-potential firms. They added that the government should acknowledge and leverage the commonalities between blockchain, quantum computing and artificial intelligence technologies , including potential applications for government services. Another recommendation was to create a high-level industry-government-regulator engagement forum to ensure informed decision-making and cross-sector collaboration.

Tom Griffiths, the co-founder and managing partner of crypto compliance advisory firm BitCompli, said in response to the letter on LinkedIn that the Financial Conduct Authority “has a lot of talent and a good sight of future plans, but the UK is definitely losing pace with Dubai, Singapore, and other EU jurisdictions.” “Now is the time for the FCA to act, or the UK will lose out on this huge opportunity, which is digital assets and all the benefits this sector can bring, not only now but over the next 20 years,” he added.

42784165,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=390226,1743566136,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/42784165.jpeg,zkLend Hacker Loses $5.4M to Tornado Cash Scam,https://cryptopotato.com/zklend-hacker-loses-5-4m-to-tornado-cash-scam/,"In an ironic twist of fate, the hacker behind February’s $9.57 million exploit on zkLend has allegedly fallen victim to another scam. The suspected criminal claimed in an on-chain message that they lost 2,930 ETH, worth about $5.4 million, while trying to launder the stolen funds through Tornado Cash. The zkLend Hack zkLend also confirmed the bizarre turn of events in a post on X, stating that the attacker had interacted with a known phishing website, tornadoeth[.]cash, as they attempted to cover their tracks from pursuers. The scam site is said to have been in operation for the last five years, and it immediately drained the thief’s entire balance of 2,930 ETH. In an on-chain message to zkLend, the attacker appeared crestfallen, saying: “Hello, I tried to move funds to Tornado but I used a phishing website and all the funds have been lost. I am devastated. I am terribly sorry for all the havoc and losses caused. All the 2,930 ETH have been taken by that site’s owners… Please redirect your efforts towards those site owners to see if you can recover some of the money.” The saga began in February, a couple of days before Valentine’s, when the Starknet-based lending protocol was hacked for more than $9.5 million. The exploiter, only identified by the address 0x64…9109, reportedly took advantage of a decimal precision vulnerability on zkLend to manipulate rounding errors in its lending accumulator and artificially inflate its balance. As a result, they made off with about 3,700 ETH, forcing the platform to pause withdrawals temporarily. Following the theft, zkLend attempted to negotiate with the perpetrator, offering them a white hat bounty of 10% of the stolen funds in exchange for the return of the remaining 3,300 ETH. However, the hacker stayed silent, moving the crypto assets through various channels, including 706 ETH valued at $1.8 million sent through Railgun. Legitimacy Concerns: A Staged Disappearance? Not everyone has bought the phishing story, though. Many within the crypto community have questioned the hacker’s claim, with the most prevalent theory being that they made up the tale to fake a loss and avoid further scrutiny from blockchain investigators and law enforcement. Given that zkLend has been actively tracking the stolen funds and working with on-chain security firms and the police, some have argued that this could be a ploy to make the funds disappear without a trace. Reactions on X quickly flooded in, with some people pointing out the suspicious timing of the announcement. One user, @pvt.eth, sarcastically noted , “Right about time for April Fool.” Others speculated that the phisher and the hacker could be the same person. Another theory is that the attacker might have transferred the stolen ETH to an alternate address, using the phishing story as a cover-up. @0xGekko was among those unconvinced, stating: “Meh, screams more like the hacker is trying to avoid any heat from a possible investigation.” Nonetheless, zkLend is treating the phishing loss as a legitimate event, noting that there isn’t conclusive evidence yet that the phishing website and the exploiter are connected.

Within just two days of its third keynote going live, the project brought in another $5 million, pushing its presale total beyond $210 million. This sudden rise wasn’t fueled by noise but by solid results that speak for themselves. With its Beta Testnet already running, over 1.2 million transactions completed, and more than 100 active community nodes worldwide, BlockDAG is already delivering value before its mainnet even launches. Now in Batch 27, BDAG coins are available at $0.0248, with over 19 billion already sold. This has created a rush from both large-scale and everyday buyers, as chances to enter at such prices may soon disappear once exchange listings go live. Keynote 3 Rolled Out Real Progress, Not Just Talks Rather than being a marketing push, the third keynote laid out strong technical milestones and strategic moves. It included several vital updates that show why BlockDAG is gaining traction among top Layer 1 projects: Beta Testnet officially launched and is actively handling millions of actions. Tools like a user-friendly block explorer, a Token/NFT creation wizard, and early access dApps are now functional. Full DeFi functionality confirmed—staking, swaps, lending, and bridges—all part of the release plan. Vision to onboard 1,000+ dApps by 2026. Exchange listings set for over 10 major platforms once the mainnet is live. The presentation’s clarity and confidence stood out. As CEO Antony Turner stated, “We’re not cutting corners. Our goal is to raise the bar for blockchain technology.” That message hit home across crypto circles—and the fast influx of capital shows many agree. Partnerships Add Strength to BlockDAG’s Ecosystem Alongside its tech advances, BlockDAG is making waves through meaningful global collaborations. With high-visibility partnerships such as Inter Milan and UFC, BDAG is gaining exposure to millions of people in sports and entertainment. Instead of relying on short-term influencers, the project is becoming part of key cultural spaces, building trust with a visible presence. Tools like the X1 Miner App , now with over 800,000 downloads, and the TG Tap Miner game, with more than 400,000 users, are drawing in new users before the mainnet is even live. BlockDAG is already being used and experienced, something rare at this stage. BDAG’s Route to $1 Is Backed by Real Data What sets BlockDAG’s current growth apart is how it steadily builds a case for BDAG reaching $1. With the current presale rate at $0.0248, there’s a potential 40x return if it hits the $1 mark after listing. And that possibility isn’t built on hope. BlockDAG now features: A working, active testnet Confirmed DeFi features Major exchange listings locked in Global hardware miner rollout 16,600+ ASIC miners sold A growing base of 170,000+ holders These indicators point to a network built with readiness from the start, not one trying to figure things out later. As Turner wrapped up the keynote confidently: “This is about more than our progress—it’s about where we’re going next.” Its massive crypto presale performance supports that vision. After pulling in $5 million in just two days, BlockDAG is rapidly moving toward its $600 million goal—a figure that looks achievable, not imaginary. BlockDAG isn’t another tech idea waiting to be noticed. It’s a complete working system gaining traction—backed by people, tools, and funding. For those delaying, the message is clear: later batches will arrive, but likely at a much higher price.

BlockDAG’s Potential Growth Sets the Stage for a Huge 2030 Target,https://thecoinrise.com/from-just-0-001-to-30-blockdags-potential-growth-sets-the-stage-for-a-huge-2030-target/,"BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining traction like few other cryptos in recent years. Since launching its presale under a year ago, it has already delivered a stunning 2,380% return for its earliest backers. Starting at just $0.001 in Batch 1, BDAG now trades at $0.0248 in Batch 27, and interest continues to snowball. Analysts are buzzing with projections: $1 by 2025, $20 in 2027, and a jaw-dropping $30 by the end of 2030. With 10 exchange listings lined up, a mainnet ready to go live, and an expanding use case network, BDAG is creating serious momentum. So far, BlockDAG has attracted over $210 million in presale investments and pulled in a crowd of more than 170,000 individual buyers. Its mix of rising adoption, strong liquidity, and growing whale attention is positioning it as one of the most talked-about altcoins of the year—and possibly the top-performing crypto for long-term gains. How BlockDAG Pulled in $210M and Handed Out 2,380% Returns It started small—just $0.001 in Batch 1. Now at $0.0248 in Batch 27, BlockDAG has moved fast, and the gains are hard to ignore. Early participants have already seen their investments multiply by over 23 times, and it’s not slowing down. So far, BlockDAG has sold over 19 billion BDAG coins and raised $210 million. That kind of number gets attention, and with more price jumps on the way, buyers aren’t hesitating to lock in before the next batch goes live. The current holder base has already passed 170,000, showing not only excitement but growing long-term support. That kind of user growth helps build staying power—and keeps the conversation going. There’s also been major whale activity. A recent $3.6 million buy-in suggests large players are eyeing the next breakout. Combined with strong community demand, this mix of small and big buyers is fueling speculation that BDAG could become one of the most profitable altcoins by 2030. BlockDAG Price Outlook: $30 Target by 2030? It’s not just hype—BlockDAG’s growth is supported by several clear factors. Analysts expect BDAG to hit $1 next year, fueled by three major drivers. First, the 10 centralized exchanges preparing to list the coin will introduce massive liquidity. Second, the launch of the mainnet will expand access and real usage. And third, ongoing adoption from both users and developers keeps adding fuel to the fire. By 2027, the platform is projected to be more mature, with deeper liquidity and a solid base of users. That’s why the $20 price forecast is gaining support. As more tools and partnerships come online, BDAG could become one of the most widely used altcoins. Looking ahead to 2030, many see $30 as more than just possible—it’s within reach. As real-world adoption of blockchain tech grows, BlockDAG could ride that wave across industries, helping its coin value rise in step. With continued updates and use cases, BDAG has the tools to hit its long-term price targets. Missed Early Entry? There’s Still Time to Get In Before the Next Jump Yes, the earliest buyers are already sitting on 2,380% returns. But even now, BDAG offers plenty of room for upside. At just $0.0248, it’s still early compared to where analysts expect it to head next. Each new batch brings a higher price, so the window to enter before bigger jumps is closing fast. Between the upcoming exchange launches, the mainnet release, and a wave of features being added, BlockDAG has the roadmap in place to push forward. If the coin hits $1 by 2025, anyone getting in now could be looking at a 40x return. And if it does reach the long-term goal of $30, the gains would be massive. That’s why more people are rushing in now—because the next price move could come sooner than expected. Final Word: Why BlockDAG Is the Top Crypto to Watch Right Now BlockDAG’s numbers speak for themselves—$210 million raised, 19 billion coins sold, and more than 170,000 holders already in. With a 2,380% gain already delivered and a path laid out to reach $30 by 2030, it’s no surprise this project is getting so much attention. The mix of strong growth, real milestones, and wide interest from both new buyers and seasoned whales is driving momentum at every step. For those still on the sidelines, the current price could be the lowest they’ll ever see again. Whether for short-term returns or long-haul potential, BlockDAG is now being viewed by many as the top crypto to buy right now —and the clock is ticking on how long that window will stay open.

The price is now consolidating and might face hurdles near the $2.120 level. XRP price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $2.20 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.120 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might extend losses if it fails to clear the $2.20 resistance zone. XRP Price Faces Rejection XRP price failed to continue higher above the $2.20 resistance zone and reacted to the downside, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below the $2.150 and $2.120 levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $2.023 swing low to the $2.199 high. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.120 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. However, the bulls are now active near the $2.10 support level. They are protecting the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $2.023 swing low to the $2.199 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.120 level and the trend line zone. The first major resistance is near the $2.150 level. The next resistance is $2.20. A clear move above the $2.20 resistance might send the price toward the $2.240 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.2650 resistance or even $2.2880 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.320. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.150 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.10 level. The next major support is near the $2.0650 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.0650 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.020 support. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone.

According to an Apr. 1 report from DL News, the global investment giant managing around $12 trillion in assets will now be able offer its new European Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded product in the UK. With this approval, BlackRock joins companies like Coinbase, PayPal, and Revolut as the 51st company to be registered with the FCA. Only 14% of applications have been approved by the FCA, demonstrating its selectiveness. According to the agency, a large number of applications were turned down because of missing or poor-quality information. The iShares Bitcoin ETP, marketed under the ticker IB1T, started trading last week on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam. It launched with a temporary fee waiver, lowering its expense ratio to 0.15% until the end of 2024. After that, the fee will rise to 0.25%, aligning with CoinShares ’ $1.3 billion physical Bitcoin ETP, the largest in Europe. You might also like: BlackRock expands money market fund BUIDL to Solana With each share backed by real Bitcoin that Coinbase holds in custody, the product gives investors direct exposure to Bitcoin. BlackRock’s action follows the success of its iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, which is listed in the United States. IBIT has amassed more than $48 billion in assets since its inception, as per data from VettaFi. IB1T uses a similar structure to give European investors a regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually holding the currency. The ETP is issued through a Swiss-based special-purpose vehicle to ensure compliance with European financial regulations. The entry of BlackRock into Europe indicates that demand for Bitcoin investment products is rising outside of North America. CEO Larry Fink recently warned that rising U.S. debt could weaken the dollar’s dominance and possibly strengthen Bitcoin’s case as a store of value. As reported by Crypto.news on Mar 31, Fink pointed out in his annual letter that investors may turn to Bitcoin as a safer option as a result of excessive government expenditure.

33767162,[object Object],1743570032,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin 4-Hour Heikin Ashi Chart Shows Oversold Levels, A Bounce On The Horizon",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-in-oversold-levels/,"Dogecoin is showing early signs of life after a weeklong downtrend, as new technical signals on the 4-hour Heikin Ashi chart suggest the meme coin may be pivoting toward recovery. The Dogecoin 4-hour candlestick Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is flashing oversold conditions and a falling wedge pattern forming at support, creating what might be a setup for a rebound upward. Price Decline Triggers RSI Drop To Oversold As Red Candles Pile Up Dogecoin’s price chart has been a sea of red over the last seven days on the 4-hour candlestick timeframe. Since March 27, the popular meme coin has consistently printed red Heikin Ashi candles, with a notable stretch producing as many as seventeen consecutive red closes. This trend came on the heels of a failed attempt by bulls to reclaim the $0.20 level, where Dogecoin briefly spiked before being overwhelmed by sell pressure. The price eventually descended toward the $0.1615 mark at the time crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade shared the analysis. As this happened, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart swiftly shifted from an overbought zone to deeply oversold, showing the magnitude of the downturn and the extent of bearish dominance during this period. Beyond the RSI’s dip into oversold conditions, the 4-hour Heikin Ashi chart has also revealed a falling wedge pattern developing right at a support zone . Falling wedges are seen as bullish reversal formations, especially when accompanied by oversold momentum indicators like the RSI. The confluence of these two signals suggests that there might be a bounce on the horizon for Dogecoin. Breakout From Falling Wedge As Green Candles Confirm Momentum Shift In a follow-up shared by the original analyst, Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin has begun to flash early signs of a breakout from its falling wedge structure. This shift in momentum is marked by the appearance of three successive green 4-hour Heikin Ashi candles, representing the clearest bullish pattern in this timeframe since the decline began. These developments indicate a possible uptrend continuation, with a short-term rebound now appearing more likely in April. The bounce signals couldn’t come at a more crucial time for Dogecoin, which just ended the most bearish first quarter it has seen in seven years. Notably, Dogecoin posted a steep 46% loss from January through March, which was its worst Q1 performance since 2018, when it plunged by an even deeper 68.8%. This historical context places added weight on the current price action, as it provides some sort of outlook as to how Dogecoin might trade for the rest of the week. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.17, up by 4.5% in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Falling Wedge Pattern|Heikin Ashi|relative strength index|RSI|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-02 05:00:32

Bitcoin Flows Reveal Key Market Shifts,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-binance-losing-its-grip-bitcoin-flows-reveal-key-market-shifts/,"After experiencing a bearish trend earlier in the week, Bitcoin (BTC) seems to have regained upward momentum. The asset started the day with a 2.1% rise. It is currently trading above the $84,000 mark, signaling a potential return to its previous price levels. Despite this positive movement, Bitcoin remains subject to fluctuating market conditions, influenced by external factors and internal metrics impacting its performance across different exchanges. Related Reading: Arthur Hayes Predicts $250,000 Bitcoin As Fed Caves To QE Pressure Shifting Trends in Bitcoin’s Exchange Flows As BTC continues to make strides above $84,000, an interesting trend has emerged in exchange flows signaling investor behavior. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant’s Joao Wedson provides a fascinating perspective on the current state of the Bitcoin market. According to Wedson, Bitcoin’s price action has been significantly impacted by lower selling pressure on certain exchanges, particularly Binance. In his report titled “Lower Selling Pressure: Binance and the BTC Flow Across Different Exchanges”, Wedson highlights that Short-Term Holders (STHs) are sending significantly fewer Bitcoin to Binance compared to other exchanges. The current amount of BTC being sent to Binance stands at 6,300 BTC, much lower than the average of 24,700 BTC transferred to other platforms. This suggests that many traders on Binance may be adopting a more neutral stance, potentially waiting for clearer signals before making further moves. On the other hand, Bitcoin inflows to other exchanges are increasing, indicating that investor behavior may vary based on the platform they use. Binance, despite having the highest trading volume, seems to be seeing less activity from short-term holders, whereas other exchanges are experiencing higher inflows. This shift could suggest that while Binance remains a trusted exchange, other platforms are beginning to see more action from BTC traders. Binance Dominates Spot Trading Volume In another analysis by CryptoQuant’s Maartunn, the focus shifted to spot trading volumes across various exchanges, with Binance taking the lead. In the year-to-date data for 2025, Binance has been the dominant player in spot trading volume, handling a cumulative total of $1.9 trillion. This is more than three times the volume of its closest competitor, Crypto.com, which stands at 12.12%. The dominance of Binance is significant, as higher trading volumes typically result in greater liquidity and tighter spreads, benefiting traders with better pricing and smoother entry and exit opportunities.

As a result, the trading volume for BNB Coin has shot up by 42% to more than $2.12 billion, as analysts are now closely watching for a BNB price rally to all-time highs. In BNB Price Ready for A Mega Rally? BNB Coin has performed relatively well over the past month compared to Bitcoin and other altcoins. While BTC and top altcoins like ETH, SOL, XRP saw double-digit losses in March, BNB Coin is down just 1% on the monthly chart. After a strong consolidation of around $610 levels, the BNB price could be eyeing a strong breakout to new all-time highs. BNB Burn and Pascal Hardfork Offer Support BNB Coin features a real-time burn mechanism that permanently removes a portion of gas fees from circulation. Over the past seven days, 951.85 BNB worth $571,747.74 was burned, contributing to a total burn value of nearly $160 million, as per data from BNBBurn . BNB’s price recently gained momentum following the implementation of the Pascal hard fork, which enhanced its compatibility with Ethereum. The network is preparing for additional hard forks this month and in June, aimed at further improving transaction speeds. Additionally, BNB Chain is gaining a lot of popularity among meme coins, adding support for Mubarak meme coin , CZ’s Dog BROCOLLI meme coin, and others. Looking at the technical setup, the BNB price chart shows that the altcoin is forming a cup-and-handle pattern, along with an ascending channel pattern formation, as shown in the image below. Source: TradingView On the other hand, BNB price is trading above the 50-day moving average, which is a positive indicator. But for the altcoin to kickstart a rally to its all-time high of $790, it must first complete the handle formation at $662, and give a breakout above that level. As of press time, BNB Coin is trading at $603 levels with its daily trading volume up by 42%, surging past $2.12 billion. Furthermore, the Coinglass data shows that the BNB options trading volume is also up by 46%. VanEck Files for Spot BNB ETF $115 billion asset manager VanEck filed for the spot BNB ETF in Delaware on Tuesday, April 1, which could serve as a major catalyst for the BNB Coin rally ahead. The proposed BNB ETF would follow the price of BNB, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Apart from BNB, VanEck has already submitted crypto ETF applications for Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and Avalanche.

Last week, the SEC officially dropped its appeal, and Ripple has agreed to pay a $50 million fine while also dropping its own cross-appeal. On top of that, the court’s injunction against Ripple has been lifted, which should’ve been great news. But here’s the twist—despite this huge win, XRP’s price didn’t skyrocket like many expected. In fact, it barely budged. That’s got XRP holders talking, and not in a good way. They’re heading to social media, demanding one thing: an official statement from the SEC confirming the case is really, truly over. “We want an announcement from the SEC just like they’ve done with other cases! ” has become the rallying cry of frustrated XRP fans. The SEC hasn’t said a word publicly since dropping the case, and that silence is driving people crazy. Some even wonder if the SEC is waiting for Paul Atkins to be confirmed as the new SEC Chair before making anything official. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse tried to calm things down during the Digital Assets Summit on March 19, 2025, saying the case’s dismissal is valid without an official SEC statement. But let’s be honest—when it comes to crypto, people love clear, official news. And right now, that’s missing. After the news broke, XRP’s price briefly jumped to $2.60, but it quickly settled back down. It’s like the market’s waiting for the SEC to give the green light before making any big moves. Until then, XRP holders will keep asking: “ Where’s the official statement?”",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 05:02:07

The price is now correcting gains and might struggle to stay above the $600 support. BNB price is attempting to recover above the $600 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $610 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $610 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $600 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Faces Resistance After forming a base above the $588 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $600 and $610 resistance levels. It even recovered above the $615 level before the bears appeared, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . A high was formed at $618 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $615 level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $587 swing low to the $618 high. There is also a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $610 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $610 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $610 level. The next resistance sits near the $612 level. A clear move above the $612 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $618. A close above the $620 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $626 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $635 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $610 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $600 level. The next major support is near the $598 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $587 swing low to the $618 high. The main support sits at $594. If there is a downside break below the $594 support, the price could drop toward the $585 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $565 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone.

Republican Jimmy Patronis won the vacant seat in Florida’s 1st Congressional District to replace Matt Gaetz, taking 57% of the vote to defeat Democrat Gay Valimont, according to AP News data. Randy Fine also took Florida’s 6th Congressional District with 56.7% of the vote to beat his Democratic rival, public school teacher Josh Weil, and fill a seat left vacant by Mike Waltz, who took a job as White House national security adviser. Florida’s 1st and 6th Congressional Districts — located in Florida’s western panhandle and along the state’s northeast coast — have been controlled by Republicans for roughly 30 years, but their lead has narrowed in recent years. Fairshake, a PAC backed by crypto industry giants including Coinbase, Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz, gave Fine around $1.16 million in advertising spending and funneled $347,000 to Patronis to support his campaign. Both Republicans have expressed support for the crypto industry, with Fine stating in a Jan. 14 X post that “Floridians want crypto innovation!” Source: Randy Fine Fairshake and its affiliates poured around $170 million into the 2024 US presidential and congressional elections to back candidates who committed to supporting the crypto industry. The wins by Patronis and Fine increased Republican representation in the House to 220 seats, with the Democrats holding 213 seats. There are two vacant seats to be filled after Texas and Arizona Democrats Sylvester Turner and Raúl Grijalva died on March 5 and March 13, respectively. Florida can expect to see a crypto-friendly regulatory environment The victories for Patronis and Fine likely mean that crypto legislation will continue to see support in the US capital. The Republican Party would have maintained its House majority even if it lost both seats in Florida, but it would have made it more difficult for some of the recently introduced Republican-backed crypto bills to pass through the House and Senate.

It appears set to resume positive action as the bulls show signs of interest. Last week saw BNB through another downturn after rejecting the $640 level during March’s recovery. This caused a small panic as it shed loss, and the price slipped to a low of $587 yesterday. Reacting well to the drops, the price was sharply rejected as a result of bullish interception, and the price increased above the key $600 level. Currently, the price is slightly up as it shows signs of strength while taking a breath. A push back above the mentioned key level could trigger a new leg up to $700 and even above. Although, the buying volume is not enough at the time of writing. Looking at the daily chart, BNB is still trading far well above the $500 level that stood as support during last month’s crash. If, by any chance, the bears resume pressure, we can expect more bleeding in the next few days. Right now, trading looks calm with a lot of conflicting signals. Should the buying volume increase, we can anticipate another major buy until the price recovers fully to the top. But for now, BNB’s demand is low as it trades flat on the daily chart. BNB Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The $587.3 level is currently providing support. If it fails to hold, the next support to consider for drops would be $566 and the $544 level. For bullish, BNB must reclaim the recently marked $640 resistance. A push above $648.5 should facilitate more recovery to $686, $700 and $732 in the next few weeks.

A breakdown from this support could fuel a major price crash. Following past months of reductions, XRP recorded substantial losses but has managed to stay well above $2 – a holding crucial support level. After bouncing off the support level last month, XRP recovered but later failed to push above the $2.6 level due to a rejection. This led to a drop and the price rolled back to the mentioned crucial support yesterday. Looking at the setup, the bears are technically back in action. Though it is uncertain if they will overcome the support level this time as several attempts to scale through it have proven abortive over the past months. However, if they successfully scale through the support, we can expect a major crash to a new multi-month low. Such a crash will validate the new bearish pattern forming on the daily chart. Failure to overcome this crucial support might result in another bounce, which could bring small gains before resuming bearish at full speed. But if XRP sustains such a bounce, it must reclaim $3.4 before considering a trend shift. XRP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Crossing down $2, the potential support levels for drops would be $1.77 and $1.53. Apart from $1.28, the $1 level is considered the next key support to watch for a dip. If the price bounces back above the immediate support level, it must retake the recently rejected $2.64 resistance level before we can consider a bullish move to the $2.99 and $3.4 resistance levels in the future.

Speaking in an interview with the Wolf of All Streets channel on YouTube, he stated that 99% of memecoins cannot be sustainable for the long term and are created solely for a select group to make money from. He clarified that memecoins experience phenomenal growth and then experience a decline in demand if not supported by a solid ecosystem. If change is not made, the user moves on, and value is known to vanish. “It’s why 99% of memecoins will fail,” he said. “They have to build community and real engagement. Otherwise, people move on.” Hoskinson also lambasted the token distribution of memecoins, asserting that self-serving insiders inflate the value of tokens, promoting the project only to sell them at a hefty profit later. This insider-focused model does not provide much incentive to build and sustain the project after its implementation. Capital drain poses risk to broader crypto adoption Hoskinson stated that memecoins have a negative impact on the rest of the cryptocurrency market since they consume liquidity without adding value through actual application use cases. He compared it to “moving water from one side of the bathtub to the other,” stating that much of the capital goes directly into the pockets of the founders and does not aid in expanding networks. “There’s a drain at the bottom of the tub. You’re not adding liquidity—you’re losing it over time,” he said, calling the phenomenon a net negative for the space. While he did not write off memecoins, he noted that sustainable value creation would come from Bitcoin DeFi, real-world asset digitalization, and algorithmic stablecoins, not just from viral tokens without a clear roadmap. Cathie Wood adds institutional perspective to memecoin risks Cathie Wood, the head of ARK Invest, also recently stated similar things in an interview with Bloomberg , stating most memecoins will be “worthless.” She attributed the phenomenon of meme-based cryptocurrencies to blockchain integration with AI, which makes it possible for almost everyone to launch thousands of tokens without any actual value. “Our funds are staying out of memecoins,” Wood confirmed, adding millions of these assets appear with no sight of utility. She urged investors to be careful, especially given global regulators’ refusal to categorize memecoins as securities. “If I have one message for those buying memecoins: buyer beware,” she said. Source: Dune Analytics According to Dune Analytics, memecoin use rose to a daily average of over 71,000 on January 23 and fluctuated before declining to reach roughly 9,000 as of April 1. Solana’s top memecoins’ market capitalization has declined to more than 85% from its yearly high of more than $81.83 billion. Tokens such as Official Trump (TRUMP), Bonk (BONK), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Pengu (PENGU) have been dropped significantly due to low investor confidence.

In an April 1 letter to New York federal court judge Edgardo Ramos, lawyers representing the SEC and Genesis requested a 60-day hold on the case and that all deadlines be pulled “to allow the parties to explore a potential resolution.” “In this case, the parties submit that it is in each of their interests to stay this matter while they consider a potential resolution and agree that no party or non-party would be prejudiced by a stay,” the letter states. The lawyers added that a stay was in the court’s interest as “a resolution would conserve judicial resources” and proposed that a joint status report be submitted within 60 days after the entry of the stay. The SEC sued Gemini and crypto lending firm Genesis Global Capital in January 2023, alleging they offered unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program. In March 2024, Genesis agreed to pay $21 million to settle charges related to the lending program, but the enforcement case against Gemini remains outstanding.

In February, Gemini said the SEC closed a separate investigation into the firm as the regulator winds back its crypto enforcement under President Donald Trump. “The SEC cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal bills alone and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation. Of course, Gemini is not alone,” Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss said at the time.

Circle, the issuer of stablecoin USDC, filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, while American Bitcoin Corp.—a mining venture backed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump—is exploring an IPO following a strategic merger with Hut 8. Circle Files for NYSE Public Listing Amid Rising Revenues, Shrinking Profits Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of the world’s second-largest stablecoin USDC, has officially filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company disclosed its intentions in a Form S-1 registration statement submitted on April 1, confirming that it plans to list its Class A common stock under the ticker symbol ”CRCL.” While Circle has not yet disclosed the number of shares it plans to offer or its initial IPO target price, the filing marks a significant milestone in the company's long-standing ambition to become a publicly traded entity. This move comes after two previously abandoned attempts — a failed Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger in 2021 and a confidential filing made in January 2024. The financial details revealed in the S-1 filing present a mixed picture of Circle’s performance over the past three years. In 2024, the company reported revenue of $1.67 billion, reflecting a solid 16% year-on-year increase. However, despite this growth in top-line income, net profits declined sharply. Circle financials (Source: SEC ) Circle posted a net income of $155.6 million for 2024, representing a substantial 41.8% drop compared to the previous year. The filing highlighted that while revenues grew, higher operational costs, particularly distribution payments to key partners, heavily impacted profitability. Notably, Circle paid a staggering $908 million last year to its primary distribution partner, Coinbase, for the circulation of USDC on its platform — a cost that has surpassed Circle’s own earnings from its stablecoin business. The financial disclosure also sheds light on Circle's operational strategy, revealing that over 99% of its revenue stems from its stablecoin reserve holdings. Circle generates most of its income by investing USDC reserves in short-term, yield-bearing US Treasury bills — a common practice among stablecoin issuers to monetize deposited funds while maintaining the liquidity needed for redemptions. In addition to its reserve-based income, Circle's filing revealed the company's exposure to major cryptocurrencies. The firm holds approximately $6.2 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC), $5.6 million in Sui (SUI), and $3.3 million in Ether (ETH). It also has smaller holdings in Sei (SEI), Aptos (APT), and Optimism (OP). While these digital asset holdings represent only a fraction of Circle's total balance sheet, they suggest an effort by the company to maintain a diversified crypto portfolio alongside its core stablecoin business. If successful, Circle's public listing will mark one of the first IPOs by a stablecoin issuer on a major US stock exchange, cementing the company's role as a cornerstone of the crypto-financial ecosystem. This move follows Circle’s recent regulatory milestone in Japan. On March 25, Circle became the first stablecoin issuer to receive regulatory approval in the country, enabling it to launch USDC trading on the SBI VC Trade exchange a day later. USDC is currently the second-largest stablecoin in the market, with a market capitalization of approximately $60.1 billion, according to CoinGecko . It trails only Tether ( USDT ), which maintains a dominant $143.9 billion market cap. Industry-Wide IPO Interest Circle’s IPO filing is part of a broader wave of crypto industry players eyeing public listings. Major firms including crypto exchange Kraken and blockchain infrastructure company BitGo are reportedly exploring plans to go public either later this year or in early 2026, signaling growing institutional interest and regulatory clarity in the digital asset space. While the timeline and valuation for Circle’s IPO remain unclear, the filing will undergo rigorous review by the SEC, which could take months. Investors, analysts, and the broader crypto community will closely watch how the SEC approaches Circle’s listing, especially amid an evolving regulatory landscape for stablecoins in the US. Trump-Backed Bitcoin Mining Firm Eyes IPO After Strategic Merger with Hut 8 In related news, American Bitcoin Corp., a cryptocurrency mining firm backed by members of the Trump family, is reportedly preparing for a public debut as part of a broader strategy to raise additional capital and expand its operations. According to an April 1 report by Bloomberg, the company is actively exploring an initial public offering (IPO) following its recent strategic merger with publicly listed Bitcoin mining company Hut 8. The news follows the March 31 announcement that Hut 8 has acquired a majority stake in American Bitcoin Corp., formerly known as American Data Centers. The Trump family’s involvement in the company is notable, with its founders including Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump — signaling a rare intersection between American political dynasties and the cryptocurrency mining sector. A New Bitcoin Mining Powerhouse As part of the acquisition, Hut 8 transferred its Bitcoin mining hardware and resources into American Bitcoin, creating a powerful mining entity with ambitions to dominate the US crypto mining landscape. While American Bitcoin will remain laser-focused on Bitcoin mining activities, Hut 8 is pivoting toward developing and operating high-performance data centers for artificial intelligence (AI) and other energy-intensive computing needs. Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8, described the transaction as a strategic evolution aimed at reducing capital costs and enhancing revenue predictability. “You can see this in the long term as two sister publicly traded companies — one that is energy, infrastructure, data centers, and the other one that’s Bitcoin mining, reserves, and AISCs [All-In Sustaining Costs]. Together, they form a vertically integrated company that has some of the best economics out there,” Genoot stated. This ambitious vertical integration strategy is designed to consolidate Bitcoin mining, infrastructure services, and high-performance computing into a single, streamlined ecosystem. According to Bloomberg, American Bitcoin Corp. is now considering an IPO as part of its broader capital-raising strategy. The timing and specifics of the public offering remain undisclosed, but sources familiar with the matter suggest that the company may pursue this move later this year or in early 2026, depending on market conditions and regulatory approvals. The Trump family’s involvement, along with the recent Hut 8 acquisition, positions American Bitcoin as a politically high-profile player in an industry facing increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny in the US. The company is also reportedly collaborating with Bitmain, the Chinese manufacturer of Bitcoin mining hardware. Bitmain’s involvement could spark further attention and regulatory interest, especially following US sanctions imposed on Sopghgo, Bitmain’s artificial intelligence affiliate. The formation of American Bitcoin Corp. and its IPO ambitions come at a time when the crypto mining industry is facing significant financial headwinds. The latest Bitcoin halving event in April 2024 slashed miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block, cutting directly into miners’ revenue streams. In response, many mining companies, including Hut 8, have begun pivoting to alternative business lines, such as data center infrastructure and AI-related computing services. This trend is seen as a defensive strategy to mitigate the impact of declining Bitcoin prices and reduced block rewards. According to a March report by Coin Metrics , miners are “diversifying into AI data-center hosting as a way to expand revenue and repurpose existing infrastructure for high-performance computing.” The report notes that this pivot could offer miners more predictable revenue streams compared to the volatile crypto market. JPMorgan’s recent analysis also highlighted the mounting financial pressure on Bitcoin miners in 2025, noting that declining cryptocurrency prices have compounded the challenges triggered by the latest halving event. Bitcoin’s price versus the network’s hashrate. (Source: JPMorgan) A Political Undertone American Bitcoin’s Trump family ties add a unique political dimension to its public listing plans. The Trumps' growing involvement in the crypto industry mirrors the broader trend of political figures and celebrities entering the digital asset space, often stirring debate about the implications of such high-profile endorsements. Given the increased regulatory focus on cryptocurrency mining's energy consumption and geopolitical associations, American Bitcoin’s potential IPO is expected to draw heightened scrutiny from regulators and environmental advocates alike. If American Bitcoin successfully completes its IPO, it will further cement the Trump family’s influence in the crypto world while reshaping the competitive landscape of Bitcoin mining in North America. The merged entity’s vertical integration strategy, combined with the diversification efforts of its parent company, Hut 8, suggests a new era of mining operations — one that combines traditional crypto mining with the rapidly growing demand for AI and data center services.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-02 05:30:00

Crypto analyst Nic Puckrin says it’s a 50-50 chance for a breakout or a drop, with possible BTC targets between $88,000 and $73,000. Bitcoin is trading below its 200-day average, and low volume suggests hesitation. Experts say tariffs may hurt Bitcoin short-term by slowing growth and raising inflation fears, but long-term, BTC could bounce back as stagflation limits further rate hikes. April 2, 2025 05:49:01 UTC Trump Tarrif News : Trump Eyes 20% Tariffs on Most Imports, $6 Trillion Revenue Target Raises Recession Fears President Trump is reportedly considering 20% tariffs on most imports, potentially generating $6 trillion annually, according to The Washington Post . While the proposal is still under review, Trump is set to begin rolling out reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday. Initially expected to be country- and product-specific, the broader plan signals a more aggressive trade stance. Economists warn that rising prices, low consumer sentiment, and ongoing inflation could push the U.S. economy into recession if the policy is implemented.

While global markets saw a rebound ahead of the news, uncertainty remains high. Trump’s plan includes a 25% tariff on imported cars and targets countries like India, the EU, and Japan. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is open to negotiation but firm on “fixing past wrongs.” EU leaders warned of retaliation, while analysts remain split on whether markets will rally or retreat. April 2, 2025 05:40:25 UTC When is Trump Announcing Tariffs? The world is tense as US President Donald Trump prepares to announce reciprocal tariffs today, April 2—dubbed “Liberation Day.” The tariffs will take immediate effect once revealed. Tensions escalated after the White House criticized India for its 100% tariff on US agricultural products and pointed out similar barriers in the EU, Japan, and Canada. With India in the spotlight, anticipation is rising globally over which countries will face the brunt of Trump’s latest move in his aggressive trade agenda. April 2, 2025 05:40:25 UTC Liberation Day Announcement Time President Donald Trump will officially announce new tariffs at 4 p.m. ET on April 2 during a Rose Garden event titled “Make America Wealthy Again.” According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, the tariffs will take effect immediately, with collections starting Thursday.

He argued that other countries have been taking advantage of the U.S. and that the expected tariffs will only help the country earn back its wealth, calling it the country’s rebirth. He even tagged April 2, the announcement day for the tariffs, “liberation day.” A day before, Trump also stated that the tariffs would be imposed on “all countries,” hinting that the levies may extend to nations responsible for most of the country’s trade deficit.

A similar standard for data-backed tokens, called VRC-20, has now emerged. Vana, an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain that helps users monetize personal data by bundling it into DataDAOs for AI model training, introduced the new standard early this week to boost trust and transparency in the market for data-backed digital assets. ""For data markets to work, tokens must be reliable, secure, and useful. As a universal standard for data-backed tokens, VRC-20 delivers this by ensuring fair and transparent data token trading,"" Vana announced on X. The VRC-20 standard design includes specific criteria such as fixed supply, governance, and liquidity rules while ensuring real data access by tying tokens to actual data utility. Additionally, it promotes continuous liquidity through rewards that ensure market stability. ""This isn’t speculation. This is real financialization of data,"" Vana noted. Vana launched its mainnet in December, with VANA as its native cryptocurrency. Since then, the network has onboarded over 12 million data points through multiple DataDAOs, reflecting strong demand for user-owned data. DataDAOs or data liquidity pools are decentralized marketplaces that bring data onchain as transferable digital tokens. DLPs are where data is contributed, tokenized and made ready for use in applications such as AI model training. Monday's announcement replaced VANA emissions as DataDAO inventive with a new feature that calls for DAOs to issue VRC-20-compliant tokens to receive liquidity support. Additionally, the protocol introduced data validator staking , where VANA holders can lock their coins in data validators instead of individual DataDAOs. ""Rewards are based on network security and usage. Stakers earn proportionally to their contribution to network uptime and data availability. No more idle staking. Earnings are tied to real network utility and reliability,"" Vana said. The VANA token changed hands at $5.58 at press time, the lowest in over two weeks, extending the decline from the recent price high of $8.78 on Binance, according to data source TradingView.",Tech|Data|Blockchain|Technology,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 05:47:30

The offering was initially set to raise at least $1.3 billion, but purchasers opted for an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of notes, GameStop said in an April 1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""The company expects to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin in a manner consistent with the Company's Investment Policy,"" GameStop added. The convertible notes are debt that can later be converted into equity and are scheduled to mature on April 1, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The conversion rate for the notes will initially be 33 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, according to the filing. GameStop shares didn’t see a significant move following the close of the convertible debt offering. GME closed the April 1 trading day up 1.34% at $22.61 and only saw an extra 0.5% bump after the bell, Google Finance data shows . GameStop’s share price barely moved after sharing it closed the convertible debt offering. Source: Google Finance Positive shareholder sentiment saw the stock jump nearly 12% to $28.36 on March 26, the day after GameStop announced its Bitcoin ( BTC ) plan, but its fortunes reversed the next day, with GME shares dropping nearly 24% to $21.68. Analysts at the time suggested the chilly reception reflected shareholders' fear of GameStop's deeper problems with its business model. GameStop joins growing Bitcoin move On March 25, GameStop confirmed that it had received board approval to invest in Bitcoin and US-dollar-pegged stablecoins using the notes and its cash reserves. Those reserves stood at $4.77 billion as of Feb. 1, compared with $921.7 million a year earlier, according to its 2024 fourth-quarter financial statements. GameStop is a relative latecomer among public companies creating Bitcoin treasuries. A slew of others have already added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in a playbook popularized by Micheal Saylor’s Strategy .

It noted, “To bridge traditional finance and Web3, we’ve brought together seasoned leaders from banking, fintech, and digital assets. Their strategic guidance ensures Vaulta stays compliant, credible, and ready for mass adoption.” At the same time, it added that Vaulta will bring Web3 to portfolio investment including real estate and commodities through Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization. These developments around Vaulta are driving a massive rally for EOS price despite a broader crypto market crash . EOS Technical Analysis After Bullish Breakout The gradual uptrend recorded by EOS price in the last seven days and the uptick in buying activity have triggered a bullish breakout from a descending parallel channel. This breakout suggests that the trend has flipped from bearish to bullish. The RSI indicates that the EOS price rally is due to a surge in buying activity. This indicator stands at 77, a sign that EOS is about to be overbought, which could cause a short-term reversal before the trend continues. However, the ADX line is rising, which shows that the bullish momentum is getting strong. These bullish signals show there is room for more upside for the EOS price, which could see it reach the 227.2% Fibonacci level of $1.05. EOS/USDT: 1-day Chart Funding Rate HeatMap Shows Extreme Short Positioning The funding rate heatmap from Coinglass shows extreme short positioning on the EOS token. At press time, EOS had a funding rate of -277%, indicating that short sellers are willing to pay a higher funding fee to maintain their positions. This suggests traders do not anticipate EOS to sustain the momentum, and they expect the price to reverse as traders sell to book profits. Fundibg Rate Heatmap However, despite the increased number of short sellers, the Vaulta banking feature, bullish predictions from other analysts, and the surge in buying activity depicted on the 1-day chart suggest that it is possible for the altcoin to extend its gains, and possibly reach $1.

The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic beast, constantly shifting between different phases. Right now, the spotlight is firmly on Bitcoin, and the Altcoin Season Index is flashing a clear signal: we’re in Bitcoin Season. Let’s dive into what this means for you and your crypto portfolio. Unveiling the Altcoin Season Index: What Is It? The Altcoin Season Index, a fascinating metric from CoinMarketCap (CMC), acts as a compass for navigating the ever-changing tides of the crypto market. Think of it as a gauge that tells you whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. On April 2nd, at 00:33 UTC, this index registered a value of 14. This number, down a point from the previous day, isn’t just a random figure; it’s a crucial indicator that the market is currently experiencing a strong Bitcoin Season. How Does the Altcoin Season Index Work? To truly understand what a score of 14 signifies, let’s break down how the Altcoin Season Index actually works: Scope: The index meticulously tracks the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap. However, it intelligently excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC), focusing on genuine altcoin performance. Timeframe: It analyzes the price performance of these top 100 coins over the past 90 days, providing a medium-term perspective on market trends. The Benchmark: Bitcoin (BTC) is the benchmark. The index compares the performance of each of the top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin’s performance during this 90-day period. Defining Altcoin Season: For the market to be declared in ‘Altcoin Season’, a significant majority – at least 75% – of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. This signifies broad-based altcoin strength. Defining Bitcoin Season: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared when only 25% or fewer of these top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin. This indicates Bitcoin’s dominance and relative strength compared to altcoins. Index Score Range: The Altcoin Season Index score ranges from 1 to 100. A higher score indicates a stronger Altcoin Season, while a lower score, like the current 14, points towards a dominant Bitcoin Season. Bitcoin Season in Full Swing: What Does an Index of 14 Mean? With the Altcoin Season Index at a low of 14, the message is clear: Bitcoin dominance is currently the defining characteristic of the crypto market. This low score powerfully indicates that a vast majority of altcoins are not keeping pace with Bitcoin’s price appreciation over the last 90 days. In fact, fewer than 25% of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform the original cryptocurrency during this period. Why Does Bitcoin Dominance Matter? Understanding Bitcoin dominance and the shift between Bitcoin and Altcoin Seasons is crucial for several reasons: Portfolio Strategy: Knowing whether we are in a Bitcoin or Altcoin Season can significantly influence your investment strategy. In a Bitcoin Season, focusing on BTC or BTC-related assets might be more prudent. During an Altcoin Season, diversifying into select altcoins could potentially yield higher returns. Risk Management: Altcoins are generally considered riskier than Bitcoin. In a Bitcoin Season, altcoins might experience more significant drawdowns if Bitcoin corrects. Understanding the market phase helps in better risk management. Identifying Opportunities: Even within a Bitcoin Season, select altcoins might still perform well due to specific catalysts. However, a Bitcoin Season generally favors Bitcoin and signals caution when allocating heavily to altcoins. Conversely, an Altcoin Season can present lucrative opportunities in carefully chosen altcoins. Market Sentiment: The Altcoin Season Index reflects broader market sentiment. A strong Bitcoin Season can indicate a flight to safety or a renewed focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. An Altcoin Season often reflects a higher risk appetite and exuberance in the market. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season: Actionable Insights So, what should you do when the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season? Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio Allocation: Consider adjusting your portfolio to potentially increase your Bitcoin holdings, especially if you were heavily invested in altcoins. This doesn’t necessarily mean selling all your altcoins, but perhaps rebalancing to reflect the current market phase. Focus on Bitcoin Fundamentals: Bitcoin Season often brings renewed attention to Bitcoin’s core value propositions: store of value, decentralization, and scarcity. Research and understand these fundamentals to reinforce your investment thesis. Selective Altcoin Approach: While it’s Bitcoin Season, it doesn’t mean all altcoins are doomed. Look for altcoins with strong fundamentals, unique use cases, and active development. However, be more selective and cautious in your altcoin investments during this phase. Monitor the Index: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index. A sustained increase in the index could signal a potential shift towards Altcoin Season. Use it as one of many tools to gauge market trends. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin: Bitcoin Season can be an opportune time to DCA into Bitcoin, gradually accumulating more BTC over time, especially if you believe in its long-term potential. Are There Any Benefits to Bitcoin Season? While altcoin enthusiasts might prefer Altcoin Season, Bitcoin Season also offers certain benefits to the broader crypto ecosystem: Market Consolidation: Bitcoin Season can lead to a period of market consolidation, where speculative excesses are reduced, and focus shifts back to fundamental value. Attracting New Investors: Bitcoin’s relative stability and established brand can attract new investors to the crypto space, who might be hesitant to dive directly into the more volatile altcoin market. Strengthening Bitcoin’s Narrative: Bitcoin Season reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as the leading cryptocurrency and a store of value, which is crucial for its long-term adoption. Potential for Future Altcoin Season: Historically, Bitcoin Seasons have often been followed by Altcoin Seasons. Bitcoin’s growth can eventually pave the way for renewed interest and investment in altcoins as investors seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. Challenges of Bitcoin Season for Altcoin Holders Of course, Bitcoin Season also presents challenges, particularly for those heavily invested in altcoins: Altcoin Underperformance: The most direct challenge is the underperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin. This can lead to portfolio stagnation or even losses in USD terms if Bitcoin is rising while altcoins are not. Capital Rotation to Bitcoin: Bitcoin Season often sees capital rotating from altcoins back into Bitcoin, further altcoin prices. Sentiment Shift Away from Altcoins: Market sentiment can shift away from altcoins during Bitcoin Season, making it harder for altcoin projects to gain traction and attract new investment. Potential for Altcoin Correction: If Bitcoin experiences a correction after a period of dominance, altcoins, already weakened, could potentially face even steeper corrections. Conclusion: Riding the Bitcoin Wave The Altcoin Season Index at 14 is a clear indicator: we are currently navigating a Bitcoin Season. This doesn’t mean the end of altcoins, but it does signal a shift in market dynamics. Understanding this shift, adjusting your strategy accordingly, and staying informed are key to successfully navigating the crypto market’s ever-changing seasons. By recognizing Bitcoin’s current dominance and appreciating the cyclical nature of the crypto market, you can position yourself to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks, whether it’s Bitcoin Season or the altcoin surge that may follow.

Recent whale metrics indicated that large-scale investors bought roughly $8 million of the token, whereas a crypto exchange behemoth also listed it previously. In an upshot, traders and investors are eyeing more gains in the asset’s price due to recent advancements that underscore rising demand for the crypto. PENDLE Price Jumps 8% Amid Bullish Whale Transactions As of press time, PENDLE price witnessed an 8% uptick in value and exchanged hands at $3.05. The crypto’s 24-hour low and high were registered as $2.84 and $3.07, respectively. On a keynote, the rising price action aligns with the heightened buying pressure bought by whales in recent days. The latest data from tracker Lookonchain showed that whales bought roughly $8 million worth of coins in the past 5 days. Per the data, five newly created wallets collectively accumulated the aforementioned amount. Here Are The PENDLE Whale Addresses Captured: -0x21fBA58b20f62397c015b1f5a15f742ad430dFA -0x2EB48c60F4ea75fa0a0Ff5BB017EBD9f5981b8F5 -0x11DFEDf01B3FA824BbCB138159B2e6AFE43692a3 -0x981D8856f572Fb076626265114EAD67697dA5501 -0x6478C8681ADC3E7a0C17Aa1E1F0Ff16d1A61a8f6 Why Are Whales Accumulating? Meanwhile, the rising whale accumulations and PENDLE price upswing fall in line with another bullish development. Crypto exchange behemoth Coinbase unveiled a listing for the token at the end of March last month. As a result, large-scale investors are hoarding massive amounts of the token, aiming to capitalize on emerging market opportunities. Historically, listings on top crypto exchanges usually usher a bullish price action as they substantially increase an asset’s market exposure, thereby welcoming more funds from investors. CoinGape previously reported another similar chronicle, wherein cryptos BROCCOLI and TUT price rallied with their listings on Binance . Similarly, the Coinbase listing appears to be a vital catalyst for driving the whale frenzy and recent price upswing. Can Bullish Developments Fuel Bull Run Ahead? Usual market sentiments continue to tilt in favor of bulls, given the Coinbase listing and rising whale accumulations. Further, a renowned crypto market trader has poured additional optimism surrounding the coin’s future price action with his bullish prediction. Analyst AMCrypto recently took to X, revealing that PENDLE price is forming an “inverse head and shoulder pattern.” This pattern formation suggests that a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish is brewing amid bullish advancements. Source: AMCrypto, X In light of this dynamic, the analyst predicts that a break above $3 paves the way for a massive rally ahead. As mentioned above, the coin is currently trading above this price level. As a result, market watchers continue to weigh further bullishness on the asset’s long-term price prospects.

Here’s What You Need to Know!,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/will-solana-ever-reach-150-as-bearish-clouds-hover-over-sol-price-rally-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"The post Will Solana Ever Reach $150 as Bearish Clouds Hover Over SOL Price Rally? Here’s What You Need to Know! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The start of the second quarter is bullish for the Solana (SOL) price as the levels surpass $125 after a tight consolidation. Although SOL-based tokens are gaining momentum, the value of the native token remains unaffected. Does this suggest the market participants have shifted their focus away from the token? Will the SOL price continue to remain consolidated below $130? The SOL price is speculated to be under bearish influence, with a high risk of falling back to $100 in the coming days. The main reason behind the bearish narrative is the formation of a bearish flag in the daily chart. A breakdown from the pattern usually results in a massive pullback, but in the wider perspective, the bulls are trying hard to invalidate the pattern. The Solana price is displaying some hidden bullish divergence, which suggests a huge breakout is following after a tight consolidation for a while. As seen in the above chart, the SOL price is stuck within a bearish pennant, but the bearish activity began much before the validation of the pattern. The Ichimoku cloud has already undergone a bearish crossover before the end of Q1 that compelled the price to begin the monthly trade on a bearish note. However, the Bollinger Bands are trading parallel to each other, suggesting a drop in volatility. Meanwhile, the technicals remain indecisive as the RSI has displayed a bearish divergence while the CMF is trying to trigger a bullish divergence. This suggests the strength of the rally is weakening, but the bulls are gaining strength compared to the bears with a rise in the buying pressure. Therefore, the Solana (SOL) price is stuck within a determined range and displays a huge possibility of pullback. However, the bulls have been defending the support at $123 since March 2024, and hence, a rebound could be on the horizon. However, if the rise in the volatility negatively impacts the crypto markets due to the announcement of new tariffs by US President Trump, a breakdown may drag the SOL price to $115 or $110. Only a major sell-off or a FUD may drag the levels below $100; until then, the probability of revising a rise to $150 remains imminent.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 06:12:22

The White House confirmed that reciprocal tariffs on nations imposing duties on US goods would take effect immediately, after Trump unveils them, raising concerns over an escalating global trade war. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.27% to around 35,520, while the broader Topix Index dropped 0.9% to 2,637 on Wednesday. The Japanese yen steady at around 149.8 per dollar on Wednesday, remaining sideways for the week. Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda warned that the new US tariffs could significantly affect global trade and economic growth. Analysts suggest the economic fallout could influence the BoJ's decision on interest rates, with a hike anticipated in Q3 of 2025, likely in July. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.07% to around 3,360 on Wednesday, building on the previous session’s gains as investors awaited clarity on US President Donald Trump’s upcoming tariffs, and the offshore yuan fell to around 7.27 per dollar on Tuesday, as the looming implementation of President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs overshadowed positive manufacturing PMI data. China has launched its inaugural green sovereign bond sale, aiming to raise up to 6 billion yuan ($826 million) , while also securing a London listing. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.28% to 23,161 in early deals on Wednesday, reversing a modest gain in the previous session amid losses in most sectors. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.62% to 76,394 in Wednesday morning deals, supported by gains from realty, auto, consumer goods, and private banks. Meanwhile, final data from a private survey showed that the manufacturing sector in India grew the most in eight months during March. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.12% to close at 7,935 on Wednesday, building on the previous session’s gains. The Australian dollar strengthened to around $0.63 on Wednesday, marking its second consecutive session of gains. Elsewhere, fresh data showed that Australian industrial activity contracted further in March, weighed down by uncertainties surrounding US tariffs and domestic politics. The seasonally adjusted estimate for total dwellings approved in Australia fell by 0.3% month-on-month to 16,606 units in February 2025, less than the expected 1.4% decline. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that his country will ""stand up for national interests"" in response to President Trump's recent plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on all U.S. trade partners. He confirmed Australia will not impose retaliatory tariffs, noting the U.S. accounts for less than 5% of Australia's goods exports. He emphasized that strengthening trade ties with Asian markets will provide crucial support to Australian businesses. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended mixed as investors awaited clarity from President Trump regarding his upcoming tariff policy. Meanwhile, recent U.S. economic releases showed weak jobs data and a poor manufacturing report. Investors are now focused on Friday's nonfarm payroll report for more insights into the Fed's rate path.

The crypto market mood ring, also known as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, is showing a notable shift. We’ve seen a significant jump, suggesting that the pervasive fear gripping the market might be starting to loosen its hold. Let’s dive into what this means for you and your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index First things first, what exactly is this “Crypto Fear and Greed Index” everyone’s talking about? Think of it as a barometer for the overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. It’s calculated daily by Alternative.me, a software development platform, and it essentially tells us whether the market is leaning towards excessive fear or exuberant greed. This index is crucial because market sentiment is a powerful force that can significantly influence crypto prices. Here’s the lowdown on how it works: Scale: The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100. 0 – Extreme Fear: When the index dips towards 0, it indicates extreme fear in the market. This often happens during price crashes and periods of uncertainty. 100 – Extreme Greed: Conversely, a reading closer to 100 signals extreme greed. This typically occurs during bull runs when prices are soaring, and everyone is jumping on the bandwagon. Current Reading: As of April 2nd, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 44. Recent Change: This is a positive jump of 10 points from the previous day’s reading. Zone: Despite this improvement, the index is still in the “Fear” zone (typically ranges from 0-49). Analyzing the Improved Crypto Sentiment A 10-point increase in a single day is nothing to scoff at! This jump in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index clearly reflects an improved crypto sentiment within the market. But what does this really mean for you as an investor or someone keeping an eye on the crypto space? Here’s a breakdown of the potential implications: Reduced Panic Selling: A move away from extreme fear often suggests that panic selling might be subsiding. Investors are potentially becoming less reactive to short-term price fluctuations. Increased Buying Interest: As fear diminishes, some investors might see it as an opportunity to “buy the dip.” This increased buying pressure can contribute to price stabilization or even upward movement. Shifting Market Psychology: Overall, an improved sentiment indicates a shift in market psychology. It suggests a move away from a purely bearish outlook towards a more neutral or even cautiously optimistic perspective. Not Out of the Woods Yet: Crucially, even with this positive shift, the index remains in the “Fear” zone. This reminds us that while sentiment is improving, significant caution is still warranted. We are not in “Greed” territory yet, indicating the market is still fragile. Decoding the Market Sentiment Shift: What’s Driving the Change? So, what’s behind this shift in market sentiment ? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just pulled out of thin air. It’s calculated using a blend of six different market factors. Understanding these components can give us clues about what’s influencing the current sentiment change. Here’s a look at the factors and their weights: Factor Weight What it Measures Volatility 25% Current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 and 90 days. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Current market momentum and volume compared to the last 30 and 90-day averages. Social Media 15% Sentiment analysis from social media platforms, primarily focusing on crypto-related hashtags and engagement rates. Surveys 15% Weekly crypto surveys (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance 10% The dominance of Bitcoin compared to the total crypto market cap. A rising dominance can sometimes indicate a risk-off sentiment. Google Trends 10% Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries, reflecting general public interest in Bitcoin and potentially the broader crypto market. To understand the recent 10-point jump, we need to consider which of these factors might have contributed most significantly. For instance, has volatility decreased? Has market momentum picked up? Is social media sentiment turning more positive? Analyzing these underlying components offers a deeper understanding of the sentiment shift. The Role of Bitcoin Sentiment in the Index It’s important to note that Bitcoin sentiment plays a significant role in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Bitcoin, as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often acts as a bellwether for the entire crypto market. Its price movements and sentiment surrounding it tend to heavily influence the overall market mood. The index explicitly includes “Bitcoin Dominance” as a factor, recognizing Bitcoin’s central position. Furthermore, many of the other factors, such as volatility and Google Trends, are heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance and public perception. Therefore, shifts in Bitcoin’s price and news surrounding it are likely to be major drivers of changes in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Understanding Each Fear and Greed Index Component in Detail Let’s delve a bit deeper into each component of the Fear and Greed Index to truly grasp what they signify: Volatility (25%): High volatility is often associated with fear. When prices swing wildly, it creates uncertainty and anxiety among investors. The index measures current volatility against historical averages to gauge if volatility is unusually high, contributing to fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Strong market momentum and high trading volume usually indicate greed. When prices are rising steadily and lots of people are buying, it signals bullishness and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Conversely, weak momentum and low volume can point to fear and disinterest. Social Media (15%): Social media sentiment provides a real-time pulse on public opinion. Analyzing keywords, hashtags, and engagement related to crypto helps gauge whether the online conversation is leaning towards positive (greed) or negative (fear) sentiment. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, weekly surveys directly gauged investor sentiment. These provided a more direct measure of fear and greed by asking participants about their market outlook. (If surveys resume, they will again be a valuable component.) Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin dominance can be a complex indicator. During periods of fear, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived “safer” crypto asset, increasing its dominance. Conversely, in greedy phases, investors may be more willing to venture into altcoins, reducing Bitcoin dominance. Google Trends (10%): Google Trends data reveals the level of public interest in Bitcoin and crypto. High search volumes often correlate with greed and market tops, while low search volumes can indicate fear and potential market bottoms. Actionable Insights and Moving Forward The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, but it shouldn’t be used in isolation. Here are some actionable insights: Confirmation Tool: Use the index as a confirmation tool alongside other technical and fundamental analysis. Don’t base trading decisions solely on the index. Contrarian Indicator: Some investors use it as a contrarian indicator. Extreme fear might be seen as a buying opportunity, while extreme greed could signal an impending correction. However, this is a high-risk strategy. Monitor Trends: Pay attention to the trend of the index. Is it consistently rising, falling, or stagnating? These trends can provide more meaningful insights than a single day’s reading. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the factors that drive the index. Understanding what’s influencing volatility, momentum, and social sentiment can give you a better grasp of market dynamics. Conclusion: Cautious Optimism in the Crypto Air The recent 10-point jump in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 44 is undoubtedly a positive sign. It suggests that the grip of extreme fear on the crypto market is loosening, and a more balanced, albeit still fearful, sentiment is emerging. While this improvement offers a glimmer of hope , it’s crucial to remember that the index remains in the “Fear” zone. The crypto market is still navigating uncertain waters, and caution remains the watchword. However, this shift in sentiment is a development worth watching closely, as it could be the early signal of a more sustained recovery in market confidence.
