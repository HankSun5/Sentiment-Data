Just a year after sparking excitement and raising funds through a community-driven crowdfunding initiative, the project has announced a complete reversal, leaving many wondering what went wrong. Are you curious to know the inside scoop on why the Dogwifhat logo won’t be lighting up the Vegas skyline after all? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story. What Happened to the Dogwifhat Las Vegas Sphere Dream? The ambitious plan to project the Dogwifhat logo onto the Las Vegas Sphere was initially met with enthusiastic support from the memecoin community. Spearheaded by the pseudonymous organizer @GamesMasterFlex, the project aimed to take crypto advertising to new heights, leveraging the Sphere’s unparalleled visual impact. However, recent updates indicate a significant change of direction. According to a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), @GamesMasterFlex announced the shelving of the Sphere advertising project. This news has been confirmed by Decrypt and has sent ripples through the Dogwifhat community and the broader crypto space. But what exactly led to this sudden change of heart? Unpacking the WIF Refund and Project Shelving The announcement of the project’s cancellation was coupled with the promise of a full WIF refund to contributors. This move, while likely disappointing for those who were excited about the Sphere campaign, is being seen by many as a responsible and community-centric approach. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: Project Shelved: The Las Vegas Sphere advertising campaign for Dogwifhat is officially off the table. Full Refunds: Contributions made to the crowdfunding campaign will be returned to donors. Reason Unclear: As of now, the specific reasons behind the decision to abandon the project remain somewhat vague. The announcement from @GamesMasterFlex provided limited details beyond the project being shelved. Community Reaction: The community’s reaction is mixed, with some expressing disappointment but largely appreciating the transparency and commitment to refunding contributions. The lack of a detailed explanation for the cancellation has naturally fueled speculation within the crypto community. Was it logistical challenges, financial hurdles, or perhaps a strategic shift in marketing focus for Dogwifhat ? As we await further clarification, it’s worth considering the potential factors that might have played a role. Potential Challenges in Crypto Advertising on the Las Vegas Sphere While the idea of showcasing a memecoin like Dogwifhat on the Las Vegas Sphere is undeniably attention-grabbing, executing such a campaign comes with its own set of challenges. Let’s explore some potential hurdles that might have contributed to the project being shelved: Challenge Description Potential Impact on Dogwifhat Project Cost Advertising on the Las Vegas Sphere is known to be exceptionally expensive. Budget constraints or unexpected cost increases could have made the project financially unviable. Logistics and Regulations Coordinating advertising on a venue like the Sphere involves complex logistics and regulatory approvals. Potential bureaucratic delays or unforeseen regulatory hurdles could have stalled the project. Market Volatility The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. Fluctuations in the value of Dogwifhat or SOL could have impacted the project’s funding and feasibility over the past year. Shifting Priorities Project priorities and marketing strategies can evolve in the fast-paced crypto world. Dogwifhat team might have decided to reallocate resources to other marketing initiatives or project developments. It’s important to note that these are just potential challenges. The official reason for shelving the Las Vegas Sphere campaign and issuing the WIF refund is yet to be fully disclosed by the project organizers. Memecoin Marketing and the Power of Community The Dogwifhat Sphere campaign, even in its cancellation, highlights the unique and often unconventional marketing strategies employed in the memecoin space. These projects often thrive on community engagement and virality, and the initial enthusiasm for the Sphere idea is a testament to this. While the crypto advertising landscape is still evolving, memecoins like Dogwifhat demonstrate the power of grassroots movements and community-driven initiatives to generate buzz and attention. Here are some key takeaways about memecoin marketing: Community Focus: Memecoin marketing heavily relies on building and engaging a strong online community. Viral Potential: The goal is often to create viral moments and trends that spread rapidly across social media. Unconventional Approaches: Memecoins are known for embracing unconventional and often humorous marketing tactics. Risk and Reward: Memecoin marketing can be highly effective in gaining attention quickly but also carries inherent risks due to market volatility and project lifecycles. What’s Next for Dogwifhat and Crypto Advertising? While the Las Vegas Sphere dream might be on hold, the Dogwifhat story is far from over. The project still boasts a vibrant community and continues to be a prominent player in the memecoin arena. The decision to issue a WIF refund and shelve the Sphere campaign could even be seen as a strategic move to re-evaluate and potentially pivot towards new marketing avenues. As for crypto advertising in general, the industry is constantly experimenting with new and innovative ways to reach audiences. From social media campaigns to partnerships and sponsorships, the strategies are diverse and ever-evolving. The Dogwifhat Sphere saga serves as a reminder of both the ambitious spirit and the inherent uncertainties within the crypto space. Conclusion: Lessons from the Dogwifhat Sphere Setback The cancellation of Dogwifhat’s Las Vegas Sphere advertising campaign is undoubtedly a setback for those who were eagerly anticipating it. However, it also offers valuable lessons about the realities of ambitious projects in the fast-paced and unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. The commitment to a WIF refund demonstrates a level of responsibility and community focus that is commendable. As Dogwifhat moves forward, it will be interesting to see what new strategies and initiatives they pursue to maintain their momentum and engage their dedicated community. The world of memecoin marketing continues to be a fascinating space to watch, full of surprises and unexpected turns.

42772663,https://timestabloid.com/?p=62545,1743546536,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"ChatGPT Explains Why XRP Price Has Fallen, Despite Multiple Positive Announcements",https://timestabloid.com/chatgpt-explains-why-xrp-price-has-fallen-despite-multiple-positive-announcements/,"Software engineer and crypto enthusiast Vincent Van Code recently shared a tweet analyzing why XRP’s price declined despite multiple positive developments. His post included a conversation with ChatGPT. He asked why XRP’s price fell from $2.50 to $2 before recovering slightly to $2.16, despite major bullish announcements. The AI’s response covered several factors, with Van Code emphasizing point three, which referenced market manipulation. I asked ChatGPT why price of XRP has fallen, despite multiple positive announcements.. no 3 was the kicker, even it knows the price is manipulated, to SHAKE OUT RETAIL. Must read Prompt: There have been dozens of XRP pro announcements from FDIC. to case settlement, you name… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) March 30, 2025 The tweet suggests that XRP’s price action does not align with expectations, given the stream of favorable news, including FDIC-related announcements and the resolution of legal matters. ChatGPT outlined six primary reasons for this disconnect. Market Dynamics and Sentiment One explanation given was the common market phenomenon of “buy the rumor, sell the news.” This occurs when investors anticipate good news and price it in beforehand. Once the news becomes official, traders may take profits, leading to a selloff instead of further gains. This behavior is common in both traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets. The second factor was the broader market sentiment. Even when XRP has positive news, overall market conditions influence its ability to gain traction. Bitcoin’s price movements, macroeconomic factors like inflation concerns, and regulatory uncertainty can weigh down altcoins, including XRP. Even strong developments may not drive price increases if the general market environment is unstable. Influence of Whales and Liquidity Strategies Van Code highlighted ChatGPT’s mention of price manipulation as a significant takeaway. The AI pointed out that XRP has a history of being influenced by large holders and institutions who may intentionally push the price lower to shake out retail investors. These liquidity strategies, often employed by market makers and institutional traders, create psychological pressure on smaller investors. The suggestion that price movements may not always be driven by logical fundamentals but rather by deliberate strategies is the key focus of the tweet. Another factor mentioned was the lack of new retail money entering the market. Even with positive announcements, its price may struggle to rise if no fresh capital flows into XRP. A significant increase requires not just existing traders cycling through positions but new participants willing to buy at higher prices. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Lingering Effects of Legal Issues and Supply Considerations The AI also pointed to the residual effects of the SEC lawsuit. While the case was largely resolved in Ripple’s favor, regulatory uncertainty has left a lasting impact. Institutional investors remain cautious, while some exchanges have yet to integrate XRP trading without restrictions. These factors contribute to sentiment issues that can suppress price growth. Finally, token supply dynamics were identified as another potential reason. Ripple holds a substantial amount of XRP and distributes tokens through monthly unlocks and over-the-counter (OTC) sales. While these distributions are part of a structured plan, they can introduce selling pressure, affecting price stability. Van Code’s tweet highlights the frustration within the XRP community regarding price movements that do not seem to reflect ongoing positive developments. The response from ChatGPT outlined multiple reasons why the price may not have reacted as anticipated, with market dynamics, sentiment, liquidity strategies, and supply considerations all playing a role. The emphasis on whale manipulation as a possible factor underscores concerns that price movements in the crypto market are not always organic. Whether this is a temporary consolidation phase before a larger breakout remains uncertain. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

42772458,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145380,1743546620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Claim: Researchers Expose OpenAI’s GPT-4o Training on Paywalled Books,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-gpt4o-paywalled-books-claim/,"Is OpenAI, the giant behind ChatGPT, embroiled in another data sourcing controversy? A new report from the AI Disclosures Project is making waves with a serious accusation : OpenAI may have trained its advanced GPT-4o model using copyrighted, paywalled books from O’Reilly Media without permission. This revelation intensifies the ongoing debate about AI training data ethics and the boundaries of copyright in the age of artificial intelligence. For crypto enthusiasts and tech-savvy individuals following the AI revolution, this news raises critical questions about data transparency and the future of content creation. Unpacking the Copyright Infringement Claim Against OpenAI The core of the accusation revolves around the source of data used to train sophisticated AI models like GPT-4o. Think of AI models as incredibly complex learning machines. They digest massive amounts of information – text, images, code – to identify patterns and generate outputs based on prompts. When you ask ChatGPT to write a poem or create an image, it’s drawing upon this vast knowledge base to produce its response. It’s not creating something entirely new, but rather intelligently remixing and extrapolating from what it has learned. While many AI labs, including OpenAI, are exploring AI-generated synthetic data to augment their training datasets, relying solely on synthetic data presents challenges. Performance can degrade, and the models may lose touch with the nuances of real-world data. This is where the controversy around AI training data sourcing becomes critical. The AI Disclosures Project, spearheaded by Tim O’Reilly and Ilan Strauss, suggests that OpenAI’s latest model, GPT-4o , exhibits a strong understanding of content from paywalled O’Reilly books. This is particularly concerning because O’Reilly Media, a prominent publisher of technical and business books, does not have a licensing agreement with OpenAI. Key findings from the AI Disclosures Project paper: GPT-4o’s Superior Recognition: The research indicates that GPT-4o demonstrates a significantly higher recognition of paywalled O’Reilly book content compared to OpenAI’s earlier model, GPT-3.5 Turbo. DE-COP Method: The researchers employed a technique called DE-COP, a “membership inference attack,” to assess whether AI models have prior knowledge of specific texts from their training data. This method tests if a model can distinguish between original human-written text and AI-paraphrased versions. Extensive Testing: Over 13,000 paragraph excerpts from 34 O’Reilly books were used to probe the knowledge of GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and other OpenAI models. Paywalled Content Recognition: The results strongly suggest that GPT-4o “recognized” a far greater amount of paywalled O’Reilly book content than its predecessors. GPT-4o and the Mystery of Paywalled Books: What Does It Mean for Copyright? The paper highlights a stark contrast between GPT-4o and older models like GPT-3.5 Turbo. While GPT-3.5 Turbo showed more familiarity with publicly accessible O’Reilly book samples, GPT-4o excelled in recognizing content behind paywalls. This raises serious questions about how OpenAI sourced its AI training data for its most advanced model. According to the research, “GPT-4o [likely] recognizes, and so has prior knowledge of, many non-public O’Reilly books published prior to its training cutoff date.” However, the researchers acknowledge that this isn’t definitive proof of copyright infringement . They concede that their method isn’t foolproof and that OpenAI could have indirectly accessed the book excerpts through user interactions with ChatGPT – users might have copied and pasted snippets of paywalled content into the platform. Furthermore, the study didn’t analyze OpenAI’s newest models, leaving open the possibility that data sourcing practices may have evolved. Why Does AI Training Data Matter in the Crypto and Tech World? For those in the cryptocurrency and broader tech space, the implications of this copyright infringement claim are significant: Data Ethics and Transparency: The crypto world champions decentralization and transparency. Questions around AI data sourcing mirror these concerns. Where AI models get their data and how ethically it’s obtained are crucial for building trustworthy AI systems. Impact on Content Creators: If AI models are trained on copyrighted material without proper licensing, it undermines the rights of content creators – authors, artists, musicians, and more. This could stifle creativity and innovation in the long run. Legal Battles and Regulatory Scrutiny: OpenAI is already facing multiple lawsuits regarding its data practices. This new report will likely add fuel to the fire, potentially leading to stricter regulations around AI training data and copyright . Future of AI Development: The search for high-quality AI training data is intensifying. AI companies are exploring various avenues, including licensing deals, synthetic data generation, and even hiring domain experts to inject knowledge directly into AI systems. The resolution of the copyright infringement debate will significantly shape the future landscape of AI development. OpenAI’s Stance and the Broader Industry Trend OpenAI has publicly advocated for more flexible rules regarding the use of copyrighted data for AI training . They argue that access to a wide range of data, including copyrighted material, is essential for developing powerful and beneficial AI models. The company does have licensing agreements with some publishers and offers opt-out mechanisms for copyright holders, though these are often criticized as insufficient. The trend of AI companies seeking higher-quality AI training data is undeniable. OpenAI has even hired journalists to refine its models’ output, and the industry is seeing a rise in AI firms recruiting experts across various fields to infuse specialized knowledge into AI systems. While OpenAI does pay for some training data through licensing deals, the O’Reilly paper underscores the ongoing tension between AI development and copyright law. As OpenAI navigates multiple lawsuits and increasing scrutiny, this new report from the AI Disclosures Project adds another layer of complexity to the copyright infringement debate. OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment, leaving the allegations unanswered for now.

The case challenges our assumptions about wealth and exposes risky behavior behind online allure. It sparks debate on how financial pressures can distort personal values and family ties. Andre Rebelo, an Australian crypto investor and former partner of Instagram influencer Grace Piscopo, was sentenced to 25 years in prison on April 1 in Perth after being found guilty of murdering his mother in 2020. Andre Rebelo Sentenced for Killing Mother in High-Profile Case Rebelo was convicted of murdering his mother, Colleen, after an eight-week trial where his siblings and ex-girlfriend testified. Colleen Rebelo was found dead in the shower of her suburban home in Perth on May 25, 2020, by her son. Authorities did not determine an exact cause of death, though some reports suggested possible asphyxiation. Andre Rebelo — the ex-partner of social media influencer Grace Piscopo — must have carried out some form of violent act against his mother when he killed her but exactly what he did may never be known. https://t.co/LrhqdfCWEB — The West Australian (@westaustralian) March 31, 2025 “You killed your own mother, in a particularly egregious and shocking nature,” Justice Bruno Fiannaca said. “This is a crime that right minded people would regard with horror, murdering your mother was the ultimate betrayal of her trust and everything she gave,” he added. Debt and Financial Motives Behind Andre Rebelo’s Crime According to The Sydney Morning Herald , Colleen’s therapist, Narina Sidhu, alerted police shortly following her client’s death that Rebelo had repeatedly contacted her about signing a life insurance claim in his mother’s name. Authorities found that Rebelo had created the policies himself and forged documents to claim up to AUD $1 million (around USD $627,000). Prosecutors said Rebelo and Piscopo had accumulated nearly AUD $100,000 (about USD $62,000) in debt due to their spending habits, which may have influenced Rebelo’s actions. The investigation did not uncover clear details about Rebelo’s cryptocurrency investments , but prosecutors focused instead on his financial struggles and motive. Social Media Activity and Final Sentencing Piscopo, who shares a child with Rebelo and has since separated from him, did not attend the sentencing. Two days before the sentencing, Piscopo shared a beach photo from Bali on Instagram, captioned “paradise.” Rebelo will be eligible for parole in 2047, after serving at least 25 years.

42772743,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145381,1743547216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Landmark STABLES Act: Coinbase CEO’s Urgent Plea for Crypto Regulation Support,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stables-act-crypto-regulation-coinbase/,"Is the U.S. finally on the verge of establishing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets? Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes we might be. In a significant move, Armstrong has publicly urged bipartisan support for the STABLES Act, labeling its upcoming markup by the House Financial Services Committee as a potentially “historic moment” for the crypto industry. Let’s dive into why this act is so crucial and what it could mean for the future of crypto in the United States. Why is the STABLES Act a Landmark for Crypto Regulation? The STABLES Act , or the “Eliminating Backlogs Act of 2023”, is not new, but its renewed momentum is capturing significant attention. Brian Armstrong’s vocal support amplifies its importance, especially as the crypto industry navigates a complex and often unclear regulatory landscape. But what exactly makes this act so pivotal? Clarity for Stablecoins: The core focus of the STABLES Act is to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reserve asset like the U.S. dollar, are crucial for everyday crypto transactions and the broader DeFi ecosystem. Current regulations are fragmented, creating uncertainty for businesses operating with stablecoins. Federal Oversight: The act proposes to bring stablecoin issuers under federal oversight, potentially treating them more like traditional financial institutions. This could involve stricter requirements for reserves, audits, and consumer protection, aiming to build trust and stability in the stablecoin market. National Framework: A federal framework could preempt state-level regulations, creating a more unified and less burdensome environment for stablecoin issuers to operate across the U.S. This national approach is highly desired by industry leaders who seek consistent rules rather than a patchwork of state laws. Brian Armstrong’s Urgent Call for Support: A Pivotal Moment Brian Armstrong’s engagement is not just a casual endorsement; it’s an urgent call to action. His recent activity on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting both the STABLES Act and the Senate’s progress on the GENIUS Act, underscores the industry’s push for comprehensive crypto regulation . Why is his voice so important right now? Industry Leadership: As the CEO of Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., Armstrong’s opinion carries significant weight. His advocacy can influence both lawmakers and the broader public perception of crypto regulation. Timing is Critical: With the House Financial Services Committee markup approaching, Armstrong’s public appeal is strategically timed to maximize pressure on lawmakers to consider and support the STABLES Act. This is a crucial window of opportunity to shape the future of digital assets regulation. Bipartisan Push: Armstrong specifically called for bipartisan support, recognizing that for any legislation to pass and be effective, it needs to transcend partisan divides. Crypto regulation is not a Republican or Democrat issue; it’s an issue of innovation and economic competitiveness for the U.S. Beyond STABLES: The GENIUS Act and a Broader Vision for Digital Assets Armstrong also mentioned the Senate’s progress on the GENIUS Act. While the STABLES Act focuses on stablecoins, the GENIUS Act represents a broader effort to establish a comprehensive digital asset framework . How do these pieces fit together? Act Focus Significance STABLES Act Stablecoin regulation, federal oversight of issuers. Provides immediate clarity and stability to a critical segment of the crypto market. GENIUS Act Broader digital asset regulatory framework, potentially covering various types of cryptocurrencies and crypto activities. Aims to create a more comprehensive and future-proof regulatory environment for the entire digital asset ecosystem in the U.S. Both acts are vital components of building a robust and innovation-friendly regulatory landscape for crypto in the U.S. Armstrong’s mention of both signals a holistic approach, advocating for both immediate needs (stablecoin clarity) and long-term vision (comprehensive framework). What are the Potential Benefits of Clear Crypto Regulation? Why is this regulatory push so important for the future? Clear crypto regulation offers numerous benefits, not just for crypto companies but for the entire U.S. economy: Increased Investment and Innovation: Regulatory clarity reduces uncertainty, making it more attractive for institutional investors and traditional businesses to enter the crypto space. This influx of capital and talent can fuel innovation and growth. Consumer Protection: Robust regulations can protect consumers from fraud and scams, fostering greater trust in digital assets and encouraging wider adoption. Economic Competitiveness: A clear and sensible regulatory framework can position the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset space, attracting businesses and talent while preventing innovation from moving overseas. Mainstream Adoption: As regulations become clearer and more established, cryptocurrencies and digital assets can move closer to mainstream adoption, integrating further into the traditional financial system. Armstrong in D.C.: Actionable Insights and What’s Next Brian Armstrong’s presence in Washington, D.C., this week is not merely symbolic. It represents direct engagement and lobbying efforts ahead of the crucial August recess. What actionable insights can we glean from this situation? Direct Engagement Matters: Armstrong’s meetings with lawmakers demonstrate the importance of direct industry engagement in shaping policy. Crypto leaders need to be actively involved in discussions and negotiations. Education is Key: Part of Armstrong’s mission is likely to educate lawmakers about the nuances of crypto and the potential benefits of well-crafted regulation. Bridging the knowledge gap between the tech industry and policymakers is crucial. Momentum Building: The simultaneous progress on the STABLES Act and the GENIUS Act, coupled with industry advocacy, suggests a growing momentum towards comprehensive crypto regulation in the U.S. This is a space to watch closely. Conclusion: A Historic Opportunity for Digital Assets? The upcoming House Financial Services Committee markup of the STABLES Act, combined with the ongoing Senate discussions on the GENIUS Act, truly represents a historic opportunity for the United States to define its stance on digital assets . Brian Armstrong’s urgent appeal for bipartisan support is a powerful reminder that the time for decisive action is now. Whether this moment will indeed be “historic” depends on the choices lawmakers make in the coming weeks and months. The crypto community, and indeed anyone interested in the future of finance and technology, will be watching closely.

The establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as a “digital Fort Knox” is part of Bitcoin’s growing role as a long-term store of value in federal financial strategy. This transparency may influence global crypto adoption and market dynamics, as this marks a turning point for both regulation and institutional confidence in digital assets. Following President Donald Trump’s recent executive order, the US Department of the Treasury and federal agencies are expected to disclose their Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency holdings on April 5. The announcement is anticipated to reveal whether assets such as XRP, Solana, and Cardano, previously mentioned by Trump, are included in the government’s digital asset reserves. How Much Crypto Does the U.S. Really Own? Treasury Set to Reveal Holdings President Trump signs executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. White House crypto czar David Sacks says the reserve will start with 200K BTC already owned by the gov, with plans for budget-neutral accumulation. BTC price dips 3%… https://t.co/4e2bJH7c72 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 7, 2025 Trump’s executive order issued on March 6 mandated the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile. According to a presidential document published on March 11, all federal agencies were given 30 days to report their digital asset holdings to the Treasury Secretary. The directive also requires the establishment of two new offices to oversee these assets, with the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve specifically designated for Bitcoin acquired through civil or criminal forfeiture. Unlike other holdings, Bitcoin in this reserve will not be sold, positioning it as a long-term store of value akin to a “digital Fort Knox.” April 5th (this Saturday) the USA must complete a full audit of the nation’s bitcoin holdings. Depending on what we learn, might answer many of the open questions about the recent price action. — David Bailey $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) March 31, 2025 The forthcoming disclosure is expected to clarify the scope of the government’s crypto holdings, which could have broader implications for the market. David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc, noted that the audit results might help explain Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations. “Depending on what we learn, it might answer many of the open questions about the recent price action,” Bailey said. Bitcoin’s price has been highly volatile since the announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Concerns over trade tensions and recession risks have contributed to a 10% decline, with Bitcoin dropping from over $92,000 to around $82,000. According to data from Arkham Intelligence , the US government currently holds approximately 198,012 BTC, valued at around $16 billion. White House crypto czar David Sacks stated that the government has accumulated roughly 400,000 BTC through asset forfeitures over the past decade. However, about half of that (195,000 BTC) was sold, generating $366 million. If those holdings had been retained, their value today would exceed $17 billion. U.S. States Push Bitcoin Legislation Amid Federal Crypto Transparency Efforts As federal agencies prepare to disclose their crypto holdings, U.S. states are making aggressive moves to integrate Bitcoin into their financial systems. While this federal transparency initiative unfolds, individual states aren’t waiting to forge their own paths forward. According to Bitcoin Laws, at least 23 states have introduced Bitcoin reserve bills, with 35 proposals still under consideration. Kentucky recently took a big step, with Governor Andy Beshear signing the “Bitcoin Rights” bill (HB 701) into law . This legislation grants residents the right to self-custody Bitcoin and supports crypto mining, reinforcing Kentucky’s position as a major mining hub. Kentucky is currently responsible for 11% of the U.S. Bitcoin hash rate. NEW: North Carolina Bitcoin Investment Bill House Bill 506 would create a new independent NC Investment Authority headed by the Treasurer. The NCIA would have authority to invest 5% of various state funds in digital assets. pic.twitter.com/YuYmI8YyY2 — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) March 25, 2025 Other states are following suit. Oklahoma’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB 1203) cleared the House with a 77-15 vote and is now awaiting Senate approval. If passed, it would allow state funds to be allocated to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Meanwhile, Arizona lawmakers advanced two key bills, SB 1373 and SB 1025, permitting the state treasurer to invest up to 10% of reserve and pension funds into Bitcoin. North Carolina is also exploring crypto investments, with multiple bills proposing to allocate up to 10% of state funds to digital assets. If enacted, these measures could provide long-term financial protection against inflation while reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in public finance. According to Bitcoin Laws, if these state initiatives proceed, they could result in up to $23 billion in Bitcoin purchases, potentially adding 247,000 BTC to government reserves. The upcoming federal crypto disclosure represents an interesting moment in US financial policy. As federal agencies prepare to reveal their holdings while states increasingly incorporate Bitcoin into their financial frameworks, the nation appears to be at a crossroads. The transparency initiative could legitimize cryptocurrencies as a mainstream asset class and potentially influence global adoption patterns. Regardless of whether this signals the beginning of a new era where digital assets become integral to national financial strategy, the April 5 disclosure will undoubtedly provide crucial insights into the government’s long-term vision for cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How could the U.S. Treasury’s crypto holdings transform global perceptions of Bitcoin? The U.S. could legitimize Bitcoin as a strategic asset by publicly holding it, potentially influencing other nations to adopt similar reserves and accelerating Bitcoin’s mainstream acceptance. What does this disclosure mean for state-level Bitcoin reserve initiatives? Federal transparency might encourage states to expand their Bitcoin legislation, which could directly create a unified national approach to integrating digital assets into public finance. How might this influence institutional investment in cryptocurrencies? A federal endorsement of crypto holdings could ignite institutional confidence, drive inflows into digital assets, and foster broader market participation. Of course, this all depends on broader macroeconomic forces and other factors.

The first quarter of this year has witnessed an unprecedented surge in crypto-related mergers and acquisitions (M&A), signaling a major evolution within the digital asset space. Buckle up as we delve into the details of this explosive growth and explore what it means for investors, businesses, and the future of cryptocurrency. Crypto M&A Transactions Reach Unprecedented Heights The numbers are in, and they’re staggering. According to a recent report from M&A consulting firm Architect Partners, as highlighted by Blockworks, the world of Crypto M&A has just experienced its most active quarter ever. We’re talking about a whopping 62 deals finalized in just the first three months of the year! To put this into perspective, this figure nearly doubles the 33 transactions recorded in Q3 of last year. This dramatic increase underscores a significant acceleration in consolidation and strategic partnerships within the crypto industry. What’s Fueling this Cryptocurrency Acquisitions Frenzy? So, what’s behind this dramatic uptick in Cryptocurrency Acquisitions ? Several factors are likely contributing to this surge: Market Maturation: The crypto market is maturing. Early-stage projects are evolving, and established companies are looking to expand their reach and capabilities. M&A provides a faster route to growth than organic expansion. Strategic Consolidation: In a competitive market, companies are merging to gain a competitive edge, consolidate market share, and eliminate redundancies. This is a natural progression as the industry matures. Access to Talent and Technology: Acquiring companies can provide access to valuable talent, cutting-edge technology, and intellectual property that would be costly and time-consuming to develop in-house. Bull Market Confidence: Optimism surrounding the future of crypto, fueled by recent market uptrends and institutional adoption, is likely encouraging companies to make strategic moves and invest in growth through acquisitions. Preparation for the Next Bull Run: Companies are positioning themselves for the anticipated next bull run. Expanding through Crypto Mergers and acquisitions now allows them to capitalize on future market growth. The Prediction: An M&A Boom Alongside Crypto IPOs Adding further credence to this trend, Dan Tapiero, founder of cryptocurrency investment firm 10T Holdings, anticipated this very scenario. Speaking at Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit last month, Tapiero predicted an imminent M&A Boom Crypto wave, coinciding with the activation of crypto-related initial public offerings (IPOs). This prediction appears to be materializing even sooner than some might have expected, given the Q1 figures. Tapiero’s insight highlights a crucial point: the crypto industry is moving towards greater institutionalization and integration with traditional financial markets. M&A activity is a key indicator of this evolution, paving the way for a more structured and mature crypto ecosystem. Benefits of Crypto Mergers and Acquisitions: Why It Matters The surge in Crypto Investment Boom through M&A isn’t just about numbers; it has tangible benefits for the entire crypto ecosystem: Benefit Description Increased Innovation Mergers can combine complementary technologies and talent, fostering innovation and accelerating the development of new crypto products and services. Enhanced Market Stability Consolidation can lead to stronger, more resilient companies, reducing market fragmentation and potentially contributing to greater market stability in the long run. Wider User Adoption Larger, more established entities resulting from mergers can have greater resources for marketing and user acquisition, potentially driving wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. Improved Regulatory Compliance Larger companies often have more resources to navigate the complex regulatory landscape, leading to better compliance and increased investor confidence. Investor Confidence Boost Increased M&A activity signals a maturing market, attracting more institutional and traditional investors who see crypto as a viable and evolving asset class. Navigating the Challenges of Crypto Acquisitions While the outlook for crypto M&A is bright, it’s important to acknowledge the potential challenges: Valuation Complexity: Valuing crypto companies can be complex due to the nascent nature of the industry, fluctuating token prices, and varying business models. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape in different jurisdictions adds complexity to cross-border M&A deals. Integration Hurdles: Integrating different company cultures, technologies, and teams can present significant challenges post-acquisition. Talent Retention: Retaining key talent from acquired companies is crucial for successful integration and value realization. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market can impact deal valuations and post-acquisition performance. Examples of Crypto M&A in Action While specific details of the 62 Q1 deals are still emerging, we can look at past examples to understand the types of Cryptocurrency Acquisitions happening in the space. These include: Exchanges Acquiring Infrastructure Providers: Major exchanges might acquire custody solutions or blockchain analytics firms to enhance their service offerings and security. NFT Marketplaces Merging: Consolidation in the NFT space could see larger marketplaces acquiring smaller, niche platforms to expand their reach and NFT categories. DeFi Protocols Combining Forces: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols might merge to create more comprehensive and robust financial ecosystems. Traditional Finance Entering Crypto: We could see traditional financial institutions acquiring crypto firms to gain a foothold in the digital asset market and offer crypto-related services to their clients. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors So, what does this Record Crypto M&A activity mean for you? Keep an Eye on M&A News: Stay informed about merger and acquisition announcements in the crypto space. These deals can signal shifts in market dynamics and identify emerging leaders. Research Acquired Companies: Pay attention to companies being acquired. Their technologies and teams might become integral to larger crypto ecosystems. Consider Investing in Consolidating Sectors: Sectors experiencing consolidation through M&A could present investment opportunities as stronger, more competitive entities emerge. Understand the Long-Term Implications: M&A activity points towards the long-term maturation and institutionalization of the crypto market. This trend could lead to greater stability and broader adoption. Conclusion: A New Era of Crypto Evolution The explosive growth in crypto M&A during Q1 is not just a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful indicator of the crypto industry’s evolution. As the market matures, strategic consolidation and acquisitions will likely become even more prevalent. This wave of mergers and acquisitions promises to reshape the crypto landscape, fostering innovation, enhancing market stability, and paving the way for wider adoption. The future of crypto is being built through strategic alliances and powerful combinations, and the Q1 M&A figures are just the beginning of this exciting new chapter.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-projects-xrp-price-to-702-heres-the-timeline/,"Crypto analyst and social media figure CryptoSensei posted a tweet that presented a speculative future price trajectory for XRP. The tweet included a video in which an individual used a pen to tap on various projected price levels, outlining what appeared to be a trading strategy from the present time into 2026. WATCH THE PEN MOVE! $2.13 $3.40 → $7.60 $29.50 → $702.50 $XRP #XRP #Ripple pic.twitter.com/nAJwkzWe7x — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) March 30, 2025 Breakdown of CryptoSensei’s Price Projection The video began by showing XRP’s current price at €2.40 before moving to three days later, where the asset was depicted at €2.13 with a signal to buy. One week later, XRP was projected at €7.60 with an indication to sell. Two weeks into the future, the price was marked at €3.40, with another buy signal. The next target was set at €29.50 in seven months, again with a recommendation to buy. The final projection is extended to 2026, displaying a price of €705.50 with the word “Rich” written alongside it. The numbers in the caption, although in a different currency, reflected the price points highlighted in the video, reinforcing the suggested pattern of accumulation and selling. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reaction The post attracted responses from XRP holders and cryptocurrency traders. Some showed enthusiasm, and others expressed skepticism. One response from a user named The Real Sazkuach stated: “So if I draw some lines and tap my pen real hard, then this lends credence to my guess of future value? Fucking ridiculous.” This comment conveyed criticism of the methodology presented in the video, questioning the legitimacy of the predictions based on visual cues rather than technical analysis or fundamental factors. Broader Context XRP has been a focal point in the cryptocurrency space due to its association with cross-border payments and ongoing regulatory discussions. Price predictions for the asset have varied widely, with some analysts forecasting significant long-term appreciation and others remaining cautious. CryptoSensei’s projection aligns with a more optimistic outlook, but its validity remains uncertain. Market participants have historically been drawn to speculative forecasts, particularly in the volatile cryptocurrency sector. While some traders may interpret such projections as potential scenarios, others emphasize the importance of research, historical trends, and external market influences when considering future price movements.

The buzz is building as Hut 8 Mining, a prominent name in the Bitcoin mining arena, has teamed up with an investment group boasting ties to the Trump family. Together, they’re charting a course to launch American Bitcoin Corp. onto the public market through an Initial Public Offering (IPO). This bold move is not just about raising capital; it’s a strategic play to redefine the future of Bitcoin mining and energy infrastructure. Are you prepared to witness the dawn of a new era in crypto? What’s the Buzz Around this Bitcoin IPO? The news, initially reported by Bloomberg, details the ambitious plan for American Bitcoin Corp. to go public. This isn’t just another company entering the market; it’s a venture born from the collaboration of Hut 8 Mining and a significant investment group linked to Donald Trump’s sons. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot has articulated a vision of synergy, aiming to forge two distinct yet interconnected public entities. One will concentrate on the bedrock of energy and infrastructure, while the other will laser-focus on Bitcoin mining operations and reserve management. The ultimate goal? A vertically integrated powerhouse poised to dominate the Bitcoin space. Let’s break down what makes this Bitcoin IPO so noteworthy: Strategic Separation: Hut 8 is aiming to split its operations into two publicly traded companies. This allows for focused management and potentially unlocks greater value in each sector. Vertical Integration: By controlling both energy/infrastructure and Bitcoin mining, American Bitcoin Corp. aims for greater efficiency, cost savings, and resilience. Trump-Linked Investment: The involvement of a group connected to the Trump family adds a layer of political and potentially influential backing to the venture. Capital Raise: The IPO is designed to inject significant private capital into American Bitcoin Corp., fueling its growth and expansion plans. Hut 8 Mining: A Strategic Power Play? For Hut 8 Mining, this move appears to be a calculated step towards optimizing its business structure and capitalizing on the burgeoning Bitcoin mining industry. Splitting into two specialized companies could offer several advantages: Aspect Energy & Infrastructure Company Bitcoin Mining & Reserves Company Focus Developing and managing energy resources and infrastructure crucial for Bitcoin mining. Operating Bitcoin mining facilities and managing Bitcoin reserves. Potential Benefits Attract investors interested in energy and infrastructure assets; potentially more stable revenue streams. Attract investors focused on Bitcoin and crypto assets; direct exposure to Bitcoin price movements. Synergy Provides stable, cost-effective energy for the mining company. Guaranteed demand for energy and infrastructure services. This strategic separation allows each entity to pursue its specific goals more effectively and attract different types of investors. The energy and infrastructure arm can focus on innovation in sustainable energy solutions for mining, while the Bitcoin mining company can concentrate on maximizing hash rate and Bitcoin accumulation. Why is Trump Crypto Group’s Involvement Significant? The involvement of an investment group with ties to the Trump family injects a unique dimension into this Cryptocurrency IPO. While the specifics of the group and their exact roles are still unfolding, the Trump name carries significant weight, particularly within certain political and economic circles. Here’s why their participation is generating considerable interest: Brand Recognition: The Trump name is globally recognized and can attract media attention and investor interest. Political Influence: Depending on the level of involvement and future political endeavors, this could signal a growing acceptance or even advocacy for Bitcoin within certain political spheres. Investor Network: The Trump network could bring in a new wave of investors who might not have previously considered Bitcoin ventures. Potential for Controversy: The Trump association could also attract controversy and scrutiny, both positive and negative, impacting public perception and market sentiment. It remains to be seen how deeply the Trump-linked group will be involved and what long-term implications their participation will have on American Bitcoin Corp. and the broader crypto industry. However, it undeniably adds a layer of intrigue and complexity to this IPO. Benefits of Investing in a Bitcoin Venture IPO Considering an investment in a Bitcoin Venture IPO like American Bitcoin Corp. presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. Let’s explore some potential benefits: Early Access: IPOs offer the chance to invest in a company at its initial public offering price, potentially before broader market awareness drives up valuation. Growth Potential: Bitcoin mining and related infrastructure are growth sectors, and a vertically integrated company like American Bitcoin Corp. could be well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. Diversification: Investing in a Bitcoin-focused company can provide portfolio diversification, especially for those seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency market without directly holding Bitcoin. Transparency of Public Markets: Publicly traded companies are subject to regulatory scrutiny and reporting requirements, potentially offering greater transparency compared to private crypto ventures. However, it’s crucial to remember that IPOs and crypto investments are inherently risky. Thorough due diligence and understanding your risk tolerance are paramount before making any investment decisions. Challenges and Considerations for American Bitcoin Corp. While the Bitcoin IPO of American Bitcoin Corp. is generating excitement, it’s essential to acknowledge the potential challenges and considerations: Bitcoin Price Volatility: The profitability of Bitcoin mining is heavily dependent on Bitcoin’s price, which is known for its volatility. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving and can pose risks to mining operations. Competition: The Bitcoin mining industry is competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Energy Costs: Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive, and fluctuating energy prices can impact profitability. Execution Risk: Successfully splitting into two companies and achieving vertical integration is a complex undertaking with execution risks. Investors should carefully assess these challenges and conduct thorough research into American Bitcoin Corp.’s business plan, management team, and financial projections before considering an investment. Actionable Insights: Is this Bitcoin IPO for You? The American Bitcoin Corp. IPO represents a fascinating development in the crypto space, merging established Bitcoin mining expertise with potentially influential backing. For investors considering this opportunity, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research: Thoroughly investigate Hut 8 Mining, the Trump-linked investment group, and the details of American Bitcoin Corp.’s business plan and IPO prospectus. Assess Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Understand your own risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Consider Long-Term Potential: Evaluate the long-term prospects of Bitcoin mining and the potential for vertical integration to create a sustainable competitive advantage. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Stay informed about evolving cryptocurrency regulations, which could impact the industry and American Bitcoin Corp.’s operations. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a financial advisor to determine if this IPO aligns with your investment goals and risk profile. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin Ventures? The planned IPO of American Bitcoin Corp. by Hut 8 Mining and a Trump-linked group marks a potentially groundbreaking moment for the Bitcoin industry. This venture embodies a strategic vision of vertical integration and specialized focus, aiming to create a robust and resilient Bitcoin mining operation. The involvement of the Trump network adds an intriguing layer of political and economic dynamics. While challenges and risks remain inherent in the crypto space, this IPO signals a maturing market and the increasing sophistication of Bitcoin ventures.

The significant milestone attained by Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain of Shiba Inu, could be an indication of the growing adoption of the token within the cryptocurrency space. Related Reading: Could XRP Actually Reach $10,000? Expert Weighs In Shiba Inu Milestone: 1 Billion Transactions Reports disclosed that in less than two years, Layer-2 blockchain Shibarium has already made a mark in the crypto space after the token has processed its 1 billionth transaction. Meme coin Shiba Inu only introduced Shibarium in August 2023 and four months before celebrating its second anniversary, its transaction volume has surpassed the 1 billion mark. Analysts said that Shibarium achieved the incredible feat of 1 billion transactions yesterday, March 31, noting that the Layer-2 blockchain was able to reach that level after recording four million transactions daily. As of writing, Shiba Inu’s blockchain has reached the record level with a current transaction volume of over 1.001 billion. Market observers believed that Shibarium’s achievement suggested that the blockchain can handle high transaction volumes, which they attributed to the token’s robustness and the active participation of the blockchain community. Faster Than Bitcoin Crypto analysts said that other blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have already processed more than a billion transactions. However, they noted that what makes Shibarium’s achievement stand out is the speed at which it reached that remarkable feat. Market observers compared Shibarium with other established blockchains that attained the same mark. They explained that Shibarium’s journey to attain 1 billion transactions is unique because the Layer-2 blockchain achieved it faster than the other blockchains. For example, Bitcoin needed 15 years to reach 1 billion transactions, while Shibarium did it in less than two years. Over 193 Milion Addresses Aside from the milestone in transactions, the popular L2 blockchain also has more than 193.93 million blockchain addresses that have interacted with Shibarium since it was introduced in 2023. According to Shibariumscan, Shiba Inu’s blockchain network boasted a total of 10.23 million mined blocks, with an average block time of 5.0 seconds.

42773531,https://coingape.com/?p=246937,1743548485,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Rep French Hill Rejects Proposal for Interest on Stablecoin Holdings,https://coingape.com/rep-french-hill-rejects-proposal-for-interest-on-stablecoin-holdings/,"During a briefing on April 1, Representative French Hill addressed the ongoing discussions surrounding the regulation of stablecoins. One key aspect that has garnered attention is the proposal to allow consumers to earn interest on their stablecoin holdings. However, Hill rejected this proposal, stating that there is no consensus among lawmakers to support it. The debate has become a point of focus as the U.S. Congress moves closer to passing new legislation for stablecoins. French Hill Points Lack of Consensus Among Lawmakers Rep. French Hill, who represents Arkansas, made it clear that there is currently no agreement on the proposal for consumers to earn interest on stablecoins. In his remarks, Hill acknowledged the concerns of those advocating for this change but emphasized the lack of consensus among both the House and Senate. “I hear the point of view but I don’t think that there’s consensus among the parties or the houses on having a dollar-backed payment stablecoin pay interest to the holder of that stablecoin,” Hill stated during the briefing. French Hill comments come as part of ongoing discussions on the “STABLE Act” (H.R. 2392), which seeks to regulate stablecoins in the U.S. The legislation, in addition, aims to provide clear guidelines for stablecoin issuers and establish a framework for how these digital assets can be used in financial transactions. However, the bill, as it stands, does not include provisions for stablecoin holders to earn interest. The STABLE Act and Recent Amendments The latest version of the STABLE Act, referred to as the Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute (ANS), was made available on the Financial Committee’s website on the morning of April 2, 2025. This updated version of the bill includes recent amendments and additions. The ANS will serve as the basis for the upcoming markup session set for April 3, 2025. Despite calls from industry advocates for a more modern approach that includes interest-bearing stablecoins, the STABLE Act does not appear to have embraced these proposals. Critics argue that the legislation, as it stands, limits the potential benefits of stablecoins by restricting consumer access to interest. Those pushing for change believe that this missed opportunity may hinder the growth and development of the stablecoin market. Industry Advocacy for Interest-Bearing Stablecoins Subsequently, the debate over stablecoin interest is not limited to policymakers. Industry leaders and cryptocurrency advocates have voiced their concerns over the current legislative direction. For example, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, unlike French Hill has argued that stablecoins should be allowed to pay interest to their holders, similar to how savings accounts offer returns to consumers. Armstrong highlighted the potential benefits of allowing consumers to earn onchain interest, stating that it would democratize access to higher yields and provide more financial opportunities for the general public. “Consumers deserve a bigger piece of the pie. Opening the door for onchain interest will force us all to up our game for the ultimate benefit of consumers,” Armstrong said in a recent statement. He additionally emphasized that by enabling interest-bearing stablecoins, both the U.S. economy and global consumers would benefit from increased access to financial resources.

Even though the recent price weakness is often linked to the escalating US-led global trade war, several factors had already been weighing on investor sentiment long before President Donald Trump announced the tariffs. Some market participants claimed that Strategy’s $5.25 billion worth of Bitcoin purchases since February is the primary reason BTC has held above the $80,000 support. But, regardless of who has been buying, the reality is that Bitcoin was already showing limited upside before President Trump announced the 10% Chinese import tariffs on Jan. 21. Gold/USD (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph The S&P 500 index hit an all-time high on Feb. 19, exactly 30 days after the trade war began, while Bitcoin had repeatedly failed to hold above $100,000 for the previous three months. Although the trade war certainly affected investor risk appetite, strong evidence suggests Bitcoin's price weakness started well before President Trump took office on Jan. 20. Spot Bitcoin ETFs inflows, strategic Bitcoin reserve expectations and inflationary trends Another data point that weakens the relation with tariffs is the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw $2.75 billion in net inflows during the three weeks following Jan. 21. By Feb. 18, the US had announced plans to impose tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, while the European Union and China had already retaliated. In essence, institutional demand for Bitcoin persisted even as the trade war escalated. Part of Bitcoin traders’ disappointment after Jan. 21 stems from excessive expectations surrounding President Trump’s campaign promise of a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile,” mentioned at the Bitcoin Conference in July 2024. As investors grew impatient, their frustration peaked when the actual executive order was issued on March 6. A key factor behind Bitcoin’s struggle to break above $89,000 is an inflationary trend, reflecting a relatively successful strategy by global central banks. In February, the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index rose 2.5% year-over-year, while the eurozone Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 2.2% in March. Investors turn more risk-averse following weak job market data In the second half of 2022, Bitcoin’s gains were driven by inflation soaring above 5%, suggesting that businesses and families turned to cryptocurrency as a hedge against monetary debasement. However, if inflation remains relatively under control in 2025, lower interest rates would favor real estate and stock markets more directly than Bitcoin, as reduced financing costs boost those sectors. US CPI inflation (left) vs. US 2-year Treasury yield (right). Source: TradingView Related: Coinbase sees worst quarter since FTX collapse amid industry bloodbath The weakening job market also dampens traders’ demand for risk-on assets, including Bitcoin. In February, the US Labor Department reported job openings near a four-year low. Similarly, yields on the US 2-year Treasury fell to a six-month low, with investors accepting a modest 3.88% return for the safety of government-backed instruments. This data suggests a rising choice for risk aversion, which is unfavorable for Bitcoin. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s price weakness stems from investors' unrealistic expectations of BTC acquisitions by the US Treasury, declining inflation supporting potential interest rate cuts, and a more risk-averse macroeconomic environment as investors turn to short-term government bonds. While the trade war has had negative effects, Bitcoin was already showing signs of weakness before it began.

A breakout from a falling wedge signals bullish momentum Ripple (XRP) Stabilises at $2 as US Congress Reviews Stablecoin Bill on April 2 The cryptocurrency market witnessed a significant recovery this week, with Ripple’s XRP rebounding 5% from a local bottom of $2 to a high of $2.20 on Tuesday. The sharp 5% XRP price recovery comes as investors anticipate regulatory developments that could boost Ripple’s ecosystem, particularly with the US Congress set to review a new stablecoin bill on April 2. Ripple (XRP) Price Action | XRPUSDT The bill, expected to provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins, could play a crucial role in the adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD, a stablecoin designed to enhance liquidity and efficiency in cross-border payments. In recent weeks, Ripple executives have consistently advocated for regulatory clarity in the stablecoin sector, arguing that well-defined rules will drive institutional adoption of digital assets. Industry experts suggest that the official US stablecoin regulation bill could be pivotal growth driver for XRP price action in April 2025, with RLUSD positioned as a viable option for compliant on-chain settlements. Can Regulatory Clarity Drive XRP Price Rally? If outcome of the US Congress’ Stablecoin bill favors Ripple’s approach, XRP could experience a parabolic price surge, with some analysts predicting a climb toward the $10 mark in April. US Congress’ Financial Services Committee publishes draft version of US Stablecoin bill on Feb 6, 2025 | Source: Financialservices.house.gov Validating this narrative, analysts believe that XRP’s bullish momentum could intensify if the stablecoin bill provides a favorable regulatory environment for RLUSD and other crypto assets tied to Ripple’s payment solutions. Historically, regulatory clarity has been a key driver of price surges for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum , and a similar impact could be seen for XRP. Another major catalyst for XRP price action it the recent closure of its long-standing legal battle with the SEC, which had hindered broader institutional adoption in previous year. However, a pro-crypto stance from Trump’s administration, Ripple is poised to gain further traction in the payment and remittance sectors fruther expanding utility and adoption of the XRP native coin. Meanwhile, macroeconomic factors such as increased institutional interest in digital assets and a growing demand for stablecoin-backed payments could further support XRP’s upward trajectory. As US lawmakers finalize discussions on stablecoin regulations, Ripple’s strategic positioning in the sector could prove instrumental in driving substantial price gains for XRP in April. XRP Price Forecast for April 2025 XRP’s recent price recovery to $2.20 on Tuesday reflects growing optimism surrounding the stablecoin bill review set for April 2. If US Congress establishes clear regulations that favor Ripple’s RLUSD, the resulting institutional confidence and adoption could propel XRP toward the $10 mark in the coming weeks. With regulatory clarity acting as a potential catalyst, investors will be closely monitoring the developments in Washington to gauge XRP’s next big move. Technical indicators also align with a bullish outlook, with XRP’s price recovery to $2.20 signaling renewed buying momentum as traders anticipate regulatory clarity from the upcoming U.S. stablecoin bill review. The chart below shows XRP price recently bounced off the lower Donchian Channel band near $2.02, confirming a strong buying support at that level. XRP Price Forecast The falling wedge pattern, a bullish reversal structure, formed over several days before XRP decisively broke above the upper trendline. This breakout, supported by increased trading volume, indicates a shift in momentum. XRP now targets the $2.21 resistance, with a measured move from the wedge suggesting a rally toward $2.50. The Donchian Channel’s upper boundary at $2.21 aligns with immediate resistance, while the lower boundary at $2.02 marks key support. The RSI at 46.74 shows improving bullish momentum, recovering from oversold conditions. A move above 50 would reinforce upside strength. If XRP sustains momentum above $2.14, the next major target is $2.50. However, failure to hold this level could see a retest of $2.02 support before another breakout attempt.

Rather than immediate selling pressure, these moves could indicate a strategy to consolidate holdings during volatile times. The concentration of tokens in fewer hands may alter future network governance and influence. Improved tracking and clearer communication of such movements could help restore investor trust. The Neo Foundation denied involvement in recent NEO token sales following a 35.85% drop in price between March 24 and April 1, prompting concern across the crypto community. In a statement released after the sharp downturn, the foundation clarified that neither it nor its development arm, Neo Global Development (NGD), had sold any NEO tokens. It also ruled out any transactions by founders or core team members. The group has since begun tracking the origins of large transactions that coincided with the decline. Neo Foundation Investigates Mystery Wallet After NEO Transfer to Binance Between March 24 and April 1, the price of NEO fell from roughly $8 to $5, alarming many long-time holders. In response, the Neo Foundation and NGD launched an internal investigation to uncover the source of the volatility. Their analysis revealed significant activity tied to a Neo Legacy address that had accumulated approximately 11.8 million NEO between 2017 and 2021. The address reportedly moved over 11.1 million NEO to the Neo N3 blockchain in 2021. From there, the tokens were distributed through various wallets across several years before ending up at a Binance deposit address. We’d like to address the recent $NEO price volatility and share our investigation results. Neither Neo Foundation, Neo Global Development, Neo Founders, nor any team members were involved. We deeply value the trust and support of our community, and we’re here to navigate… https://t.co/fskCRKhezK — Neo Smart Economy (@Neo_Blockchain) April 1, 2025 Starting on March 24, 2025, around 9.25 million NEO — about 13.2% of the total circulating supply — began moving through intermediary wallets to Binance. These transfers were estimated at approximately $60 million, based on an average price of $6.50 per token. Although the timing matches the price decline, the foundation stated that the connection remains speculative. “It’s important to note that the activity of this address and the price changes are merely a correlation-based speculation,” the Neo Foundation stated. It added, “While the timing of these transfers aligns with the observed price drop, we cannot confirm a direct causal relationship at this stage.” The wallet in question still holds 2 million NEO. The Neo Foundation is now working with blockchain analytics firms and exchanges to trace the tokens further. “We understand the concerns this volatility and these large-scale transfers have caused within the Neo community, and we share your desire for clarity and stability,” the foundation stated. As the Neo Foundation continues its probe, it has pledged to keep the public informed and to maintain its commitment to the long-term stability of the ecosystem. Neo Foundation Responds as Crypto Market Volatility Intensifies NEO’s decline unfolded during a wider crypto sell-off, where altcoins and memecoins were hit by sudden liquidations on April 1. Act I The AI Prophecy (ACT) dropped nearly 60%, wiping out $96 million in value. Several meme tokens, such as HIPPO, BROCCOLI, and KISHU, followed suit with double-digit losses. Binance updated leverage & margin tiers on tokens like $ACT — and a whale got liquidated for $3.79M at $0.1877. Since then, the price of $ACT has plunged more than 50%. https://t.co/MT0EgNW8ib pic.twitter.com/CRuTR9bwSh — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 1, 2025 According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, Binance’s adjustments to its leverage and margin tiers triggered a wave of liquidations that contributed to the crash. NEO, sometimes referred to as the “Ethereum of China,” recorded a 30.8% weekly loss before recovering slightly with a 6.7% bounce. Coingecko data shows its daily trading volume has fallen 28.4% to $131 million. Once a dominant player in the blockchain sector, NEO’s market capitalization now sits at $390 million — a long way from its all-time high of $198. As the Neo Foundation continues investigating large NEO transfers to Binance, market watchers are eyeing the next developments closely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could these token movements be part of routine portfolio rebalancing rather than panic selling? Whales often shift tokens as a way to secure assets during turbulence. Such reallocation can be a precaution to manage risk, not necessarily a sign of forced liquidation. What might concentrated token flows to a centralized exchange imply for the network’s governance? When a few holders amass a larger share of tokens, it can shift voting power and decision-making influence—potentially prompting future changes in how the network is managed.

With major stablecoin bills moving through Congress and a pro-crypto administration in place, Armstrong sees this as a crucial moment to shape consumer-friendly policies in the U.S. The discussion comes as World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform tied to Donald Trump’s family, prepares to launch its own stablecoin. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to X on Monday to make a case for why the U.S. should allow stablecoin holders to earn interest similar to a traditional savings account, generating widespread debate on social media. Brian Armstrong Advocates For Stablecoin Onchain Interest According to Armstrong’s March 31 X post, the crypto executive believes that onchain interest would grant stablecoins the opportunity to “function as a form of payment” while offering consumers the ability to directly garner interest themselves. https://t.co/Y7JDtkRK1R — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 31, 2025 Armstrong argues that legislation allowing stablecoin holders to earn interest on stablecoins would democratize “access to the market yield rate” and give “regular people a fair shot at growing and maintaining their wealth.” “Opening the door for onchain interest will force us all to up our game for the ultimate benefit of consumers, and will keep this innovation onshore,” Armstrong continued. “Competition breeds strength and those who innovate will win, as they should.” Critics Push Back On Coinbase CEO’s Policy Proposal Despite the digital asset entrepreneur’s enthusiasm, not everyone in the crypto community was as receptive to his policy ideas. “Why wouldn’t these be tokenized shares in money market funds subject to the securities laws ?” said one user. “Doesn’t this ultimately ask the U.S. government to pay crypto users—in dollars—for making their dollars digital?” asked another. These criticisms have emerged at a time when stablecoins are gaining political attention. World Liberty Financial Announces Stablecoin Venture While the debate over interest-bearing stablecoin continues, the broader stablecoin landscape is evolving rapidly. Armstrong’s arguments come amid news that World Liberty Financial , the crypto platform affiliated with U.S. President Donald Trump and his family, has plans to launch its own stablecoin known as USD1. The timing is noteworthy. With major stablecoin legislation currently moving through the U.S. Congress, critics of the move claim it could potentially affect political decision-making. However, Armstrong indicated that upcoming congressional discussions could serve as a key platform for advancing consumer-friendly stablecoin policy. “We have a huge opportunity in front of us right now with a pro-crypto administration and Congress actively working on new stablecoin legislation,” he said. “We can choose to level the playing field and ensure these laws pave a way for all regulated stablecoins to deliver interest directly to consumers, the same way a savings or checking account can.” As stablecoin legislation advances through Congress and prominent figures like Armstrong advocate for specific features, the debate highlights the growing intersection between traditional finance, digital assets, and public policy. The outcome of these discussions could fundamentally reshape how Americans interact with digital dollars and potentially influence global cryptocurrency adoption patterns. Whether lawmakers will incorporate interest-bearing capabilities into forthcoming regulations remains a pivotal question for the industry’s development in the United States. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What would be the benefits of onchain interest? Allowing stablecoins to pay interest could give consumers access to higher returns than traditional bank savings accounts, expand financial inclusion worldwide, and encourage global adoption of USD-backed assets. What role does Congress play in this? With stablecoin legislation currently being debated in Congress, Armstrong sees this as a key opportunity to shape policies that support onchain interest while keeping financial innovation within the U.S. How is the crypto community reacting? While some support Armstrong’s push for more financial freedom, others question whether stablecoins should be treated differently from other interest-bearing assets regulated under securities laws.

In a new interview on the Wolf of all Streets YouTube channel, Hoskinson says memecoins need to evolve and develop use cases and user bases to avoid going through a ‘dumpening’ – the practice of launching tokens with the sole aim of enriching insiders. “So a memecoin is just like the ascendancy of a celebrity that has 15 minutes of fame. It doesn’t necessarily mean that that celebrity is going to disappear forever, but they’re in a temporary state of popularity. They have to find a way to become sustainable quickly or otherwise the people stop paying attention and they die out. It’s why the 99% of the memecoins will fail, and the ones that succeed, they pivot into ecosystem-building… They have to. It’s the only way they can survive. So typically, you have to build community, you have to start doing things with that community, you have to have a reason for people to be there and continue investing. And it’s really hard because, almost always, the distributions of memecoins are built for insider dump. So the person who issues it, and the insiders who issue it, their only incentive is to pump the price to dump the price. So they have to survive the dumpening.” Hoskinson also warns that memecoins are hurting the crypto industry, as issuers tend to drain capital from market participants instead of helping boost digital asset adoption “What’s happening is you’re moving water from one side of the bathtub to the other side of the bathtub… [and] the drain is open, it goes into the founder’s pocket. So basically, you’re not adding water to the tub, you’re losing water over time… It’s net-net neutral or negative.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While meme coins like Pepe and Official Trump have captured the spotlight with sharp rises and rapid declines, BlockDAG (BDAG) is steadily progressing under real-world conditions. Pepe achieved significant early success fueled by social media, and $TRUMP rose sharply with its political timing—only to encounter issues with volatility and longevity. In contrast, BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet “Primordial” is testing economic scenarios, mining capacity, and user interaction to affirm its network’s scalability. Having accumulated over $210 million and distributed 19 billion coins, it demonstrates potential for lasting stability in a market often swayed by fleeting hype. Pepe Coin Journey: How it Excels Pepe Coin (PEPE), introduced in 2023 as a meme-inspired digital currency, has become a top-performing meme token. Initially fueled by social media excitement and strong community support, PEPE has yielded significant returns for early participants. As of March 29, 2025, the coin has increased more than 300% since its launch. Forecasts indicate it might rise between 450% and 1500% throughout 2025, depending on how the market behaves. For example, a $1,000 early stake in 2024 might now be valued at over $4,000. At present, the coin’s value is approximately $0.00001226, with potential growth expected to reach $0.0000413 by year-end. Moreover, its deflationary mechanism—automatically burning a part of each transaction—plays a crucial role in enhancing its market value. Trump Coin: Political Impact on Crypto Market Launched on January 17, 2025, just before Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration, the $TRUMP meme coin quickly became a major topic of discussion. Within just two days, its market valuation rocketed from $600 million to over $13 billion, and its price surged from $7 to a high of $75 per token—an increase of over 900%. Consequently, early backers saw returns from 300% to 19,000%, with some transforming small bets into fortunes. However, the token’s value has significantly dropped by over 50% from its highest point, currently trading between $12.50 and $14. Future predictions remain hopeful, with potential growth of 289% by the end of 2025, possibly hitting €62.97. Moreover, the Trump Organization holds 80% of the token supply, which stirs concerns about centralization and conflicts of interest. Despite generating more than $350 million through token sales and fees, the coin has faced criticisms over ethical issues and financial losses to the community. Ultimately, the $TRUMP coin illustrates both the immense possibilities and the typical risks associated with politically associated cryptocurrencies. BlockDAG Beta Testnet Evaluates Performance Under Real Conditions BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet “Primordial” serves as a realistic testing environment, mimicking the actual conditions that the mainnet will encounter once operational. It is designed to evaluate the network’s performance including transaction speeds, miner activity, and wallet interactions under genuine economic pressures. The focus extends beyond merely spotting flaws; it’s about assessing the network’s resilience in real operational scenarios. The testnet achieves this through supporting more than 2,000 transactions per second with a DAG-based Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism (GHOSTDAG) that allows for simultaneous block processing, offering a significant edge over conventional blockchain systems. With plans to integrate over 200 mining nodes and tens of thousands of wallets, the testnet is currently verifying large-scale transaction handling, precise token distribution, and the execution of EVM-compatible smart contracts. Additionally, providing incentives for leading miners and active wallets ensures that participation mirrors genuine user interactions. For early participants, the numbers provide reassurance. BlockDAG’s crypto presale has successfully gathered $210 million, with more than 19 billion coins distributed thus far. Now in its 27th batch, the price of BDAG stands at $0.0248 each, showing a 2,380% increase in value from the initial batch. These figures not only indicate a growing interest but also confirm a robust confidence in the network’s scalability. Distinguishing Genuine Progress from Mere Speculation While hype can drive quick spikes in interest and potential short-term gains, it’s the robust infrastructure that maintains lasting appeal. Pepe and Official Trump have demonstrated the effects of hype with rapid increases and sudden drops. In contrast, BlockDAG is validating its technology in a different manner. By rigorously testing its Beta Testnet in scenarios that mirror actual usage, it transcends simple market buzz to prove its technical viability. With solid presale support and observable chain activity, BlockDAG is not just chasing fleeting headlines but is establishing a foundation for sustained operation. In a market filled with transient excitement, BlockDAG emphasizes the importance of building systems that are designed to last rather than merely to impress.

CRO Rises 40%, While ZEC Targets Breakout",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-shakes-the-crypto-market-5m-in-48-hours-cro-rises-40-while-zec-targets-breakout/,"Cronos (CRO) is on the upswing as the SEC concludes its investigation into Crypto.com without charges, resulting in a 40% increase over the week. This development reflects a more supportive regulatory environment, enhanced by Crypto.com’s exploratory deal with Trump Media regarding crypto ETFs. However, despite positive news, there’s ongoing speculation about a potential reintroduction of 70 billion CRO, which could impact the token’s supply stability. Simultaneously, Zcash (ZEC) has risen by 12% in 24 hours, surpassing the crucial $33 support level, and now aims for the $45.63 resistance, signaling potential for a significant reversal after a period of low performance. While CRO and ZEC are finding their footing, BlockDAG (BDAG) has surged ahead with a $5 million increase in just 48 hours following Keynote 3, taking its presale to over $210 million. With a functioning beta testnet and substantial user engagement evidenced by over 800,000 app users, BlockDAG demonstrates effective execution beyond mere planning. CRO Climbs 40% This Week Cronos (CRO) is capturing attention again with a 40% rise this week, following the SEC’s decision to end its inquiry into Crypto.com without penalties. This marks a significant positive shift for the crypto landscape under the new SEC leadership, signaling a more lenient approach to digital assets. The enthusiasm is bolstered by Crypto.com’s tentative agreement with Trump Media to introduce crypto-backed ETFs, which propelled CRO by an additional 10% in just a day. Yet, the excitement is tempered by warnings from on-chain analyst ZachXBT about the possible return of 70 billion CRO tokens to circulation, which raises market integrity concerns. Zcash (ZEC) Surges 12% in a Day—Could This Signal a Major Market Shift? Zcash (ZEC) is regaining momentum with a 12% increase, pushing it back into the top 100 cryptocurrencies. After rallying from a low of $25 to regain the critical $33 support, this could be the start of a new upward trend after extended declines. While the immediate outlook shows mixed signals, the successful breach of a long-term downtrend and positive indicators on the RSI and MACD suggest increasing momentum. Potential buyers should monitor the $45.63 resistance closely. A breakthrough could initiate a wider rally. As one of the foundational privacy-focused coins, ZEC maintains enduring relevance, and current low prices might offer a significant entry point with substantial growth prospects. BlockDAG Secures $5M Rapidly Following Keynote 3 In a remarkable 48-hour period post-Keynote 3, BlockDAG has garnered an impressive $5 million, pushing its presale total beyond $210 million. This significant increase occurred shortly after demonstrating substantial advancements, including a live Beta Testnet with over 1.2 million transactions, robust block explorer capabilities, and comprehensive tools for token and NFT creation, alongside the operation of more than 100 active nodes. Unlike some Layer 1 projects that are still in the planning phase, BlockDAG is actively delivering results, which is catalyzing a strong response from the market. Currently, during Batch 27 of sales, BDAG is priced at $0.0248, with more than 19 billion coins already sold. Complemented by a vibrant community of over 800,000 X1 App users and 16,700+ units sold to miners, along with high-profile partnerships like those with Inter Milan and UFC, it’s clear why analysts are optimistic about BDAG reaching $1 post-listing. With the crypto presale accelerating following Keynote 3, the impending launch of mainnet features, DeFi tools, and new exchange listings is highly anticipated. The recent $5 million raised in just two days is a strong indicator of the potential excitement surrounding BDAG’s official release. This could be an opportunity many will wish they hadn’t missed. Critical Insights While CRO’s recent price jump might look attractive for quick gains, ongoing uncertainties about its token supply and overall market trust could dampen its growth. Meanwhile, Zcash faces its own challenges in sustaining momentum after its initial market recovery, with its long-term viability still to be proven. The future of both projects hinges on upcoming developments, including market sentiment shifts, new partnerships, and their ability to overcome technical resistance levels. In contrast, BlockDAG is turning potential into tangible success. The latest Keynote didn’t just serve as a promotional event but highlighted a project that is already in full swing, with over 1.2 million transactions on its testnet and effective smart contract functionalities, backed by a community that’s actively engaging with its tools. The swift $5 million raised post-Keynote isn’t just excitement; it’s a strong endorsement from both retail and institutional participants. Unlike its peers, BlockDAG isn’t merely waiting for external factors to boost its profile; it’s actively creating its momentum.

Elon brought charts, handed out $1 million checks, and used a packed town hall to accuse Biden of funneling taxpayer funds into what he called a broken system. The rally happened just a day and a half before polls opened in a high-stakes state judicial election. The event grabbed national attention after Elon gave the money to two Wisconsin voters who signed a petition against “activist judges.” That petition followed a ruling from the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which refused to hear a case saying the giveaway was illegal. After the checks, Elon brought up his DOGE associate Antonio Gracias to talk about what they uncovered inside the Social Security Administration. Behind them, a large slide appeared with the words “New Non-Citizen Social Security Numbers Issued.” Antonio explained what it meant. Elon Musk at the rally event. Source: Fox News/Getty Images “We started at the top of the system, mapping the whole system of Social Security to understand where all the fraud was,” Antonio said during the event. “But this is what jumped out at us. When we saw these numbers, we were like, ‘What is this?’” Antonio said that between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2025, noncitizens were issued Social Security numbers in growing numbers. In fiscal year 2024 alone, more than 2 million received them. The year before that, and even in fiscal year 2025 which began in October and runs through this September, the number was around 1 million each year. “This literally blew us away,” Antonio said. “We went there to find fraud and we found this by accident.” Elon’s Social Security overhaul may slow checks and support Jason Fichtner, who served as deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration under President George W. Bush, said things are getting risky. “Now I’m concerned that benefits could get disrupted,” he said. Jason said these new updates aren’t small tweaks—they could block people from getting help at all. Jason joined Kathleen Romig, another former SSA official and now director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in a public op-ed. They wrote that 7,000 workers have been removed from the SSA, and six regional offices have been shut down. That means fewer people to help, longer lines at field offices, and more bugs on the official SSA website. The phone line? It already had long waits before the layoffs. Now it’s worse. Kathleen and Jason said this mess could hit people with disabilities hardest. Delays could leave them waiting so long they die before getting the money they’re owed. “The Social Security Administration is in crisis, and people’s benefits are at risk,” they wrote. Jason also spoke about DOGE’s plan to wipe out COBOL, the old programming language that runs millions of lines of SSA code. DOGE wants to rebuild the entire system in a few months. Jason said that’s reckless. “If you start messing with the system’s code, that could impact those who are currently getting benefits now,” he said. Normally, a change like that would take years. It would start with one state, then move out slowly to other regions. Jason said DOGE isn’t doing that. Instead, they’re forcing everything through in a tight window, with no time for test runs or slow rollouts. Jason said he wasn’t too worried at first. He knew there were service delays, but he didn’t think people’s monthly checks were at risk. But now, with this COBOL plan moving full speed, he said it’s a whole new problem. The Social Security Administration responded by email saying, “There is no validity to these reports.” The White House used the same exact words too, oddly enough.

The company collapsed amid a liquidity crisis and fraud allegations. The news uncovered that Alameda Research, a closely related trading company to FTX, had invested billions of dollars of client funds in dubious investments. As clients flocked to withdraw their cash, FTX had insufficient funds to accommodate the demands, sending investors into chaos and the company’s swift downfall. FTX and Alameda Research collapsed on November 11, 2022. Further investigations indicated that FTX’s founder and chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, had diverted customer deposits. He was charged and convicted of fraud and conspiracy. The European subsidiary, FTX EU, was also impacted. Even with the stricter European oversight, customer assets in the broader FTX bankruptcy were trapped. FTX EU was purchased in January 2025 by Backpack Exchange, a regulated global cryptocurrency platform founded by ex-FTX and Alameda Research staff. The FTX bankruptcy court and the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) gave the acquisition the green light, allowing Backpack to scale its services throughout Europe. As part of the acquisition, Backpack would have handled the distribution of court-eventually approved bankruptcy claims to FTX EU customers, with a target to speed up the restitution process. Backpack Exchange has structured a claims process to facilitate customer restitution Backpack Exchange has created a simple process to recover funds for the affected FTX EU clients. The process starts with identity verification, requiring users to utilize a responsive verification system. The step is live and can be accessed via Backpack’s official claims page. Users who have successfully passed the verification process can then withdraw their funds. Backpack will share instructions as soon as the withdrawal phase goes live CEO Armani Ferrante stated that this is a significant effort and reaffirmed restitution to customers as a central element of building trust and confidence across the industry. Backpack Exchange has also made extensive support accessible across supported channels to assist users in recovery. The community is reacting and sharing feedback on social media The request for the asset recovery process brought different views within the crypto ecosystem. Responses from users on the social media platform have been optimistic and sceptical. “It’s been a really long road for us,” one user posted . Another said, “This is the minimum they could do after all of this time. I hope it will not take long.” Another one stated. The structured claims process is a great step in the right direction to re-attach FTX EU customers’ funds to the company while the company is now where it needed to be from the beginning, in the customer’s hands. As the Backpack Exchange aims to rebalance, however, the gaze of the cryptocurrency community will fall on them to secure their trust for good. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Despite the current rally, it remains unknown how the BTC price will react to the tariffs in the long term. Bitcoin is known to exhibit short-term reversal to macroeconomic uncertainties, a trend many believe may play out again. State of the Donald Trump Reciprocal Tariff One of the most crucial policies in the Donald Trump administration is levying tariffs on key trade partners. While this move is considered a commensurate measure to match what other trade partners are levying on US goods, the aftermath has toppled the market. Almost all big economies, including Russia have received Tariff threat from the US government. This threat is bound to be matched by the countries involved, including Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union. With Trump’s tariff kickstarting on April 2, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has revealed that reciprocal measures will be announced on April 3. This tariff war is poised to offset the mainstream stock market. The signs are already visible in the S&P 500, which has dropped by over 2% in the past five trading days. Similar negative sentiment is seen for the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones. The correlation between Bitcoin price and the mainstream financial market remains a fueling factor behind potential negative shifts in the market moving forward. Bitcoin Price is Yet to Adjust As of writing, the price of Bitcoin has rallied 3.44% in 24 hours to $85,186.47, according to CoinMarketCap data . However, the coin’s price has experienced a unique drawdown over the past week, dropping 2.79%. Since President Trump took office, the price of Bitcoin has experienced a mix of positive and negative sentiments. Amid the positive shifts, the BTC price hit $109,114 ATH on January 20, corresponding with President Trump’s inauguration. Since the all-time high milestone, Bitcoin price has fallen by over 20% to date. With the trade wars forming a headwind for the coin, more volatility is expected in the short term. With the trade war and reciprocal tariffs, inflation will soar again, forcing the Federal Reserve to adjust its interest rate policy. Should rates be slashed to boost the monetary landscape, it can set a basis for more BTC adoption, leading to a price surge in the long term. BTC Price and Key Tailwinds to Watch While April started positively for the top coin, the month still holds uncertainties per the trade war. However, some important tailwinds are at play that may influence market valuation moving forward. The US government’s strategic Bitcoin reserve might serve as a basis for more nation-state adoption in the long term. Institutional investors are also betting on BTC, creating a high demand for the coin. Despite the current volatility, top advocates advise buying now with hopes of a rebound soon.

The analyst warns that this technical formation could trigger a significant price correction for XRP, describing this downturn as the worst-case scenario. Analyst Predicts XRP Price Crash To $1.15 The ‘Charting Guy,’ a pseudonymous crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has unveiled a potential Head and Shoulder pattern formation on the XRP price chart. The analyst has shared insights into the implications of this technical pattern, projecting a potential crash in the XRP price. Related Reading: XRP Price Breakdown below $2: Analyst Reveals Next Major Support As a well-known bearish reversal pattern, the formation of a Head and Shoulder in the XRP price chart suggests a potential shift from an uptrend to a downtrend. Typically, a Head and Shoulder pattern consists of three peaks: the Left Shoulder, Head, and Right Shoulder. However, the Charting Guy has confirmed that XRP’s current pattern formation consists of two right shoulders and one head. Due to this irregularity, the analyst has expressed doubt about the possibility of the pattern playing out. If the Head and Shoulder pattern eventually takes shape, it could lead to a significant drop in the XRP price, potentially bringing it down to as low as $1.15. This price level aligns with a key Fibonacci Golden Pocket retracement zone between 0.618 – 0.786. Notably, the analyst has described this projected price crash as the worst-case scenario for XRP. While he believes a bearish move is possible, the analyst is confident that XRP’s broader market structure is bullish. Moreover, the Charting Guy argues that if XRP does decline to $1.15, it would likely serve as a healthy retracement in an overall bullish trend. He noted that XRP’s price has been holding the $2 level on daily closes, meaning its price action remains strong above support levels. This also indicates the possibility of an uptrend resumption that could yield higher highs and higher lows for XRP. Key Support And Resistance Levels To Watch The Charting Guy’s analysis of XRP’s potential Head and Shoulder pattern formation highlights several critical price levels to watch. Since XRP has consistently closed daily candles above $2, the analyst has determined this level as short-term support. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Begin Part 2 Of Bullish Wave 5 Movement, Here Are The Targets XRP has also been wicking during recent pullbacks in a crucial range between $1.7 and $1.9. As a result, the crypto analyst has revealed that he will be watching this area closely for a potential price bounce. The Golden Pocket retracement zone, which represents the worst-case scenario for the XRP price, is between $1.15 and $1.30. If XRP experiences a deeper price correction, lower support levels have been marked from $1.19 to $0.91. For its resistance levels, the Charting Guy has pinpointed $2.27 as a key price point. Additionally, $3.14 – $3.32 has been identified as an upper resistance range where XRP could rally if bullish momentum resumes.

Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), once the undisputed performers of the blockchain world, are seeing investors turn their attention elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an emerging player in decentralized finance that is capturing market interest at an unprecedented pace. With ETH currently trading at $1,814 and SOL at $126, their growth appears to be tapering, MUTM tokens are available during their Phase 4 presale which are priced at $0.025. A strong investor backing emerged through the acquisition of more than 7700 buyers who have raised $6 million during the presale process. Investors participating in Mutuum Finance Phase 4 token purchase earn 140% profit at $0.06 at exchange launch. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates in Phase 4 The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale is in progress while the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of hyper-inflated meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 4 of the presale has surpassed $5.9 million total shares and attracted more than 7600 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.025 during Phase 4 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Investors who bought in Phase 4 obtained 140% growth from their investment once MUTM launches. The current cost of MUTM attracts investors to buy during Phase 5 since it will undergo another pricing increase to 0.03. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders receive dependable income while borrowers get secure financing opportunities through this system. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Security takes precedence in this ecosystem through combination with open-source smart contracts along with third-party audits to establish complete transparency. The MUTM token holders benefit from both price growth potential and earn passive income while receiving investments through a strategic buyback system that strengthens long-term token value. Mutuum Finance aims to increase accessibility and liquidity by implementing multi-chain expansion which will include EVM and non-EVM blockchain support. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining decentralized lending with its innovative dual-model system, attracting thousands of investors seeking sustainable DeFi solutions. The Phase 4 presale has already raised over $6 million from more than 7,700 buyers, with the token price set to surge from $0.025 to $0.06 at launch, delivering an impressive 140% profit potential. As traditional blockchain giants like Ethereum and Solana experience slowed momentum, savvy investors are securing their positions in MUTM before the next price increase in Phase 5. With its cutting-edge security, automated interest rate adjustments, and multi-chain expansion, Mutuum Finance is primed for long-term success. Don’t miss out on this opportunity and join the presale today and be part of the future of DeFi.

Pineau’s announcement comes just weeks before Meta’s LlamaCon AI conference on April 29, where the company is set to unveil the latest version of Llama. Pineau departs Meta as AI race intensifies under Zuckerberg’s vision In a LinkedIn post, Pineau, who serves as Meta’s Vice President of AI Research, revealed that her last day at the company will be May 30. Her departure comes at a crucial moment for Meta, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made AI a top priority, committing billions of dollars to position the company as a leader in the field, ahead of competitors like OpenAI and Google. According to Zuckerberg, his goal for Meta is to build an AI assistant with more than 1 billion users and artificial general intelligence, which is a term used to describe computers that can think and take actions comparable to humans. “As the world undergoes significant change, as the race for AI accelerates, and as Meta prepares for its next chapter, it is time to create space for others to pursue the work,” Pineau wrote. She noted that she would be cheering from the sidelines, knowing that the firm has all the ingredients needed to build the best AI systems in the world and responsibly bring them into the lives of billions of people. Pineau was one of Meta’s leading AI researchers, having headed the company’s fundamental AI research division, FAIR, since 2023. In this role, she guided the company’s advanced computer science research, much of which has been integrated into its core applications. Pineau reflects on legacy at Meta ahead of key AI milestones and LlamaCon event Pineau began her tenure at Meta in 2017 to lead Meta’s Montreal AI research lab . In addition to her role at Meta, she is a computer science professor at McGill University, where she is a co-director of its reasoning and learning lab. She helped oversee some of the projects, including Meta’s open-source Llama family of AI models and other technologies, such as the PyTorch software for AI developers. Her departure announcement comes a few weeks ahead of Meta’s LlamaCon AI conference at the end of this month. In this event, Meta is expected to provide details on its latest version of Llama. Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, to whom Pineau reported had earlier, noted that Llama 4 will help power AI agents, the latest craze in generative AI. The firm is also expected to announce a standalone app for its Meta AI chatbot. A Meta spokesperson expressed gratitude for Joelle Pineau’s leadership of FAIR and acknowledged her significant contributions as an important advocate for Open Source. They highlighted her role in driving breakthroughs that have advanced both the company’s products and the science behind them. Pineau has not revealed her next role but said she “will be taking some time to observe and to reflect before jumping into a new adventure.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Investors hoped that regulatory reform and policies like a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve would drive prices appreciably higher. But it’s been the opposite. Bitcoin has fallen from highs well above $100,000 at the beginning of the year to a trough in the mid-80,000s for most of March. Crypto prices have suffered from being increasingly correlated with traditional assets like stocks and bonds, which have been hit by macroeconomic uncertainty. Tariffs — surcharges the U.S. places on imports from other countries — have Wall Street worried about a global recession. Crypto investors have been steering clear of crypto assets, which are seen as relatively risky. “This is all about markets’ ‘risk appetite’ which continues to deteriorate, and for the time being drives a wedge between crypto assets and gold, which continues to be the ‘safe haven’ of choice,” said Marc Ostwald, Chief Economist & Global Strategist at ADM Investor Services International. “[That’s] in no small part driven by central bank FX reserve managers, who are seeking to reduce USD exposure, which has long been a source of concern to them.” As the global financial and trade system becomes more fragmented, investors are seeking alternatives to riskier assets, including dollars. For now, that means turning to gold, which is up 18% year-to-date. But that could change, said Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and author of ""The Story of the Blockchain: A Beginner's Guide to the Technology That Nobody Understands."" Bitcoin could be the new gold soon enough. “I think the entire [future] is uncertain and in some ways unknowable, because there are many crosscurrents and both crypto and tariffs are new. Some people argue that crypto is just a risk-on tech asset and would sell off due to tariffs. But bitcoin has found footing in some circles as ‘digital gold’ and the physical variety is soaring on the tariff news. So which will it be?” In other words, economic uncertainty could lead investors to seek out bitcoin just as they have sought out gold in recent months. Another note of positivity: the impact of tariffs on crypto could be “priced in” and the worst might be over already, said Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale, a leading crypto asset management firm. President Trump is due to announce U.S. tariffs on Wednesday, April 2, at 4 p.m. ET—what’s known as “Liberation Day.” According to reports, he’ll lay out “reciprocal tariffs” against 15 countries that have levied tariffs against the U.S., including China, Canada and Mexico. Pandl estimates tariffs have so far taken 2% off economic growth this year. But Liberation Day might actually stop the worst of the pain felt in financial markets. “If we see an announcement [on Wednesday] that is tough but phased, and focused on the 15 countries they seem to be targeting, my expectation is that markets will rally on that news,” Pandl told CoinDesk. “Potentially once we get through this announcement, crypto markets can focus back on the fundamentals which are very positive.” Pandl said announcements like Circle’s IPO wouldn’t be happening if institutions didn’t have a high degree of confidence in the digital assets sector and the policies around it. Moreover, Pandl, a former macro-economist at Goldman Sachs, believes that tariffs will increase the appetite for currencies that aren’t dollars. “I think tariffs will weaken the dominant role of the dollar and create space for competitors including bitcoin. Prices have gone down in the short run. But the first few months of the Trump Administration have raised my conviction in the longer term for bitcoin as a global monetary asset.” Pendl still believes that bitcoin will hit new all-time highs this year, despite current pessimism around prices. “I wouldn’t have quit my Wall Street job if I didn’t think bitcoin will be the winner in the long term,” he said.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 01:28:58

Genesis Global Capital LLC, 23-cv-00287 , filed in the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). This lawsuit alleges that Gemini failed to register its cryptocurrency asset lending program, Gemini Earn, before offering it to retail investors. Gemini and SEC seek 60-day pause in legal battle over Gemini Earn In a joint letter filed on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court, the twins’ Gemini Trust and the SEC asked to hold all deadlines in the civil case over Gemini Earn for 60 days to allow the parties to explore a potential resolution. The letter did not say whether this might entail a settlement, the government agency dropping its case, or some other outcome. Neither Gemini’s nor the SEC’s lawyers immediately responded to requests for comment. In 2023, the regulatory body filed a lawsuit against Gemini, alleging that the exchange and Genesis Global Capital unlawfully raised billions of dollars in cryptocurrency through the Gemini Earn program. The program allowed customers to lend crypto assets, including Bitcoin, to Genesis in exchange for interest payments, with Gemini taking a fee as high as 4.29%. Genesis halted withdrawals in November 2022, the same month Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX cryptocurrency exchange collapsed. Two months later, it filed for bankruptcy. At the time, it held $900 million of assets from about 340,000 Gemini Earn customers. According to the SEC, Genesis and Gemini bypassed disclosure requirements meant to protect investors in creating Gemini Earn. Genesis agreed in March 2024 to pay a $21 million fine to settle, pending the resolution of claims in its Chapter 11 case, without admitting wrongdoing. On the other hand, Gemini continues to deny any wrongdoing in relation to the allegations. SEC shifts crypto regulatory stance under Trump, easing oversight and settling key cases The SEC has eased oversight of the cryptocurrency industry since Donald Trump became president in January. It is widely expected to remain more supportive of it than under the Biden administration. In recent weeks, the watchdog has ended civil lawsuits against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and agreed to settle a case against cryptocurrency company Ripple Labs over the unregistered sale of securities. Many crypto advocates hailed Trump’s election, hoping for more industry-friendly regulation and less regulatory enforcement. The billionaire Winklevoss brothers, Tyler and Cameron, each donated $844,600 to Trump’s 2024 campaign, the maximum allowed under federal law. According to Forbes, the brothers are each worth $3 billion. In a separate matter, Gemini reached a settlement with New York regulators, agreeing to return at least $1.1 billion to its customers.

This decision follows several days of controversy over the building’s status. Although the formal dispute continues in court, the judge stated that the building transfer has already taken place and thus cannot be undone at this time. On Saturday, officials associated with DOGE transferred the USIP headquarters, located in Washington, DC, to the General Services Administration (GSA). Judge Howell wrote that the transfer is “no longer merely ‘proposed’ but done,” which, in her view, made the plaintiffs’ request to block it moot for now. The building also contains office property and fixtures whose ownership the former USIP staff hoped to protect through the legal process. USIP building in Washington, DC. Source: Wikipedia George Foote, a longtime outside general counsel to the institute, has voiced frustration with the situation. In his words, “That’s like letting a burglar break into your house, steal your TV, and have the court say well, there’s no TV to adjudicate, so I can’t do anything about it.” This building has become a focal point of a dispute between the USIP’s former board and staff and members of DOGE. On March 14, the Trump administration dismissed the institute’s 10 voting board members. When USIP staff refused to allow DOGE employees to enter the headquarters, the DOGE group returned with a physical key that a former security contractor had given them. That action allowed DOGE to take physical control of the premises. After that, a series of personnel changes occurred within the institute itself. First, former State Department official Kenneth Jackson was put in place as USIP president. Then, on March 25, DOGE staffer Nate Cavanaugh replaced him. Before that, Cavanaugh had been assigned to the GSA. By last Friday evening, the majority of USIP employees received termination notices, effectively bringing the agency’s work to a standstill. Details from a lawsuit filed on Monday by former USIP staffers against Cavanaugh, DOGE, Donald Trump, and others in the administration show that Cavanaugh sought to transfer the headquarters to the GSA without asking the government to pay anything. In a letter, he told GSA Acting Administrator Stephen Ehikian that the transfer “is in the best interest of USIP, the federal government, and the United States.” In a different letter dated March 29, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought agreed to Ehikian’s request to “set the amount of reimbursement at no cost” for the facility. A court filing from Monday also lays out the Trump administration’s reasoning. Michael Peters, who leads the Public Buildings Service at the GSA, wrote in a transfer request form that “The transfer of the U.S. Institutes [sic] of Peace (USIP) headquarters facility … is a priority of the Trump-Vance administration.” The building’s transfer may not be permanent, at least for now Under the arrangement just approved by Howell, the federal government obtains the USIP building at no cost, even though the structure itself is valued at around $500 million. The institute’s endowment, worth more than $20 million across various bank accounts, still belongs to USIP for the moment. However, that endowment might also face uncertainty later. Judge Howell said there is no immediate need to stop any transfer of funds and that she did not view blocking it as essential to the broader case right now. One major issue is whether the USIP belongs fully to the federal government or operates as an independent agency outside of the executive branch. Lawyers for DOGE have argued in court that the USIP is a “wholly owned government corporation,” giving the GSA permission to take its property. On the other side, attorneys for USIP point to the 1984 United States Institute of Peace Act, which established the institute as an “independent, nonprofit, national institute.” That legislation, in their view, clearly separates USIP from typical federal agencies. They also contend that the headquarters building resulted from extensive private donations, which means it should not be seized as a public asset. Judge Howell has acknowledged that both sides have introduced conflicting arguments and says that “ambiguity persists” because there is very little law on point about how exactly to classify the USIP. Previously, she declined the institute’s request for a temporary restraining order that would have allowed the original board to return to their positions. That denial left the institute under DOGE’s control, at least for the time being. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

You should not overlook this. BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly gaining attention as a high-speed Layer 1 platform backed by a hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work model. With its expanding use cases and appeal to meme coin creators, it’s earning a reputation as the potential “Solana alternative” for 2025. However, what’s pushing it to the forefront isn’t just the technology—it’s the growing trend of meme coin adoption. The numbers highlight the momentum. BlockDAG has already raised over $210 million in its presale, with $5 million collected within just two days after Keynote 3. Now in Batch 27, BDAG is selling at $0.0248, with more than 19 billion coins distributed—showing no signs of slowing. Why Meme Coins Flourish on Layer 1 Chains with the Right Setup Solana’s growth wasn’t only because of its speed. It became a base for meme tokens like BONK, WIF, and SAMO due to cheap fees and quick transactions. But Solana has had issues like network disruptions and weak EVM integration, making DeFi expansion harder. BlockDAG takes these problems into account and brings added functionality. Keynote 3 revealed that BlockDAG’s mainnet will launch with full DeFi capabilities: Swaps: Allowing instant trading of meme coins. Lending & Staking: Letting users earn on idle assets. Bridges: Making it easier to move coins between chains. Governance Modules: Letting communities participate in project direction. Token & NFT Creation Wizard: Helping users launch meme coins quickly without needing to write any code. What sets BlockDAG apart is that it’s compatible with both EVM and WASM. That allows builders from Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems to easily bring their projects over. Meme coins thrive on fast execution, strong community support, and liquidity. BlockDAG brings all three to the table. User Growth Shows Meme Ecosystem Is Already Taking Shape on BlockDAG The base of a meme coin economy is user energy—memes, activities, and online participation. BlockDAG’s network shows strong signs: Over 800,000 users mining BDAG on the X1 Miner App More than 400,000 have joined the Tap Miner game Around 170,000 users have taken part in the presale These aren’t inflated numbers or inactive accounts. They’re real people interacting with the ecosystem and mining BDAG before it reaches centralized platforms. That kind of early activity helped push Solana into the meme coin spotlight. BlockDAG appears to be building similar momentum, with more structure behind it. Meme Coins Need DeFi Tools—BlockDAG Makes Them Accessible For meme coins to last, they must go beyond just hype. With BlockDAG’s tools, meme tokens can function within a full ecosystem. Users can launch a community token, list it on a BDAG-powered DEX, activate staking features, and set up bridges—all without coding. These tools were already shown in action during the Beta Testnet in Keynote 3. This early exposure is drawing attention from outside players, too. BlockDAG has over 10 confirmed exchange listings coming after the mainnet, and there are talks about large-scale backing preparing to enter. At the current price of $0.0248, there’s rising anticipation around BDAG touching the $1 mark. The combined effect of liquidity, staking activity, and listings creates a strong path for price growth. BlockDAG Sets the Stage for Meme Coin Breakouts With more than $210 million already secured during the crypto presale , BlockDAG’s structure is turning heads. Its combination of fast processing, EVM/WASM compatibility, and active participation makes it more than just a tech solution. “It’s about the next phase,” shared CEO Antony Turner during Keynote 3, hinting at the project’s roadmap. What lies ahead could set off a new era of meme coins—this time on a foundation built for performance and community strength. Solana began the trend. BlockDAG is ready to scale it. With high-speed architecture and tools that simplify meme coin development, the potential is growing. At the current price point, the entry looks promising.

However, the price remains confined within specific ranges, and tools like RSI and MACD suggest declining strength. Concurrently, Tether is evolving past its stablecoin persona by buying a 30% share in Be Water Media for $10.8 million. This strategy leans more towards influence than just infrastructure. On another front, BlockDAG (BDAG) is playing a whole new game. With a $210 million fund, over 800,000 miners, and an active hybrid DAG + PoW testnet, BlockDAG isn’t just in the news—it’s creating history. From enhancing smart contract safety to achieving 2,000 transactions per second, it”‘ putting into action what others merely discuss. While ETH and USDT are repositioning themselves, BlockDAG is precisely advancing towards a full Layer-1 debut, potentially transforming the crypto architecture completely. Ethereum Whales Build Up Pre-Pectra—Yet Risks of Breakdown Persist Ethereum whales are intensifying their purchases as the Pectra mainnet upgrade nears, scheduled for April 30. Lookonchain data indicates substantial acquisitions, including a whale who bought over $103 million worth of ETH. Additionally, exchange reserves have diminished by close to one million ETH since early March, suggesting increased accumulation. Despite this positive sentiment, ETH’s price remains subdued. It recently fell below a crucial trendline after failing at $2,069, which heightens the risk of a significant drop towards $1,800 or even $1,200 if a bearish pattern holds. Early indicators from RSI and MACD point to growing weaknesses. While the Pectra upgrade could stimulate network activities, wider economic uncertainties and ETF withdrawals are tempering the momentum. Market watchers should keep an eye on $2,069 and $1,800; the first level to give could dictate Ethereum’s next significant direction. Tether Secures 30% of Be Water Media in $10.8M Transaction Tether has boldly stepped outside the cryptocurrency sphere by securing a 30.4% interest in the Italian media company Be Water for €10 million ($10.8 million). With CEO Paolo Ardoino joining Be Water’s board, Tether is positioning itself to impact the media through storytelling and advanced technology content. This strategic pivot marks Tether’s transition from focusing solely on stablecoins to engaging in film, podcasts, and live media production. While Guido Maria Brera continues to hold the majority stake, Tether’s involvement could redefine how content is produced and distributed across different platforms. As the lines between cryptocurrency and mainstream media continue to merge, this investment places Tether at the forefront of influencing digital narratives. This move is viewed by analysts as part of a broader strategy where crypto entities penetrate traditional sectors to broaden their influence and lessen their dependency on primary offerings. Upcoming regulatory discussions might ensue as the crypto industry further integrates with mainstream sectors. BlockDAG Raises $210M—Could This Redefine Layer-1 Technologies? BlockDAG has successfully raised $210 million through its presale, showcasing its strength in smart Layer-1 design, eclipsing many trend-based crypto initiatives. This platform is engineered for scalability, security, and decentralization from the ground up, steering clear of reliance on secondary patches and Layer-2 solutions. During Keynote 3, the team unveiled modern hybrid architecture combining Proof-of-Work with DAG, allowing simultaneous transaction processing. This framework not only runs a beta testnet but is also geared up for 2,000 transactions per second at launch, with aspirations to expand to 15,000 TPS in the next two years. Security is a paramount feature, with each smart contract rigorously audited by Certik and Halborn, and the treasury safeguarded through multi-party computation, eliminating any single failure points. The system’s inherent real-time threat monitoring and network defenses negate the necessity for supplementary security layers. Already supported by over 800,000 X1 miners and 170,000 holders, and enhanced by an accessible no-code token creation tool, BlockDAG is a testament to robust, integral infrastructure. It integrates functionalities ranging from DeFi to governance seamlessly within a secure Layer-1 environment. As other networks add layers of complexity, BlockDAG demonstrates that a strong foundational build is superior to makeshift solutions. With the mainnet launch imminent, the focus shifts from potential to actual implementation. Key Insights The upcoming reaction to Ethereum’s Pectra mainnet could swing ETH’s value significantly. Tether’s venture into media is bold and shows long-term ambition but lacks immediate benefits to its network, presenting both opportunities and risks. These moves are crucial yet speculative. Keynote 3 introduced a dynamic ecosystem actively developing—featuring DeFi innovations, a treasury secured by MPC, and tools for creating no-code NFTs and tokens, with global hackathons in progress. BlockDAG’s approach eschews dependence on Layer-2 adjustments or external narrative shifts, focusing instead on direct scalability, security, and market adoption. The $210 million milestone in the crypto presale signals robust confidence from over 170,000 holders, distinguishing BlockDAG in a market saturated with transient trends. While Ethereum and Tether are planning their future moves, BlockDAG is already delivering tangible results, establishing its platform one block at a time. The vision for the future of crypto isn’t layered—it’s built on a solid foundation, and BlockDAG’s foundation is firmly in place.

However, as the market evolves, Ethereum is facing a slowdown, leading smart investors to seek higher-growth alternatives. With scalability concerns, high gas fees, and slowing institutional interest, Ethereum’s dominance is being challenged. This has opened the door for new projects with better efficiency, lower costs, and stronger upside potential. One hidden crypto gaining traction among early adopters and institutional investors is RCO Finance (RCOF) , a next-generation crypto designed to deliver explosive returns and real-world utility. Why Ethereum’s (ETH) Growth Is Slowing Ethereum (ETH), once hailed as the backbone of decentralized finance and blockchain innovation, has faced significant challenges recently. Now trading at $1,837, ETH has dropped by over 55% since November, when it rose to $4,106, the closest it has been to its all-time high since 2021. Here’s what is causing this declining performance. Despite hosting over 60% of all DeFi projects, Ethereum is no longer the only major player in the blockchain space. Competitors like Solana , Cardano , and Avalanche have gained traction by offering faster transaction speeds and lower costs. They are increasingly attracting developers and projects that might have otherwise chosen Ethereum. Ethereum’s transaction fees have remained a major pain point for users. Despite layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, the cost of interacting with the Ethereum network remains significantly higher than newer blockchain solutions. This has pushed many developers and users toward more affordable platforms. While Ethereum was once the go-to blockchain for institutional adoption, many investment firms and hedge funds are now exploring newer blockchain ecosystems that offer better speed, lower costs, and advanced financial tools. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Hidden Crypto Smart Money Is Migrating To As Ethereum’s growth slows, smart investors are rotating into undervalued cryptos with stronger short-term potential. RCOF has emerged as one of the top picks for high-growth opportunities, offering a scalable, AI-powered ecosystem with real-world financial integrations. RCO Finance’s core offering is its groundbreaking robo-advisor , an AI-powered trading assistant that is transforming how we interact with the crypto world. Think of it as your personal financial advisor, available 24/7. This tool offers real-time market insights, portfolio management, automated trade execution and tailored investment guidance. The robo-advisor uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical and real-time market data to create personalized investment and trading plans based on a user’s references. This can include your financial goals, risk tolerance, how long you want to invest, and other market preferences. This customization enables you to easily create a profitable portfolio without prior experience. What’s better, the robo-advisor can adjust things should market conditions or your preferences change. Let’s say you initially adopt a conservative investment strategy, focusing on low-risk assets like government bonds, but as you gain confidence and explore opportunities for higher returns, your risk appetite might increase. The robo-advisor can easily adjust your strategy, diversifying your portfolio to include high-performing altcoins like FUNToken (FUN), which has grown by over 185% in the last week. This adaptive framework ensures your investments remain aligned with your evolving goals, offering you the flexibility to capitalize on lucrative opportunities without compromising your financial stability. This crypto is breaking new ground with its real-world asset (RWA) integration. This feature allows investors to access diverse investment options that include digital assets and RWAs like ETFs, commodities, real estate, bonds and more. This ingenious initiative democratizes access to these high-value assets once reserved for a select few. It also bridges the gap between crypto and traditional finance, providing stability to counter the volatility of crypto investments. Many platforms require users to fulfil Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements before they can participate. This approach often forces users to submit sensitive personal documents, undergo identity checks, and navigate tedious approval processes. This can be off-putting for those who value their anonymity and lock out users in restricted regions. RCOF’s KYC-free ecosystem eliminates this burden, allowing users from anywhere worldwide to participate without compromising their personal data. Given the market’s vulnerability to scams and rug pulls, RCOF has taken a proactive approach to ensuring the security and reliability of its platform by undergoing a rigorous SolidProof audit . This meticulous audit shows its smart contracts and codebase are free of vulnerabilities, reassuring users of its trustworthiness and security. Unlike many DeFi projects that hold back their features until after launch, RCOF has boldly unveiled its beta platform during the presale stage, a rarity in the crypto world. This move showcases the platform’s confidence in its technology and allows you to test its cutting-edge features first-hand. This fully functional version has already attracted over 10,000 active users exploring the platform and providing valuable feedback to refine and enhance its features. Want to see the robo-advisor in action? Access the beta platform here . Capitalize on This Opportunity: Invest in RCOF While Ethereum remains a powerful crypto, multiple challenges have caused investor confidence to wane, pushing them to RCO Finance. The combination of AI-driven tools, real-world asset integration, and early-stage growth potential makes it a prime target for those looking for exponential gains. Priced at $0.100 in the 5th stage of the presale , this is your chance to get in on the action while the price is still low. With an estimated launch price between $0.40 and $0.60, your investment could grow by between 300% and 500%. Smart investors are already jumping on this opportunity, with over half of the tokens allocated for this stage already gone. Your window of opportunity is closing fast. Act now, make smart money moves by joining RCOF and position yourself for massive returns.

42779954,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=722182,1743559259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42779954.jpeg,Shifting Sentiment? Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Stay Put Despite Losses,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/shifting-sentiment-short-term-bitcoin-holders-stay-put-despite-losses/,"According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, short-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders are choosing to retain their digital assets despite incurring unrealized losses. CryptoQuant contributor Onchained explained that short-term BTC holders have recorded significantly lower realized losses compared to their unrealized losses. Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Expecting A Price Rally? The first quarter of 2025 has been marked by high price volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin. BTC has dropped from approximately $97,000 on January 1 to around $83,000 at the time of writing, reflecting a decline of more than 15%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Make Big Moves As Bullish Momentum Resurfaces Despite this price pullback, short-term BTC holders continue to hold onto their assets instead of selling at a loss. CryptoQuant contributor Onchained analyzed the Short-Term Holder Net Realized PNL to Exchanges, highlighting a shift in selling behavior. According to the analyst, BTC holders who have owned their coins for one to three months have been the most active sellers in recent days, even at the cost of realizing losses. This is unusual, as short-term investors holding BTC for less than a week are typically the most reactive sellers. However, recent data shows a significant decline in selling pressure to cryptocurrency exchanges. This suggests that BTC holders who purchased their coins in the last six months are opting to hold onto their assets rather than panic sell. This shift in selling behavior among short-term holders could have multiple implications. A decline in selling pressure may indicate a change in investor sentiment, with holders willing to endure short-term losses in anticipation of long-term gains. While the analyst cautioned that this data does not predict future price movements, it does provide valuable insights into market psychology. The analysis states: Are short-term holders finally holding the line? If so, this could reduce downside volatility and set the stage for stabilization, or even a reversal. Onchained concluded that short-term holders currently control 28% of BTC’s circulating supply. If a significant portion of these holdings transitions to long-term holders, it could pave the way for Bitcoin’s price to surge beyond $150,000. Is BTC About To Stage A Comeback? Alongside the decline in short-term BTC selling pressure, several other exchange-related metrics suggest the possibility of an upcoming price surge for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Daily RSI Downtrend, But Analyst Warns Of Strong Resistance Ahead Recently, crypto entrepreneur and market commentator Arthur Hayes claimed that BTC “probably” hit this market cycle’s bottom during its plunge to $77,000 on March 10. However, Hayes noted that the stock market could still experience further pullbacks. While Bitcoin has been in a downtrend for the past few months, gold has surged to multiple new all-time highs (ATHs) due to ongoing global macroeconomic uncertainty. BTC’s poor performance against the precious metal is likely to continue as the US trade tariff threat looms. At press time, BTC trades at $83,953, up 2.2% in the past 24 hours.

Gala Price Prediction and Algorand Rank Among Top Cryptos for Massive Growth,https://thecoinrise.com/qubetics-tics-to-hit-10-gala-price-prediction-and-algorand-rank-among-top-cryptos-for-massive-growth/,"Is crypto still the wild west of finance, or has it evolved into the future of investment? While traditional markets continue to move at a snail’s pace, the crypto world is buzzing with action, shaking up the financial industry with alternative investment opportunities. In this chaotic yet lucrative landscape, three names are turning heads— Qubetics ($TICS), Gala ($GALA), and Algorand ($ALGO). These cryptos have not only captured the attention of serious market players but have also solidified themselves as powerful instruments for wealth generation. Amid the crypto storm, Qubetics is carving its path as the next big thing, with mind-blowing adoption, a red-hot presale, and a utility-focused ecosystem that could redefine cross-border transactions. As Gala strengthens its dominance in blockchain gaming and Algorand continues its mission of high-performance finance, each of these cryptos presents a unique opportunity for top cryptos for massive growth. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics isn’t just a typical digital asset; it’s redefining cross-border transactions with seamless global payments. Imagine sending money to a friend overseas without outrageous fees, slow processing times, or annoying red tape. That’s the power Qubetics ($TICS) brings to the table. At its core, Qubetics is engineered to bridge the gap in international finance, eliminating inefficiencies that have plagued traditional banking systems for decades. Whether it’s businesses paying suppliers across borders, remote freelancers receiving their salaries, or families supporting loved ones in another country, Qubetics is revolutionizing cross-border transactions, making them faster, cheaper, and more accessible. Currently, Qubetics is in its 28th crypto presale stage, having already sold over 504 million $TICS tokens to more than 23,900 holders, raking in a jaw-dropping $15.5 million. Right now, the price of $TICS stands at $0.1430, but analysts are extremely bullish, projecting it to hit $1 (599% ROI), $5 (3,396% ROI), and even $10 (6,892% ROI). Some ultra-bullish estimates even push the price up to $15 post-mainnet launch, delivering an eye-watering 10,388% ROI. Taking it up a notch, a $2,500 investment could yield $17,482 at $1, $87,412 at $5, $174,825 at $10, and a life-changing $262,237 if $TICS reaches $15. These scenarios show why many are calling $TICS one of the most exciting crypto opportunities on the market today. With real-world usability, growing demand, and aggressive expansion, Qubetics positioning itself as the top cryptos for massive growth. Gala ($GALA): Leading the Blockchain Gaming Revolution Gala Games has been the undisputed champion in the blockchain gaming world, delivering a decentralized ecosystem where players own their in-game assets and shape the future of gaming. Unlike traditional gaming platforms where developers hold all the power, Gala flips the script—giving gamers the ability to earn, trade, and fully control their digital items. Since its inception, Gala ($GALA) has amassed a die-hard community and partnerships with major gaming studios, reinforcing its status as the go-to platform for Web3 gaming. Analysts remain bullish on Gala price prediction, expecting significant growth as blockchain gaming adoption accelerates in 2025. While $GALA saw explosive growth during the last bull run, it has proven its resilience, bouncing back stronger with new developments, partnerships, and an ever-expanding metaverse vision. Analysts predict that as more traditional gamers enter the blockchain space, demand for $GALA will surge, making it one of the top cryptos for massive growth in 2025 and beyond. Algorand ($ALGO): The Green Blockchain Powering High-Performance Finance When it comes to scalability, security, and sustainability, few blockchains hold a candle to Algorand ($ALGO). Designed by MIT professor Silvio Micali, Algorand is one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains in existence, making it a prime candidate for global finance applications. What sets Algorand apart is its Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, which eliminates the energy-intensive mining process found in traditional Proof-of-Work blockchains. This makes $ALGO one of the most eco-friendly cryptos, a huge selling point for institutions and businesses looking to adopt blockchain technology without the environmental backlash. With rising adoption, strategic partnerships, and institutional interest, Algorand remains one of the top cryptos for massive growth, ready to explode as global markets shift towards blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Conclusion: Which Crypto Holds the Key to the Future? Qubetics, Gala, and Algorand have all carved out unique niches in the crypto world, offering immense potential for those looking for the top cryptos for massive growth . Whether it’s Qubetics’ mission to revolutionize cross-border transactions, Gala’s dominance in blockchain gaming, or Algorand’s role in high-performance finance, these cryptos are reshaping digital investments. If you’re looking to get in early on a project with sky-high potential, Qubetics stands out as the ultimate frontrunner. With its presale numbers already turning heads and price predictions pointing to a jaw-dropping ROI, now is the time to make a move before $TICS becomes the next big name in crypto.

Kentucky’s Department of Financial Institutions filed the stipulation to dismiss jointly with Coinbase on April 1, ending the state’s legal action against the exchange first filed along with 10 other state regulators in June 2023. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal posted to X on April 1, calling for Congress “to end this litigation-driven, state-by-state approach with a federal market structure law.” Source: Paul Grewal Financial regulators from 10 states launched similar suits against Coinbase in June 2023, on the same day the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the exchange — a lawsuit the SEC dropped last month. Seven suits against Coinbase still active Alabama, California, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington and Wisconsin are the seven states that are still continuing with their lawsuits, which all allege Coinbase breached securities laws with its staking rewards program. Vermont was the first state to end its suit against Coinbase, with its Department of Financial Regulation filing an order to rescind the action on March 13, noting the SEC’s Feb. 27 decision to drop its action against the exchange and the likelihood of changes in the federal regulator’s guidance. The South Carolina Attorney General’s securities division followed Vermont days later, dismissing its lawsuit in a joint stipulation with Coinbase on March 27. Related: South Carolina dismisses its staking lawsuit against Coinbase, joining Vermont Kentucky’s decision to drop its case against Coinbase follows just days after the state’s governor, Andy Beshear, signed a “Bitcoin Rights” bill into law on March 24 that establishes protections for crypto self-custody and exempts crypto mining from money transmitting and securities laws. The axed state-level lawsuits come amid a stark policy change at the SEC, which has dropped or delayed multiple lawsuits against crypto companies that it filed under the Biden administration.

Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) adviser Jamie Collier said in an April 2 report that while the US is still a key target, increased awareness and right-to-work verification challenges have forced North Korean IT workers to find roles at non-US companies. “In response to heightened awareness of the threat within the United States, they’ve established a global ecosystem of fraudulent personas to enhance operational agility,” Collier said. “Coupled with the discovery of facilitators in the UK, this suggests the rapid formation of a global infrastructure and support network that empowers their continued operations,” he added. Google's Threat Intelligence Group says North Korea's tech workers expanded their reach amid a US crackdown. Source: Google The North Korea-linked workers are infiltrating projects spanning traditional web development and advanced blockchain applications, such as projects involving Solana and Anchor smart contract development , according to Collier. Another project building a blockchain job marketplace and an artificial intelligence web application leveraging blockchain technologies was also found to have North Korean workers. “These individuals pose as legitimate remote workers to infiltrate companies and generate revenue for the regime,” Collier said. “This places organizations that hire DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] IT workers at risk of espionage, data theft, and disruption.” North Korea looking to Europe for tech jobs Along with the UK, Collier says the GTIG identified a notable focus on Europe, with one worker using at least 12 personas across Europe and others using resumes listing degrees from Belgrade University in Serbia and residences in Slovakia. Separate GTIG investigations found personas seeking employment in Germany and Portugal, login credentials for user accounts of European job websites, instructions for navigating European job sites, and a broker specializing in false passports. At the same time, since late October, the North Korean workers have increased the volume of extortion attempts and gone after larger organizations, which the GTIG speculates is the workers feeling pressure to maintain revenue streams amid a crackdown in the US. “In these incidents, recently fired IT workers threatened to release their former employers’ sensitive data or to provide it to a competitor. This data included proprietary data and source code for internal projects,” Collier said. Related: North Korean crypto attacks rising in sophistication, actors — Paradigm In January, the US Justice Department indicted two North Korean nationals for their involvement in a fraudulent IT work scheme involving at least 64 US companies from April 2018 to August 2024. The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control also sanctioned companies it accused of being fronts for North Korea that generated revenue via remote IT work schemes.

The motion , which was submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 1, requests that the court postpone all deadlines while further discussions occur. In January 2023, the SEC filed its first lawsuit against Gemini Trust and Genesis Global Capital, claiming they had unlawfully raised billions of dollars through the Gemini Earn program without registering it as a securities offering. The lawsuit was part of the SEC’s broader crackdown on crypto firms under the Biden administration’s regulatory push. Gemini had previously agreed to return $2.18 billion to affected customers as part of a separate settlement with New York regulators. The motion did not specify whether discussions could lead to a settlement, dismissal, or another resolution, but both parties argue that pausing the case serves the public interest and conserves judicial resources. The SEC and Gemini will provide a joint status update within 60 days of the request being approved.

The change in approach has been welcomed by crypto industry players who previously faced strict enforcement under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The Winklevoss twins, founders of Gemini, have also been active supporters of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. They each donated the maximum allowed $844,600 to Trump’s 2024 campaign. Genesis, which managed $900 million from 340,000 Gemini Earn customers before halting withdrawals in November 2022, settled its part of the case in February 2024 by agreeing to a $21 million fine.

According to the April 1 filing , Circle ( USDC ) intends to list its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker “CRCL.” The company’s filing indicates that some current shareholders will also sell shares, even though the quantity and price range of shares have not yet been made public. While sales from current holders will not benefit the business, Circle will profit from shares it sells directly. Major banks like JPMorgan and Citigroup will underwrite the IPO, and there will be a 30-day window for additional share purchases. Information about Circle’s performance can be found in its financial disclosures. The company’s reserve income and total revenue climbed from $1.45 billion in 2023 to $1.68 billion in 2024. Interest on reserves backing USDC accounted for a sizable amount of its profits.

Additionally, the business reported $54.4 million in other income and $4.3 million in losses on digital assets. The money raised from the IPO will go toward possible acquisitions , operational growth, and product development. A three-tiered share structure will be introduced by Circle’s IPO. Each Class A share, which will be offered for sale, has one vote. Co-founders Jeremy Allaire and Patrick Sean Neville own Class B shares, which are limited to 30% of the total voting power but have five votes each. Class C shares are convertible under specific circumstances, but they do not have voting rights. Following the cancellation of a $9 billion SPAC merger in 2021, this IPO marks Circle’s first attempt at a traditional public listing. Circle’s public debut signals its plan to further integrate into the financial sector as stablecoin adoption continues to grow.

The firm has submitted its prospectus to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aiming to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” This move comes at a time when the U.S. government appears to be becoming more favorable toward cryptocurrency and blockchain-based technologies. USDC Issuer Circle Files for IPO Circle’s decision to go public follows years of anticipation. The company first attempted to enter the public markets via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2021. However, this effort was halted due to regulatory concerns and timing issues with the SEC. Since then, Circle has worked to position itself as a more integral player in global finance, including relocating its headquarters from Boston to New York’s One World Trade Center. In 2024, Circle submitted a draft registration statement for its IPO with the SEC, move that has been made in light of the growing influence of stablecoins in the crypto-market. In the case of IPO, it will give Circle access to public funds, and investors a chance to invest in a company that has been active in cryptocurrency for several years now. Financial Performance and IPO Valuation Circle reported a significant increase in its revenue for 2024, with its total revenue reaching $1.68 billion, up from $1.45 billion in 2023. A large portion of this income came from reserve income related to its stablecoin operations. The company’s net income for the year stood at approximately $156 million, though this was a decrease from $268 million in 2023. The IPO is expected to value Circle at between $4 billion and $5 billion, with JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup acting as the lead underwriters. The company’s created stablecoin USDC is now among the biggest and most popular stablecoins available in the cryptocurrency market having a market capitalization of around $60 billion. Regulatory Climate and Crypto-Friendly Shift Circle’s decision to go for the IPO can also be seen as a signal of a change in the regulatory outlook of cryptocurrencies in the US. The current government under the presidency of Donald Trump is more receptive and inclined towards formulating favorable crypto laws. This is a change that has given more assurance to firms in the crypto space such as Circle, which now has a chance to conduct its operations under a friendly regulatory environment. Analysts have noted that the US authorities may introduce legislation regulating stablecoins this year, which will allow Circle to strengthen its position in the market. Such moves also show the increasing role of stablecoins in the context of the company’s cooperation with exchanges like Coinbase that have committed to sharing revenues generated by USDC. But, Circle is not alone in the crypto-related firm trying to list it on the stock exchange. Another big player in the sphere of blockchain, Ripple, is also believed to be considering going public . Although facing continued regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, Ripple has obtained a strong standing in the cryptocurrency market, especially in cross-border payments, which puts the company in the position to possibly mimic Circle.

However, due to market uncertainty, the asset is facing difficulties and struggling to gain momentum. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.67 and has experienced a modest price surge of over 0.50%, which was previously 4.5%. However, due to uncertainty, the token lost its gains. Meanwhile, during the same period, the asset’s trading volume dropped by 20%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Price Prediction According to expert technical analysis, ADA recently visited a key support level of $0.63, which has a history of strong price reversals or rebounds. ADA has always seen strong buying pressure at this level, leading to an upside rally. This time, the asset has formed a Doji candle at the support level on the daily timeframe, hinting at potential upside momentum. Based on recent price action, if ADA remains above the $0.63 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 25% to reach $0.85. However, since the current market isn’t bullish, it would be difficult to see such an upward move. Instead, we may see price consolidation between the $0.63 and $0.70 levels over the next few days. Source: Trading View In addition to this, ADA’s 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is above its current price, indicating that the asset is in a bearish trend and has weak price action. Key Liquidation Levels This bearish trend explains why traders are strongly betting on short positions, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass Data revealed that $0.662 and $0.70 are the levels where intraday traders are highly over-leveraged, having built $5.50 million and $13.60 million worth of long and short positions, respectively, in the past 24 hours.

ETH is now consolidating and facing key hurdles near the $1,920 level. Ethereum started a recovery wave above $1,820 and $1,850 levels. The price is trading above $1,860 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $1,860 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $1,900 and $1,920 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Starts Recovery Ethereum price managed to stay above the $1,750 support zone and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH was able to climb above the $1,820 and $1,850 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $1,880 resistance zone. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,032 swing high to the $1,767 low. However, the bears are active near the $1,920 zone. Ethereum price is now trading above $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $1,860 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

The next key resistance is near the $1,920 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,032 swing high to the $1,767 low. The first major resistance is near the $1,970 level. A clear move above the $1,970 resistance might send the price toward the $2,020 resistance. An upside break above the $2,020 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,050 resistance zone or even $2,120 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,920 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,860 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $1,845 zone. A clear move below the $1,845 support might push the price toward the $1,800 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,765 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,710.

Here’s What Experts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-the-xrp-bottom-finally-in/,"The XRP price fell as low as $2.0238 on Monday, potentially forming a local bottom. Since then, the XRP price is up almost 6%, however, the possibility of a deeper retracement remains. Two prominent chartists—CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) and Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy)—have shared their perspectives on whether the token has found its local bottom or if further downside might still be on the table. Is The XRP Price Bottom In? According to CasiTrades’ newly published chart, XRP appears to have tested the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement at $2.05 and is now showing bullish divergences across multiple timeframes—from the 15-minute all the way to the 4-hour chart. CasiTrades notes that these signals are a positive indicator both for short-term bounces and a potential macro recovery. “Was that the bottom for XRP? After reaching the .786 retrace at $2.05, #XRP is printing bullish divergences from the 15min all the way up to the 4hr chart. That’s the kind of signal we want to see for both short-term bottom and macro! The bounce is holding so far! CasiTrades notes. Related Reading: XRP Bull Cycle Could End If This Happens: Analyst The analyst also points to key resistance at $2.25, suggesting that a convincing break above this level with strong momentum would likely negate the need for another retest of support. “If we break above $2.25 with strong momentum, that would invalidate the need for another support retest—a very bullish sign, CasiTrades writes, adding “$2.00–2.01 remains a support if the $2.05 doesn’t hold.” Moreover, she highlights a Fib Time Zone 3 that could span the entire month of April, forecasting a “bullish window” for XRP. According to the chart, once price meets its target, a larger impulse to the upside may follow, with potential resistance lining up at $2.70 and $3.80+. Related Reading: XRP MVRV Ratio Dips Below The 200-Day MA – Trend Shift Underway? Meanwhile, Charting Guy addressed that market chatter has surfaced about a possible head and shoulders pattern on the XRP chart, with a projected breakdown target near $1.15. While acknowledging this bearish formation as a possibility, Charting Guy believes it is unlikely to play out, describing the pattern as “irregular and ugly.” He maintains that XRP’s overall trend is still biased to the upside, characterized by higher highs and higher lows.“ A lot of people are posting this possible head and shoulders that targets $1.15. I personally don’t think it plays out, but it’s a possibility. If it does happen, it’s just a golden pocket backtest and the chart remains bullish overall,” he says. Charting Guy draws attention to the $1.70–$1.90 zone that has repeatedly caught wicks in previous pullbacks, with daily closes managing to reclaim $2 or above. He believes that a final corrective dip to fill the March 11 wick lows—potentially down to around $1.90—could mark the end of the current retracement. Additional support levels are located at the weekly Ichimoku base line at $1.94, the Weekly Supertrend at $1.73 and at the Weekly EMA Ribbon between $1.46 – $1.93. At press time, XRP traded at $2.14.

In a March 31 letter , the coalition of six UK digital economy trade bodies urged Starmer’s special adviser on business and investment, Varun Chandra, for a “greater strategic focus and alignment to deliver investment, growth and jobs” for the crypto industry. The group, which consisted of the UK Cryptoasset Business Council, Global Digital Finance, The Payments Association, Digital Currencies Governance Group, the Crypto Council for Innovation and techUK, noted the US policy shift on crypto under President Donald Trump and his appointment of a crypto czar . Britain’s commitment to an economic trade deal focused on technological cooperation with the US “presents a significant opportunity to mirror the United States’ ambition in fostering leadership in blockchain, digital assets, and other emerging financial technologies,” the letter stated. The group recommended that the UK appoint a blockchain special envoy, similar to the US, to coordinate policy, foster innovation, and position the country competitively in global markets. The trade bodies also called for the development of a dedicated government action plan for crypto and blockchain technology, including a concierge service to attract high-potential firms. They added that the government should acknowledge and leverage the commonalities between blockchain, quantum computing and artificial intelligence technologies , including potential applications for government services. Another recommendation was to create a high-level industry-government-regulator engagement forum to ensure informed decision-making and cross-sector collaboration.

Tom Griffiths, the co-founder and managing partner of crypto compliance advisory firm BitCompli, said in response to the letter on LinkedIn that the Financial Conduct Authority “has a lot of talent and a good sight of future plans, but the UK is definitely losing pace with Dubai, Singapore, and other EU jurisdictions.” “Now is the time for the FCA to act, or the UK will lose out on this huge opportunity, which is digital assets and all the benefits this sector can bring, not only now but over the next 20 years,” he added.

42784165,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=390226,1743566136,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/42784165.jpeg,zkLend Hacker Loses $5.4M to Tornado Cash Scam,https://cryptopotato.com/zklend-hacker-loses-5-4m-to-tornado-cash-scam/,"In an ironic twist of fate, the hacker behind February’s $9.57 million exploit on zkLend has allegedly fallen victim to another scam. The suspected criminal claimed in an on-chain message that they lost 2,930 ETH, worth about $5.4 million, while trying to launder the stolen funds through Tornado Cash. The zkLend Hack zkLend also confirmed the bizarre turn of events in a post on X, stating that the attacker had interacted with a known phishing website, tornadoeth[.]cash, as they attempted to cover their tracks from pursuers. The scam site is said to have been in operation for the last five years, and it immediately drained the thief’s entire balance of 2,930 ETH. In an on-chain message to zkLend, the attacker appeared crestfallen, saying: “Hello, I tried to move funds to Tornado but I used a phishing website and all the funds have been lost. I am devastated. I am terribly sorry for all the havoc and losses caused. All the 2,930 ETH have been taken by that site’s owners… Please redirect your efforts towards those site owners to see if you can recover some of the money.” The saga began in February, a couple of days before Valentine’s, when the Starknet-based lending protocol was hacked for more than $9.5 million. The exploiter, only identified by the address 0x64…9109, reportedly took advantage of a decimal precision vulnerability on zkLend to manipulate rounding errors in its lending accumulator and artificially inflate its balance. As a result, they made off with about 3,700 ETH, forcing the platform to pause withdrawals temporarily. Following the theft, zkLend attempted to negotiate with the perpetrator, offering them a white hat bounty of 10% of the stolen funds in exchange for the return of the remaining 3,300 ETH. However, the hacker stayed silent, moving the crypto assets through various channels, including 706 ETH valued at $1.8 million sent through Railgun. Legitimacy Concerns: A Staged Disappearance? Not everyone has bought the phishing story, though. Many within the crypto community have questioned the hacker’s claim, with the most prevalent theory being that they made up the tale to fake a loss and avoid further scrutiny from blockchain investigators and law enforcement. Given that zkLend has been actively tracking the stolen funds and working with on-chain security firms and the police, some have argued that this could be a ploy to make the funds disappear without a trace. Reactions on X quickly flooded in, with some people pointing out the suspicious timing of the announcement. One user, @pvt.eth, sarcastically noted , “Right about time for April Fool.” Others speculated that the phisher and the hacker could be the same person. Another theory is that the attacker might have transferred the stolen ETH to an alternate address, using the phishing story as a cover-up. @0xGekko was among those unconvinced, stating: “Meh, screams more like the hacker is trying to avoid any heat from a possible investigation.” Nonetheless, zkLend is treating the phishing loss as a legitimate event, noting that there isn’t conclusive evidence yet that the phishing website and the exploiter are connected.

Within just two days of its third keynote going live, the project brought in another $5 million, pushing its presale total beyond $210 million. This sudden rise wasn’t fueled by noise but by solid results that speak for themselves. With its Beta Testnet already running, over 1.2 million transactions completed, and more than 100 active community nodes worldwide, BlockDAG is already delivering value before its mainnet even launches. Now in Batch 27, BDAG coins are available at $0.0248, with over 19 billion already sold. This has created a rush from both large-scale and everyday buyers, as chances to enter at such prices may soon disappear once exchange listings go live. Keynote 3 Rolled Out Real Progress, Not Just Talks Rather than being a marketing push, the third keynote laid out strong technical milestones and strategic moves. It included several vital updates that show why BlockDAG is gaining traction among top Layer 1 projects: Beta Testnet officially launched and is actively handling millions of actions. Tools like a user-friendly block explorer, a Token/NFT creation wizard, and early access dApps are now functional. Full DeFi functionality confirmed—staking, swaps, lending, and bridges—all part of the release plan. Vision to onboard 1,000+ dApps by 2026. Exchange listings set for over 10 major platforms once the mainnet is live. The presentation’s clarity and confidence stood out. As CEO Antony Turner stated, “We’re not cutting corners. Our goal is to raise the bar for blockchain technology.” That message hit home across crypto circles—and the fast influx of capital shows many agree. Partnerships Add Strength to BlockDAG’s Ecosystem Alongside its tech advances, BlockDAG is making waves through meaningful global collaborations. With high-visibility partnerships such as Inter Milan and UFC, BDAG is gaining exposure to millions of people in sports and entertainment. Instead of relying on short-term influencers, the project is becoming part of key cultural spaces, building trust with a visible presence. Tools like the X1 Miner App , now with over 800,000 downloads, and the TG Tap Miner game, with more than 400,000 users, are drawing in new users before the mainnet is even live. BlockDAG is already being used and experienced, something rare at this stage. BDAG’s Route to $1 Is Backed by Real Data What sets BlockDAG’s current growth apart is how it steadily builds a case for BDAG reaching $1. With the current presale rate at $0.0248, there’s a potential 40x return if it hits the $1 mark after listing. And that possibility isn’t built on hope. BlockDAG now features: A working, active testnet Confirmed DeFi features Major exchange listings locked in Global hardware miner rollout 16,600+ ASIC miners sold A growing base of 170,000+ holders These indicators point to a network built with readiness from the start, not one trying to figure things out later. As Turner wrapped up the keynote confidently: “This is about more than our progress—it’s about where we’re going next.” Its massive crypto presale performance supports that vision. After pulling in $5 million in just two days, BlockDAG is rapidly moving toward its $600 million goal—a figure that looks achievable, not imaginary. BlockDAG isn’t another tech idea waiting to be noticed. It’s a complete working system gaining traction—backed by people, tools, and funding. For those delaying, the message is clear: later batches will arrive, but likely at a much higher price.

BlockDAG’s Potential Growth Sets the Stage for a Huge 2030 Target,https://thecoinrise.com/from-just-0-001-to-30-blockdags-potential-growth-sets-the-stage-for-a-huge-2030-target/,"BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining traction like few other cryptos in recent years. Since launching its presale under a year ago, it has already delivered a stunning 2,380% return for its earliest backers. Starting at just $0.001 in Batch 1, BDAG now trades at $0.0248 in Batch 27, and interest continues to snowball. Analysts are buzzing with projections: $1 by 2025, $20 in 2027, and a jaw-dropping $30 by the end of 2030. With 10 exchange listings lined up, a mainnet ready to go live, and an expanding use case network, BDAG is creating serious momentum. So far, BlockDAG has attracted over $210 million in presale investments and pulled in a crowd of more than 170,000 individual buyers. Its mix of rising adoption, strong liquidity, and growing whale attention is positioning it as one of the most talked-about altcoins of the year—and possibly the top-performing crypto for long-term gains. How BlockDAG Pulled in $210M and Handed Out 2,380% Returns It started small—just $0.001 in Batch 1. Now at $0.0248 in Batch 27, BlockDAG has moved fast, and the gains are hard to ignore. Early participants have already seen their investments multiply by over 23 times, and it’s not slowing down. So far, BlockDAG has sold over 19 billion BDAG coins and raised $210 million. That kind of number gets attention, and with more price jumps on the way, buyers aren’t hesitating to lock in before the next batch goes live. The current holder base has already passed 170,000, showing not only excitement but growing long-term support. That kind of user growth helps build staying power—and keeps the conversation going. There’s also been major whale activity. A recent $3.6 million buy-in suggests large players are eyeing the next breakout. Combined with strong community demand, this mix of small and big buyers is fueling speculation that BDAG could become one of the most profitable altcoins by 2030. BlockDAG Price Outlook: $30 Target by 2030? It’s not just hype—BlockDAG’s growth is supported by several clear factors. Analysts expect BDAG to hit $1 next year, fueled by three major drivers. First, the 10 centralized exchanges preparing to list the coin will introduce massive liquidity. Second, the launch of the mainnet will expand access and real usage. And third, ongoing adoption from both users and developers keeps adding fuel to the fire. By 2027, the platform is projected to be more mature, with deeper liquidity and a solid base of users. That’s why the $20 price forecast is gaining support. As more tools and partnerships come online, BDAG could become one of the most widely used altcoins. Looking ahead to 2030, many see $30 as more than just possible—it’s within reach. As real-world adoption of blockchain tech grows, BlockDAG could ride that wave across industries, helping its coin value rise in step. With continued updates and use cases, BDAG has the tools to hit its long-term price targets. Missed Early Entry? There’s Still Time to Get In Before the Next Jump Yes, the earliest buyers are already sitting on 2,380% returns. But even now, BDAG offers plenty of room for upside. At just $0.0248, it’s still early compared to where analysts expect it to head next. Each new batch brings a higher price, so the window to enter before bigger jumps is closing fast. Between the upcoming exchange launches, the mainnet release, and a wave of features being added, BlockDAG has the roadmap in place to push forward. If the coin hits $1 by 2025, anyone getting in now could be looking at a 40x return. And if it does reach the long-term goal of $30, the gains would be massive. That’s why more people are rushing in now—because the next price move could come sooner than expected. Final Word: Why BlockDAG Is the Top Crypto to Watch Right Now BlockDAG’s numbers speak for themselves—$210 million raised, 19 billion coins sold, and more than 170,000 holders already in. With a 2,380% gain already delivered and a path laid out to reach $30 by 2030, it’s no surprise this project is getting so much attention. The mix of strong growth, real milestones, and wide interest from both new buyers and seasoned whales is driving momentum at every step. For those still on the sidelines, the current price could be the lowest they’ll ever see again. Whether for short-term returns or long-haul potential, BlockDAG is now being viewed by many as the top crypto to buy right now —and the clock is ticking on how long that window will stay open.

The price is now consolidating and might face hurdles near the $2.120 level. XRP price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $2.20 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.120 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might extend losses if it fails to clear the $2.20 resistance zone. XRP Price Faces Rejection XRP price failed to continue higher above the $2.20 resistance zone and reacted to the downside, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below the $2.150 and $2.120 levels. The bears were able to push the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $2.023 swing low to the $2.199 high. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.120 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. However, the bulls are now active near the $2.10 support level. They are protecting the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $2.023 swing low to the $2.199 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.120 level and the trend line zone. The first major resistance is near the $2.150 level. The next resistance is $2.20. A clear move above the $2.20 resistance might send the price toward the $2.240 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.2650 resistance or even $2.2880 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.320. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.150 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.10 level. The next major support is near the $2.0650 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.0650 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.020 support. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone.

According to an Apr. 1 report from DL News, the global investment giant managing around $12 trillion in assets will now be able offer its new European Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded product in the UK. With this approval, BlackRock joins companies like Coinbase, PayPal, and Revolut as the 51st company to be registered with the FCA. Only 14% of applications have been approved by the FCA, demonstrating its selectiveness. According to the agency, a large number of applications were turned down because of missing or poor-quality information. The iShares Bitcoin ETP, marketed under the ticker IB1T, started trading last week on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam. It launched with a temporary fee waiver, lowering its expense ratio to 0.15% until the end of 2024. After that, the fee will rise to 0.25%, aligning with CoinShares ’ $1.3 billion physical Bitcoin ETP, the largest in Europe. You might also like: BlackRock expands money market fund BUIDL to Solana With each share backed by real Bitcoin that Coinbase holds in custody, the product gives investors direct exposure to Bitcoin. BlackRock’s action follows the success of its iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, which is listed in the United States. IBIT has amassed more than $48 billion in assets since its inception, as per data from VettaFi. IB1T uses a similar structure to give European investors a regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually holding the currency. The ETP is issued through a Swiss-based special-purpose vehicle to ensure compliance with European financial regulations. The entry of BlackRock into Europe indicates that demand for Bitcoin investment products is rising outside of North America. CEO Larry Fink recently warned that rising U.S. debt could weaken the dollar’s dominance and possibly strengthen Bitcoin’s case as a store of value. As reported by Crypto.news on Mar 31, Fink pointed out in his annual letter that investors may turn to Bitcoin as a safer option as a result of excessive government expenditure.

33767162,[object Object],1743570032,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin 4-Hour Heikin Ashi Chart Shows Oversold Levels, A Bounce On The Horizon",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-in-oversold-levels/,"Dogecoin is showing early signs of life after a weeklong downtrend, as new technical signals on the 4-hour Heikin Ashi chart suggest the meme coin may be pivoting toward recovery. The Dogecoin 4-hour candlestick Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is flashing oversold conditions and a falling wedge pattern forming at support, creating what might be a setup for a rebound upward. Price Decline Triggers RSI Drop To Oversold As Red Candles Pile Up Dogecoin’s price chart has been a sea of red over the last seven days on the 4-hour candlestick timeframe. Since March 27, the popular meme coin has consistently printed red Heikin Ashi candles, with a notable stretch producing as many as seventeen consecutive red closes. This trend came on the heels of a failed attempt by bulls to reclaim the $0.20 level, where Dogecoin briefly spiked before being overwhelmed by sell pressure. The price eventually descended toward the $0.1615 mark at the time crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade shared the analysis. As this happened, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart swiftly shifted from an overbought zone to deeply oversold, showing the magnitude of the downturn and the extent of bearish dominance during this period. Beyond the RSI’s dip into oversold conditions, the 4-hour Heikin Ashi chart has also revealed a falling wedge pattern developing right at a support zone . Falling wedges are seen as bullish reversal formations, especially when accompanied by oversold momentum indicators like the RSI. The confluence of these two signals suggests that there might be a bounce on the horizon for Dogecoin. Breakout From Falling Wedge As Green Candles Confirm Momentum Shift In a follow-up shared by the original analyst, Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin has begun to flash early signs of a breakout from its falling wedge structure. This shift in momentum is marked by the appearance of three successive green 4-hour Heikin Ashi candles, representing the clearest bullish pattern in this timeframe since the decline began. These developments indicate a possible uptrend continuation, with a short-term rebound now appearing more likely in April. The bounce signals couldn’t come at a more crucial time for Dogecoin, which just ended the most bearish first quarter it has seen in seven years. Notably, Dogecoin posted a steep 46% loss from January through March, which was its worst Q1 performance since 2018, when it plunged by an even deeper 68.8%. This historical context places added weight on the current price action, as it provides some sort of outlook as to how Dogecoin might trade for the rest of the week. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.17, up by 4.5% in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Falling Wedge Pattern|Heikin Ashi|relative strength index|RSI|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-02 05:00:32

Bitcoin Flows Reveal Key Market Shifts,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-binance-losing-its-grip-bitcoin-flows-reveal-key-market-shifts/,"After experiencing a bearish trend earlier in the week, Bitcoin (BTC) seems to have regained upward momentum. The asset started the day with a 2.1% rise. It is currently trading above the $84,000 mark, signaling a potential return to its previous price levels. Despite this positive movement, Bitcoin remains subject to fluctuating market conditions, influenced by external factors and internal metrics impacting its performance across different exchanges. Related Reading: Arthur Hayes Predicts $250,000 Bitcoin As Fed Caves To QE Pressure Shifting Trends in Bitcoin’s Exchange Flows As BTC continues to make strides above $84,000, an interesting trend has emerged in exchange flows signaling investor behavior. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant’s Joao Wedson provides a fascinating perspective on the current state of the Bitcoin market. According to Wedson, Bitcoin’s price action has been significantly impacted by lower selling pressure on certain exchanges, particularly Binance. In his report titled “Lower Selling Pressure: Binance and the BTC Flow Across Different Exchanges”, Wedson highlights that Short-Term Holders (STHs) are sending significantly fewer Bitcoin to Binance compared to other exchanges. The current amount of BTC being sent to Binance stands at 6,300 BTC, much lower than the average of 24,700 BTC transferred to other platforms. This suggests that many traders on Binance may be adopting a more neutral stance, potentially waiting for clearer signals before making further moves. On the other hand, Bitcoin inflows to other exchanges are increasing, indicating that investor behavior may vary based on the platform they use. Binance, despite having the highest trading volume, seems to be seeing less activity from short-term holders, whereas other exchanges are experiencing higher inflows. This shift could suggest that while Binance remains a trusted exchange, other platforms are beginning to see more action from BTC traders. Binance Dominates Spot Trading Volume In another analysis by CryptoQuant’s Maartunn, the focus shifted to spot trading volumes across various exchanges, with Binance taking the lead. In the year-to-date data for 2025, Binance has been the dominant player in spot trading volume, handling a cumulative total of $1.9 trillion. This is more than three times the volume of its closest competitor, Crypto.com, which stands at 12.12%. The dominance of Binance is significant, as higher trading volumes typically result in greater liquidity and tighter spreads, benefiting traders with better pricing and smoother entry and exit opportunities.

As a result, the trading volume for BNB Coin has shot up by 42% to more than $2.12 billion, as analysts are now closely watching for a BNB price rally to all-time highs. In BNB Price Ready for A Mega Rally? BNB Coin has performed relatively well over the past month compared to Bitcoin and other altcoins. While BTC and top altcoins like ETH, SOL, XRP saw double-digit losses in March, BNB Coin is down just 1% on the monthly chart. After a strong consolidation of around $610 levels, the BNB price could be eyeing a strong breakout to new all-time highs. BNB Burn and Pascal Hardfork Offer Support BNB Coin features a real-time burn mechanism that permanently removes a portion of gas fees from circulation. Over the past seven days, 951.85 BNB worth $571,747.74 was burned, contributing to a total burn value of nearly $160 million, as per data from BNBBurn . BNB’s price recently gained momentum following the implementation of the Pascal hard fork, which enhanced its compatibility with Ethereum. The network is preparing for additional hard forks this month and in June, aimed at further improving transaction speeds. Additionally, BNB Chain is gaining a lot of popularity among meme coins, adding support for Mubarak meme coin , CZ’s Dog BROCOLLI meme coin, and others. Looking at the technical setup, the BNB price chart shows that the altcoin is forming a cup-and-handle pattern, along with an ascending channel pattern formation, as shown in the image below. Source: TradingView On the other hand, BNB price is trading above the 50-day moving average, which is a positive indicator. But for the altcoin to kickstart a rally to its all-time high of $790, it must first complete the handle formation at $662, and give a breakout above that level. As of press time, BNB Coin is trading at $603 levels with its daily trading volume up by 42%, surging past $2.12 billion. Furthermore, the Coinglass data shows that the BNB options trading volume is also up by 46%. VanEck Files for Spot BNB ETF $115 billion asset manager VanEck filed for the spot BNB ETF in Delaware on Tuesday, April 1, which could serve as a major catalyst for the BNB Coin rally ahead. The proposed BNB ETF would follow the price of BNB, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Apart from BNB, VanEck has already submitted crypto ETF applications for Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and Avalanche.

Last week, the SEC officially dropped its appeal, and Ripple has agreed to pay a $50 million fine while also dropping its own cross-appeal. On top of that, the court’s injunction against Ripple has been lifted, which should’ve been great news. But here’s the twist—despite this huge win, XRP’s price didn’t skyrocket like many expected. In fact, it barely budged. That’s got XRP holders talking, and not in a good way. They’re heading to social media, demanding one thing: an official statement from the SEC confirming the case is really, truly over. “We want an announcement from the SEC just like they’ve done with other cases! ” has become the rallying cry of frustrated XRP fans. The SEC hasn’t said a word publicly since dropping the case, and that silence is driving people crazy. Some even wonder if the SEC is waiting for Paul Atkins to be confirmed as the new SEC Chair before making anything official. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse tried to calm things down during the Digital Assets Summit on March 19, 2025, saying the case’s dismissal is valid without an official SEC statement. But let’s be honest—when it comes to crypto, people love clear, official news. And right now, that’s missing. After the news broke, XRP’s price briefly jumped to $2.60, but it quickly settled back down. It’s like the market’s waiting for the SEC to give the green light before making any big moves. Until then, XRP holders will keep asking: “ Where’s the official statement?”",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 05:02:07

The price is now correcting gains and might struggle to stay above the $600 support. BNB price is attempting to recover above the $600 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $610 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $610 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $600 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Faces Resistance After forming a base above the $588 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $600 and $610 resistance levels. It even recovered above the $615 level before the bears appeared, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . A high was formed at $618 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $615 level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $587 swing low to the $618 high. There is also a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $610 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $610 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $610 level. The next resistance sits near the $612 level. A clear move above the $612 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $618. A close above the $620 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $626 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $635 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $610 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $600 level. The next major support is near the $598 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $587 swing low to the $618 high. The main support sits at $594. If there is a downside break below the $594 support, the price could drop toward the $585 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $565 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone.

Republican Jimmy Patronis won the vacant seat in Florida’s 1st Congressional District to replace Matt Gaetz, taking 57% of the vote to defeat Democrat Gay Valimont, according to AP News data. Randy Fine also took Florida’s 6th Congressional District with 56.7% of the vote to beat his Democratic rival, public school teacher Josh Weil, and fill a seat left vacant by Mike Waltz, who took a job as White House national security adviser. Florida’s 1st and 6th Congressional Districts — located in Florida’s western panhandle and along the state’s northeast coast — have been controlled by Republicans for roughly 30 years, but their lead has narrowed in recent years. Fairshake, a PAC backed by crypto industry giants including Coinbase, Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz, gave Fine around $1.16 million in advertising spending and funneled $347,000 to Patronis to support his campaign. Both Republicans have expressed support for the crypto industry, with Fine stating in a Jan. 14 X post that “Floridians want crypto innovation!” Source: Randy Fine Fairshake and its affiliates poured around $170 million into the 2024 US presidential and congressional elections to back candidates who committed to supporting the crypto industry. The wins by Patronis and Fine increased Republican representation in the House to 220 seats, with the Democrats holding 213 seats. There are two vacant seats to be filled after Texas and Arizona Democrats Sylvester Turner and Raúl Grijalva died on March 5 and March 13, respectively. Florida can expect to see a crypto-friendly regulatory environment The victories for Patronis and Fine likely mean that crypto legislation will continue to see support in the US capital. The Republican Party would have maintained its House majority even if it lost both seats in Florida, but it would have made it more difficult for some of the recently introduced Republican-backed crypto bills to pass through the House and Senate.

It appears set to resume positive action as the bulls show signs of interest. Last week saw BNB through another downturn after rejecting the $640 level during March’s recovery. This caused a small panic as it shed loss, and the price slipped to a low of $587 yesterday. Reacting well to the drops, the price was sharply rejected as a result of bullish interception, and the price increased above the key $600 level. Currently, the price is slightly up as it shows signs of strength while taking a breath. A push back above the mentioned key level could trigger a new leg up to $700 and even above. Although, the buying volume is not enough at the time of writing. Looking at the daily chart, BNB is still trading far well above the $500 level that stood as support during last month’s crash. If, by any chance, the bears resume pressure, we can expect more bleeding in the next few days. Right now, trading looks calm with a lot of conflicting signals. Should the buying volume increase, we can anticipate another major buy until the price recovers fully to the top. But for now, BNB’s demand is low as it trades flat on the daily chart. BNB Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The $587.3 level is currently providing support. If it fails to hold, the next support to consider for drops would be $566 and the $544 level. For bullish, BNB must reclaim the recently marked $640 resistance. A push above $648.5 should facilitate more recovery to $686, $700 and $732 in the next few weeks.

A breakdown from this support could fuel a major price crash. Following past months of reductions, XRP recorded substantial losses but has managed to stay well above $2 – a holding crucial support level. After bouncing off the support level last month, XRP recovered but later failed to push above the $2.6 level due to a rejection. This led to a drop and the price rolled back to the mentioned crucial support yesterday. Looking at the setup, the bears are technically back in action. Though it is uncertain if they will overcome the support level this time as several attempts to scale through it have proven abortive over the past months. However, if they successfully scale through the support, we can expect a major crash to a new multi-month low. Such a crash will validate the new bearish pattern forming on the daily chart. Failure to overcome this crucial support might result in another bounce, which could bring small gains before resuming bearish at full speed. But if XRP sustains such a bounce, it must reclaim $3.4 before considering a trend shift. XRP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Crossing down $2, the potential support levels for drops would be $1.77 and $1.53. Apart from $1.28, the $1 level is considered the next key support to watch for a dip. If the price bounces back above the immediate support level, it must retake the recently rejected $2.64 resistance level before we can consider a bullish move to the $2.99 and $3.4 resistance levels in the future.

Speaking in an interview with the Wolf of All Streets channel on YouTube, he stated that 99% of memecoins cannot be sustainable for the long term and are created solely for a select group to make money from. He clarified that memecoins experience phenomenal growth and then experience a decline in demand if not supported by a solid ecosystem. If change is not made, the user moves on, and value is known to vanish. “It’s why 99% of memecoins will fail,” he said. “They have to build community and real engagement. Otherwise, people move on.” Hoskinson also lambasted the token distribution of memecoins, asserting that self-serving insiders inflate the value of tokens, promoting the project only to sell them at a hefty profit later. This insider-focused model does not provide much incentive to build and sustain the project after its implementation. Capital drain poses risk to broader crypto adoption Hoskinson stated that memecoins have a negative impact on the rest of the cryptocurrency market since they consume liquidity without adding value through actual application use cases. He compared it to “moving water from one side of the bathtub to the other,” stating that much of the capital goes directly into the pockets of the founders and does not aid in expanding networks. “There’s a drain at the bottom of the tub. You’re not adding liquidity—you’re losing it over time,” he said, calling the phenomenon a net negative for the space. While he did not write off memecoins, he noted that sustainable value creation would come from Bitcoin DeFi, real-world asset digitalization, and algorithmic stablecoins, not just from viral tokens without a clear roadmap. Cathie Wood adds institutional perspective to memecoin risks Cathie Wood, the head of ARK Invest, also recently stated similar things in an interview with Bloomberg , stating most memecoins will be “worthless.” She attributed the phenomenon of meme-based cryptocurrencies to blockchain integration with AI, which makes it possible for almost everyone to launch thousands of tokens without any actual value. “Our funds are staying out of memecoins,” Wood confirmed, adding millions of these assets appear with no sight of utility. She urged investors to be careful, especially given global regulators’ refusal to categorize memecoins as securities. “If I have one message for those buying memecoins: buyer beware,” she said. Source: Dune Analytics According to Dune Analytics, memecoin use rose to a daily average of over 71,000 on January 23 and fluctuated before declining to reach roughly 9,000 as of April 1. Solana’s top memecoins’ market capitalization has declined to more than 85% from its yearly high of more than $81.83 billion. Tokens such as Official Trump (TRUMP), Bonk (BONK), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Pengu (PENGU) have been dropped significantly due to low investor confidence.

In an April 1 letter to New York federal court judge Edgardo Ramos, lawyers representing the SEC and Genesis requested a 60-day hold on the case and that all deadlines be pulled “to allow the parties to explore a potential resolution.” “In this case, the parties submit that it is in each of their interests to stay this matter while they consider a potential resolution and agree that no party or non-party would be prejudiced by a stay,” the letter states. The lawyers added that a stay was in the court’s interest as “a resolution would conserve judicial resources” and proposed that a joint status report be submitted within 60 days after the entry of the stay. The SEC sued Gemini and crypto lending firm Genesis Global Capital in January 2023, alleging they offered unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program. In March 2024, Genesis agreed to pay $21 million to settle charges related to the lending program, but the enforcement case against Gemini remains outstanding.

In February, Gemini said the SEC closed a separate investigation into the firm as the regulator winds back its crypto enforcement under President Donald Trump. “The SEC cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal bills alone and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation. Of course, Gemini is not alone,” Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss said at the time.

Circle, the issuer of stablecoin USDC, filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, while American Bitcoin Corp.—a mining venture backed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump—is exploring an IPO following a strategic merger with Hut 8. Circle Files for NYSE Public Listing Amid Rising Revenues, Shrinking Profits Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of the world’s second-largest stablecoin USDC, has officially filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company disclosed its intentions in a Form S-1 registration statement submitted on April 1, confirming that it plans to list its Class A common stock under the ticker symbol ”CRCL.” While Circle has not yet disclosed the number of shares it plans to offer or its initial IPO target price, the filing marks a significant milestone in the company's long-standing ambition to become a publicly traded entity. This move comes after two previously abandoned attempts — a failed Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger in 2021 and a confidential filing made in January 2024. The financial details revealed in the S-1 filing present a mixed picture of Circle’s performance over the past three years. In 2024, the company reported revenue of $1.67 billion, reflecting a solid 16% year-on-year increase. However, despite this growth in top-line income, net profits declined sharply. Circle financials (Source: SEC ) Circle posted a net income of $155.6 million for 2024, representing a substantial 41.8% drop compared to the previous year. The filing highlighted that while revenues grew, higher operational costs, particularly distribution payments to key partners, heavily impacted profitability. Notably, Circle paid a staggering $908 million last year to its primary distribution partner, Coinbase, for the circulation of USDC on its platform — a cost that has surpassed Circle’s own earnings from its stablecoin business. The financial disclosure also sheds light on Circle's operational strategy, revealing that over 99% of its revenue stems from its stablecoin reserve holdings. Circle generates most of its income by investing USDC reserves in short-term, yield-bearing US Treasury bills — a common practice among stablecoin issuers to monetize deposited funds while maintaining the liquidity needed for redemptions. In addition to its reserve-based income, Circle's filing revealed the company's exposure to major cryptocurrencies. The firm holds approximately $6.2 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC), $5.6 million in Sui (SUI), and $3.3 million in Ether (ETH). It also has smaller holdings in Sei (SEI), Aptos (APT), and Optimism (OP). While these digital asset holdings represent only a fraction of Circle's total balance sheet, they suggest an effort by the company to maintain a diversified crypto portfolio alongside its core stablecoin business. If successful, Circle's public listing will mark one of the first IPOs by a stablecoin issuer on a major US stock exchange, cementing the company's role as a cornerstone of the crypto-financial ecosystem. This move follows Circle’s recent regulatory milestone in Japan. On March 25, Circle became the first stablecoin issuer to receive regulatory approval in the country, enabling it to launch USDC trading on the SBI VC Trade exchange a day later. USDC is currently the second-largest stablecoin in the market, with a market capitalization of approximately $60.1 billion, according to CoinGecko . It trails only Tether ( USDT ), which maintains a dominant $143.9 billion market cap. Industry-Wide IPO Interest Circle’s IPO filing is part of a broader wave of crypto industry players eyeing public listings. Major firms including crypto exchange Kraken and blockchain infrastructure company BitGo are reportedly exploring plans to go public either later this year or in early 2026, signaling growing institutional interest and regulatory clarity in the digital asset space. While the timeline and valuation for Circle’s IPO remain unclear, the filing will undergo rigorous review by the SEC, which could take months. Investors, analysts, and the broader crypto community will closely watch how the SEC approaches Circle’s listing, especially amid an evolving regulatory landscape for stablecoins in the US. Trump-Backed Bitcoin Mining Firm Eyes IPO After Strategic Merger with Hut 8 In related news, American Bitcoin Corp., a cryptocurrency mining firm backed by members of the Trump family, is reportedly preparing for a public debut as part of a broader strategy to raise additional capital and expand its operations. According to an April 1 report by Bloomberg, the company is actively exploring an initial public offering (IPO) following its recent strategic merger with publicly listed Bitcoin mining company Hut 8. The news follows the March 31 announcement that Hut 8 has acquired a majority stake in American Bitcoin Corp., formerly known as American Data Centers. The Trump family’s involvement in the company is notable, with its founders including Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump — signaling a rare intersection between American political dynasties and the cryptocurrency mining sector. A New Bitcoin Mining Powerhouse As part of the acquisition, Hut 8 transferred its Bitcoin mining hardware and resources into American Bitcoin, creating a powerful mining entity with ambitions to dominate the US crypto mining landscape. While American Bitcoin will remain laser-focused on Bitcoin mining activities, Hut 8 is pivoting toward developing and operating high-performance data centers for artificial intelligence (AI) and other energy-intensive computing needs. Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8, described the transaction as a strategic evolution aimed at reducing capital costs and enhancing revenue predictability. “You can see this in the long term as two sister publicly traded companies — one that is energy, infrastructure, data centers, and the other one that’s Bitcoin mining, reserves, and AISCs [All-In Sustaining Costs]. Together, they form a vertically integrated company that has some of the best economics out there,” Genoot stated. This ambitious vertical integration strategy is designed to consolidate Bitcoin mining, infrastructure services, and high-performance computing into a single, streamlined ecosystem. According to Bloomberg, American Bitcoin Corp. is now considering an IPO as part of its broader capital-raising strategy. The timing and specifics of the public offering remain undisclosed, but sources familiar with the matter suggest that the company may pursue this move later this year or in early 2026, depending on market conditions and regulatory approvals. The Trump family’s involvement, along with the recent Hut 8 acquisition, positions American Bitcoin as a politically high-profile player in an industry facing increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny in the US. The company is also reportedly collaborating with Bitmain, the Chinese manufacturer of Bitcoin mining hardware. Bitmain’s involvement could spark further attention and regulatory interest, especially following US sanctions imposed on Sopghgo, Bitmain’s artificial intelligence affiliate. The formation of American Bitcoin Corp. and its IPO ambitions come at a time when the crypto mining industry is facing significant financial headwinds. The latest Bitcoin halving event in April 2024 slashed miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block, cutting directly into miners’ revenue streams. In response, many mining companies, including Hut 8, have begun pivoting to alternative business lines, such as data center infrastructure and AI-related computing services. This trend is seen as a defensive strategy to mitigate the impact of declining Bitcoin prices and reduced block rewards. According to a March report by Coin Metrics , miners are “diversifying into AI data-center hosting as a way to expand revenue and repurpose existing infrastructure for high-performance computing.” The report notes that this pivot could offer miners more predictable revenue streams compared to the volatile crypto market. JPMorgan’s recent analysis also highlighted the mounting financial pressure on Bitcoin miners in 2025, noting that declining cryptocurrency prices have compounded the challenges triggered by the latest halving event. Bitcoin’s price versus the network’s hashrate. (Source: JPMorgan) A Political Undertone American Bitcoin’s Trump family ties add a unique political dimension to its public listing plans. The Trumps' growing involvement in the crypto industry mirrors the broader trend of political figures and celebrities entering the digital asset space, often stirring debate about the implications of such high-profile endorsements. Given the increased regulatory focus on cryptocurrency mining's energy consumption and geopolitical associations, American Bitcoin’s potential IPO is expected to draw heightened scrutiny from regulators and environmental advocates alike. If American Bitcoin successfully completes its IPO, it will further cement the Trump family’s influence in the crypto world while reshaping the competitive landscape of Bitcoin mining in North America. The merged entity’s vertical integration strategy, combined with the diversification efforts of its parent company, Hut 8, suggests a new era of mining operations — one that combines traditional crypto mining with the rapidly growing demand for AI and data center services.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-02 05:30:00

Crypto analyst Nic Puckrin says it’s a 50-50 chance for a breakout or a drop, with possible BTC targets between $88,000 and $73,000. Bitcoin is trading below its 200-day average, and low volume suggests hesitation. Experts say tariffs may hurt Bitcoin short-term by slowing growth and raising inflation fears, but long-term, BTC could bounce back as stagflation limits further rate hikes. April 2, 2025 05:49:01 UTC Trump Tarrif News : Trump Eyes 20% Tariffs on Most Imports, $6 Trillion Revenue Target Raises Recession Fears President Trump is reportedly considering 20% tariffs on most imports, potentially generating $6 trillion annually, according to The Washington Post . While the proposal is still under review, Trump is set to begin rolling out reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday. Initially expected to be country- and product-specific, the broader plan signals a more aggressive trade stance. Economists warn that rising prices, low consumer sentiment, and ongoing inflation could push the U.S. economy into recession if the policy is implemented.

While global markets saw a rebound ahead of the news, uncertainty remains high. Trump’s plan includes a 25% tariff on imported cars and targets countries like India, the EU, and Japan. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is open to negotiation but firm on “fixing past wrongs.” EU leaders warned of retaliation, while analysts remain split on whether markets will rally or retreat. April 2, 2025 05:40:25 UTC When is Trump Announcing Tariffs? The world is tense as US President Donald Trump prepares to announce reciprocal tariffs today, April 2—dubbed “Liberation Day.” The tariffs will take immediate effect once revealed. Tensions escalated after the White House criticized India for its 100% tariff on US agricultural products and pointed out similar barriers in the EU, Japan, and Canada. With India in the spotlight, anticipation is rising globally over which countries will face the brunt of Trump’s latest move in his aggressive trade agenda. April 2, 2025 05:40:25 UTC Liberation Day Announcement Time President Donald Trump will officially announce new tariffs at 4 p.m. ET on April 2 during a Rose Garden event titled “Make America Wealthy Again.” According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, the tariffs will take effect immediately, with collections starting Thursday. This move is part of Trump’s broader trade strategy tied to his so-called “Liberation Day,” aiming to penalize countries with unfair trade practices and strengthen U.S. economic standing ahead of the 2024 election campaign.

He argued that other countries have been taking advantage of the U.S. and that the expected tariffs will only help the country earn back its wealth, calling it the country’s rebirth. He even tagged April 2, the announcement day for the tariffs, “liberation day.” A day before, Trump also stated that the tariffs would be imposed on “all countries,” hinting that the levies may extend to nations responsible for most of the country’s trade deficit.

A similar standard for data-backed tokens, called VRC-20, has now emerged. Vana, an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain that helps users monetize personal data by bundling it into DataDAOs for AI model training, introduced the new standard early this week to boost trust and transparency in the market for data-backed digital assets. ""For data markets to work, tokens must be reliable, secure, and useful. As a universal standard for data-backed tokens, VRC-20 delivers this by ensuring fair and transparent data token trading,"" Vana announced on X. The VRC-20 standard design includes specific criteria such as fixed supply, governance, and liquidity rules while ensuring real data access by tying tokens to actual data utility. Additionally, it promotes continuous liquidity through rewards that ensure market stability. ""This isn’t speculation. This is real financialization of data,"" Vana noted. Vana launched its mainnet in December, with VANA as its native cryptocurrency. Since then, the network has onboarded over 12 million data points through multiple DataDAOs, reflecting strong demand for user-owned data. DataDAOs or data liquidity pools are decentralized marketplaces that bring data onchain as transferable digital tokens. DLPs are where data is contributed, tokenized and made ready for use in applications such as AI model training. Monday's announcement replaced VANA emissions as DataDAO inventive with a new feature that calls for DAOs to issue VRC-20-compliant tokens to receive liquidity support. Additionally, the protocol introduced data validator staking , where VANA holders can lock their coins in data validators instead of individual DataDAOs. ""Rewards are based on network security and usage. Stakers earn proportionally to their contribution to network uptime and data availability. No more idle staking. Earnings are tied to real network utility and reliability,"" Vana said. The VANA token changed hands at $5.58 at press time, the lowest in over two weeks, extending the decline from the recent price high of $8.78 on Binance, according to data source TradingView.",Tech|Data|Blockchain|Technology,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 05:47:30

The offering was initially set to raise at least $1.3 billion, but purchasers opted for an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of notes, GameStop said in an April 1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""The company expects to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin in a manner consistent with the Company's Investment Policy,"" GameStop added. The convertible notes are debt that can later be converted into equity and are scheduled to mature on April 1, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The conversion rate for the notes will initially be 33 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, according to the filing. GameStop shares didn’t see a significant move following the close of the convertible debt offering. GME closed the April 1 trading day up 1.34% at $22.61 and only saw an extra 0.5% bump after the bell, Google Finance data shows . GameStop’s share price barely moved after sharing it closed the convertible debt offering. Source: Google Finance Positive shareholder sentiment saw the stock jump nearly 12% to $28.36 on March 26, the day after GameStop announced its Bitcoin ( BTC ) plan, but its fortunes reversed the next day, with GME shares dropping nearly 24% to $21.68. Analysts at the time suggested the chilly reception reflected shareholders' fear of GameStop's deeper problems with its business model. GameStop joins growing Bitcoin move On March 25, GameStop confirmed that it had received board approval to invest in Bitcoin and US-dollar-pegged stablecoins using the notes and its cash reserves. Those reserves stood at $4.77 billion as of Feb. 1, compared with $921.7 million a year earlier, according to its 2024 fourth-quarter financial statements. GameStop is a relative latecomer among public companies creating Bitcoin treasuries. A slew of others have already added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in a playbook popularized by Micheal Saylor’s Strategy .

It noted, “To bridge traditional finance and Web3, we’ve brought together seasoned leaders from banking, fintech, and digital assets. Their strategic guidance ensures Vaulta stays compliant, credible, and ready for mass adoption.” At the same time, it added that Vaulta will bring Web3 to portfolio investment including real estate and commodities through Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization. These developments around Vaulta are driving a massive rally for EOS price despite a broader crypto market crash . EOS Technical Analysis After Bullish Breakout The gradual uptrend recorded by EOS price in the last seven days and the uptick in buying activity have triggered a bullish breakout from a descending parallel channel. This breakout suggests that the trend has flipped from bearish to bullish. The RSI indicates that the EOS price rally is due to a surge in buying activity. This indicator stands at 77, a sign that EOS is about to be overbought, which could cause a short-term reversal before the trend continues. However, the ADX line is rising, which shows that the bullish momentum is getting strong. These bullish signals show there is room for more upside for the EOS price, which could see it reach the 227.2% Fibonacci level of $1.05. EOS/USDT: 1-day Chart Funding Rate HeatMap Shows Extreme Short Positioning The funding rate heatmap from Coinglass shows extreme short positioning on the EOS token. At press time, EOS had a funding rate of -277%, indicating that short sellers are willing to pay a higher funding fee to maintain their positions. This suggests traders do not anticipate EOS to sustain the momentum, and they expect the price to reverse as traders sell to book profits. Fundibg Rate Heatmap However, despite the increased number of short sellers, the Vaulta banking feature, bullish predictions from other analysts, and the surge in buying activity depicted on the 1-day chart suggest that it is possible for the altcoin to extend its gains, and possibly reach $1.

The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic beast, constantly shifting between different phases. Right now, the spotlight is firmly on Bitcoin, and the Altcoin Season Index is flashing a clear signal: we’re in Bitcoin Season. Let’s dive into what this means for you and your crypto portfolio. Unveiling the Altcoin Season Index: What Is It? The Altcoin Season Index, a fascinating metric from CoinMarketCap (CMC), acts as a compass for navigating the ever-changing tides of the crypto market. Think of it as a gauge that tells you whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. On April 2nd, at 00:33 UTC, this index registered a value of 14. This number, down a point from the previous day, isn’t just a random figure; it’s a crucial indicator that the market is currently experiencing a strong Bitcoin Season. How Does the Altcoin Season Index Work? To truly understand what a score of 14 signifies, let’s break down how the Altcoin Season Index actually works: Scope: The index meticulously tracks the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap. However, it intelligently excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC), focusing on genuine altcoin performance. Timeframe: It analyzes the price performance of these top 100 coins over the past 90 days, providing a medium-term perspective on market trends. The Benchmark: Bitcoin (BTC) is the benchmark. The index compares the performance of each of the top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin’s performance during this 90-day period. Defining Altcoin Season: For the market to be declared in ‘Altcoin Season’, a significant majority – at least 75% – of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. This signifies broad-based altcoin strength. Defining Bitcoin Season: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared when only 25% or fewer of these top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin. This indicates Bitcoin’s dominance and relative strength compared to altcoins. Index Score Range: The Altcoin Season Index score ranges from 1 to 100. A higher score indicates a stronger Altcoin Season, while a lower score, like the current 14, points towards a dominant Bitcoin Season. Bitcoin Season in Full Swing: What Does an Index of 14 Mean? With the Altcoin Season Index at a low of 14, the message is clear: Bitcoin dominance is currently the defining characteristic of the crypto market. This low score powerfully indicates that a vast majority of altcoins are not keeping pace with Bitcoin’s price appreciation over the last 90 days. In fact, fewer than 25% of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform the original cryptocurrency during this period. Why Does Bitcoin Dominance Matter? Understanding Bitcoin dominance and the shift between Bitcoin and Altcoin Seasons is crucial for several reasons: Portfolio Strategy: Knowing whether we are in a Bitcoin or Altcoin Season can significantly influence your investment strategy. In a Bitcoin Season, focusing on BTC or BTC-related assets might be more prudent. During an Altcoin Season, diversifying into select altcoins could potentially yield higher returns. Risk Management: Altcoins are generally considered riskier than Bitcoin. In a Bitcoin Season, altcoins might experience more significant drawdowns if Bitcoin corrects. Understanding the market phase helps in better risk management. Identifying Opportunities: Even within a Bitcoin Season, select altcoins might still perform well due to specific catalysts. However, a Bitcoin Season generally favors Bitcoin and signals caution when allocating heavily to altcoins. Conversely, an Altcoin Season can present lucrative opportunities in carefully chosen altcoins. Market Sentiment: The Altcoin Season Index reflects broader market sentiment. A strong Bitcoin Season can indicate a flight to safety or a renewed focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. An Altcoin Season often reflects a higher risk appetite and exuberance in the market. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season: Actionable Insights So, what should you do when the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season? Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio Allocation: Consider adjusting your portfolio to potentially increase your Bitcoin holdings, especially if you were heavily invested in altcoins. This doesn’t necessarily mean selling all your altcoins, but perhaps rebalancing to reflect the current market phase. Focus on Bitcoin Fundamentals: Bitcoin Season often brings renewed attention to Bitcoin’s core value propositions: store of value, decentralization, and scarcity. Research and understand these fundamentals to reinforce your investment thesis. Selective Altcoin Approach: While it’s Bitcoin Season, it doesn’t mean all altcoins are doomed. Look for altcoins with strong fundamentals, unique use cases, and active development. However, be more selective and cautious in your altcoin investments during this phase. Monitor the Index: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index. A sustained increase in the index could signal a potential shift towards Altcoin Season. Use it as one of many tools to gauge market trends. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin: Bitcoin Season can be an opportune time to DCA into Bitcoin, gradually accumulating more BTC over time, especially if you believe in its long-term potential. Are There Any Benefits to Bitcoin Season? While altcoin enthusiasts might prefer Altcoin Season, Bitcoin Season also offers certain benefits to the broader crypto ecosystem: Market Consolidation: Bitcoin Season can lead to a period of market consolidation, where speculative excesses are reduced, and focus shifts back to fundamental value. Attracting New Investors: Bitcoin’s relative stability and established brand can attract new investors to the crypto space, who might be hesitant to dive directly into the more volatile altcoin market. Strengthening Bitcoin’s Narrative: Bitcoin Season reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as the leading cryptocurrency and a store of value, which is crucial for its long-term adoption. Potential for Future Altcoin Season: Historically, Bitcoin Seasons have often been followed by Altcoin Seasons. Bitcoin’s growth can eventually pave the way for renewed interest and investment in altcoins as investors seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. Challenges of Bitcoin Season for Altcoin Holders Of course, Bitcoin Season also presents challenges, particularly for those heavily invested in altcoins: Altcoin Underperformance: The most direct challenge is the underperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin. This can lead to portfolio stagnation or even losses in USD terms if Bitcoin is rising while altcoins are not. Capital Rotation to Bitcoin: Bitcoin Season often sees capital rotating from altcoins back into Bitcoin, further altcoin prices. Sentiment Shift Away from Altcoins: Market sentiment can shift away from altcoins during Bitcoin Season, making it harder for altcoin projects to gain traction and attract new investment. Potential for Altcoin Correction: If Bitcoin experiences a correction after a period of dominance, altcoins, already weakened, could potentially face even steeper corrections. Conclusion: Riding the Bitcoin Wave The Altcoin Season Index at 14 is a clear indicator: we are currently navigating a Bitcoin Season. This doesn’t mean the end of altcoins, but it does signal a shift in market dynamics. Understanding this shift, adjusting your strategy accordingly, and staying informed are key to successfully navigating the crypto market’s ever-changing seasons. By recognizing Bitcoin’s current dominance and appreciating the cyclical nature of the crypto market, you can position yourself to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks, whether it’s Bitcoin Season or the altcoin surge that may follow.

Recent whale metrics indicated that large-scale investors bought roughly $8 million of the token, whereas a crypto exchange behemoth also listed it previously. In an upshot, traders and investors are eyeing more gains in the asset’s price due to recent advancements that underscore rising demand for the crypto. PENDLE Price Jumps 8% Amid Bullish Whale Transactions As of press time, PENDLE price witnessed an 8% uptick in value and exchanged hands at $3.05. The crypto’s 24-hour low and high were registered as $2.84 and $3.07, respectively. On a keynote, the rising price action aligns with the heightened buying pressure bought by whales in recent days. The latest data from tracker Lookonchain showed that whales bought roughly $8 million worth of coins in the past 5 days. Per the data, five newly created wallets collectively accumulated the aforementioned amount. Here Are The PENDLE Whale Addresses Captured: -0x21fBA58b20f62397c015b1f5a15f742ad430dFA -0x2EB48c60F4ea75fa0a0Ff5BB017EBD9f5981b8F5 -0x11DFEDf01B3FA824BbCB138159B2e6AFE43692a3 -0x981D8856f572Fb076626265114EAD67697dA5501 -0x6478C8681ADC3E7a0C17Aa1E1F0Ff16d1A61a8f6 Why Are Whales Accumulating? Meanwhile, the rising whale accumulations and PENDLE price upswing fall in line with another bullish development. Crypto exchange behemoth Coinbase unveiled a listing for the token at the end of March last month. As a result, large-scale investors are hoarding massive amounts of the token, aiming to capitalize on emerging market opportunities. Historically, listings on top crypto exchanges usually usher a bullish price action as they substantially increase an asset’s market exposure, thereby welcoming more funds from investors. CoinGape previously reported another similar chronicle, wherein cryptos BROCCOLI and TUT price rallied with their listings on Binance . Similarly, the Coinbase listing appears to be a vital catalyst for driving the whale frenzy and recent price upswing. Can Bullish Developments Fuel Bull Run Ahead? Usual market sentiments continue to tilt in favor of bulls, given the Coinbase listing and rising whale accumulations. Further, a renowned crypto market trader has poured additional optimism surrounding the coin’s future price action with his bullish prediction. Analyst AMCrypto recently took to X, revealing that PENDLE price is forming an “inverse head and shoulder pattern.” This pattern formation suggests that a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish is brewing amid bullish advancements. Source: AMCrypto, X In light of this dynamic, the analyst predicts that a break above $3 paves the way for a massive rally ahead. As mentioned above, the coin is currently trading above this price level. As a result, market watchers continue to weigh further bullishness on the asset’s long-term price prospects.

Here’s What You Need to Know!,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/will-solana-ever-reach-150-as-bearish-clouds-hover-over-sol-price-rally-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"The post Will Solana Ever Reach $150 as Bearish Clouds Hover Over SOL Price Rally? Here’s What You Need to Know! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The start of the second quarter is bullish for the Solana (SOL) price as the levels surpass $125 after a tight consolidation. Although SOL-based tokens are gaining momentum, the value of the native token remains unaffected. Does this suggest the market participants have shifted their focus away from the token? Will the SOL price continue to remain consolidated below $130? The SOL price is speculated to be under bearish influence, with a high risk of falling back to $100 in the coming days. The main reason behind the bearish narrative is the formation of a bearish flag in the daily chart. A breakdown from the pattern usually results in a massive pullback, but in the wider perspective, the bulls are trying hard to invalidate the pattern. The Solana price is displaying some hidden bullish divergence, which suggests a huge breakout is following after a tight consolidation for a while. As seen in the above chart, the SOL price is stuck within a bearish pennant, but the bearish activity began much before the validation of the pattern. The Ichimoku cloud has already undergone a bearish crossover before the end of Q1 that compelled the price to begin the monthly trade on a bearish note. However, the Bollinger Bands are trading parallel to each other, suggesting a drop in volatility. Meanwhile, the technicals remain indecisive as the RSI has displayed a bearish divergence while the CMF is trying to trigger a bullish divergence. This suggests the strength of the rally is weakening, but the bulls are gaining strength compared to the bears with a rise in the buying pressure. Therefore, the Solana (SOL) price is stuck within a determined range and displays a huge possibility of pullback. However, the bulls have been defending the support at $123 since March 2024, and hence, a rebound could be on the horizon. However, if the rise in the volatility negatively impacts the crypto markets due to the announcement of new tariffs by US President Trump, a breakdown may drag the SOL price to $115 or $110. Only a major sell-off or a FUD may drag the levels below $100; until then, the probability of revising a rise to $150 remains imminent.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 06:12:22

The White House confirmed that reciprocal tariffs on nations imposing duties on US goods would take effect immediately, after Trump unveils them, raising concerns over an escalating global trade war. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.27% to around 35,520, while the broader Topix Index dropped 0.9% to 2,637 on Wednesday. The Japanese yen steady at around 149.8 per dollar on Wednesday, remaining sideways for the week. Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda warned that the new US tariffs could significantly affect global trade and economic growth. Analysts suggest the economic fallout could influence the BoJ's decision on interest rates, with a hike anticipated in Q3 of 2025, likely in July. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.07% to around 3,360 on Wednesday, building on the previous session’s gains as investors awaited clarity on US President Donald Trump’s upcoming tariffs, and the offshore yuan fell to around 7.27 per dollar on Tuesday, as the looming implementation of President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs overshadowed positive manufacturing PMI data. China has launched its inaugural green sovereign bond sale, aiming to raise up to 6 billion yuan ($826 million) , while also securing a London listing. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.28% to 23,161 in early deals on Wednesday, reversing a modest gain in the previous session amid losses in most sectors. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.62% to 76,394 in Wednesday morning deals, supported by gains from realty, auto, consumer goods, and private banks. Meanwhile, final data from a private survey showed that the manufacturing sector in India grew the most in eight months during March. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.12% to close at 7,935 on Wednesday, building on the previous session’s gains. The Australian dollar strengthened to around $0.63 on Wednesday, marking its second consecutive session of gains. Elsewhere, fresh data showed that Australian industrial activity contracted further in March, weighed down by uncertainties surrounding US tariffs and domestic politics. The seasonally adjusted estimate for total dwellings approved in Australia fell by 0.3% month-on-month to 16,606 units in February 2025, less than the expected 1.4% decline. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that his country will ""stand up for national interests"" in response to President Trump's recent plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on all U.S. trade partners. He confirmed Australia will not impose retaliatory tariffs, noting the U.S. accounts for less than 5% of Australia's goods exports. He emphasized that strengthening trade ties with Asian markets will provide crucial support to Australian businesses. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended mixed as investors awaited clarity from President Trump regarding his upcoming tariff policy. Meanwhile, recent U.S. economic releases showed weak jobs data and a poor manufacturing report. Investors are now focused on Friday's nonfarm payroll report for more insights into the Fed's rate path.

The crypto market mood ring, also known as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, is showing a notable shift. We’ve seen a significant jump, suggesting that the pervasive fear gripping the market might be starting to loosen its hold. Let’s dive into what this means for you and your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index First things first, what exactly is this “Crypto Fear and Greed Index” everyone’s talking about? Think of it as a barometer for the overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. It’s calculated daily by Alternative.me, a software development platform, and it essentially tells us whether the market is leaning towards excessive fear or exuberant greed. This index is crucial because market sentiment is a powerful force that can significantly influence crypto prices. Here’s the lowdown on how it works: Scale: The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100. 0 – Extreme Fear: When the index dips towards 0, it indicates extreme fear in the market. This often happens during price crashes and periods of uncertainty. 100 – Extreme Greed: Conversely, a reading closer to 100 signals extreme greed. This typically occurs during bull runs when prices are soaring, and everyone is jumping on the bandwagon. Current Reading: As of April 2nd, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 44. Recent Change: This is a positive jump of 10 points from the previous day’s reading. Zone: Despite this improvement, the index is still in the “Fear” zone (typically ranges from 0-49). Analyzing the Improved Crypto Sentiment A 10-point increase in a single day is nothing to scoff at! This jump in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index clearly reflects an improved crypto sentiment within the market. But what does this really mean for you as an investor or someone keeping an eye on the crypto space? Here’s a breakdown of the potential implications: Reduced Panic Selling: A move away from extreme fear often suggests that panic selling might be subsiding. Investors are potentially becoming less reactive to short-term price fluctuations. Increased Buying Interest: As fear diminishes, some investors might see it as an opportunity to “buy the dip.” This increased buying pressure can contribute to price stabilization or even upward movement. Shifting Market Psychology: Overall, an improved sentiment indicates a shift in market psychology. It suggests a move away from a purely bearish outlook towards a more neutral or even cautiously optimistic perspective. Not Out of the Woods Yet: Crucially, even with this positive shift, the index remains in the “Fear” zone. This reminds us that while sentiment is improving, significant caution is still warranted. We are not in “Greed” territory yet, indicating the market is still fragile. Decoding the Market Sentiment Shift: What’s Driving the Change? So, what’s behind this shift in market sentiment ? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just pulled out of thin air. It’s calculated using a blend of six different market factors. Understanding these components can give us clues about what’s influencing the current sentiment change. Here’s a look at the factors and their weights: Factor Weight What it Measures Volatility 25% Current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the corresponding average values of the last 30 and 90 days. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Current market momentum and volume compared to the last 30 and 90-day averages. Social Media 15% Sentiment analysis from social media platforms, primarily focusing on crypto-related hashtags and engagement rates. Surveys 15% Weekly crypto surveys (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance 10% The dominance of Bitcoin compared to the total crypto market cap. A rising dominance can sometimes indicate a risk-off sentiment. Google Trends 10% Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries, reflecting general public interest in Bitcoin and potentially the broader crypto market. To understand the recent 10-point jump, we need to consider which of these factors might have contributed most significantly. For instance, has volatility decreased? Has market momentum picked up? Is social media sentiment turning more positive? Analyzing these underlying components offers a deeper understanding of the sentiment shift. The Role of Bitcoin Sentiment in the Index It’s important to note that Bitcoin sentiment plays a significant role in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Bitcoin, as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often acts as a bellwether for the entire crypto market. Its price movements and sentiment surrounding it tend to heavily influence the overall market mood. The index explicitly includes “Bitcoin Dominance” as a factor, recognizing Bitcoin’s central position. Furthermore, many of the other factors, such as volatility and Google Trends, are heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance and public perception. Therefore, shifts in Bitcoin’s price and news surrounding it are likely to be major drivers of changes in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Understanding Each Fear and Greed Index Component in Detail Let’s delve a bit deeper into each component of the Fear and Greed Index to truly grasp what they signify: Volatility (25%): High volatility is often associated with fear. When prices swing wildly, it creates uncertainty and anxiety among investors. The index measures current volatility against historical averages to gauge if volatility is unusually high, contributing to fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Strong market momentum and high trading volume usually indicate greed. When prices are rising steadily and lots of people are buying, it signals bullishness and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Conversely, weak momentum and low volume can point to fear and disinterest. Social Media (15%): Social media sentiment provides a real-time pulse on public opinion. Analyzing keywords, hashtags, and engagement related to crypto helps gauge whether the online conversation is leaning towards positive (greed) or negative (fear) sentiment. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, weekly surveys directly gauged investor sentiment. These provided a more direct measure of fear and greed by asking participants about their market outlook. (If surveys resume, they will again be a valuable component.) Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin dominance can be a complex indicator. During periods of fear, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived “safer” crypto asset, increasing its dominance. Conversely, in greedy phases, investors may be more willing to venture into altcoins, reducing Bitcoin dominance. Google Trends (10%): Google Trends data reveals the level of public interest in Bitcoin and crypto. High search volumes often correlate with greed and market tops, while low search volumes can indicate fear and potential market bottoms. Actionable Insights and Moving Forward The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, but it shouldn’t be used in isolation. Here are some actionable insights: Confirmation Tool: Use the index as a confirmation tool alongside other technical and fundamental analysis. Don’t base trading decisions solely on the index. Contrarian Indicator: Some investors use it as a contrarian indicator. Extreme fear might be seen as a buying opportunity, while extreme greed could signal an impending correction. However, this is a high-risk strategy. Monitor Trends: Pay attention to the trend of the index. Is it consistently rising, falling, or stagnating? These trends can provide more meaningful insights than a single day’s reading. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the factors that drive the index. Understanding what’s influencing volatility, momentum, and social sentiment can give you a better grasp of market dynamics. Conclusion: Cautious Optimism in the Crypto Air The recent 10-point jump in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 44 is undoubtedly a positive sign. It suggests that the grip of extreme fear on the crypto market is loosening, and a more balanced, albeit still fearful, sentiment is emerging. While this improvement offers a glimmer of hope , it’s crucial to remember that the index remains in the “Fear” zone. The crypto market is still navigating uncertain waters, and caution remains the watchword. However, this shift in sentiment is a development worth watching closely, as it could be the early signal of a more sustained recovery in market confidence.

In a new interview with independent journalist David Lin, Scaramucci says Bitcoin’s performance in the coming months will largely depend on President Trump’s trade war rhetoric. According to Scaramucci, he sees BTC soaring to new all-time highs if Trump dials down on tariff threats. But he notes that the Bitcoin bull market could end with a whimper if Trump decides to double down. “Bitcoin is being held back right now by the macro dilemma that we’re facing. I think people were expecting that President Trump would be pro-business and he’d be pro-growth for the stock market. I don’t think they were anticipating these starts and stops with the tariffs and this level of uncertainty. If it gets calmer and it looks more like the 2017, 2021 Trump term, Bitcoin will get to $200,000 this year. If you’re telling me we’re going to be in a protracted trade war and we’re going to be fighting with our European and Western allies, Bitcoin will probably hover near here, maybe get back to $100,000. But it is going to be very hard for Bitcoin to ascend to where I think it could go if we’re just in a more normal environment – normal being [the] proper intersection between government and finance.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $85,338, up over 3% in the past day.

Caraco, the CEO of ERA Queensland in Australia, expressed frustration over claims that XRP could surge to “$1,000 to $10,000 overnight.” In a post on X, he argued that such hype-driven narratives deceive new investors and set unrealistic expectations. According to Caraco, XRP’s current trading range of $2 to $2.50 reflects a more grounded outlook, with any substantial increase likely coming from institutional adoption and gradual market growth rather than sudden parabolic moves. 1000% Agree I have been a CEO of an Australian Stock Market Company and it’s sad to see incoming XRP Buyers been sold the story of $1000 to $10,000 and it’s parabolic and going to happen tommorow or next week.

The influencer pointed out that hype-filled statements no longer resonate with the community as people grow weary of baseless predictions. Emphasizing the importance of truth and transparency, All Things XRP urged community leaders to focus on fact-based insights instead of chasing attention with unrealistic claims. He called out those who predict $1,00 next month or $10,000 overnight . The post highlighted how the community looks for responsible leadership rather than sensationalism. Caraco echoed this sentiment, cautioning that treating the crypto market like the stock market is misleading. While many analysts have predicted rapid growth to targets as high as $10,000 , Caraco argued that crypto assets are inherently volatile, making precise predictions unreliable. Instead, he believes gradual progress driven by institutional interest and market maturity is more realistic. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Role of Regulation and Credible Insights Caraco also stressed the importance of regulation in fostering a more stable market environment. He noted that as legislation becomes clearer, cryptocurrencies lacking liquidity or substantial backing could face sanctions, helping curb misleading narratives. Caraco remains optimistic about XRP’s long-term potential. However, he firmly rejects the notion of sudden, astronomical price increases. In contrast to the hype-driven content, Caraco praised credible influencers like All Things XRP, Jake Claver, Max Avery, and Zach Rector. While these influencers are optimistic about the digital asset’s future , they provide well-researched and balanced analyses of XRP. Caraco criticized “clickbait marketing” that promotes sensational price targets, emphasizing that educated and grounded insights are essential for building community trust. His remarks serve as a reminder that sustainable growth requires a focus on facts and informed perspectives rather than speculative hype.

Circle, the powerhouse behind the USDC stablecoin, has just made a significant move. News broke via Unfolded on X and further reported by Fortune that Circle has confidentially filed for an Initial Public Offering (IPO). This cryptocurrency IPO could be a game-changer, signaling a new level of maturity and mainstream acceptance for the digital asset space. Let’s dive into what this could mean for you and the future of crypto. Why is the Circle IPO a Big Deal for Digital Assets? Circle’s move to go public is not just another company listing; it’s a potential watershed moment for the entire digital assets ecosystem. Here’s why this IPO is generating so much buzz: Validation of the Crypto Industry: A successful IPO from a major player like Circle lends significant legitimacy to the cryptocurrency industry. It signals to traditional investors and institutions that crypto is not just a fleeting trend but a serious asset class. Increased Transparency and Regulation: Public companies face stricter regulatory scrutiny and reporting requirements. Circle’s IPO could pave the way for greater transparency and accountability within the stablecoin sector, potentially easing regulatory concerns and fostering wider adoption. Capital Infusion for Growth and Innovation: An IPO can provide Circle with a substantial capital injection. This fresh capital could fuel further innovation in their product offerings, expand their global reach, and solidify USDC’s position in the competitive stablecoin market. Boost for USDC Adoption: A publicly traded Circle could enhance trust and confidence in USDC. Investors might see this as a sign of stability and reliability, potentially driving increased adoption and usage of USDC across various crypto platforms and applications. Circle’s USDC: A Stablecoin Giant in the Making For those new to the crypto space, understanding USDC’s role is crucial. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Think of it as a digital dollar designed for the internet age. Here’s a quick rundown of why USDC has become so prominent: Feature Description Pegged to USD Each USDC is designed to be redeemable 1:1 for US dollars, providing price stability. Transparency Circle publishes regular attestations to verify that USDC reserves are fully backed by cash and cash equivalents. Regulatory Compliance Circle is committed to regulatory compliance and works with established financial institutions. Wide Adoption USDC is supported on numerous cryptocurrency exchanges, DeFi platforms, and payment systems. USDC has become a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and is increasingly used for payments, remittances, and as a safe haven asset within the volatile crypto market. Its stability and reliability are key factors in its growing popularity. What Does a Circle IPO Mean for the Future of Stablecoins? Circle’s IPO aspirations could set a precedent for other stablecoin issuers. It signals a potential shift towards greater institutional involvement and regulatory alignment within the stablecoin sector. Here are some potential implications: More Stablecoin IPOs? Circle’s move might encourage other major stablecoin issuers to consider going public, further legitimizing the asset class and attracting institutional capital. Enhanced Regulatory Clarity: As a public company, Circle will operate under increased regulatory scrutiny. This could contribute to the development of clearer regulatory frameworks for stablecoins globally. Innovation in Stablecoin Use Cases: With more capital and public visibility, Circle could drive innovation in how stablecoins are used, potentially expanding their applications beyond the crypto realm into traditional finance. Competition and Market Dynamics: A public Circle will likely intensify competition in the stablecoin market, pushing other players to innovate and improve their offerings. Navigating the Road to IPO: Challenges and Opportunities for Circle While the IPO filing is a significant milestone, Circle still faces several hurdles on its journey to becoming a publicly traded company. Let’s consider some challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins is still evolving and varies significantly across jurisdictions. Navigating these complexities will be crucial for Circle. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Market fluctuations could impact investor sentiment and Circle’s IPO valuation. Competition: The stablecoin market is competitive, with players like Tether (USDT) holding a dominant market share. Circle needs to continue to differentiate itself and maintain its competitive edge. Maintaining Trust and Transparency: As a public company, maintaining the trust and transparency that has been crucial to USDC’s success will be paramount. Opportunities: Growth Capital: The IPO will provide significant capital for expansion, product development, and strategic acquisitions. Brand Building: Going public will enhance Circle’s brand visibility and credibility, attracting new users, partners, and institutional investors. Strategic Partnerships: Public status can facilitate strategic partnerships with traditional financial institutions and corporations. Global Expansion: The IPO can support Circle’s ambitions for global expansion, bringing USDC to new markets and user bases. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, take away from this news? Here are some actionable insights: Keep an Eye on Regulatory Developments: Circle’s IPO journey will likely be closely watched by regulators. Pay attention to any regulatory updates related to stablecoins and crypto IPOs. Monitor USDC’s Market Position: Observe how USDC’s market share and adoption evolve in the lead-up to and after the IPO. Consider Potential Investment Opportunities: While direct investment in Circle might not be immediately available, the IPO could create broader investment opportunities in the crypto space. Understand the Broader Market Impact: Circle’s IPO could be a bellwether for the crypto market. Its success or challenges could influence the trajectory of other crypto companies considering going public. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Circle and the Crypto Industry Circle’s confidential filing for an IPO marks a potentially explosive and transformative moment for the company and the wider cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the growing maturity of the digital asset space and signals a potential wave of institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. As Circle navigates the IPO process, the crypto world will be watching closely, eager to see how this landmark event unfolds and shapes the future of finance.

While investors hoped that regulatory reforms and the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve would boost prices, instead, Bitcoin has fallen from over $100,000 at the start of the year to the mid-$80,000s for most of March. With the markets bracing up for Trump’s reciprocal tariffs , it’s remains uncertain how BTC will react in the long run. President Trump is gearing up to drop a major announcement on April 2 at 4 p.m. ET, dubbed “ Liberation Day .” He’s expected to unveil reciprocal tariffs targeting 15 countries, including China, Canada, and Mexico, all of which have already imposed tariffs on the U.S. Tariff War Shakes Up the Market The ongoing tariff war is shaking up the stock market, with the S&P 500 dropping over 2% in the past five days. Bitcoin’s price often follows the market, so it could face more ups and downs. The trade war is likely to cause more short-term price swings. Crypto prices have taken a hit as they’ve become more tied to traditional assets like stocks and bonds, which are struggling due to economic uncertainty. U.S. tariffs on imports have left Wall Street worried about a global recession, making investors wary of risky assets like crypto. Marc Ostwald, Chief Economist at ADM Investor Services International, explained that Markets are losing their ‘risk appetite,’ which is pushing crypto further from safe-haven assets like gold, which remains the go-to choice in uncertain times. As the global financial and trade system grows more fragmented, investors are looking for safer alternatives to riskier assets like the U.S. dollar. Right now, gold is the go-to choice, up 18% so far this year. Bitcoin To Take Over Gold? However, this could change, says Omid Malekan, adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. He believes that Bitcoin might soon take over as the ‘new gold’. He noted that the future is uncertain as both crypto and tariffs are new and complex. Some believe crypto is a risky tech asset that would drop due to tariffs. But Bitcoin is also seen as “digital gold ,” and gold prices are rising with tariff news. He believes that when the economy is uncertain, investors might turn to Bitcoin just like they’ve turned to gold recently. Tariffs Could Boost Bitcoin In another positive note, Zach Pandl , head of research at Grayscale, notes that the impact of tariffs on crypto could be “priced in” and the worst might be over already. Besides, he believes that the Liberation Day could ease financial market struggles and if the tariffs are tough but phased, targeting 15 countries, markets will likely rally. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S Liberation Day 2nd April : Trump Tarrifs Announcment, Crypto News Today, XRP News, Trump Speech Today , He also pointed out that events like Circle’s IPO wouldn’t be happening if institutions weren’t confident in the crypto space and its regulations. Pandl believes that tariffs will reduce the demand for the U.S. dollar and open the door for other currencies like Bitcoin. He still believes that Bitcoin will reach new all-time highs this year, despite the current negative sentiment around its prices. Bounce-back For Bitcoin? Sid Powell, CEO & co-founder of Maple, is saying that traders are hopeful that Trump’s upcoming tariff announcement on April 2 will be less harsh than expected. Powell noted that after weeks of falling prices, any relief could trigger FOMO and a quick bounce-back for Bitcoin. However, he also warns that if the tariffs cause the U.S. dollar to strengthen or slow down the global economy, risky assets like crypto could suffer even more. So, investors are waiting to see what happens before making big decisions. Besides, if inflation rises, the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates, which could boost Bitcoin adoption and lead to a price increase over time. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In the past 24 hours, Act I The AI Prophecy (ACT) price has dropped over 63 percent to trade at about $0.06987 on Wednesday, during the early Western financial markets. Several other Binance-listed tokens – led by DEXE, KAVA, HIPPO, TST, LUMIA, and QUICK, among others – recorded more than 50 percent decline in the past 24 hours. After an on-chain investment, it was revealed that the Binance exchange lowered the leverage position for the involved tokens. As a result, market makers like Wintermute, which held positions exceeding the new limits were forced to liquidate their holdings automatically. Binance to Take Responsibility Following the Binance scandal on April Fools’ Day, the desire for the affected crypto investors to boycott the exchange is palpable. In the past 24 hours, the #BoycottBinance topic has been trending on the X platform, especially after the crypto exchange had not provided a detailed report on the incident as of this writing. Friends, I have decided not to use #Binance anymore, they have dragged the market into too much manipulation and many of the coins they have listed for a long time are being filled and emptied, I think this exchange should really be punished This is a call for everyone to… pic.twitter.com/fgHxayvoDP — DXC Foundation (@Dxc_Foundation) April 1, 2025 According to Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO at Wintermute, yesterday’s altcoin selloff on the Binance exchange was a reaction to an arbitrage opportunity in an Automated Market Maker pool rather than a deliberate strategy. Meanwhile, Yi He, cofounder at Binance, noted that the crypto exchange is collecting details and preparing a report on yesterday’s incident. Yi hinted at the involvement of another player, which has significantly complicated the incident. Nonetheless, the scandal has made a major dent in memecoins, especially those listed by Binance in the recent past. Moreover, some community members have accused Binance exchange of being focused to make profit on rising volume instead of focusing on building utility projects. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Search Trends Crash After Ripple Lawsuit Ends,https://coinpedia.org/news/was-the-sec-unintentionally-boosting-xrps-popularity-search-trends-crash-after-ripple-lawsuit-ends/,"The post Was the SEC Unintentionally Boosting XRP’s Popularity? Search Trends Crash After Ripple Lawsuit Ends appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The long-standing Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit has officially wrapped up, but there’s a catch—we’re still waiting for the SEC’s official statement. Why the hesitation? In past cases like Kraken and Cumberland, the SEC gave official statements and confirmation, and this one’s no different. According to attorney Fred Rispoli, Ripple should receive an official update within 60 days. But here’s the million-dollar question—what’s next for XRP’s price? Investors had high hopes for a massive rally, even expecting a $10 surge, considering the emotional rollercoaster of the legal battle. After all, XRP’s price reacted strongly to events like Trump’s election, so wouldn’t this be an even bigger catalyst? Now, let’s put technical charts aside and dive into an unexpected data point: XRP’s global search interest. It plummeted to a new low of 16, according to Google Trends. To put that in perspective, XRP’s search interest peaked at 100 in January—the exact time of Ripple’s appeal deadline. Interestingly, XRP saw a 5% price rally during that period. trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(""TIMESERIES"", {""comparisonItem"":[{""keyword"":""xrp"",""geo"":"""",""time"":""today 3-m""}],""category"":0,""property"":""""}, {""exploreQuery"":""date=today%203-m&q=xrp&hl=en"",""guestPath"":""https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/""}); So, here’s a thought: was the SEC unintentionally keeping XRP alive through public attention? The endless social media debates, Gary Gensler’s constant mentions, and top lawyers joining the case all fueled the XRP buzz. Now that the lawsuit is over, the chatter’s died down, and so has the search interest. Is the SEC’s silence the final nail in the coffin for XRP’s social sentiment? Or is this just the calm before the next wave? Only time—and that much awaited official statement—will tell.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 07:24:18

Here is the Data,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/has-the-peak-in-bitcoin-and-altcoins-already-been-seen-or-is-the-big-bull-still-to-come-here-is-the-data/,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal has cited several key indicators that point to low public interest in digital assets, suggesting that the much-anticipated euphoria period of the current market cycle may not yet have materialized. In his statement, Alphractal outlined four key metrics that point to a lack of mainstream excitement around cryptocurrencies: Google search trends remain significantly lower than previous market peaks, indicating waning interest among the general public. Wikipedia searches for cryptocurrency-related pages have not reached previous cycle levels and are even declining. Crypto discussions on Reddit remain weak, a stark contrast to the surge seen during the height of enthusiasm in 2021. 4Chan participation, once a prominent forum for crypto discussions, has also seen a decline in activity. Alphractal believes that this trend raises an important question: Is the general public now well-informed about crypto, or is there simply a lack of demand for information? The firm leans towards the latter explanation, emphasizing that cryptocurrencies are still a relatively new asset class and most people are unfamiliar with the intricacies of these assets. Related News: Anticipated Altcoin Airdrop Announced - 50 Million Tokens to be Distributed to Users, Here are the Details Alphractal draws two important conclusions from these observations: The peak of public interest in 2024 was less intense compared to previous cycles. The expected market euphoria has not yet materialized, but it could occur in the coming months. With Bitcoin dominance still high and many altcoins trading at historically low prices, Alphractal suggests that a significant market rally could still be on the horizon, potentially resulting in a surge in searches and public interest in 2025. *This is not investment advice.

The BTC/JPY trading on the Japan-based bitFlyer fell 1% after failing to take out the trendline drawn off the record high reached on Jan. 20, data from charting platform TradingView show. BTC's USD-denominated price faced similar losses. Meanwhile, Asian equity indices and the U.S. equity futures treaded water ahead of President Donald Trump's sweeping new “Liberation Day” reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday that could trigger a global trade war. The tariff uncertainty has spurred several investment banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs , pencil in a higher chance of U.S. recession or consecutive quarterly contractions in the growth rate. Some crypto observers expect investors to treat bitcoin (BTC) as a haven asset should a tariff-led economic swoon materialize. Goldman, however, sees the Japanese yen, a long-preferred safe haven, as the top hedge against U.S. risks. ""The yen offers investors the best currency hedge should the chances of a US recession increase,"" Kamakshya Trivedi, head of global foreign exchange, interest rates and emerging market strategy at Goldman Sachs, said late Tuesday, according to Bloomberg . Trivedi added that the yen is also a ""very good hedge"" against U.S. labor market weakness and tends to do best when U.S. real rates [inflation-adjusted yields] and U.S. equities fall together. While BTC is widely seen as a digital gold or haven asset by crypto market participants, the cryptocurrency has historically moved in tandem with technology stocks. In other words, tariffs-led risk-off on Wall Street could spill over into the crypto market. Additionally, the yen's strength could prompt the unwinding of risk-on bullish trades financed by inexpensive yen-denominated loans, contributing to overall risk aversion in financial markets. The crypto market experienced this in early August last year when the yen carry trade unravelled, leading to declines in both stocks and BTC. During that period, bitcoin plummeted from approximately $65K to $50K within a week. Goldman expects the Japanese yen to rise to the low 140s against the U.S. dollar this year. The USD/JPY pair traded at 149.77 at press time. The exchange rate is known to closely track the differential between yields on the 10-year U.S. and Japanese bonds. The latter recently dropped to its lowest since August 2022, offering yen-bullish cues.",Markets|Bitcoin|yen|Goldman Scahs|recession|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 07:26:33

Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and also Mutuum Finance (MUTM). These tokens offer anonymous, hype-driven presale gains and real-world DeFi utility, however Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is unique in attracting real-world DeFi utility with its structured presale. With Cardano (ADA) and DOGE toying with market sentiment and meme driven pumps, MUTM’s lending philosophy and embedded buy pressure lay out a concrete pathway to exponential returns. With Cardano (ADA) looking poised to break out and DOGE attracting interest from whales, phase 4 of MUTM’s presale, priced at $0.025, provides a 140% return at launch — a unique low-risk, high-reward opportunity before pent-up demand ticks prices up. Cardano (ADA): Out Of The Bull Flag Ready For Breakout Analysts discover potential 10X rally as Cardano (ADA) surges. A historically inverse head-and-shoulders pattern indicates that Cardano (ADA) could fly to between $2.90 and $7.10, if it maintains momentum. Whale activity is fueling that thesis, as deep-pocketed holders control $8.8 billion worth of Cardano (ADA). But recent sell-offs by them have caused dips in the price, highlighting Cardano (ADA) volatility. Interest waned with the Cardano (ADA) slump in March; however, searches for “Cardano price prediction” shot up 170% last week. Cardano’s (ADA) upside is indeed real despite being tethered to speculative trends and shaky whale behavior for investors. Dogecoin (DOGE): Whale Accumulation Amidst Meme Hype Dogecoin (DOGE) is enjoying a 42% bounce-off its $0.14 low, now at $0.20. Analysts say Dogecoin (DOGE) might push to $0.80—or other predictions even suggest $6—if it breaks through the $0.31 area of resistance. Wallets with 10M–100M Dogecoin (DOGE) tokens, known as whales, have amassed 200M Dogecoin (DOGE) coins in fortnight—spurring optimism. One major catalyst is the House of Doge initiative that locked 10M Dogecoin (DOGE) into a reserved wallet and issued an increase in the sentiment of the community. But Dogecoin (DOGE) dependence on hype and limited usability renders it a speculative play. In stark contrast, MUTM’s DeFi framework is such that tokens have engineering engineered gains not for hopes of gains, but for engineering gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Pre-Sale Success and 140% Exchange ROI Phase 4 of its presale is fast approaching a conclusion, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) guaranteed profits will be available to current buyers with the token starting at $0.025 and moving to $0.03 in the next stage – a 20% jump. With a listing price of $0.06 per Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at launch, phase 4 participants will enjoy a 140% profit.

42791168,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145386,1743579055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Revelation: Eric Trump’s Crypto Journey After Banks’ Account Blacklist,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eric-trump-crypto-adoption-banks/,"In a stunning revelation that has sent ripples through both the political and financial worlds, Eric Trump, son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, has publicly announced his foray into the realm of cryptocurrency. But what sparked this interest? According to Eric Trump himself, it wasn’t just market trends or technological curiosity, but a direct response to what he describes as an orchestrated campaign of financial censorship against his family. Eric Trump’s Crypto Adoption: A Response to ‘Financial Censorship’ During a recent interview with Fox Business, Eric Trump detailed the unprecedented challenges faced by the Trump family when numerous U.S. banks abruptly closed their accounts. He named prominent financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Capital One, TD Bank, and First Republic, painting a picture of a coordinated effort to ostracize his family from the traditional financial system. This, he asserted, was the pivotal moment that opened his eyes to the importance of cryptocurrency . “I never thought I’d be in crypto,” Eric Trump stated, highlighting the unexpected nature of his entry into the digital asset space. He framed the bank account closures as an “attack” on the Trump family, a move that forced him to reconsider the vulnerabilities of centralized finance and explore decentralized alternatives. This personal experience underscores a growing concern among many about the potential for financial censorship and the increasing appeal of cryptocurrencies as a hedge against such actions. Why Did Banks Close Trump Family Accounts? While Eric Trump attributes the account closures to political motivations, banks often cite various reasons for such decisions, including: Risk Management: Banks are heavily regulated and must manage risks associated with their clients. Politically exposed persons (PEPs) and their families often undergo enhanced scrutiny due to potential reputational and compliance risks. Regulatory Compliance: Banks must adhere to strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. If a client’s activities raise red flags or compliance concerns, banks may choose to de-risk by closing accounts. Reputational Risk: Maintaining accounts for high-profile individuals, especially those embroiled in controversy, can pose reputational risks for banks. Negative publicity or association can impact a bank’s brand and customer trust. Business Strategy: Banks periodically review their client portfolios and may decide to terminate relationships that no longer align with their business strategy or profitability goals. It’s important to note that banks operate in a complex regulatory environment and must make decisions based on a multitude of factors. While Eric Trump views the closures as targeted financial censorship , banks would likely argue they were acting within their rights and responsibilities to manage risk and comply with regulations. The Allure of Cryptocurrency: A Decentralized Alternative Eric Trump’s embrace of crypto highlights a key appeal of decentralized digital currencies – their potential to offer a financial system outside the control of traditional institutions. For individuals and entities concerned about censorship, de-platforming, or arbitrary financial restrictions, cryptocurrency importance as an alternative becomes increasingly apparent. Benefits of Cryptocurrency as an Alternative Financial System: Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, meaning no single entity controls them. This reduces the risk of censorship or unilateral control. Accessibility: Cryptocurrency transactions can be conducted globally, often without the need for traditional banking intermediaries, increasing financial inclusion. Transparency: Blockchain technology, which underpins most cryptocurrencies, provides a transparent and auditable record of transactions. Security: Cryptography secures cryptocurrency transactions, offering a robust level of security. Control: Users have greater control over their digital assets compared to traditional banking systems, where accounts can be frozen or restricted by third parties. The Future of Digital Finance and Eric Trump’s Role Eric Trump’s entry into crypto could be seen as a symbolic moment, reflecting a broader trend of individuals and institutions exploring digital finance future and alternative financial solutions. His high profile and public stance could potentially influence public perception and accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies, particularly among those who share concerns about centralized control and financial censorship . However, the cryptocurrency space is not without its challenges. Volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and security risks remain significant hurdles. For widespread mainstream adoption, addressing these challenges is crucial. Nevertheless, stories like Eric Trump’s, driven by real-world experiences of perceived financial exclusion, underscore the compelling value proposition of cryptocurrencies. Challenges and Considerations in Cryptocurrency Adoption: Challenge Description Volatility Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate dramatically, posing risks for investors. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, creating uncertainty and potential compliance hurdles. Security Risks Cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets can be targets for hacking and theft. Complexity Understanding cryptocurrency technology and concepts can be complex for new users. Scalability Some cryptocurrencies face scalability challenges in processing large volumes of transactions. Despite these challenges, the narrative of Eric Trump crypto adoption , fueled by concerns about financial censorship , resonates with a growing segment of the population. It highlights the potential of cryptocurrencies to empower individuals and offer a more resilient and inclusive financial system. As the digital finance future unfolds, stories like these will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping public discourse and driving further innovation in the crypto space. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from Eric Trump’s Crypto Journey? Diversification of Financial Assets: Eric Trump’s move underscores the importance of diversifying financial assets and exploring alternatives to traditional banking systems. Understanding Decentralization: His experience highlights the value of decentralized systems in mitigating risks associated with centralized control and potential censorship. Staying Informed about Crypto: Whether you agree with Eric Trump’s motivations or not, his story serves as a reminder to stay informed about the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency and its potential implications. Advocating for Financial Freedom: The narrative around financial censorship raises important questions about financial freedom and the role of decentralized technologies in safeguarding it. In conclusion, Eric Trump’s journey into cryptocurrency is more than just a celebrity endorsement. It’s a compelling case study of how real-world events, perceived injustices, and concerns about financial censorship can drive individuals to embrace decentralized alternatives. As the world moves further into the digital age, the importance of cryptocurrency as a tool for financial empowerment and resilience is likely to grow, making stories like Eric Trump’s increasingly relevant and impactful.

The altcoins are slightly in the red, aside from CRO and EOS, as both have charted impressive gains once again. BTC Dominance on the Rise The primary cryptocurrency had a good run last week when its price shot up to $88,800 to mark a multi-week peak. However, it couldn’t penetrate that level and started to lose value gradually in the next few days. The situation worsened on Friday when BTC’s floor gave in and the asset dropped to $81,600. It managed to recover some ground during the weekend, but that was short-lived. The start of the current business week was also painful, with a price drop to a weekly low of $81,200. The bulls finally stepped up at this point and didn’t allow a further breakdown below $80,000. In fact, BTC started to gain traction and jumped beyond $85,000 for the first time since Friday. Interestingly, data from Bitstamp shows that bitcoin flash-crashed to $81,200, while the same cannot be found on other exchanges, like Binance. Nevertheless, BTC’s current price is just over $84,000, and its market cap stands tall at $1.670 trillion. The asset’s dominance over the alts is on the rise again by nearing 60%, which is more than 1.5% higher than the numbers from last week. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView CRO, EOS Shoot Up Most altcois have turned red on a daily scale after yesterday’s impressive gains. BNB, SOL, TON, LINK, DOE, ADA, and XRP are all with minor losses. SHIB has dropped the most from the larger-cap alts. In contrast, EOS and CRO have emerged as today’s top performers. EOS has jumped by double digits (20%) and trades above $0.8, while CRO is up by 7.5% and sits north of $0.105.

42791557,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145387,1743579657,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Uniswap DAO’s Bold $113M Incentive Plan: Empowering Crypto Governance Revolution,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/uniswap-dao-incentive-governance/,"Exciting developments are unfolding in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) as Uniswap DAO, a leading decentralized autonomous organization, takes a significant step to fortify its governance. Get ready to dive into the details of their newly approved, groundbreaking delegate incentive plan , a massive $113 million initiative designed to supercharge participation and reshape the future of crypto governance. This move is poised to empower underrepresented voices and inject fresh dynamism into the Uniswap ecosystem. Let’s explore how this ambitious plan could redefine decentralized decision-making and what it means for you. Unveiling the $113M Delegate Incentive Plan : A New Era for Uniswap Governance The heart of this news is the Uniswap DAO’s preliminary approval of a substantial treasury delegation program. Imagine a system where active community members are not just heard, but actively incentivized to shape the platform’s direction. This is precisely what the delegate incentive plan aims to achieve. With a potential allocation of up to 18 million UNI tokens, valued at approximately $113 million, this initiative is a clear signal of Uniswap’s commitment to robust and inclusive governance. Here’s a breakdown of what this ambitious plan entails: Massive Token Allocation: Up to 18 million UNI tokens earmarked for delegation. Significant Financial Backing: Approximately $113 million in value at current prices. Targeted Delegation: Aimed at 12 delegates to ensure focused and impactful participation. Individual Delegate Incentive: Potentially 1 million UNI per delegate, providing substantial motivation. Tiered Rewards: Extra tokens for “top-tier” delegates who demonstrate exceptional engagement and contribution. Enhancing Governance: The core goal is to strengthen Uniswap’s decentralized governance framework. This move follows the Uniswap Foundation’s recent approval of a $165.5 million funding initiative, showcasing a broader push towards bolstering the Uniswap ecosystem and its governance mechanisms. The preliminary vote for this delegate incentive plan saw a strong 60% approval, indicating significant community support, although nearly 30% abstained, suggesting room for further dialogue and consensus-building as the plan moves forward to an onchain vote for final confirmation. Why a Delegate Incentive Plan ? Addressing the Core of Crypto Governance Challenges Decentralized governance, while revolutionary in concept, often faces challenges in practice. One common hurdle is ensuring active and representative participation. Many token holders, even those deeply invested in a project, may lack the time, resources, or expertise to actively engage in governance processes. This can lead to lower voter turnout and potentially less diverse perspectives shaping the future of the protocol. Uniswap DAO’s delegate incentive plan directly tackles this challenge by: Boosting Participation: Incentives can motivate more individuals to become active delegates. Diversifying Representation: Encouraging participation from underrepresented segments of the community. Rewarding Active Contributors: Recognizing and rewarding those who dedicate time and effort to governance. Strengthening Decentralization: Distributing governance power more broadly and effectively. Improving Decision-Making: Potentially leading to more informed and well-rounded decisions through increased participation. Essentially, this plan is about making crypto governance more vibrant, inclusive, and effective within the Uniswap ecosystem. By incentivizing delegation, Uniswap aims to harness the collective intelligence and dedication of its community to guide its future. How Does the UNI Token Play a Role in This Incentive Program? The UNI token is the lifeblood of Uniswap’s governance. Holding UNI grants users voting rights within the DAO, allowing them to propose and vote on changes to the protocol. This delegate incentive plan leverages the UNI token as the primary mechanism for rewarding active governance participants. Here’s how the UNI token is central to the incentive structure: Incentive Currency: UNI tokens are the direct reward for delegates. Governance Power: Delegated UNI tokens increase the voting power of active delegates. Alignment of Interests: Incentivizing delegates with UNI aligns their interests with the long-term success of the Uniswap protocol. Value Accrual: A thriving governance system, fueled by incentivized delegates, can potentially enhance the value of the UNI token itself. By allocating a significant amount of UNI tokens to this program, Uniswap DAO is demonstrating a clear commitment to investing in its governance infrastructure and empowering its community to shape the protocol’s trajectory. This strategic use of the UNI token underscores its importance not just as a utility token, but as a key instrument in decentralized governance. What are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of This Crypto Governance Initiative? Like any ambitious initiative, the Uniswap DAO’s delegate incentive plan comes with both potential benefits and challenges. Understanding these aspects is crucial for assessing its long-term impact on crypto governance and the Uniswap ecosystem. Benefits Challenges Increased Participation in Governance More Diverse and Representative Decision-Making Enhanced Protocol Security and Resilience Greater Community Engagement and Ownership Potential for Faster Innovation and Adaptation Risk of Centralization if Delegation is Concentrated Potential for Sybil Attacks or Malicious Delegation Complexity in Defining “Top-Tier” Delegate Criteria Sustaining Long-Term Delegate Engagement Ensuring Fair and Equitable Distribution of Incentives Navigating these challenges effectively will be key to the success of the delegate incentive plan . Careful consideration of delegate selection criteria, robust security measures, and ongoing monitoring of governance dynamics will be essential to maximize the benefits and mitigate potential risks. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for DeFi and You? The Uniswap DAO’s delegate incentive plan is more than just internal protocol news; it offers valuable insights into the evolving landscape of DeFi and crypto governance as a whole. Here are some actionable takeaways: Governance is Evolving: Protocols are actively experimenting with incentive mechanisms to improve decentralized governance. Participation Matters: Your voice and participation in DAOs can directly shape the future of DeFi. UNI Token Utility is Growing: The UNI token’s role extends beyond trading; it’s a key to governance and influence within the Uniswap ecosystem. Delegation is Powerful: Even if you don’t have time to be a delegate yourself, delegating your tokens to active participants is a way to contribute. Stay Informed and Engaged: Keep track of governance proposals and discussions within DAOs you are invested in. This initiative from Uniswap DAO serves as a powerful example for other DeFi projects and DAOs looking to enhance their governance models. It highlights the growing recognition that active and incentivized community participation is crucial for the long-term health and sustainability of decentralized protocols. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a More Decentralized Future Uniswap DAO’s $113 million delegate incentive plan represents a bold and innovative approach to strengthening crypto governance . By directly incentivizing active participation, Uniswap is not just aiming to improve its own decision-making processes but also setting a potential precedent for the broader DeFi space. As the plan moves towards a final onchain vote, the crypto community will be watching closely to see how this ambitious initiative unfolds and the impact it has on the future of decentralized governance and the evolution of the UNI token ecosystem. This move underscores the dynamic and experimental nature of decentralized organizations as they strive to build more robust, inclusive, and truly decentralized systems.

This move marked the investment firm’s fifth registration of crypto asset ETFs in the state, including Ether, Bitcoin, Solana, and Avalanche ETFs. The firm filed for a spot Solana ETF mid last year, following its successful ETF registrations backed by BTC and ETH. Earlier this month, VanEck also submitted a registration for an Avalanche ETF in the state of Delaware.

This is their fifth crypto ETF after BTC, ETH, SOL, and AVAX. pic.twitter.com/xAoKiUEg4U — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) April 2, 2025 Investment management firm VanEck has filed to launch a trust entity for a proposed BNB ETF in Delaware. The investment manager has established a trust to serve as a preparatory measure in the ETF registration process prior to the formal application to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The firm marked the first attempt to establish a Binance Coin (BNB) ETF specifically in the U.S. market. Other BNB-related products, such as the 21Shares Binance ETP, exist, but they are not U.S.-based. The 21Shares BNB exchange-traded product is also the only ETN that tracks the Binance Coin index. The asset manager registered the new product on Monday, called VanEck BNB ETF, under filing number 10148820. According to public records on the official Delaware state website, the ETF was also registered as a trust corporate service company. Source: Delaware state website . Registration for the VanEck BNB ETF in Delaware. The New York-based company acknowledged that the BNB ETF will track the price of Binance Coin, currently ranked as the fifth-largest virtual currency by market capitalization. The digital asset is currently exchanging hands at around $599.70 with a 5.27% drop in the last seven days. On-chain data also revealed that the trading volume for BNB Coin has surged by 42% to more than $2.12 billion as a result of VanEck’s move. VanEck registers other digital asset ETFs The firm’s recent registration makes BNB join Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and Avalanche as the fifth digital asset to have an independent ETF registration initiated by VanEck in Delaware. The firm, managing nearly $115 billion in client assets globally, debuted its Bitcoin and Ether ETFs last year after securing approval from the SEC. The asset investment manager filed for a Solana ETF in June 2024, making it the first Solana exchange-traded fund in the U.S. The firm had registered a trust company for its SOL fund in November 2021, when the asset changed hands at pandemic-era peak of $259. VacEck also applied for SEC approval last month to launch the first AVAX ETF. According to public records on the official Delaware state website, the document is registered under file number 10125689, and the agent registered on the form was revealed to be CSC Delaware Trust. “VanEck seems to be taking a ‘throw everything at the wall and see what sticks’ approach, which makes sense. Avalanche isn’t the most widely traded cryptocurrency, but being first to market with an ETF in a new category comes with potential upside and little downside.” ~ Sumit Roy, senior ETF analyst at etf.com. The firm noted that the AVAX ETF is structured as a Delaware statutory trust and will be managed under a trust agreement, with VanEck as the fund’s main sponsor. The investment company will now have to file an official S-1 form with the U.S. SEC for a spot AVAX ETF. The NASDAQ exchange also applied to the SEC on March 28 to list shares of an Avalanche ETF issued by crypto asset manager Grayscale. Grayscale’s AVAX fund 19b-4 form showed that the ETF would use Coinbase Custody as its custodian. Grayscale also offers spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and has applied to launch funds based on other digital assets including XRP, Solana and Dogecoin. The firm’s BTC fund manages nearly $17 billion, and ranks third among other Bitcoin funds from BlackRock and Fidelity. The surge in ETF applications comes after the success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds last year, and as crypto-based exchange traded products garnered roughly $44 billion worth of assets in 2024.

Interest is through the roof, and even usually slow-to-change traditional financial institutions seem to have finally admitted that they need to adopt crypto, at least partially, not to miss out on future possibilities. But scratch beneath the surface, and you’ll find the same old problems that have persisted in the industry since its inception threatening to derail everything: outdated security, hidden fees, and platform interfaces so confusing they seem designed to keep people out rather than welcome them in. It doesn’t take a high-level industry insider to see the pattern: the market gets hyped, money flows in, but the fundamental issues never get fixed. With Web3 no longer just industry jargon but on the cusp of becoming a digital reality pillar, crypto’s make-or-break moment isn’t that far away. Will the industry actually deliver on its revolutionary promise, or just remain a playground for insiders who already know the secret handshake? It all depends on the industry’s willingness to finally face and fix the problems that have prevented mass-scale adoption since the beginning. Giorgi Shonia Aims to Have Security Reimagined It shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that the CEO of the upcoming trading platform Nordom Exchange, puts a particularly high emphasis on the need to provide better security. Unlike most exchange leaders who come from finance or marketing backgrounds, Shonia began his digital career in cybersecurity before transitioning to development. Those curious to meet Giorgi Shonia and learn more about his path or hear more of his expertise in the field, can visit his website. What jumps out in industry discussions is Shonia’s take that most exchanges treat security as a feature rather than a foundation. Too many platforms bolt on security after the problems have already popped up, scrambling to patch holes after attacks instead of building solid systems from day one. Nordom’s team is trying to take the opposite route, utilizing cold storage, encryption ( instead of enticing people with marketing buzzwords), and outside security audits. But here’s the thing—all the tech solutions in the world wrapped up in a singular platform won’t matter without a fundamental shift in attitude at large within the field. The industry needs to start putting user protection ahead of launching shiny new features. Exchanges must come clean about their security measures (and risks) instead of hiding behind vague promises and refusing to acknowledge there are any dangers at all. After years of headline-grabbing hacks, trust is in short supply. Earning Trust: Importance of Education and Transparency Let’s be honest—crypto can be a minefield for newcomers. Most platforms act like everyone who clicks on was born understanding blockchain. There’s a huge knowledge gap and it drives away people who’re just trying to gauge the situation. These are the people who might’ve stuck around and helped the ecosystem grow—if only the industry were more welcoming. Nordom’s approach is to have the platform act as an educational hub along with providing a more user-friendly trading experience. New traders can learn as they go, including what the concept of crypto mining even is, how to earn free crypto rewards through various platform activities, how to identify scams, etc.—making the whole thing less intimidating for regular people who are curious but confused by crypto’s complexity. But education is just one piece. Have you ever tried to figure out exactly what fees you’re paying on most exchanges? Good luck with that. The charges are usually buried in fine print that nobody reads. Platforms serious about sticking around need to make their pricing crystal clear—no financial decoder ring required. The crypto industry needs to make important choices about how it intends to operate going forward. Its future depends not just on fancy tech but on whether platforms can create spaces where regular folks feel safe, informed, and valued. The outlook seems bright, but without exchanges tackling these core issues, all that potential will remain just that—potential.",Guest Post,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 07:43:40

42791874,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145388,1743580259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Update: SEC Gemini Lawsuit Stalled by 60-Day Delay – What Does It Mean?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-gemini-lawsuit-delay/,"In a dramatic turn of events in the crypto world, the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Gemini Trust has taken an unexpected pause. Just when things seemed to be heating up, the SEC has requested a 60-day delay from a New York federal court. This request, reported by Bloomberg, hints at potential behind-the-scenes negotiations and raises critical questions about the future of the SEC Gemini Lawsuit and its broader implications for crypto regulation. Let’s dive into what this delay means and what could be next in this high-stakes legal drama. Why the Sudden Gemini Trust Delay ? Exploring the SEC’s Motives The SEC’s request for a 60-day delay might seem like a simple procedural matter, but it’s loaded with potential meaning. The official reason cited is to explore potential resolutions to the lawsuit. But what could these resolutions be? Here are a few possibilities: Negotiated Settlement: The most likely scenario is that the SEC and Gemini are engaging in settlement talks. The SEC might be looking for Gemini to agree to certain terms, potentially involving fines, operational changes, or even admissions of wrongdoing (though this is less likely from Gemini’s side). Further Investigation: While less probable given the lawsuit is already underway, the delay could provide the SEC with more time to gather additional evidence or refine their legal strategy. This is less likely, but in complex cases, new information can always surface. Regulatory Reconsideration: The crypto regulatory landscape is constantly evolving. It’s possible, though less likely, that the SEC is re-evaluating its approach to crypto regulation in general, and this delay reflects a broader strategic pause. It’s crucial to remember that the SEC initially charged Gemini and Genesis (another crypto firm) in 2023 for allegedly selling unregistered securities through Gemini’s Earn program. This program, which offered users interest on their crypto holdings, is at the heart of the legal dispute. The SEC argues that Earn constituted an investment contract and therefore should have been registered as a security. The Core Issue: Unregistered Securities and the Gemini Earn Program To truly understand the significance of this delay, we need to revisit the crux of the lawsuit: the allegation of selling unregistered securities . Let’s break down what this means in the context of Gemini Earn: What are Securities? In simple terms, securities are financial instruments that represent ownership (like stocks) or debt (like bonds). Under U.S. law, securities offerings generally need to be registered with the SEC to protect investors by ensuring transparency and disclosure of risks. Why the SEC Says Gemini Earn is a Security: The SEC argues that Gemini Earn, despite dealing with cryptocurrencies, functions like a traditional investment contract. Here’s their reasoning: Investment of Money: Users deposited their crypto assets into the Earn program. Common Enterprise: Gemini pooled these assets and used them to generate yield, allegedly through lending to Genesis. Expectation of Profits: Users expected to earn interest on their deposited crypto. Profits Derived from the Efforts of Others: The profits (interest) were generated by Gemini and Genesis’s management of the pooled assets and lending activities, not directly by the users themselves. Because of these factors, the SEC believes Gemini Earn should have been registered as a security offering. Gemini, on the other hand, likely argues that Earn was not a security and that existing regulations were not clear enough to classify it as such. Impact on Crypto Regulation : A Precedent-Setting Case? The SEC Gemini Lawsuit is not just about Gemini; it has far-reaching implications for the entire crypto industry and the future of crypto regulation . Here’s why this case is so important: Clarity on Crypto Lending: The outcome will set a precedent for how crypto lending products are regulated in the U.S. If the SEC wins, it could mean stricter regulations for platforms offering interest-bearing crypto accounts. Broader Definition of Securities: The case could further clarify the SEC’s view on which crypto assets and activities fall under the definition of securities. This has been a major point of contention and uncertainty in the crypto space. Investor Protection vs. Innovation: The lawsuit highlights the ongoing tension between the SEC’s mandate to protect investors and the crypto industry’s desire for innovation and less stringent regulation. The resolution will likely reflect a balancing act between these two priorities. The Gemini Trust Delay might be a sign that both parties are feeling the weight of this case and are seeking a negotiated solution to avoid a potentially lengthy and costly court battle. However, it could also simply be a tactical pause before the legal proceedings continue. What’s Next? Possible Scenarios and Timelines Predicting the future in legal battles is always tricky, but here are a few possible scenarios following this 60-day delay in the Digital Asset Lawsuit : Scenario Likelihood Potential Outcome Timeline Settlement Agreement High Gemini agrees to certain terms (fines, operational changes) without admitting wrongdoing. Case is resolved. Within 60 days or shortly after. Continued Litigation Medium Settlement talks fail. Legal proceedings resume, potentially leading to a trial. Months to years. Partial Settlement Medium Gemini and SEC reach agreement on some issues but continue to litigate others. Potentially ongoing litigation with certain aspects resolved. Regulatory Shift Low Unlikely to be the sole driver, but broader regulatory changes could influence the case. Ongoing, but less directly tied to the 60-day delay. The next 60 days will be crucial. Industry observers will be keenly watching for any signals of progress in settlement talks or indications that the parties are preparing for a protracted legal fight. The crypto community is particularly interested in how this case will shape the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. and beyond. Key Takeaways: Navigating the Uncertainties This Gemini Trust Delay in the SEC Gemini Lawsuit serves as a stark reminder of the regulatory uncertainties still surrounding the cryptocurrency industry. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in this case and other regulatory actions impacting the crypto space. Regulatory clarity is essential for the industry’s long-term growth. Understand Regulatory Risks: For crypto businesses, it’s crucial to proactively assess and mitigate regulatory risks, particularly concerning securities laws. Seek legal counsel to ensure compliance. Advocate for Clear Rules: Engage in constructive dialogue with regulators and policymakers to advocate for clear and sensible rules that foster innovation while protecting investors. Investor Due Diligence: For crypto investors, understand the regulatory landscape and potential risks associated with different crypto products and platforms. The SEC Gemini Lawsuit is a landmark case that will have lasting consequences for the crypto industry. This 60-day delay introduces a new layer of intrigue and uncertainty, but also perhaps a glimmer of hope for a negotiated resolution. The crypto world waits with bated breath to see what unfolds.

Speaking on the subject, Hoskinson said that once the stablecoin and market structure bills are approved, leading technology firms such as Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook will include cryptocurrency wallets on their platforms, potentially reaching a combined user base of 3 billion people. Hoskinson highlighted two major bills currently being considered in the US Congress. The first, a stablecoin bill, is the most likely to pass in the next 30 to 90 days, and the second, a broader market structure bill, is also being considered. “After these two bills pass, Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook will say, ‘Hey, we are crypto people now,’” Hoskinson said, predicting that these companies will integrate digital asset wallets into their operating systems and applications. According to Hoskinson, tech giants will have the opportunity to reduce their reliance on traditional credit card payment processing systems by issuing their own stablecoins or partnering with existing stablecoin providers. This move could make payments more efficient and cost-effective by enabling fee-free transactions within their ecosystems. Related News: Watch Out: An Altcoin Listed on Major Exchanges Hit by a Massive Hack Attack “They will do this because they can now legally hold and use stablecoins,” he explained, adding: “They don’t like paying credit card transaction fees.” If these companies integrate crypto wallets, they could effectively become financial services providers, reshaping the industry with their vast capital and user reach, according to Hoskinson. Hoskinson believes this shift will lead to the creation of new financial products, including yield-generating opportunities built directly into their platforms. The potential impact of these regulatory developments extends far beyond individual crypto investors, Hoskinson noted. With tech giants controlling access to billions of users, a seamless transition to integrated crypto services could drive unprecedented adoption of digital assets: “When these two bills pass, the floodgates will open and 3 billion people will walk through that door.” *This is not investment advice.

Axel Adler Jr notes that this is not the first time such a situation has happened in the history of BTC cycles. He points out that a similar situation has occurred nearly five times. He also reveals that out of these five times, at least four have triggered a price rise in the Bitcoin market, and once, it has led to a price decline. Expert on Strong Buying Activity in the Bitcoin Market Expressing his optimistic outlook about the growth potential of the BTC market, Adler Jr reveals that corporate investors are actively buying BTC, selling pressure in the BTC spot market has declined considerably, long-term holders have resumed accumulating BTC, and experienced investors have ceased selling. Highlighting on-chain metrics, he also claims that the market is stabilising after a period of overheating. Expert on Macroeconomic Challenges: Threat to BTC? Like many senior experts, Adler Jr also acknowledges that poor macroeconomic indicators are posing a serious threat to the growth potential of the Bitcoin market right now. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Tariff Announcement—Will Bitcoin Price Today Surge Past $90K or Crash Hard? , Potential Catalysts for the BTC Growth However, Adler Jr asserts that if either the Federal Reserve or the Trump administration gives positive signals, it could trigger a bullish rally in the market.

XRP has been consolidating within the pattern shown below, characterized by two converging trend lines that suggest a buildup of momentum. Technical analysis from well-followed X user @DefendDark indicates that a breakout from this formation could propel XRP toward a short-term target of $6. The symmetrical triangle has been forming over recent weeks, with XRP’s price action tightening as it approaches the apex of the triangle. This setup, commonly observed in crypto markets, often precedes a sharp move — either upward or downward — depending on the direction of the breakout. Fibonacci retracement analysis further supports this outlook, identifying $2.04 as a key support level and $2.2 as a critical resistance. A break above $2.2 could confirm the bullish trend, potentially driving XRP toward the $5 to $8 range in the mid term, per @DarkDefend. The Elliott Wave framework forecasts price movements in five distinct “waves” based on repeating price patterns, called ""waves."" The five-wave pattern reflects growing optimism, while the three-wave correction shows profit-taking or pessimism. These waves are driven by collective investor psychology and can occur across different timeframes and are considered by followers to be a way to map market behavior. As such, a bullish technical outlook coincides with growing optimism in the crypto market, driven in part by regulatory developments. The U.S. House will hold a crypto hearing on April 9, termed “The Future of American Innovation and Digital Assets: Adjusting U.S. Securities Law for the Digital Age,” with plans to develop a regulatory framework for digital assets. That could boost eyes on tokens perceived to be close to the U.S. government, such as XRP and Cardano’s ADA, which were named as part of potential crypto stockpile by President Donald Trump earlier in January.",Markets|XRP|Technical Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 07:57:44

In the times when the markets continue to display some uncertainty ahead of Trump’s new tariffs, the second largest token is displaying strength. While the lower targets at $1500 continue to remain active, the possibilities of a bear trap also appear to be quite evident. Therefore, similar to 2018 and 2022, the ETH price is expected to print massive bullish candles after facing consecutive bearish candles. Ethereum Whales Wake Up In the past few days, the ETH price has been facing massive selling pressure that has kept the price consolidated between $2000 and $2100. A popular analyst, Ali , reported a massive selloff of over 760,000 ETH in the last two weeks. On the other hand, an Ethereum OG, or the early investor who acquired 5001 Ethereum in 2017 at a base price of $277, has sold all his holdings. As per the data from an on-chain reporting platform, Lookonchain , the OG had begun to sell his holdings a month ago, making a total profit of over $8.6 million with an initial investment of around $1.36 million. Interestingly, this whale did not sell during the ETH peak above $4800 that could have attracted over $23 million in profit. This indicates the whale may have either found a better offer or lost faith in the next price action. Will a Rise Above $2500 in ETH Price Kick off an Altseason? The Ethereum price is closely monitored as the token was printing massive bearish candles, squashing the possibility of a rebound back to $4000. Currently, the token is in such a position where defending $2000 has become an uphill battle. However, the token has been trying to revive a strong upswing at frequent intervals, but the weakness among the bulls prevented the token from securing levels above the gains. Meanwhile, the price has now triggered a rebound from a crucial support level; hence, the possibility of a rebound emerges. The weekly chart of ETH displays an attempt of the bulls to remain within a bullish pattern, above the important ascending trend line. Ever since the price surged above $800 in Q4 2020, the token has been trading along an ascending trend line. The price is trying to hold the support at present and if the rebound is validated, the bearish clouds may fade away for a while. However, rising above the local resistance at $2081 and securing $2100 may pave the way for the token to test the higher resistance. Besides, securing the levels above the 200-day EMA could validate a bullish continuation, and as the weekly RSI has formed a double bottom, an upswing is imminent. Therefore, the Ethereum (ETH) price is primed to maintain a healthy upswing but if it fails to hold, a drop to $1500 could be imminent. If this happens, the probability of an Altseason may fade away indefinitely.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 07:58:00

Despite this short-term gain, the asset remains down by over 21.2% from its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January. The ongoing price fluctuations have left Bitcoin in a downward trend on a broader time scale, with investors and analysts closely watching for signs of a rally. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Downtrend Continue? This Metric Suggests Yes Path To $150k: Short-Term Holders’ Changing Behavior Despite the recent dip, data from CryptoQuant provides interesting insights into Bitcoin’s market dynamics. According to one of CryptoQuant’s contributors, Onchained, the behavior of short-term holders is a key factor to observe in the current market. Onchained’s analysis suggests that short-term holders, defined as those who have held Bitcoin for between one and three months, are no longer panicking and selling at a loss as they did in previous market cycles. The analysis reveals a slowdown in the selling pressure from this group, suggesting a shift in sentiment. Onchained’s report highlights the importance of the Short-Term Holder Net Realized PNL to Exchanges (CEXs) metric. This metric helps determine the selling pressure on Bitcoin, showing who is selling, whether they’re selling at a profit or loss, and the overall intensity of the market’s movement. The data indicates that while short-term holders are selling, the realized losses have been relatively low compared to unrealized losses. This suggests that these holders, despite being in the red, are opting to hold their positions rather than panic sell. Onchained further notes that this reduction in selling pressure could indicate the formation of a market bottom. Historically, when realized losses from short-term holders have been low and selling pressure has diminished, it has marked the end of a downward trend and the beginning of a recovery phase. With 28% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply in the hands of short-term holders, if these coins transition into long-term holders, it could significantly contribute to Bitcoin’s price surge beyond $150,000. Related Reading: Saylor’s Strategy Adds $1.9 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin To Growing Portfolio Decreasing Selling Pressure and What It Means for Bitcoin’s Future Another CryptoQuant analyst, CryptoOnchain, has pointed out that the selling pressure from short-term holders is indeed decreasing, as reflected in both the Short-Term SOPR chart and the UTXO Age Band for holders between one to three months. The data shows a decrease in Bitcoin being moved by this group, suggesting that short-term investors are holding off on making further sales. This aligns with Onchained’s view that a reduction in short-term selling pressure could signal a market bottom.

As we approach a crucial phase for Bitcoin, all eyes will be on these short-term holders and the potential for a longer-term shift in sentiment.

According to an April 2 announcement, Sony Electronics Singapore now accepts USDC (USDC) stablecoin payments through an integration with the Crypto.com exchange. Crypto.com Singapore general manager Chin Tah Ang said: “We’re pushing to make paying in crypto more mainstream and partnering with a well-established and forward-thinking brand like Sony Electronics Singapore further raises awareness of how simple it can be to pay for everyday goods and services using crypto.” This is far from the only high-profile partnership that Crypto.com has been recently able to score. At the end of 2024, the mobile-first crypto exchange partnered with Deutsche Bank to provide corporate banking services across Asian-Pacific markets, covering regions such as Singapore, Australia, and Hong Kong.

Late February reports indicate that Metro, a publicly listed department store chain in Singapore, has enabled its customers to pay for products using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt. The initiatives also follow January reports that Singapore is becoming a key destination for Web3 companies after it issued twice as many crypto licenses in 2024 as in the previous year. William Croisettier, chief growth officer of ZKcandy, told Cointelegraph at the time: “The country adopts a risk-adjusted approach to crypto regulation, focusing on the biggest digital currencies to protect investors. Singapore also makes it easy for new crypto firms to interact with local banking partners, a provision considered a luxury in other parts of the world.” Related: Singapore Exchange to list Bitcoin futures in H2 2025: Report An emerging crypto hub In late November, the crypto-friendly digital bank Singapore Gulf Bank reportedly sought a fund injection of at least $50 million as it plans to acquire a stablecoin payments company in 2025 .

Terrifying Crypto Analysis Emerges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-market-low-crypto-analysis/,"Is the cryptocurrency world bracing for another significant dip? Whispers of a potential Bitcoin market low are circulating again, fueled by a recent analysis that draws parallels to past market downturns. For those watching the volatile crypto markets with bated breath, this news could be a critical signal. Let’s dive into the details of this analysis and understand what it could mean for your Bitcoin holdings. Is Bitcoin Really Nearing a Market Low? Decoding the Crypto Analysis According to a recent post by crypto analyst Bilal Huseynov on CryptoQuant, a historical pattern might be repeating itself, suggesting that Bitcoin market low could be on the horizon. Huseynov points to the relationship between two key on-chain metrics: Realized Cap and Thermo Cap. This isn’t just speculative chatter; it’s based on observable data and historical market behavior. But what exactly are these metrics, and why are they causing a stir? Unpacking Realized Cap and Thermo Cap: Essential Crypto Analysis Tools To understand the analyst’s perspective on the potential Bitcoin market low , we need to grasp the concepts of Realized Cap and Thermo Cap. Think of them as unique lenses through which we can view the Bitcoin network’s health and investor sentiment. Realized Cap: Imagine tracking the price of every Bitcoin the last time it moved between wallets. Realized Cap is essentially the sum of all these prices. It’s a measure of the aggregate value investors paid for their Bitcoin holdings, providing a more nuanced view of the market’s capitalization than just multiplying the current price by the total supply. It reflects the ‘realized’ value locked into Bitcoin by investors. Thermo Cap: This metric represents the total security spend on the Bitcoin network since its inception. In simpler terms, it’s the cumulative sum of all block rewards and transaction fees paid to miners. Thermo Cap can be seen as the total capital injected into the Bitcoin ecosystem through mining activities. It represents the ‘thermodynamic’ energy expended to secure the network. The analyst’s observation hinges on the relationship between these two caps. Historically, significant market events have occurred when these metrics interact in specific ways. Let’s explore the concerning pattern highlighted in this crypto analysis . The Terrifying ‘Death Cross’ and BTC Price Prediction: Echoes of the $16,000 Low? Huseynov’s crypto analysis highlights a concerning trend: the Realized Cap is currently nearing the Thermo Cap. This proximity itself isn’t necessarily alarming, but the potential outcome is. He suggests that if the Realized Cap were to fall *below* the Thermo Cap – a scenario often referred to as a ‘death cross’ in this context – it could trigger a significant price correction, potentially pushing Bitcoin towards a Bitcoin market low . Why is this ‘death cross’ so significant for BTC price prediction ? Historical Precedent: The analyst points to a past instance when the Realized Cap dipped below the Thermo Cap. This event coincided with Bitcoin’s price plummeting to $16,000. This historical echo raises concerns that a similar pattern could lead to a similar price drop. Market Sentiment Indicator: When Realized Cap falls below Thermo Cap, it could suggest that the market’s perceived value (Realized Cap) is lower than the total investment in securing the network (Thermo Cap). This imbalance can reflect weakened investor confidence and increased selling pressure. Potential Price Target: While not explicitly stated as a definitive prediction, Huseynov’s analysis implies that if the ‘death cross’ materializes, we could see a substantial price decrease. The mention of the $16,000 low as a historical reference point is particularly noteworthy, even if the analyst tentatively mentions a higher figure of $75,000 in the original content (which seems to be a typo and likely should be much lower given the context of a market low and the $16,000 reference). Is History Repeating Itself? Lessons from Previous Bitcoin Market Lows The analyst’s comparison to the $16,000 Bitcoin market low is crucial. It forces us to consider whether market cycles and on-chain indicators are indeed cyclical. If history is any guide, understanding past market bottoms can provide valuable insights. Let’s briefly revisit the circumstances surrounding the previous instance when Realized Cap fell below Thermo Cap: Market Conditions: The previous occurrence likely coincided with a bear market phase, characterized by prolonged price declines and negative market sentiment. It’s important to assess whether current market conditions bear similarities to that period. External Factors: Macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and significant industry events can all influence Bitcoin’s price. Analyzing the external landscape alongside on-chain metrics is essential for a comprehensive crypto analysis . Investor Behavior: Understanding how investors reacted during past market lows can offer clues about potential future behavior. Are long-term holders remaining steadfast, or are we seeing signs of capitulation? While historical patterns can be informative, it’s crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is dynamic and evolving. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. However, these patterns do provide valuable context for navigating the current market. Navigating the Potential Bitcoin Market Low: Actionable Insights So, what should you do with this information? Is it time to panic sell, or is there an opportunity amidst the potential Bitcoin market low ? Here are some actionable insights based on this crypto analysis : Stay Informed: Continuously monitor on-chain metrics like Realized Cap and Thermo Cap, alongside traditional market indicators. Platforms like CryptoQuant and others provide real-time data and analytical tools. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. Diversification and proper risk management strategies are paramount. Consider DCA: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) can be a prudent strategy during market downturns. By investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, you can average out your entry price and potentially benefit from price rebounds. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that Bitcoin has historically recovered from significant price drops. If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, a market downturn could present a buying opportunity. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re unsure how to interpret this analysis or manage your crypto portfolio, consult with a qualified financial advisor. Conclusion: Brace for Volatility, But Stay Informed The crypto analysis suggesting a potential Bitcoin market low based on the Realized Cap and Thermo Cap pattern is a noteworthy development. While it doesn’t guarantee a price crash, it serves as a terrifying reminder of the market’s inherent volatility and cyclical nature. Staying informed, understanding key on-chain metrics, and managing risk are crucial for navigating these uncertain times. Whether this analysis proves accurate remains to be seen, but it underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. Keep a close watch on market movements and be prepared for potential price swings.

In findings published on X on April 1, onchain analytics firm Glassnode revealed that $110,000 was not high enough to make many hodlers sell. Glassnode: 2020 Bitcoin buyers “still holding” Bitcoiners who entered the market between three and five years ago have retained their holdings despite significant BTC price upside. According to Glassnode, this investor cohort, with a cost basis from anywhere between the 2020 lows of $3,600 and the 2021 highs of $69,000, is still hodling. “Although the share of wealth held by investors who bought $BTC 3–5 years ago has declined by 3 percentage points since its November 2024 peak, it remains at historically elevated levels,” it reports. “This suggests that the majority of investors who entered between 2020 and 2022 are still holding.” Bitcoin Realized Cap HODL Waves data. Source: Glassnode An accompanying chart shows data from the Realized Cap HODL Waves metric, which splits the BTC supply into sections based on when each coin last moved onchain. Using this, Glassnode is able to draw a distinction between the 2020-22 buyers and those who came immediately before them. “In contrast, over two-thirds of those who had bought $BTC 5–7 years ago exited their positions by the December 2024 peak,” it reveals, reflecting their lower cost basis. Speculators stay cool at BTC price highs As Cointelegraph reported , more recent buyers, who form the more speculative investor cohort known as short-term holders (STHs), have proven much more sensitive to recent BTC price volatility. Related: Bitcoin sellers 'dry up' as weekly exchange inflows near 2-year low Episodes of panic selling have occurred throughout the past six months as BTC/USD hit new record highs and then fell by up to 30% . Continuing, Glassnode argued that current STH participation does not suggest a speculative frenzy — something common to previous BTC price cycle tops. “Short-Term Holders currently hold around 40% of Bitcoin's network wealth, after peaking near 50% earlier in 2025,” it commented alongside Realized Cap HODL Waves data on March 31. “This remains significantly below prior cycle tops, where new investor wealth peaked at 70–90%, suggesting a more tempered and distributed bull market so far.” Bitcoin Realized Cap HODL Waves.

The sale, completed on Apr. 1, 2025, raised $1.48 billion after fees, according to the company’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. GameStop was initially aiming to raise $1.3 billion amid plans to add Bitcoin to its list of treasury assets. The sale surpassed expectations, with an extra $200 million in notes sold. The company stated the funds will be used for general corporate purposes, including Bitcoin purchases. GameStop’s decision to invest in Bitcoin is part of a larger trend whereby publicly traded companies are diversifying their balance sheets by holding the most popular cryptocurrency. Similar to Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which holds the largest Bitcoin treasury, GameStop has adopted the use of convertible senior notes to fund Bitcoin purchases. Strategy currently holds more than 500,000 Bitcoin, which is valued at over $45 billion.

In a new CNBC interview, Lee says markets are “really oversold” currently following a correction that has come amid fears over US tariffs. According to the Fundstrat co-founder, investors are currently facing uncertainty, but there will be clarity after April 2nd that could relieve the selling pressure. “And this week, I think into April 2nd, investors have three things on their minds. One is, they just don’t know what the tariffs look like. They don’t know if it’s going to damage the economy. And I think, third, many are just a little terrified of the policies of the White House. But post-Wednesday, I think markets are going to have some visibility. That allows us to take some of the selling pressure off. So yes, I think it’s possible that instead of us breaking down here and seeing markets under further pressure, we actually got the right pieces for a bottom.” According to Lee, America’s economy is “going to come out okay” after the imposition of the proposed tariffs by the US administration scheduled for April 2nd, a day that President Donald Trump has dubbed “Liberation Day.” “Brexit’s [the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union] an example, you know. Brexit happened and the UK economy emerged okay. It didn’t have a huge recession and the stock market did okay.

The world of cryptocurrency payments just got a whole lot more exciting. In a groundbreaking move that’s set to redefine online shopping in the Lion City, Crypto.com, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has joined forces with tech giant Sony Electronics to bring crypto payments to Sony’s online store for Singaporean users. This partnership, announced via a buzzworthy post on X (formerly Twitter), marks a significant step forward for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption and offers a seamless way for Singaporean crypto enthusiasts to spend their digital assets on cutting-edge electronics. Why is Crypto Payment a Revolutionary Leap for Online Shopping in Singapore? Imagine buying that sleek new Sony Bravia TV or those noise-canceling headphones you’ve been eyeing, and paying for it all with your favorite cryptocurrency. Sounds futuristic, right? Well, for Singaporean users, this future is now a reality thanks to the collaboration between Crypto.com and Sony. But why is this such a big deal? Let’s break down the electrifying benefits of embracing crypto payments for online shopping: Unlocking Your Crypto Wealth: For years, many crypto holders have sought practical ways to use their digital assets beyond trading and investment. This partnership provides a tangible avenue to utilize cryptocurrency for everyday purchases, directly converting your crypto holdings into real-world goods. Seamless and Speedy Transactions: Crypto.com Pay is known for its efficiency and speed. Say goodbye to lengthy bank transfers or credit card processing times. Crypto transactions are typically faster, offering a smoother checkout experience on the Sony online store. Lower Transaction Fees (Potentially): Depending on the cryptocurrency used and network conditions, crypto transactions can sometimes incur lower fees compared to traditional payment methods, especially for international transactions. This could translate to savings for savvy shoppers. Enhanced Privacy and Security: Cryptocurrency transactions offer a layer of privacy, as they don’t require sharing sensitive banking details with the merchant. Furthermore, blockchain technology underpins crypto, providing robust security for transactions. Expanding Cryptocurrency Adoption in Singapore: This move by Sony, a globally recognized brand, sends a powerful message about the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate form of payment. It encourages wider cryptocurrency adoption within Singapore and potentially beyond. Sony Singapore Embraces the Future of Finance: What’s in it for You? Sony’s decision to integrate Crypto.com Pay is more than just a trendy move; it’s a strategic alignment with the evolving financial landscape. By embracing cryptocurrency adoption , Sony is: Catering to a Growing Market Segment: A significant and increasing number of Singaporeans are involved in the cryptocurrency space. By accepting crypto payments, Sony taps into this tech-savvy demographic and caters to their preferred payment methods. Positioning Themselves as Innovation Leaders: In a competitive market, being at the forefront of technological adoption is crucial. Sony is solidifying its image as a forward-thinking brand that embraces innovation and adapts to changing consumer preferences. Expanding Payment Options and Customer Convenience: Offering diverse payment methods enhances customer convenience and accessibility. Crypto.com Pay adds another valuable option for customers, making the purchasing process more flexible. Potentially Attracting International Customers: While initially for Singapore users, this integration could pave the way for wider crypto payment adoption across Sony’s global online stores in the future, attracting a broader international customer base. How Can You Dive into Crypto Payments on Sony’s Online Store with Crypto.com Pay? Ready to experience the future of online shopping? Using Crypto.com Pay at Sony’s online store is designed to be user-friendly. Here’s a simplified guide to get you started: Ensure You Have a Crypto.com Account and App: If you’re not already a Crypto.com user, you’ll need to sign up and download the Crypto.com app. This is your gateway to managing your cryptocurrency and utilizing Crypto.com Pay . Fund Your Crypto.com Wallet: You’ll need cryptocurrency in your Crypto.com wallet to make payments. You can deposit crypto from other wallets or purchase crypto directly within the Crypto.com app. Shop on Sony Singapore’s Online Store: Browse Sony’s online store and add your desired products to your cart, just like any other online shopping experience. Select Crypto.com Pay at Checkout: During the checkout process, you should see Crypto.com Pay as a payment option. Select this option. Complete the Payment via the Crypto.com App: You’ll likely be redirected or prompted to use your Crypto.com app to authorize the payment. This might involve scanning a QR code or confirming the transaction details within the app. Enjoy Your New Sony Gadgets! Once the payment is confirmed via Crypto.com Pay , your order is placed, and you’re one step closer to enjoying your new Sony products purchased with cryptocurrency! Navigating the Horizon: Are There Any Bumps on the Crypto Payment Road? While the integration of crypto payments is undeniably exciting, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Challenge Consideration Cryptocurrency Volatility: The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate. The price of the crypto you use to pay might change between the time you add items to your cart and complete the transaction. However, for everyday purchases, these fluctuations are often minimal and short-lived. Limited Cryptocurrency Options (Initially): It’s possible that initially, only certain cryptocurrencies will be supported via Crypto.com Pay on the Sony store. Users might need to use specific cryptocurrencies for transactions. It’s advisable to check which cryptocurrencies are accepted at the time of purchase. User Adoption and Education: While cryptocurrency adoption is growing, not everyone is familiar with using crypto for payments. Education and clear instructions from both Crypto.com and Sony will be crucial to ensure smooth user adoption and address any initial hesitancy. Regulatory Landscape: Cryptocurrency regulations are still evolving globally. Businesses need to navigate the regulatory landscape to ensure compliance and provide secure and legitimate crypto payment options. Despite these potential challenges, the overall outlook for crypto payments in e-commerce, especially in digitally-forward Singapore, is incredibly promising. The partnership between Crypto.com and Sony Singapore is a testament to this exciting trajectory. The Dawn of a New Payment Era The collaboration between Crypto.com and Sony Electronics to enable crypto payments for Singaporean users is a monumental leap towards mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. It’s a win-win situation: consumers gain greater flexibility and utility from their crypto holdings, while Sony positions itself as a pioneer in embracing innovative payment solutions. As cryptocurrency adoption continues its upward trend, expect to see more partnerships like this emerge, reshaping the future of online retail and how we transact in the digital age. Singapore is once again at the forefront of financial innovation, and this exciting development is just the beginning.

Details",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-faces-short-term-pullback-against-ethereum-a-recovery-looms-details/,"CrediBull Crypto (@CredibleCrypto), a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, has provided an updated outlook on the XRP/ETH trading pair, waiting for a temporary correction before further upward movement. After accurately predicting a 250% rally for XRP against Ethereum late last year, the analyst now expects a pullback in the short to mid-term. After nailing the the 250+% rally on $XRP /$ETH, my last update stated: ""Since we are now at range highs after a pretty massive move, it's possible we get a pullback soon. If we do, nothing to be concerned about."" We have since printed multiple weekly bearish divs on the pairing… https://t.co/kV5Ty4ZMdB pic.twitter.com/VjrvAj1IFw — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) March 31, 2025 Short-Term Pullback Expected for XRP/ETH In early March, CrediBull Crypto noted that the trading pair had reclaimed and retested a 4-year-long range, reaching a level not seen since 2021 and setting the stage for a significant rally. The asset accomplished this feat around the same time as the dismissal of the Ripple lawsuit , but its progress has stalled. CrediBull Crypto has observed multiple bearish divergences on the chart, signaling a potential correction. In his update from early March, he acknowledged that the digital asset had reached range highs following a substantial rally and stated that it could experience a pullback against ETH soon. XRP Expected to Decline While Ethereum Gains Strength The analyst also highlighted the relationship between XRP and Ethereum’s broader market positioning. He noted that XRP is likely to “tag range lows at $1.60-$1.80” while Ethereum remains in a massive higher timeframe demand zone. This suggests that ETH may perform better in the short term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The accompanying chart provided by CrediBull Crypto outlines a projected price movement in which XRP/ETH corrects further before resuming its upward trend. The expected decline would allow the market to reset before XRP continues its next major impulse move. Long-Term Bullish Outlook Remains Intact Despite the anticipated pullback, CrediBull Crypto remains optimistic about XRP’s long-term trajectory. The correction is viewed as a natural phase within a broader bullish cycle, with further upside expected once the market stabilizes. Commenting on the upcoming decline, he stated, “If we do, nothing to be concerned about,” reinforcing confidence in the digital asset’s future performance. While Ethereum is expected to see stronger short-term momentum, the long-term outlook for XRP remains positive, with a potential continuation of its upward trend once the correction phase concludes. One important factor that could aid XRP’s recovery is the recent market trend of investors dumping ETH for the digital asset. Another well-respected analyst recently drew attention to this phenomenon as the massive outflow caused ETH to fall below a crucial resistance level, and more investors dump the asset, it could fall further, giving XRP space for a swift recovery.

On Wednesday, April 2, burn statistics signaled that over 115 million coins were removed from the circulating supply, whereas transactions on the Layer 2 blockchain scaled new heights by topping 1 billion. In response, crypto market participants are now eyeing a highly bullish future for one of the most renowned dog-themed meme tokens amid bolstered market dynamics. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Soars Over 12,000%, Supply Takes A Blow Data from the official tracker Shibburn indicated that the SHIB burn rate surged 12,278.89% in the past 24 hours. Per the data, this massive surge rode the back of 115.89 million tokens removed from the supply in just a day. Source: Shibburn, X Notably, the burn mechanism permanently reduces the circulating supply by transferring tokens to a null address. As a response, traders and investors weigh bullishness on the asset’s future prospects by considering the law of supply and demand. With today’s massive burn saga, the total number of coins killed to date reached 410.72 trillion SHIB. Meanwhile, 584.35 trillion tokens still remain in circulation. Further, it’s worth mentioning that the wallet address “0xc439514852e132c” single-handedly burnt 92.64 million tokens, aiding the surge. The impact of the constant Shiba Inu burns has kept investors hopeful about a price rally ahead. On the other hand, the coin’s layer 2 blockchain, Shibarium, is making monumental strides. Shibarium Transaction Volume Hits 1B SHIB’s marketing lead Lucie further revealed on X that the transaction volume on the Layer 2 blockchain has crossed the 1 billion mark. This chronicle has added to the optimistic buzz orbiting the crypto as it underscores its network’s rising popularity. Soon after its launch in August 2023, the L2 network gained significant traction with its vast offerings. Ranging from seamless transactions and gaming opportunities to utilities with tokens such as TREAT, LEASH, and BONE, the L2 network offers users top-notch services in the Web3 space. The rising transactions add to bullish market sentiments, accompanying the Shiba Inu burn rate upswing. Is SHIB Price Gearing Up For A Rally? Despite the bullish advancements, SHIB price traded down nearly 4% today, resting at $0.00001224. The meme coin hit a low and a peak of $0.00001214 and $0.00001312 in the past 24 hours. Besides, the weekly chart also indicated a 20% crash in value. This bearish action has kept investors cautious over future aspects despite the Shiba Inu burn surge and Shibarium advancement. Source: Nebraskangooner, X Simultaneously, a renowned crypto market trader going by the name Nebraskangooner revealed that SHIB continues to reject resistance just like other altcoins. Crypto market participants continue to thoroughly monitor the token, given that some market stats indicate a bullish stance whilst the price wanes. Also, CoinGape reported that the coin’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, shared a cryptic location update recently.

Crypto fund founder slams BTC as ‘out-of-date’,https://finbold.com/is-bitcoin-dead-crypto-fund-founder-slams-btc-as-out-of-date/,"As Bitcoin ( BTC ) attempted yet another rally towards $85,000 on April 1, Justin Bons, the founder and CIO of Cyber Capital, took to X to bash the world’s premier cryptocurrency . Specifically, Bons argued that BTC is, in 2025, a mere outdated dinosaur that, while being a successful experiment, is no longer in a position to disrupt the world of finance in any way, shape, or form. The Cyber Capital founder highlighted Bitcoin’s lack of ability to process numerous transitions per second, describing them as severely lagging behind other blockchains , and warned the flaw could easily prove catastrophic for investors and mining companies . He also warned that Bitcoin’s security has been collapsing in recent years, thus posing a danger to the entire ecosystem. He pointed toward cryptocurrency’s governance as the main culprit for its failures. BTC is a dinosaur: The tech is ridiculously out-of-date! At an embarrassing max 7 Transaction-Per-Second, it is in a position to disrupt nothing. BTC’s collapsing security kill scarcity guarantees, putting users in danger! From utility to economics, BTC is a failure. Is Bitcoin an existential threat to other crypto? Indeed, Bons opined that ‘BTC has been captured by a relatively small group.’ However, the founder of Cyber Capital also highlighted that the problem is not the fault of traders and enthusiasts but the issue with the blockchain’s design. Lastly, Justin Bons concluded that the world’s premier cryptocurrency has become a ‘game’ he is refusing to play and warned that Bitcoin has become an existential threat to other digital assets. Simultaneously, he urged the community to stop ‘paying lip service to such a deeply flawed network,’ explaining in no uncertain terms he deems BTC to be running on technology that is ‘ridiculously out-of-date.‘ Are crypto traders abandoning Bitcoin? The argument that Bitcoin is severely outdated by 2025 is nothing new, and the community, as well as the industry’s institutional actors, have been working on solutions such as layer two networks. Thus far, the criticism has hardly impacted BTC’s dominance, though some factors indicate traders are losing confidence. For example, the number of active Bitcoin addresses at the beginning of March of the current year was akin to the numbers seen in 2018 and far below the 2021 highs, according to the data Finbold retrieved from Glassnode on April 2. Bitcoin price and active addresses chart. Source: Glassnode The situation is all the more stark given that, even with the 2025 turbulence and the threat that the bull cycle will suffer an early end due to external pressure, Bitcoin’s price is – at $84,648 – higher than it was at any point prior to the November 2024 rally.

As phase four tokens go for $0.025 — only a 20% increase at $0.03 away in the next phase — investors are directing their gaze. So the big question is, how is a presale token putting a top-10 cryptocurrency in the dust? XRP’s Current Position Ripple (XRP) now meets a crucial inflection point. The head-and-shoulders pattern outlined by analysts such as Ali Martinez indicates a possible 32% decline to $1.50 if support at $2 gives out. Even Peter Brandt’s bearish $1.07 target only heightens these fears compared to CryptoELITES’ bullish $15 prediction. Such a divide is indicative of XRP’s dependence on speculative heat rather than real utility. The lack of immediate use cases other than cross-border transactions also craters confidence. A breakout above 3 dollars could dismiss bearish opinions, before the way is not free of volatility. For risk-averse participants, XRP’s prevailing conditions create more anxiety than comfort. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) On the Rise Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes to the rescue of speculative market disturbances with efficient and managed growth. Phase four of its presale is currently underway, with tokens priced at $0.025, before a planned increase to $0.03. Early buyers guarantee (at its $0.06 exchange listing) 140% return — a figure based on publicly available tokenomics. Excluding launch, analysts forecast a moonshot to $3.50 in 2025, equivalent to a 13,900% increase from phase 1. Demand is driven by the protocol’s lending model. Users deposit assets like ETH or DAI and receive mtTokens, which bear interest and grow in value over time. A buy & distribute system takes the revenue of the platform and uses it to buy back MUTM, redistributing the tokens to the stakers, and creating a continued upward pressure on the price. Couple this with the options of overcollateralized lending and peer-to-peer lending. Security Drives Mutuum Finance (MUTM)— When it comes to Defi, security is pretty important, and Mutuum Finance recognized the need for an audit, on 1st October 2023, Mutuum Finance underwent a Certik audit to ensure the integrity of the smart contract. Results will be released shortly afterwards through official channels, further ensuring the investors’ trust. The quick progression of the presale (fourth phase is almost full) proves urgency! The trade off of waiting would be not catching it at the $0.025 price point before a potential 20% increase. Changing Tastes in a Tumultuous Market While XRP currently is bound to emotional currents and legal tides, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has quantifiable progress. The presale’s $6 million pull and 7.7k holder base are a testament to grass-roots confidence lacking in larger, staid projects. As phase four fills rapidly, the opportunity for pre-listing profits shrinks. Combining DeFi ingenuity with measured expansion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a lucid path from presale to post-launch ease of mind. XRP trading, get ready for the rollercoaster of your life MUTM investors suppress interest rate volatility and lock in perfect rates In the uncertain crypto market of 2025, predictability is often more powerful than hype. Lock Up A Position While Phase Four Is Open In today’s speculative climate, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) strikes a balance between risk and reward when rarely done. Pending Certik audit completion adds another credibility aspect, and tiered presale structure ensures those first in will net the biggest profits. As phase four approaches with its 20% price rise, delay can cost huge gains. MUTM is a stable alternative for users who want to stay away from volatile assets like XRP. Act now — before the next surge.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) as well as other altcoins have likely already priced in a lot of the U.S. recession fears, but there’s still a chance for some more downside if the recession actually happens. In a recent research report , analysts at crypto management firm Bitwise outlined that Bitcoin’s performance during past recessions has shown mixed results. For instance, during the 2020 Covid recession, Bitcoin sold off by over 50% but still ended the year up more than 300%.

Based on this case, the analysts say it is “quite likely that Bitcoin is likely going to stay under pressure if equity downside continues.” So far, Bitcoin has already experienced a drawdown of about 27% from its peak, suggesting most of the recession fears are reflected in the price. “The key takeaway here is that U.S. recession fears are already being priced into bitcoin and other cryptoassets as we speak but there might still be a little bit more downside left if a U.S. recession actually materialises.” Bitwise Yet, the analysts also see signs of “peak uncertainty,” noting that U.S. economic policy uncertainty is “as high as during Covid” and that “Google search trends for the word ‘recession’ also as high as during Covid.” As analysts at QCP Capital noted earlier in a Telegram post , markets are now focused on President Donald Trump’s upcoming “Liberation Day” announcement on April 2, where he is expected to unveil new reciprocal tariffs. The analysts pointed out that with consumer confidence at a 12-year low and equities already under pressure from a 4-5% weekly drawdown, aggressive trade policies could deepen recession fears and weigh further on risk assets, including Bitcoin.

Several community members shared theories for the incident, speculating that recent adjustments in the exchange’s position limits could be responsible. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin (BTC) Poised For A Q2 Recovery? Analyst Points To 2017 Similarities Altcoins See Q2 Opening Crash On Binance Multiple altcoins saw a peculiar start to Q2 after their price tanked on Binance on Tuesday morning. The crypto community raised the alarm after Solana-based memecoin and AI Agent token Act I: The AI Prophecy (ACT) plunged around 50% in less than an hour. The cryptocurrency, which once had a market capitalization of $722 million, has moved sideways for most of March, hovering between the $0.18-$0.19 price range until today. In 30 minutes, ACT crashed from the $0.189 mark to the $0.087 level, registering a 53% fall. Similarly, the DEXE, KAVA, DF, HIPPO, BANANAS31, LUMIA, TST, and QUICK tokens also recorded a sudden price drop, losing between 10% and 35% of their value in an hour. ACT’s team acknowledged the incident, stating, “Dear ACT community, we want to assure you that we’re fully aware of the current situation. Our team is actively investigating and working collaboratively with all relevant parties to address this matter.” The post also noted they had begun developing a response plan alongside their trusted partners. Analyst Altcoin Sherpa suggested that a price bounce for ACT seems likely but noted that “ppl might realize that they don’t really want to hold this coin and view this as a forced rebalance event. Nobody buying. Nobody selling.” No April Fool’s Joke As Binance posted about a different April Fool’s joke, investors started to speculate what caused the sudden bleeding, with some joking that the prank had gone too far. The crypto community guessed that Wintermute was responsible for the Altcoin massacre, as it reportedly liquidated several of its positions today. Nonetheless, the trading firm’s CEO, Evgeny Gaevoy, denied the rumors, stating, “Not us fwiw, but also curious about that postmortem.” Meanwhile, Lookonchain suggested that Binance’s recent update of its leverage and margin tiers on several altcoins, including ACT, could have been the reason for the token crash. Six hours later, Binance Customer Support replied to Wu Blockchain’s report, revealing that the reason for the dump was that three VIP users cross-sold tokens worth 514,000 USDT in the spot market and a non-VIP user transferred a large amount of ACT from other platforms and sold 540,000 USDT worth of the token in a short period. As a result, the cryptocurrency’s price dropped, which led some users to close their futures contracts, triggering the decline of other altcoins. The crypto exchange pointed out that they recently took “the initiative to take preventive measures to adjust leverage multiples downward.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Calls Dogecoin Chart A ‘Beauty’ As Key Indicators Align “Binance Contracts has recently issued consecutive adjustment announcements for the ACTUSDT perpetual contract, during which there was no market movement and no active reduction of any user’s position,” the post detailed.

Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) 2025 price rally may be boosted by the US Federal Reserve pivoting to quantitative easing (QE) , when the Fed buys bonds and pumps money into the economy to lower interest rates and encourage spending during difficult financial conditions. “Bitcoin trades solely based on the market expectation for the future supply of fiat,” according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer of Maelstrom. Hayes wrote in an April 1 Substack post : “If my analysis of the Fed’s major pivot from QT to QE for treasuries is correct, then Bitcoin hit a local low of $76,500 last month, and now we begin the ascent to $250,000 by year-end.” The Fed reduced the Treasury runoff cap to $5 billion per month from $25 billion effective April 1, while keeping mortgage-backed securities (MBS) runoff steady at $35 billion. The Fed may allow the MBS roll off without replacement and the excess principal payment might be reinvested into Treasurys, according to comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell published by Reuters. “Mathematically, that keeps the Fed balance sheet constant; however, that is treasury QE. Bitcoin will scream higher once this is formally announced,” added Hayes.

The pace of capital deployment will increase or decrease depending on the accuracy of his predictions. “I still believe Bitcoin can hit $250,000 by year-end because now that the BBC has put Powell in his place, the Fed will flood the market with dollars,” wrote Hayes, adding: “That allows Xi Jinping to instruct the PBOC to stop tightening monetary conditions onshore to defend the dollar-yuan exchange rate, which increases the net quantity of yuan.” Despite the optimistic prediction, many market participants are betting on a lower Bitcoin price top for the end of 2025.

These days, companies are spending billions of dollars annually on blunt, ineffective advertising campaigns with very little to show for it. Such challenges call for drastic solutions, and Uber has responded by turning to the XION blockchain’s novel Web3 technologies to power a much more efficient, verifiable and incentivized customer acquisition strategy that’s already showing positive results. Traditional Ads Are Losing Effectiveness Over the years, Uber has noticed that its online advertising campaigns are slowly but surely losing their impact. Its new user acquisition costs have increased steadily as a result of various challenges faced by the traditional online advertising industry. These days, the impact of online ads is significantly lower than what it used to be, due to intensified competition with every brand throwing hundreds of thousands of dollars at the same ad platforms. Brands are also dealing with rising “ad fatigue”, where consumers are, to be frank, becoming seriously disconcerted by the invasive ads that seem to follow them across every website they visit. The use of ad blockers has increased, and more consumers than ever are choosing to purposely avoid clicking on ads. That’s led to declining rates of engagement, which forces brands to spend more than ever before to keep up with their user acquisition targets. In addition, companies also have to deal with tougher regulations. Privacy laws such as Europe’s GDPR and California’s CCPA, and Apple’s new App Tracking Transparency policy have dented brands’ ability to effectively target consumers. There’s also the growing ad fraud phenomenon they have to navigate, with an estimated $84 billion worth of advertising spend lost to fake ad impressions in 2023. Faced with these challenges, Uber last year came to the conclusion that traditional online advertising is no longer sustainable. It was a stark realization that led it to implement an entirely different customer acquisition strategy that’s only possible with Web3 technologies. Web3 Incentivizes User Engagement Uber’s revolutionary solution was to launch an entirely new user acquisition strategy based on offering powerful incentives to high-value targets using an app known as EarnOS , powered by the XION blockchain. EarnOS makes full use of Web3’s innovative capabilities, allowing Uber to target customers of rival brands such as Bolt, Lyft and Grab. Those users can securely connect their accounts to EarnOS to verify their ride histories, and in return for providing this verifiable data, brands like Uber can offer them tempting rewards and discounts in return for using its service. The beauty of this approach is that it means Uber can target only the most likely prospects – consumers who are already using ride-sharing services. It’s much more efficient than relying on “hit and miss” ad impressions, which seek to lure in less-likely customer prospects. With its Web3 campaign, Uber enables riders who use its services to enter regular sweepstakes, with the number of entries corresponding to how many times they ride with one of its competitors. By doing so, it can engage riders who are substantially more likely to switch from one of its rivals to use its own services. To reassure consumers that their privacy is preserved, Uber points out that EarnOS uses a cryptographic technology called “zero-knowledge proofs”, which allows for their ride histories to be verified while preserving their anonymity. What’s more, consumers can retain full control of their information and choose who they want to share it with. EarnOS also helps Uber to engage with consumers over the longer-term, as it can offer ongoing incentives to ensure they continue to use its services on a regular basis. The more consumers use its ride sharing services, the greater the rewards they can earn. It fundamentally changes the nature of Uber’s marketing strategy from passive, ad-based customer acquisition to one that rewards user engagement. Blockchain Abstraction Is Key Uber’s next-generation customer acquisition campaign has only been made possible recently thanks to XION’s incredible innovations in blockchain abstraction . Until recently, interacting with blockchain has always required a high-degree of technical skills on the part of the end user, limiting its effectiveness. For instance, blockchain users are required to create a crypto wallet and secure it with a seed phrase, and then they need to go through the drama of signing up to a crypto exchange, including KYC, to be able to buy the cryptocurrencies required to use blockchain services. XION changes that by abstracting away these complexities. With it, users can create a non-custodial account (really a blockchain wallet) using an email and password, so there’s no more seed phrase to worry about. They can use that account with every single app in XION’s ecosystem, and they don’t have to worry about buying different crypto tokens or paying gas fees or waiting for transactions to process. Everything is simplified to the extent that they won’t even know they’re using a blockchain-based platform. It’s Web3, but not as we know it. Next-Generation User Acquisition By providing Web3 capabilities with a Web2-like user experience, XION can potentially transform the nature of customer acquisition across every industry, helping hundreds of brands to shift to a much more effective, laser-targeted, incentivized engagement model with verifiable results. It provides a way for brands to reward users located anywhere in the world, and they won’t even need a bank account or have to worry about expensive cross-border transactions, as these rewards can be paid out in blockchain-based stablecoins that can be sent anywhere in the world instantly. All this while preserving user’s full anonymity, ensuring any and all sensitive data is secured. Given the growing ineffectiveness of web-based advertising, blockchain abstraction technologies such as XION’s have the potential to transform internet digital marketing forever, enabling every brand to adopt a strategy based on incentivized, laser-targeted engagement. What’s more, advertising will no longer be a one-way street. Because Web3 allows brands to verify consumer behavior, they’ll be able to measure loyalty and gain insights that allow them to tailor their products and services specifically for different consumer subsets, enhancing their services. Finally, Web3 also solves the ongoing problem of ad fraud by verifying ad impressions, enabling brands to trust the results they’re seeing.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MINING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 09:35:21

The blockchain firm transferred the tokens across multiple wallets, with 700 million coins later locked in escrow. However, the unusual absence of the scheduled April escrow release has left investors questioning Ripple’s motives. XRP News: Ripple’s 1 Billion Move Sparks Speculation Ripple has been the hot topic in the latest XRP news thread with its latest move. The recent transactions have drawn attention due to their sheer volume and an unexpected deviation from its usual schedule. According to Whale Alert, the blockchain company moved 1 billion XRP in multiple transactions, with a significant portion being re-locked in escrow. Whale Alert data showed that the first transfer saw 300 million XRP, valued at approximately $629 million, sent from the Ripple (26) wallet to the “rBg…91m” address. Shortly after, another 200 million XRP worth $420 million was sent to the “rKD…2op” wallet. Interestingly, the “rKD…2op” wallet later received another 170 million XRP in a separate transaction from Ripple (27). Soon after, 330 million XRP was transferred to the “rDd…eCK” address, marking its first transaction since March. These movements totaled 1 billion XRP. Ripple Locked 700 Mln XRP In Escrow Despite moving a massive sum, Ripple locked 700 million XRP back into escrow accounts. The “rKD…2op” wallet, which received 370 million XRP, locked the entire amount in escrow shortly after the transactions. Similarly, the “rDd…eCK” wallet re-locked all 330 million XRP it received. This brought the total escrowed amount to 700 million, leaving 300 million XRP untouched. Currently, the wallet “rBg…91m” holds these funds, likely for operational liquidity. What’s Lies Ahead? These latest transfers have drawn attention mostly due to the absence of the expected 1 billion XRP escrow release in April. Usually, Ripple releases 1 billion XRP on the first day of each month before re-locking a part of the locked amount. However, no such event has been witnessed this month yet. However, with these latest transfers, speculations are high on the potential reason behind the move. Besides, the discussions further amplified as the Ripple Vs SEC case is likely to end in August. Meanwhile, amid the transfer, XRP price today slipped 3% to $2.12, while its one-day volume fell 11% to $3.83 billion. Besides, a recent report indicates that Ripple’s coin price may slip to $1.5 if it loses critical support ahead.

Although ETH has bounced back from the support of $1,800, analysts are weighing the possibility of how low it can fall further from here. Some analysts believe that the largest altcoin is currently facing a make-or-break scenario. Ethereum Price – A Do or Die for Investors? With a 44% drop since the beginning of 2025, Ethereum price has been under a strong bearish grip so far. The monthly chart reveals ETH has been trading within a well-defined channel since 2018, with clear “Top Level” and “Bottom Level” boundaries. Source: Merlijn The Trader The price is currently testing what analysts have labeled the “Make or Break Level” – a mid-channel resistance zone that has historically determined significant price movements. As we can see from the above image, ETH is trading in a critical support range. If the ETH price bounces from here, the road to $20,000 and above is open for the altcoin. However, if it fails to hold this support, it can also crash under $1,000 levels, all the way to $610. For the first time in history, Ethereum has ended all three months of Q1, in negative territory. Market analysts believe that Q2 would be better. Our Ethereum price prediction shows that ETH would continue to flirt around $1,880 levels over the next month. $ETH just had the worst Q1 in history. Q2 is where it all turns around! pic.twitter.com/2JUB8woYXV — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) April 2, 2025 ETH Whale Selloff Intensifies Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported a significant decline in Ethereum whale activity , with large transactions dropping 63.8% since February 25. Over the past two weeks, whales have sold 760,000 ETH, signaling reduced institutional or large-holder participation in the network. Source: Ali Martinez Despite this, some market analysts believe that ETH will soon start outperforming Bitcoin. Popular analyst Michael van de Poppe stated that altcoins will soon start gaining momentum as Gold shows signs of topping out. “If Gold starts to correct in this month, likely ETH starts to outperform Bitcoin,” noted Poppe . Ethereum ETF Flows Disappoint Inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs have also dried up amid poor Ethereum price performance. The net inflows since its inception have slipped under $2.5 billion, showing waning institutional interest in the asset class. This is down from the peak of $3.042 billion on February 25. Experts attribute Ethereum’s struggles to its lack of leadership and innovation in the Web3 space.

Leading trade associations have collectively voiced an urgent appeal to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, urging the appointment of a dedicated crypto special envoy and the formulation of a robust action plan for digital assets and blockchain technology. This bold move, as reported by Cointelegraph, signals a strong desire within the industry to propel the UK to the forefront of the global crypto landscape. But what exactly does this mean for the future of crypto in the UK, and why is this call to action so critical right now? Why a Crypto Special Envoy and Why Now for the UK Crypto Sector? Imagine navigating a complex maze without a map or guide. That’s somewhat analogous to the current situation facing the burgeoning UK crypto sector . While there’s immense potential, the path forward requires clear direction, coordination, and a unified strategy. This is precisely why a coalition of six influential digital economy bodies has penned a letter to Prime Minister Starmer’s special advisor, advocating for a paradigm shift in how the UK approaches digital assets. Drawing inspiration from the United States’ proactive approach, which includes a ‘crypto czar’ to steer policy and innovation, these trade associations believe the UK needs a similar figurehead – a crypto special envoy . This envoy would act as a central point of contact, a champion for the industry, and a key driver in coordinating policy across different government departments. But what are the specific benefits of having such a role? Unified Strategy: A special envoy can ensure a cohesive and consistent approach to crypto regulation UK , fostering a more predictable and business-friendly environment.

BTC 1d chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss the BTC price prediction by giving you its short and price forecasts, and specifically focus on Bitcoin price prediction in April 2025. What is Bitcoin? According to Bitcoin.org , ‘’Bitcoin is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money.’’ Peer-to-peer technology allows BTC to function independently of banks and a central authority; the network handles transaction management and bitcoin issuance collectively. BTC is open-source; everyone can participate, no one owns or controls it, and its design is publicly available. Due to a number of its special features, BTC enables innovative applications that were not possible with earlier payment methods including traditional banks or otherwise. Now let’s discuss BTC price prediction in April 2025 both from a technical point of view and also look into some fundamental factors that could affect the price as well.

All you need to do is make your portfolio and stay under the money in April and May. $Btc pic.twitter.com/n4aYuiZYwR — @CryptoELlTES (@CryptooELITES) March 26, 2025 BTC price factors for April 2025 Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, recently shared her thoughts on the market in an interview with crypto.news , saying that after a brief correction following April 2, she expects the market to stabilize and pave the way for future growth. President Donald Trump had previously promised to implement new tariffs on April 2, calling it a crucial moment for the economy just weeks after the last round rattled markets and sparked recession worries. Market volatility has been greatly influenced by the tariff scenario, as evidenced by the U.S. policy uncertainty index hitting all-time highs. Although trade talks have grown to be a major cause of investor anxiety, many analysts believe that the level of uncertainty may soon reach a high. The increase in gold prices in April 2025 is another significant factor impacting the price of BTC . Gold has long been seen as a safe-haven asset, and rising prices sometimes indicate escalating concerns about a recession. Investors move money from riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies to gold and bonds when they’re looking for stability. The price of BTC and other digital assets may decline as a result of this trend. The Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy will also be very important. The Fed may decrease liquidity and lessen the appeal of riskier assets if it maintains high rates in an effort to fight inflation. In contrast, indications of rate reductions could raise the price of BTC. Opinion may be influenced by the SEC’s position on BTC ETFs, cryptocurrency regulation, and enforcement actions against exchanges. Stricter regulations may result in sell-offs, but clearer regulatory frameworks may encourage institutional adoption.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency including BTC, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a price point that was once considered a very strong support or resistance may become invalid in a very short time. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the price action before having any price expectations for the future of the BTC token. Will Bitcoin go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While BTC is not affected by the aforementioned events in general, it is still hard to determine how high or low BTC will go. Hence, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include increased adoption, global policies, and critical support and resistance levels. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for BTC price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious as no one can accurately predict how high or low BTC can go. Should I invest in Bitcoin? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any BTC price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals and long-term global sentiment which may very well decide the future of BTC.

With investors constantly hunting for projects that promise exponential returns, fresh contenders are making waves. Among them, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is stealing the spotlight with its unique concept and deflationary tokenomics. Meanwhile, Bonk continues to hold its ground as a community-driven sensation, and Osaka Protocol is gaining traction with its AI-powered innovations. As these three projects capture investor attention, the real question is—which one has the highest potential for massive growth? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC ) is turning heads with its aggressive token burn strategy and a presale that’s heating up fast. Designed for long-term sustainability, APC reduces supply weekly by eliminating unsold tokens, making it a deflationary asset primed for scarcity-driven value surges. The presale is already generating a frenzy, with early adopters rushing in before prices climb. Meanwhile, Bonk remains a dominant force in the meme coin sector, while Osaka Protocol is carving a niche in AI-integrated blockchain solutions. This article dives into the latest developments and updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Bonk, and Osaka Protocol. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Surge: How Token Burns Enhance Value The Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) ecosystem employs a strategic token burn mechanism designed to drive long-term value. Every week during the meme coin presale , unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation, increasing scarcity and elevating potential investor gains. Once the presale concludes, any remaining tokens will also be burned, ensuring a deflationary supply model. This burning process helps stabilize demand and reinforces the coin’s long-term growth potential, making Arctic Pablo Coin a standout in the space. All burn transactions are verifiable on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offering full transparency. With fewer tokens in circulation, early investors could benefit from increasing value as supply diminishes. This calculated approach strengthens confidence in the project and aligns with the broader strategy of making Arctic Pablo Coin an elite contender among the best new meme coins for exponential returns. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale Momentum: Act Now Before the Price Jumps The Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC ) meme coin presale is heating up, and investors are racing to secure their holdings before the next price increase. Each phase of the presale brings a higher valuation, creating a golden opportunity for those who enter early. The limited token supply and rising demand indicate that waiting too long could mean missing out on significant potential gains. As the presale progresses, prices continue their upward trajectory, making this moment the best time to get in before the next surge. Priced at $0.000087, Arctic Pablo Coin’s 17th presale stage—Glacial Glade—is already drawing massive attention. Over $2 million raised and a headline-worthy 9,084.48% projected ROI signal serious investor interest. For anyone eyeing meme coin presales with explosive upside, APC is hard to ignore. Bonk: The Community-Driven Dog-Themed Meme Coin Bonk, a popular Solana-based meme coin, has captured the attention of the crypto community with its decentralized and community-focused model. Created as a response to centralized dog coins, Bonk’s distribution model ensured that 50% of its total supply was airdropped to Solana users, fostering a strong and engaged ecosystem. The token has since been widely adopted, driving up trading volumes and maintaining its relevance within the meme coin space. Bonk’s tokenomics and vibrant community have contributed to its steady growth and adoption. It has been integrated into numerous DeFi applications, offering utility beyond its meme status. With ongoing developments, partnerships, and exchange listings, Bonk remains a significant player among emerging meme coins, demonstrating the power of community-driven crypto projects. Osaka Protocol: Bridging Decentralization and AI Technology Osaka Protocol is a rising star in the blockchain and AI integration sector, blending meme coin appeal with cutting-edge technological advancements. The project focuses on decentralization and artificial intelligence, offering a unique ecosystem where smart contracts interact with AI-driven applications. This innovative approach positions Osaka Protocol as a disruptive force in the crypto world, with its native token gaining increasing traction. The protocol aims to enhance blockchain efficiency through AI-powered decision-making, ensuring faster transactions and reduced costs. With strong developer backing and a clear roadmap, Osaka Protocol is poised for sustained growth. As crypto AI projects gain popularity, Osaka stands out as a contender that could redefine the synergy between blockchain and artificial intelligence. Final Thoughts: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge The competition among the best new meme coins for exponential returns is fierce, but Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary model and rapidly selling meme coin presale set it apart. Bonk’s community-driven approach and Osaka Protocol’s AI innovations add variety to the space, offering investors multiple avenues for potential growth. However, Arctic Pablo Coin’s aggressive token burns and presale momentum position it as a top-tier investment opportunity. With prices climbing in each phase, securing APC tokens now is the smartest move for those seeking high-return investments. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs What makes Arctic Pablo Coin a strong investment opportunity? Arctic Pablo Coin’s weekly token burns and its rapidly increasing presale price make it a lucrative investment with strong scarcity-driven potential. Why is Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale gaining so much attention? With limited tokens and increasing demand, investors are securing APC tokens before prices surge in the next phase, driving intense interest. How does Bonk compare to Arctic Pablo Coin? Bonk is community-driven and airdropped widely, while Arctic Pablo Coin features a deflationary burn mechanism that enhances scarcity and value. What sets Osaka Protocol apart in the meme coin space? Osaka Protocol integrates AI technology with blockchain, offering a unique ecosystem beyond typical meme coin projects. How can I buy Arctic Pablo Coin before the next price increase?

Since its last report in September 2024, Google Threat Intelligence Group has observed a rise in DPRK IT workers infiltrating tech and crypto firms in multiple countries across Europe. These individuals use fake identities and create multiple fake personas to secure high-paying jobs at tech and blockchain companies, often using additional fabricated personas for references. In one case, a single individual was found operating under at least 12 different personas across Europe and the U.S., targeting organizations within the defense and government sectors. Source: List of countries impacted by DPRK IT workers According to the latest report , a number of of DPRK IT workers have been found to be actively involved in blockchain projects in the UK, such as developing Solana and Anchor/Rust smart contracts and building a blockchain-based job marketplace using the MERN stack and Solana. In addition to the IT workers themselves, investigations have also uncovered a network of facilitators supporting these workers in navigating European job websites and providing them with false identity documents. You might also like: News ‘We can’t defeat an enemy that we don’t know’: Researcher warns of North Korea’s changing crypto tactics North Korea’s aggressive expansion of IT worker infiltration is largely driven by the regime’s need to circumvent international sanctions that have restricted its access to global financial systems. With economic pressure mounting, the country has turned to cyber operations as a major revenue stream, using IT workers to secure high-paying jobs and funnel earnings back to the state. In 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department estimated that these workers collectively generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually for North Korea. The DPRK government withholds up to 90 percent of the wages earned by these workers, thereby channeling substantial funds into its military projects. Beyond directly funneling their salaries to the regime, North Korean IT workers sometimes act as entry points for state-sponsored hacking groups like Lazarus Group , which was recently in the spotlight for orchestrating the $1,5 billion hack of Bybit exchange. Notably, Lazarus stole over $600 million from the Ronin Network (Axie Infinity) in 2022, with IT workers playing a key role in providing access to internal systems. In August 2024, on-chain sleuth ZachXBT uncovered over 25 crypto projects infiltrated by DPRK devs. While Lazarus’s hack of Bybit—after which North Korea became the fifth-largest government holder of Bitcoin ( BTC )—was linked to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in its multi-sig wallet rather than direct infiltration, it has raised awareness of the DPRK’s threat in the U.S. According to GTIG report , this heightened awareness is one of the key factors behind the expansion of North Korean infiltration efforts into Europe, in addition to increased public reporting, U.S. Department of Justice indictments, and challenges related to right-to-work verification.

The cryptocurrency is currently navigating a crucial phase where technical indicators hint at both bullish and bearish possibilities. Here’s an in-depth analysis of XRP’s short-term trajectory based on the 1-hour, 30-minute, and 15-minute charts. 1-Hour Chart Analysis XRP has been consolidating within a descending triangle pattern, signaling potential breakout opportunities. The price recently tested the lower boundary near $2.50, coinciding with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. This suggests that XRP might be experiencing a corrective phase before initiating a stronger upward movement. A confirmed breakout above $2.20 would indicate a bullish shift. 30-Minute Chart Analysis On the 30-minute chart, XRP’s trend leans slightly bearish, with 57.14% of moving average signals pointing downward. The 50-period moving average also indicates the possibility of a trend reversal. However, key support at $2.00 remains intact, and a break above the $2.20 resistance level could signal renewed buying pressure. 15-Minute Chart Analysis Short-term price action shows consolidation near the middle Bollinger Band, reflecting market indecision. Immediate support is observed at $2.05 , while resistance stands at $2.15. If buyers push the price beyond this resistance, XRP could gain further momentum. Conversely, a drop below $2.05 might lead to a decline toward $1.533 before finding stability. Future Price Direction and Expected Rebound Bullish Scenario: If XRP maintains support above $2.05 and successfully breaches the $2.20 resistance, it could climb toward $2.37, aligning with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. This movement could develop within the next 24 to 48 hours. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bearish Scenario: A breakdown below $2.05 could see XRP testing $1.533, with a potential stabilization before any significant recovery. Based on current price dynamics, a rebound is likely within the next 48-72 hours, provided XRP sustains key support levels and gains bullish momentum.

In an April 1 announcement , Cruz unveiled the Facilitating Lower Atmospheric Released Emissions Act, which he believes will make Texas the “number one place for Bitcoin mining.” The FLARE Act proposes a change to the U.S. tax code that would allow companies to permanently deduct the full cost of systems designed to capture and repurpose natural gas that would otherwise be flared or vented. These systems, called flaring and venting mitigation systems, would qualify for 100% expensing starting in 2026. To qualify, the equipment must intake natural gas and convert it into something useful, like electricity, liquid fuels, or even computational power for digital asset mining. The bill lists several eligible uses, including compressing or liquefying gas for transport, producing petrochemicals or fertilizer, and powering oilfield equipment or the electrical grid. Besides the incentives, the bill blocks foreign entities of concern, including those tied to China , Russia, Iran, or North Korea, from benefiting from the incentives. This clause is meant to keep the tax break exclusive to U.S.-aligned operators and strengthen domestic energy independence. You might also like: SpaceX to launch first polar orbit crewed mission backed by Bitcoin mining tycoon By turning stranded gas into usable energy, Cruz and supporters argue the bill would not only cut emissions but also boost energy innovation and grid resilience, especially during periods of peak demand or extreme weather. “This bill takes advantage of Texas’s vast energy potential, reinforces our position as the home of the Bitcoin industry, and is good for the environment. I call upon my colleagues to expeditiously take up and advance this legislation,” Cruz said. The bill has already picked up support from industry players who see it as a win-win for both energy and innovation. Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings endorsed the legislation in an X post, adding that it could reduce emissions and “unlock stranded energy” across Texas and beyond. See below. The FLARE Act from Sen. @tedcruz allows full expensing for infrastructure that captures and repurposes flared gas into value-added uses—like Bitcoin mining. MARA supports this legislation. It recognizes Bitcoin mining’s role in reducing emissions and unlocking stranded energy. https://t.co/7GhnGYQqXx — MARA (@MARAHoldings) April 1, 2025 Last year, MARA partnered with NGON to launch a 25-megawatt micro data center operation across wellheads in Texas and North Dakota. The data center will use excess natural gas to generate electricity to power data centers, offering energy producers a high-efficiency solution for methane mitigation. Under the legislation, infrastructure like this would qualify as a flaring and venting mitigation system, making it eligible for permanent full expensing. That means MARA and similar operators could deduct the entire cost of installing such systems from their taxable income, starting in 2026. Long before he introduced the FLARE Act, Cruz floated the idea at the 2021 Texas Blockchain Summit that Bitcoin mining could turn excess energy from oil and gas operations into something useful instead of just burning it off. “Use that power to mine Bitcoin. Part of the beauty of that is the instant you’re doing it you’re helping the environment enormously because rather than flaring the natural gas you’re putting it to productive use,” he said at the time.

42795799,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145433,1743587410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin’s Bold Leap: Surging as a Prime Alternative to Tech Stocks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-prime-tech-stock-alternative/,"In a surprising turn of events, Bitcoin (BTC), the pioneering cryptocurrency, is increasingly being viewed not just as digital gold, but as a potent alternative to tech stocks. This fascinating shift comes at a time when the U.S. economy faces mounting uncertainties, fueled by concerns over tariffs and fluctuating market dynamics. Could this be a game-changer for investors seeking to diversify beyond traditional tech giants? Let’s delve into the insights from a Standard Chartered executive that are turning heads in the financial world. Is Bitcoin Really Becoming the New Tech Stock? Geoff Kendrick, the Head of Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered, has ignited a compelling discussion by highlighting Bitcoin’s growing correlation with the NASDAQ. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it suggests a fundamental shift in how institutional investors are perceiving BTC. Kendrick argues that Bitcoin is starting to behave more like a tech stock than the inflation hedge it was originally conceived to be. This perspective challenges conventional wisdom and opens up exciting new avenues for portfolio strategy. But what exactly does this correlation mean for you? In essence, it implies that Bitcoin’s price movements are increasingly mirroring those of major tech stocks listed on the NASDAQ. When tech stocks rise, Bitcoin tends to follow suit, and vice versa. This relationship is crucial for investors because it suggests that Bitcoin is becoming integrated into the broader tech-driven investment landscape. Why the Shift? Economic Uncertainty and Tariffs Several factors are driving this intriguing transformation. Firstly, the rising economic uncertainty in the U.S. is pushing investors to seek assets that can perform well even amidst market volatility. Traditional tech stocks, while historically robust, are now facing headwinds from various sources, including: Concerns over Tariffs: Trade tensions and tariffs can significantly impact the global operations and profitability of tech companies, leading to investor apprehension. Inflationary Pressures: While initially touted as an inflation hedge, Bitcoin’s recent behavior suggests it’s reacting more to macroeconomic factors influencing growth stocks. Geopolitical Instability: Global events and geopolitical risks often trigger market fluctuations, impacting investor sentiment towards traditional equities, including tech stocks. In this environment, Bitcoin , with its decentralized nature and limited supply, is presenting itself as a potentially attractive investment alternative . Its independence from traditional financial systems and governments can be seen as a buffer against some of these economic uncertainties. Investors are starting to recognize this and are allocating capital accordingly. Bitcoin vs. Tech Stocks: A Head-to-Head Comparison Let’s take a closer look at how Bitcoin stacks up against traditional tech stocks . While both are considered growth assets, they possess distinct characteristics that investors should consider: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Tech Stocks (e.g., NASDAQ) Asset Class Cryptocurrency, Digital Asset Equity, Stocks Decentralization Decentralized, No central authority Centralized, Regulated markets Supply Limited (21 million BTC) Unlimited (Stock supply can vary) Volatility Historically High Generally Lower (than Bitcoin, but can be volatile) Regulation Evolving regulatory landscape Heavily regulated Market Maturity Relatively nascent, growing institutional adoption Mature, well-established markets As you can see, while tech stocks represent established companies with proven business models, Bitcoin offers a unique value proposition rooted in decentralization and scarcity. The choice between them, or a strategic blend of both, depends on an investor’s risk tolerance, investment horizon, and belief in the future of digital assets. The “Magnificent 7” and the Bitcoin Proposition Kendrick’s analysis takes an even more provocative turn when he suggests replacing Tesla (TSLA), a prominent member of the “Magnificent 7” U.S. tech stocks, with Bitcoin . The “Magnificent 7” – comprising Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, NVIDIA, Tesla, and Meta (Facebook) – have been the darlings of the stock market, driving significant portions of its growth. However, Kendrick posits that substituting Tesla with Bitcoin in this elite group could potentially lead to: Higher Returns: Bitcoin, despite its volatility, has historically outperformed many traditional assets over longer periods. Lower Volatility (in the context of the portfolio): While Bitcoin itself is volatile, its inclusion in a portfolio alongside other tech stocks could potentially diversify risk and, surprisingly, reduce overall portfolio volatility due to its unique market dynamics and lower correlation with some traditional assets compared to individual tech stocks. This is a bold claim, but it underscores the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a mainstream investment. It’s not just about comparing Bitcoin to individual tech stocks; it’s about considering its strategic role within a broader investment portfolio and its potential to enhance returns and manage risk in innovative ways. Portfolio diversification is key in today’s uncertain economic climate, and Bitcoin might just be the unexpected piece of the puzzle. Benefits of Considering Bitcoin as a Tech Investment Alternative Why should investors seriously consider Bitcoin as a tech stocks alternative? Here are some compelling benefits: Diversification Beyond Traditional Markets: Bitcoin offers diversification away from traditional equities and fixed income, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Exposure to a Nascent and Growing Asset Class: Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are still in their early stages, offering significant growth potential as adoption increases. Potential for High Returns: Bitcoin has historically demonstrated the potential for substantial returns, although this comes with higher volatility. Decentralization and Transparency: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature can be appealing to investors seeking assets outside of government and traditional financial control. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional stock markets, Bitcoin markets operate 24/7, offering continuous trading opportunities. Navigating the Challenges and Risks Of course, investing in Bitcoin , especially as a tech stocks alternative, is not without its challenges and risks. Investors need to be aware of: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility can be significant, leading to potential losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and changes in regulations could impact Bitcoin’s price and adoption. Security Risks: Cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets can be targets for hacking and theft. Secure storage and risk management are crucial. Complexity: Understanding the technology and market dynamics of Bitcoin requires effort and due diligence. Market Sentiment: Bitcoin’s price can be heavily influenced by market sentiment and news events, leading to rapid price swings. Actionable Insights: Integrating Bitcoin into Your Investment Strategy So, how can investors translate these insights into actionable strategies? Here are a few key takeaways: Educate Yourself: Thoroughly understand Bitcoin , its technology, and its market dynamics before investing. Start Small: Begin with a small allocation to Bitcoin as part of your portfolio diversification strategy. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: Invest a fixed amount regularly to mitigate the impact of volatility. Use Reputable Exchanges and Wallets: Choose secure and regulated platforms for buying, selling, and storing Bitcoin. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market trends, regulatory developments, and news impacting the cryptocurrency space. Consult a Financial Advisor: Seek professional advice to determine if Bitcoin aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Conclusion: The Dawn of a New Investment Paradigm? The notion of Bitcoin emerging as a viable investment alternative to tech stocks is a powerful signal of the evolving financial landscape. Standard Chartered’s perspective highlights a potentially transformative shift in how institutional investors are viewing and utilizing cryptocurrencies. While challenges and risks remain, the benefits of diversification, exposure to a growing asset class, and the potential for significant returns are increasingly compelling. As economic uncertainties persist and the digital economy expands, Bitcoin’s role in investment portfolios is likely to become even more prominent. The bold move of considering Bitcoin alongside, or even in place of, traditional tech giants may just be the beginning of a new era in investment strategy.

This decrease represents a 74% decline from its all-time high of $2.98 in February 2025. ​ Major Token Unlock Ahead A major contributing factor to this downturn is the upcoming unlocking of over 124 million PI tokens this month, with projections indicating a total of 1.6 billion tokens to be unlocked over the next year. Besides, PI trading activity is also slowing down, indicating that investor excitement is fading fast. The Pi Core team recently announced that the inaugural PiFest on the Open Network achieved record participation, with over 125,000 registered sellers, more than 58,000 active sellers, and 1.8 million Pioneers engaging with the Map of Pi, highlighting Pi’s real-world utility on a global scale. Community Members Demand New Leadership However, this announcement has not been well-received by the community. Dr. Altcoin remarked that since the commencement of PiFest, trading activity within the Pi ecosystem has significantly declined, with the only transactions involving the sale of Pi for cash. He also criticized the Pi co-founders, suggesting that they appear disconnected from the practical realities and concerns of the broader Pi community. Community members are unhappy with the Pi Core Team’s updates and are demanding more transparency and fresh leadership with real crypto expertise. They want updates that spark interest, not just the boring routine reports. Pi Network’s Mining Rate Drops By Over 1% Notably, the Pi Network’s mining rate has dropped by 1.18% this month, now at 0.0029030 π per hour. This continues a trend of gradual mining rate reductions. While there were hopes of Pi listing on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, it hasn’t materialised yet. While the BTCC exchange did add Pi for spot trading, it has not boosted the coin’s price. Over the past seven days, the Pi coin price has tanked by 20%, with the next crucial support levels at $0.60. Furthermore, the correction under $0.70 comes with heavy selling pressure as daily trading volumes tanked 52% to $148 million. Pi Network is currently forming a classic falling wedge pattern, testing the lower boundary near $0.687. A confirmed breakout with volume above the $0.71–$0.72 range could signal a bullish move, potentially pushing the price toward $0.75–$0.78, where key resistance levels lie.

With a max supply of 100 billion Pi coins and only 6.7 billion currently in circulation, token unlocks are increasing the number of coins in the market. While some cryptos tackle this by burning tokens to reduce supply, it’s unclear if Pi has plans for such a strategy. Options could include burning tokens not moved to the mainnet by June or using ecosystem fees for token burns. Nicolas Kokkalis, Pi’s co-founder, is likely to address these issues in the project’s first X Space.

The country will explore the use of blockchain technology to promote the “on-chaining” of important data and realize data encryption processing and process flexibility. Li Chunlin, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said that the Commission had applied privacy computing to the sharing and application of credit information to reduce the risk of information leakage. A 2024 study revealed that China attached great importance to the development of blockchain technology, listing it as a key area of ‘national cutting-edge technology layout’ and encouraging local governments to actively explore its application potential, aiming to use the characteristics of blockchain technology to improve the efficiency, transparency, and security of government services. China’s Cyberspace Administration (CAC) regulations require all blockchain companies to register their users and to provide personal data and activity sheets to the authorities upon request. According to the Data Security Management Regulation, incidents that could harm national security or public interest must be reported within 24 hours of identification.

The initiative highlighted China’s drive towards innovative technology to improve credit data security, although market reactions remained unclear. Previously, China’s credit systems were supported by technologically advanced frameworks, showing an upward trend in loan distributions across small enterprises. By 2024, these loans reached trillions of yuan, indicating substantial demand and growth. The integration of blockchain reportedly promises to further strengthen these systems by offering enhanced encryption and data processing. China’s adoption could potentially position it as a leader in credit management innovation as global economies integrate similar technologies. “We are committed to enhancing the financing environment for small businesses to foster growth and innovation.” ~ Li Chunlin The project outlined in the ‘National Data Infrastructure Construction Guidelines’ will be implemented in two phases. The first phase, which focuses on designing the system architecture, is expected to be completed by 2026, while the full deployment is scheduled for 2029. According to Chunlin, a key component of this infrastructure is the integration of smart contracts to automate data processes and eliminate unnecessary human intervention. The system will provide high-level security and reliability by ensuring that recorded data cannot be changed. Data leak reveals public-private collaboration to monitor Chinese cyberspace SentinelLABS analyzed a data leak containing infrastructure details and work logs from employees of Chinese state-affiliated private sector security firm, TopSec, revealing that TopSec was likely enabling content moderation for internet censorship purposes, a key strategy used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to monitor and control public opinion on issues that the state deems contentious or antisocial. SentinelLABS identified this leak as a submission to a multi-scanner platform that fired off a rule that looked for common abuse activities associated with Kubernetes (K8s). According to SentinelLABS, the data leak included a document with 7K+ lines of work logs and code used to organize infrastructure for the firm’s DevOps practices and downstream customers. It included scripts that connected to several Chinese government hostnames, academic institutions, and news sites. SentinelLABS also reported that it found evidence indicating that TopSec provided bespoke services to a state-owned enterprise on the date that a corruption investigation targeting the organization’s top official was announced. The leaked documents analyzed by SentinelLABS referenced multiple organizations in both the private and public sectors, likely customers or otherwise associated with TopSec. Some of the TopSec customers referenced in these documents included Dongwu Fund Management Co. Ltd, Gucheng County Petition Bureau, Illegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center, Linhai Rural Commercial Bank, and Petkit, among others. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The recovery in the DOGE price was followed by a drop of over 4% triggered by Elon Musk’s comment of Dogecoin not being adopted by the government. Meanwhile, the selling pressure has faded to some extent, which could elevate the levels beyond $0.2 soon as technicials are turning bullish. Ever since the institutions have landed in the crypto space, the crypto has been less influenced by the developments in the space or by the on-chain readings. The only thing that matters currently is the US government and its policies. It has been broadly seen in the traditional markets and gold, which is peaking due to uncertainty. Dogecoin whales have accumulated more than 220 million DOGE throughout March while the price remained consolidated around $0.17 and experienced a single push to above $0.2, which was thrashed in no time. Considering the historical chart, the DOGE price has reached the lower support of the lower rising parallel channel. The price is finding its support at the 200-day weekly MA while the 50-day weekly MA is acting as an immediate resistance. The selling pressure has dropped over the past few weeks and the MACD levels are heading for a bullish crossover, which suggests the price may soon trigger a rebound and maintain a healthy upswing. Will Dogecoin Price Reach $0.25 in April 2025? Whenever the Dogecoin price finds itself between the two MAs, it tends to maintain a horizontal consolidation until these levels undergo either a bullish or bearish crossover. Besides, in the short term, price action also displays a similar trend. The daily chart of DOGE shows the price is consolidating along the multi-month ascending trend line, flashing bullish signals for the upcoming price action. The price is holding along the rising trend line that it has held since the October breakout. The MACD suggests a drop in the buying pressure but the levels, which were about to undergo a bearish crossover, have diverted. On the other hand, the RSI remains incremental, holding along the ascending trend line, suggesting the rise in the strength of the rally. Therefore, the Dogecoin price is expected to maintain an ascending consolidation along the trend line and reach the crucial resistance around $0.2. These levels have been acting as resistance and support levels as and when required. Therefore, a surpass from these ranges may build more confidence among the market participants. As the volume has slightly increased recently, it indicates the bulls are vigilant and hence may exhibit required action, pushing the Dogecoin (DOGE) price beyond $0.25.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-02 09:53:12

However, hopes for a boost from Elon Musk faded after he clarified that the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) has no plans to adopt the meme coin. Massive Whale Buys Last Month The biggest meme coin in terms of total market capitalization witnessed enhanced volatility throughout March, with its price ranging from $0.14 to almost $0.25. Currently, it trades at around $0.17, representing a 25% decline on a 30-day scale. DOGE Price, Source: CoinGecko Whales seem unfazed by this turbulence, and they increased their holdings during that timeframe. The X user Ali Martinez revealed that these investors ended the month with net purchases of over 220 million DOGE, which equals more than $37 million (calculated at current rates). He pointed out that whales now own approximately 10.52 billion tokens, constituting roughly 7% of Dogecoin’s circulating supply. When such large investors buy substantial amounts of DOGE, they effectively decrease the available number of tokens on the open market. If demand remains constant or increases, this reduction can lead to upward pressure on the price. ​ Such actions can also be interpreted as a signal of confidence in the asset’s future performance, which could encourage additional buying from retail investors, further driving up the valuation. Musk’s Recent Comments Elon Musk’s entry into the US political scene several months ago triggered huge enthusiasm among DOGE proponents. Tesla’s CEO was appointed to lead the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). The division has the same abbreviation as the popular meme coin, while the billionaire is known as a firm supporter of the latter. And while the crypto community expected some kind of endorsement, Musk’s recent comments poured cold water on such hopes. He said the US government has no plans to use DOGE in any form. “They happen to be similar names, but really, we’re literally just trying to make the government 15% more efficient,” he added. That said, bulls will have to wait for other catalysts that could push the price up in the near future . One example is the potential approval of a spot DOGE ETF in America. Grayscale, Bitwise, and Osprey Funds are some of the firms that have submitted applications to launch this type of product. The chances of a green light before the end of the year are currently projected to be just below 70%.

All the tariffs will take effect immediately. Markets have receded over recent weeks in anticipation of the tariffs, but a much greater degree of certainty could now be restored. Will the U.S. stock market and Bitcoin start reversing their downward trends? What really matters to the market For markets, what really matters isn’t news that has the potential to send them rapidly in one direction or the other, it is ‘certainty’, or as close to that as it is possible to get. The news can be really bad or extremely good, but as long as the market is able to price this in, huge spikes up or down can generally be avoided. Will the tariffs already be sufficiently priced in? The U.S. stock market, and also Bitcoin, given the strong correlation, have come down relatively hard over the last few weeks due to the large uncertainty over President Trump’s tariffs. The market has not known with any degree of confidence just how harsh the tariffs would be, or how many countries they would affect. Therefore, once this is known later on Wednesday, when President Trump announces the tariffs at a formal event, it may be that the amount the stock market has already dipped, could be more than what will be priced in, thereby allowing the market to start reversing its current downtrend. U.S. stock market primed for a bounce Source: TradingView The S&P 500 has dipped as much as 10.6% from top to bottom. The horizontal support band from $5,635 down to $5,560 is currently holding, so a rally could take place from here. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI, and the Relative Strength Index, are also both in excellent positions for a bounce. If one looks at the charts of all the ‘magnificent seven’ stocks, a very similar scenario is happening there. Trend changes are potentially just starting to take place. If you also throw Bitcoin into the mix, this is one more asset perfectly primed for take-off. Impetus needed for Bitcoin Source: TradingView The short-term chart for Bitcoin shows that a ceiling is over the price. This is formed by the horizontal resistance at $85,000, plus the descending trendline . The bulls need some impetus in the form of some bullish event. This could potentially be the U.S. stock market spiking higher. Weekly chart has $BTC primed for Breakout Source: TradingView The weekly view of the $BTC price shows just how primed Bitcoin is for that breakout. Some good horizontal support has developed under the price, and it just remains for the bulls to break the ascending trendline and confirm above. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart has the indicators very close to the 20.00 level. If this is passed by both indicators, with the blue line on top, momentum should lift the price higher. The more unlikely scenario is that $BTC is once more rejected at the descending trendline, and a breakdown to $70,000 occurs. That said, the key is the U.S. stock market, and how it reads today’s tariffs announcement. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Projects built on the popular Solana network, including applications and job boards, are getting hit by the rising attacks. Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) operatives pose as legit remote workers to infiltrate companies, take over critical systems and steal sensitive data which is likely sold to “generate revenue for the regime.” The increased threat in Europe is a shift from a U.S.-heavy focus as DPRK-linked entities faced heat from DOJ indictments and tighter hiring scrutiny stateside. The report reveals that one such worker juggled 12 fake personas across the U.S. and Europe and sought employment by fabricating references, building a rapport with job recruiters, and using additional personas they controlled to vouch for their credibility. It’s not like the workers lack coding chops either: Workers were found taking projects ranging from token hosting platform using Next.js, React and CosmosSDK, and Golang, and even created an entire Solana-based job marketplace. More blockchain-related projects involved Anchor and Rust smart contract development. One worker even developed an artificial intelligence (AI) web application using Electron, Next.js, and blockchain applications. A key culprit may be workplaces that let employees use their own devices. “(Google Cloud) believes that IT workers have identified BYOD environments as potentially ripe for their schemes, and in January 2025, IT workers are now conducting operations against their employers in these scenarios,” the report said. “Global expansion, extortion tactics, and the use of virtualized infrastructure all highlight the adaptable strategies employed by DPRK IT workers.” DPRK entities and hacking groups are one of the biggest threat actors in the crypto ecosystem, stealing an estimated $1.3 billion from projects in 2024 and conducting a $1.5 billion hack on crypto exchange Bybit in February alone.",Markets|North Korea|Hack|Solana,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-02 09:58:05

Recently, Whale Alert, the vigilant eye of the crypto space, reported a significant event: a whopping 370 million XRP tokens have been locked in escrow at Ripple. For those deeply invested in the crypto sphere, and especially in XRP, this news sparks a flurry of questions. What does this mean? Why is Ripple making such a move? And crucially, how will this impact the future of XRP? Let’s dive deep into this massive development and unlock the layers of meaning behind Ripple’s latest strategic maneuver. Decoding the XRP Escrow: What’s Really Happening? First, let’s break down the basics. Escrow in the cryptocurrency world, particularly for Ripple and XRP , isn’t a new concept. Think of it as a digital safety deposit box. Ripple uses escrow to manage the supply of XRP tokens systematically. These escrow accounts are essentially smart contracts designed to release XRP tokens at predetermined intervals. This process was initially set up to ensure a predictable and controlled release of XRP into the market, fostering stability and trust within the ecosystem. But why is this important, and how does it benefit the XRP community? Here’s a simplified breakdown of why Ripple utilizes XRP escrow: Predictable Supply: Escrow ensures a steady and predictable release of XRP tokens, preventing sudden floods of tokens into the market, which could potentially lead to price volatility. Transparency and Trust: By locking tokens in escrow, Ripple demonstrates transparency in its token distribution strategy. This builds trust among XRP holders and the broader crypto community as it shows a commitment to a controlled supply. Long-Term Planning: Escrow allows Ripple to plan for the long term, using the released XRP for various operational and developmental purposes, supporting the growth and expansion of the XRP Ledger and its ecosystem. In essence, escrow is a mechanism that underpins Ripple’s commitment to responsible XRP management. It’s not just about locking away tokens; it’s about strategically managing the flow of XRP to support its long-term vision. But with 370 million XRP now locked, what’s the immediate impact? The Significance of 370 Million XRP Lockup: A Closer Look The sheer volume – 370 million XRP – is what grabs attention. To put this into perspective, at current market valuations, this amount represents a significant value. Locking up such a substantial quantity signals a strong commitment from Ripple. It suggests a strategic move aimed at reinforcing the long-term value and stability of XRP . But let’s unpack the potential implications further: Aspect Potential Implication of 370 Million XRP Escrow Supply Dynamics Reduces the immediate circulating supply of XRP, potentially creating scarcity. In theory, reduced supply with stable or increasing demand could exert upward pressure on price. Market Sentiment Can be interpreted as a bullish signal. Locking up a large amount may indicate Ripple’s confidence in XRP’s future value and its commitment to its long-term success. Strategic Reserves These escrowed funds are likely reserved for future operational needs, partnerships, ecosystem development, or even strategic investments. It provides Ripple with a financial buffer and resources for growth. Investor Confidence Actions like this can bolster investor confidence by demonstrating responsible token management and a long-term vision for XRP. It reassures investors about the stability and potential of their investment. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors. While a reduced circulating supply can be a positive catalyst, market sentiment, broader economic conditions, regulatory developments, and adoption rates all play significant roles in determining cryptocurrency prices. So, while this escrow lockup is noteworthy, it’s just one piece of the larger puzzle. Ripple’s Strategic Playbook: Why Escrow Matters in the Bigger Picture? To truly understand the significance of this 370 million XRP escrow, we need to consider Ripple’s overarching strategy. Ripple has consistently emphasized the utility of XRP in facilitating faster and cheaper cross-border payments. Escrow is integral to this strategy because it allows Ripple to: Fund Operational Activities: Released XRP from escrow is used to fund Ripple’s operations, including technology development, business expansion, and supporting the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Incentivize Adoption: A portion of the released XRP may be used to incentivize partnerships and adoption of XRP-based solutions by financial institutions and other entities. Maintain Market Stability: The controlled release mechanism helps in maintaining a degree of market stability by preventing sudden supply shocks. Ripple’s use of escrow is not just a financial maneuver; it’s a strategic tool designed to foster a healthy and sustainable blockchain ecosystem around XRP. By carefully managing the supply, Ripple aims to build long-term value and utility for XRP, which is crucial for its widespread adoption and success. What Does This Mean for XRP Holders and the Crypto Community? For those holding XRP, news of a substantial escrow lockup can be viewed with cautious optimism. It reinforces the idea that Ripple is committed to a measured and strategic approach to managing the XRP supply. But what are the actionable insights for the average crypto enthusiast? Stay Informed: Keep track of announcements from Ripple and monitor on-chain data like escrow transactions reported by Whale Alert. Understanding these movements can provide insights into Ripple’s strategy. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Ripple’s escrow strategy is inherently long-term focused. This lockup reinforces their commitment to the future of XRP. Investors should align their perspective accordingly, considering XRP as a long-term investment rather than a get-rich-quick scheme. Diversify and Manage Risk: While escrow news can be positive, the crypto market is volatile. Diversification remains a key strategy to manage risk. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if that basket seems to be getting more secure. Understand Market Dynamics: The price of XRP, like any cryptocurrency , is influenced by numerous factors. Escrow is just one of them. Keep an eye on broader market trends, regulatory news, and adoption updates to get a holistic view. Ultimately, the 370 million XRP escrow lockup is a significant event that underscores Ripple’s strategic approach to managing XRP. It’s a move that reflects long-term planning and a commitment to stability and growth within the XRP ecosystem. For XRP holders and the broader crypto community, it’s a reminder of the intricate dynamics at play behind the scenes and the importance of staying informed and strategic in this ever-evolving digital landscape. Looking Ahead: The Future of XRP and Ripple’s Strategic Escrows As we move forward, expect Ripple to continue utilizing escrow as a key tool in its XRP management strategy. These strategic lockups are likely to remain a recurring feature, designed to support the long-term health and stability of the XRP market. The 370 million XRP lockup is not just a number; it’s a statement – a statement of intent, strategy, and commitment from Ripple to the future of XRP. In conclusion, the recent 370 million XRP escrow lockup by Ripple is more than just a transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver with potential implications for supply dynamics, market sentiment, and investor confidence. While the crypto market remains complex and multifaceted, understanding these strategic moves provides valuable insights into the long-term vision and commitment of key players like Ripple. By staying informed and adopting a strategic perspective, stakeholders can navigate the exciting yet volatile world of XRP and cryptocurrency with greater clarity and confidence.

However, with Ether’s recent underperformance, the move isn’t a cause for too much celebration. As of April 1, the 30-day volume for Ethereum was $63 billion, compared to $51.3 billion for Solana, according to DeFiLlama. Yet ETH plunged almost 28% in March, according to CoinGecko.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitmex-founder-arthur-hayes-makes-bitcoin-price-prediction-for-2025-here-are-the-details/,"BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes suggested that Bitcoin’s price action is entirely driven by market expectations regarding future fiat money supply. Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $250K by Year-End Amid Fed Policy Shift In his latest article, Hayes argues that Bitcoin (BTC) could climb toward a $250,000 target by the end of 2025 if the U.S. Federal Reserve makes a major policy shift from quantitative tightening (QT) to quantitative easing (QE) for Treasury bonds. According to Hayes, Bitcoin responds sharply to changes in monetary policy, acting as a barometer for global liquidity conditions. Hayes points out that previous periods of aggressive money printing, such as during the COVID-19 stimulus period, have led to significant rallies in Bitcoin and other risk assets. If the Fed reverses its QT stance and continues to buy Treasuries through QE, it could inject a large amount of liquidity into the financial system. Hayes argues that this will drive investors into hard assets like Bitcoin, strengthening Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against fiat devaluation. Can Bitcoin Reach $250K? Hayes’ $250,000 Bitcoin price target is based on the assumption that the Fed will ease in the face of economic pressures. While such a target is ambitious, increasing speculation that monetary policy will shift could further fuel bullish sentiment in the crypto market. With Bitcoin set to surpass its all-time high in 2025, macro trends and central bank policies could play a decisive role in determining whether Hayes can achieve his six-figure prediction. *This is not investment advice.

The figure is two thirds of the total amount stolen across 2024, although it's worth noting that the majority of Q1's losses can be attributed to the $1.45 billion Bybit hack. Aside from that, CertiK analyzed 197 hacking incidents in Q1, 98 of which occurred on Ethereum. The two largest hacks following Bybit were the $71 million Phemex heist in January and the $49.5 million exploit suffered by crypto neobank Infini. Phishing attacks, which involve stealing a victim's credentials to gain access to personal accounts, remains the highest attack vector accounting for 81 incidents. There were also 15 incidents of private key compromise. Only 0.38% of stolen funds in Q1 have been returned compared to 42.09% in the previous quarter, making the adjusted loss much higher.
