PancakeSwap, a leading decentralized exchange, has just announced a groundbreaking partnership with Ondo Finance. This collaboration is set to revolutionize the BNB Chain by bringing over 100 tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) to its vibrant ecosystem. This move marks a significant leap forward for PancakeSwap RWAs and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, promising to bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. This strategic alliance signals a powerful evolution in how we perceive and interact with digital assets. It’s not just about cryptocurrencies anymore; it’s about unlocking tangible value from the real world and making it accessible to a global, decentralized audience. Let’s delve into what this means for users, the BNB Chain, and the future of DeFi. What Are Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) and Why Are They Crucial for PancakeSwap RWAs? At its core, a tokenized real-world asset (RWA) is a representation of a physical or traditional financial asset on a blockchain. Think of it this way: instead of owning a physical gold bar or a share certificate, you own a digital token that proves your ownership or fractional ownership of that asset. These assets can range from real estate and commodities like gold to government bonds and private equity. The beauty of RWAs lies in their ability to bring several benefits to the blockchain: Increased Liquidity: Traditional assets can be illiquid. Tokenization allows for easier buying, selling, and fractional ownership, making them more liquid. Fractional Ownership: High-value assets can be split into smaller, more affordable tokens, opening up investment opportunities to a wider audience. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain technology provides an immutable and transparent record of ownership and transactions. Global Accessibility: Anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet can potentially access these assets, breaking down geographical barriers. Moreover, RWAs are crucial for DeFi’s maturity. They introduce stability and tangible value, reducing the volatility often associated with purely crypto-native assets. This integration creates a more robust and diverse financial ecosystem. The Groundbreaking Partnership: PancakeSwap and Ondo Finance Ignite BNB Chain The collaboration between PancakeSwap and Ondo Finance is a match made in DeFi heaven. PancakeSwap is renowned for its user-friendly interface, deep liquidity pools, and massive user base on the BNB Chain. It has long been a gateway for millions into the world of decentralized trading and yield farming. Ondo Finance, on the other hand, specializes in bringing institutional-grade assets onto the blockchain. They act as the bridge, ensuring that these real-world assets are properly structured, compliant, and securely tokenized. Their expertise is vital for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the tokenization process. This partnership means a massive influx of diverse PancakeSwap RWAs will soon be available directly on the BNB Chain. Users will be able to access a broad spectrum of tokenized assets, diversifying their portfolios beyond traditional cryptocurrencies. This is not merely an expansion; it’s a transformation of the investment landscape within DeFi, making it more comprehensive and appealing to a wider range of investors, including those from traditional finance. What Benefits Do Users Gain from Accessing Diverse PancakeSwap RWAs? For everyday users and seasoned DeFi participants alike, the integration of PancakeSwap RWAs brings a host of compelling advantages: Portfolio Diversification: Gain exposure to assets like U.S. Treasury bills, corporate bonds, or real estate funds directly from your DeFi wallet. This can help stabilize portfolios during crypto market fluctuations. Access to Stable Yields: Many RWAs, especially tokenized bonds, offer predictable and often higher yields compared to traditional savings accounts, providing a new avenue for passive income within DeFi. Reduced Volatility: By incorporating assets whose value is tied to real-world performance, users can potentially mitigate some of the inherent volatility of the crypto market. Enhanced Trust and Security: Ondo Finance’s rigorous due diligence and compliance frameworks for tokenizing assets add a layer of institutional-grade security and reliability to these offerings. Imagine being able to participate in a fractional ownership of a commercial property or earn yield from government bonds, all through the familiar interface of PancakeSwap. This partnership truly democratizes access to investment opportunities that were once exclusive to large institutions. Navigating the Future: Potential and Challenges of PancakeSwap RWAs The potential for PancakeSwap RWAs is immense. This initiative could catalyze further institutional adoption of DeFi, as it provides a compliant and accessible pathway for traditional financial entities to engage with blockchain technology. It also paves the way for innovative financial products built upon these tokenized assets, fostering a new wave of creativity in the DeFi space. However, like any nascent technology, challenges exist. Regulatory clarity remains a significant hurdle globally. Different jurisdictions have varying stances on tokenized securities and commodities, which requires careful navigation. Moreover, ensuring the accurate and real-time pricing of these assets through reliable oracle networks is paramount for maintaining trust and preventing manipulation. Bridging the legal framework of traditional assets with the decentralized nature of blockchain also presents complexities. PancakeSwap and Ondo Finance are actively addressing these complexities, demonstrating a commitment to compliance and robust infrastructure. Their collaboration is not just about bringing assets; it’s about building a sustainable and regulated bridge between two distinct financial worlds. The integration of over 100 tokenized real-world assets via the PancakeSwap and Ondo Finance partnership is a monumental step for the BNB Chain and the entire DeFi ecosystem. This development promises to reshape how users interact with decentralized finance, offering unprecedented access to diverse and stable investments.

His remarks came during an online exchange that began with a lighthearted question posed by CoinDesk about early cryptocurrency investments. Schwartz’s Advice to His Younger Self The discussion began when CoinDesk published a social media post asking its audience to imagine they could speak three words to their 18-year-old selves. The outlet’s intern responded with “buy more crypto,” prompting various figures in the industry to share their own takes. Schwartz joined the conversation, stating that he would choose the words “2010 Bitcoin 100,000.” The comment implied that, if given the chance, he would instruct his younger self to acquire 100,000 BTC in 2010, the year Bitcoin was still largely unknown and trading at just a few cents. 2010 bitcoin 100,000 (Assuming numbers count as words.) — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) October 28, 2025 At that time, Bitcoin’s highest price for the year was about $0.39, meaning that 100,000 BTC could have been purchased for less than $39,000. Based on today’s valuation, that investment would be worth over $11 billion, illustrating the scale of opportunity available in Bitcoin’s early days. Community Questions: Why Not XRP? While the comment was intended humorously, it drew attention from XRP supporters who questioned why Schwartz, a central figure in Ripple’s development, would choose Bitcoin rather than XRP. One community member directly asked him, “What about XRP?” XRP, like Bitcoin , also offered major accumulation opportunities during its early years. Historical data shows that in July 2014, XRP traded around $0.0028. If the same $39,000 had been used to purchase XRP at that time, it would have secured roughly 13.9 million tokens, valued today at about $36 million. Though still a considerable return, it falls far short of what early Bitcoin investors would have gained. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz Reflects on His Real XRP Decision Schwartz has previously acknowledged that his real-world investment decisions might have played out differently from ideal scenarios. In January, he revealed that he had opted to acquire Ripple equity instead of XRP tokens in the company’s early days. Looking back, he admitted he sometimes questions that choice, noting that XRP would have been “more liquid” compared to Ripple’s private shares. Given that context, one might assume that Schwartz would use any chance to alter that decision. However, when asked directly why he wouldn’t tell his younger self to buy XRP, he gave a humorous yet thought-provoking response : XRP is too directly connected to his own work at Ripple, and advising himself about it could create a paradox. Though lighthearted, Schwartz’s remarks highlight the differing trajectories of Bitcoin and XRP over time. His response underscores Bitcoin’s unparalleled early returns while reflecting on the limitations and complexities tied to XRP’s origins, particularly for those directly involved in its creation. The conversation, while informal, offered a glimpse into Schwartz’s reflections on early crypto opportunities, as well as his awareness of the ethical and logical questions that arise when considering “what if” scenarios in a market still shaped by its own pioneers.

This move shows that the payment company is considering the acquisition of another crypto firm. Five sources close to the talks stated that, although there is a possibility the deal might not materialize, it would be one of Mastercard’s largest investments in stablecoins if it does. ZeroHash previously raised over $100 million in funding, valuing the company at more than $1 billion. Industry analysts say the move aligns with Mastercard’s plan to enhance its cryptocurrency capabilities and rival other major payment companies, such as Visa and PayPal , which are also backing blockchain-based payment infrastructure. The acquisition could also have implications for emerging markets, where integrated crypto and stablecoin rails may enhance cross-border payments, reduce costs, and offer new options for fintechs and consumers. Mastercard shows growing interest in the acquisition of stablecoin startups Founded in 2017, Zerohash is a leading provider of crypto and stablecoin infrastructure, enabling banks and fintech firms to offer blockchain-based products in three key areas: stablecoins, tokenization, and cryptocurrency trading. Regarding Mastercard’s move to purchase Zerohash, six sources with knowledge of the matter mentioned that the announcement of this potential acquisition came after the payment company’s earlier talks with another stablecoin startup, BVNK. Mastercard and Coinbase were close to acquiring BVNK for about $2 billion during this negotiation period. However, sources pointed out that Coinbase seems to have finalized the deal and is currently in an exclusive partnership with BVNK. This meant that they cannot consider offers from other potential buyers, according to the sources. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that as the crypto industry has grown in value over the past year, firms, particularly those involved with stablecoins, have gained increased popularity. To support this claim, analysts have discovered that following Stripe’s acquisition of the stablecoin startup Bridge for approximately $1.1 billion, numerous other investment agreements and acquisition discussions have ensued. These recent examples of the acquisition of stablecoin startups demonstrate that investors strongly believe that stablecoins and the broader cryptocurrency market will be the future of payments. Additionally, supporters weighed in on the topic of discussion, claiming that stablecoins have benefits compared to traditional methods such as SWIFT, transfers, and wire transfers. Based on their argument, blockchain technology can facilitate transactions more efficiently and at a lower cost. Still, sources noted that the essential infrastructure required to support this vision is being developed, prompting major firms like Coinbase, Mastercard, and Stripe to seek out startups to enhance their new products. Analysts worry that stablecoins might threaten Mastercard’s business model Bridge and BVNK are focused on stablecoins, enabling businesses to leverage cryptocurrencies like USDC and Tether for purposes such as global payroll and treasury management. On the other hand, Zerohash provides a broader scope of services. This includes helping firms establish their own crypto trading platforms and offering APIs for tokenization, which entails placing traditional financial assets into blockchain formats. In September, Zerohash raised approximately $104 million in funding, backed by a strong support system from several investors, including Apollo, Point72 Ventures, Interactive Brokers, and Nyca. At this time, the stablecoin startup secured a valuation of $1 billion. While analysts have raised concerns that stablecoins might threaten Mastercard’s business model, which depends on earning a small payment for every transaction, the company noted that it has been participating in the cryptocurrency ecosystem for some time. Experts suggest the acquisition could have significant implications for emerging markets, including Africa. With Mastercard potentially embedding ZeroHash’s infrastructure into its global network, banks and fintechs in these regions could gain faster, lower-cost access to stablecoin and crypto payment rails.

Meme coins like La Culex flip the story, suddenly, the buzzing pest becomes the banker, and the joke’s on the bears. Forget spare change in a jar; this is spare change in a swarm. Each presale stage, each referral, and each burn feels less like an itch and more like a payday. On social feeds, jokes and memes are already buzzing. One viral post shows a mosquito in a suit with the caption: “Your portfolio manager has arrived.” Another reads: “You can’t outrun a mosquito, but you can ride the swarm to the bank.” La Culex ($CULEX) embraces that mischievous humor, offering tokenomics designed to reward loyalty while keeping the swarm growing. Yet, while this new mosquito coin builds its hive, seasoned players like Solana continue to dominate the charts with speed and resilience. La Culex: The Meme Coin Mosquito with a Sting in Its Tail La Culex ($CULEX) is Ethereum-based, merging playful branding with serious mechanics. Think of it as a crypto’s mosquito: tiny, annoying, but with a surprising bite. Its presale, known as the La Culex presale, is structured across stages, each cleverly named to reflect the risk and reward, like the current “Bug Spray Dip,” priced at $0.00002274 per token. Investors who threw in $7,500 at this stage would receive 329,815,303 tokens, potentially ballooning to $2,308,707.12 at the listing price of $0.007. This projects a jaw-dropping ROI of 30,683% from Stage 3 to the listing price. What drives this potential? La Culex’s tokenomics employ scarcity and community engagement. Systematic token burns shrink supply, while referral incentives reward loyal holders. Staking programs allow holders to earn passive rewards, effectively transforming every token into a potential paycheck. Over 431 million tokens have already been sold, raising over $8,000, with more than 50 buyers onboard. Early joiners enjoyed a 16.8% ROI, highlighting the potential gains for those willing to join the swarm early, making La Culex presale a prime candidate for the next 100x crypto to buy now. Blockchain explorers confirm transparency, with verifiable smart contracts and detailed transaction histories. According to La Culex’s whitepaper, the platform emphasizes sustainable growth, meaning it’s not just hype; it’s engineered to expand the hive methodically. Viral mosquito memes on platforms like Twitter and Reddit bolster community engagement, turning holders into ambassadors. The buzz on social media indicates excitement about the upcoming price surge of 8.091%, moving from $0.00002274 to $0.00002458. Analysts on Telegram groups highlight the network effect: the more people onboard, the larger the swarm, the higher the potential returns. Humor-driven marketing meets serious tokenomics here, creating a phenomenon that’s part game, part investment, and a must-watch for anyone seeking the next 100x crypto to buy now. Solana: The Lightning-Fast Layer 1 Veteran While La Culex is catching eyes with its humor and meme appeal, Solana (SOL) maintains its status as a powerhouse in the blockchain ecosystem. Trading at $200.87 with a 24-hour volume of $7.35 billion, Solana boasts a market cap of $110.42 billion, holding the #6 position on CoinMarketCap. With a circulating supply of 549.7 million SOL and the ability to process up to 710,000 transactions per second through its Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Stake hybrid consensus, Solana is a high-speed network for DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 projects. Recent developments reinforce Solana’s mainstream adoption. Institutional ETF exposure and partnerships, including Western Union’s stablecoin initiative, strengthen on-chain activity and liquidity. Social media sentiment around Solana’s price potential is largely bullish, with analysts noting that the network’s scalability makes it a prime candidate for major financial and NFT applications. Communities are actively discussing staking yields, which range from 6-8% annually, according to Solana’s official documentation, providing investors with steady, verifiable returns. Solana’s ecosystem is a high-octane playground for developers. NFT collaborations, decentralized exchanges, and DeFi protocols thrive on the network, while occasional network hiccups act as reminders that even the fastest horse can stumble. For crypto enthusiasts, Solana represents innovation married to speed—a benchmark against which newer tokens like La Culex measure their own potential. Pudgy Penguins: Meme Coin Meets Strategic Growth Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) adds a different flavor to the meme coin universe. Trading at $0.02128 with a 24-hour volume of $224.87 million, PENGU has a market cap of $1.34 billion, securing a #61 ranking on CoinMarketCap. With a circulating supply of 62.86 billion tokens, it has risen 472.96% from its all-time low of $0.003715. This token demonstrates how strategic community engagement and partnerships can revive a coin from market dips. PENGU’s growth strategy combines nostalgia and pop culture with modern crypto mechanics. NFT collaborations and retail integrations, along with DreamWorks-linked promotions, have positioned Pudgy Penguins as a high-profile meme coin within the Solana ecosystem. Community-driven campaigns, including meme contests and social challenges, ensure the token maintains cultural relevance while fostering loyalty. Analysts note that PENGU’s appeal lies in its blend of humor, art, and finance. The token is designed to thrive on social virality, leveraging the same mechanics that La Culex uses, albeit on a different blockchain. Its rise underscores the importance of community momentum in meme-driven crypto economies. Investors are increasingly paying attention to engagement metrics, NFT collaborations, and token burn strategies when evaluating the long-term viability of such coins. Final Thoughts: Ride the Swarm Wisely La Culex ($CULEX) is more than a playful meme coin; it’s a lesson in strategic tokenomics, community building, and viral marketing. Its Halloween-themed buzz and transparent presale mechanics make it a fascinating watch for crypto students, analysts, and meme coin enthusiasts. Solana’s speed and Pudgy Penguins’ community-driven rise remind investors that balance between innovation, reliability, and virality is key in the crypto landscape. While the swarm is promising, readers should approach every investment with research and caution. In short, if you’re seeking the next 100x crypto to buy now, La Culex offers humor, high-yield staking, and viral potential, but the smartest moves are always informed ones.

The test, which went live around 18:53 UTC, was the completion of Ethereum’s three-stage simulation process following earlier activations on the Holesky and Sepolia testnets. Fusaka Upgrade According to the Ethereum Foundation, Fusaka’s mainnet rollout is expected at least 30 days after Hoodi’s activation, while developers tentatively target December 3. The main objective behind the upgrade is to strengthen Ethereum’s scalability, security, and cost efficiency, building on the groundwork laid by April’s Pectra upgrade. Fusaka introduces a series of technical improvements spanning more than a dozen Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). Leading the list is the EIP-7594, or Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS), which enables validators to verify only portions of data, rather than entire “blobs,” and significantly reduces bandwidth demands and operational costs for validators and Layer 2 networks. Other proposals, such as EIPs 7825 and 7935, will adjust gas limits to improve efficiency and prepare the network for parallel execution, while EIPs 7939 and 7951 boost performance and zero-knowledge proving support. These upgrades are designed to lower transaction costs for users and developers while setting the stage for the next phase of rollup scaling. Ethereum client teams confirmed smooth progress following Hoodi’s activation. Nethermind stated “The Ethereum 𝗛𝗼𝗼𝗱𝗶 𝗙𝗼𝗿𝗸 has been successfully completed and is now running seamlessly on the 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁. Another smooth upgrade, another key milestone on the road to Fusaka. Big thanks to everyone in the ecosystem who helped make it happen – from client teams to researchers and operators.” Road Ahead Consensys also said that Fusaka “paves the way for parallel execution” and lays the foundation for future network advancements. The rollout will proceed in phases. Following the mainnet launch scheduled for December 3, blob capacity increase is expected to be on December 17, while a second hard fork to expand blob capacity further is slated for January 7, 2026. Ethereum developers have already turned their focus to the next upgrade, dubbed “Glamsterdam,” which is expected to introduce faster block times and further scalability enhancements. Glamsterdam falls under the “Surge” stage of the network’s roadmap. Meanwhile, ETH’s price remained fairly unfazed by the technical development. The altcoin recorded a fresh decline of almost 3% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading below $4,000.

Despite this bullish development being highly anticipated by top experts as the best catalyst for the remainder of the year, Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, and Ethereum (ETH) led the market downturn following the announcement. Fed Chair Signals Uncertainty Over Further Rate Cuts The selloff intensified after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated during his press conference that another interest-rate cut in December “is not a foregone conclusion.” This uncertainty has contributed to market volatility, as both cryptocurrencies and stocks have rallied this year in anticipation of lower interest rates. If the Fed does not implement further rate cuts in December, it could lead to a rebound in the dollar, which would be detrimental for Bitcoin bulls. Related Reading: Avalanche Expands In Asia — Japan’s Biggest Card Processor Joins The Network Analyst Manuel Villegas from Julius Baer noted that options-derived implied movements for US equity indices suggest significant shifts around upcoming macroeconomic reports. He advised crypto investors to prepare for potential volatility. However, market expert Timothy Peterson provided further insights on social media site X (formerly Twitter), predicting that the Bitcoin price could rise up to 12% over the next week, meaning that the leading crypto could surge toward $123,000. Analyst Foresees Positive Momentum For Bitcoin In his analysis, Peterson highlighted Bitcoin’s performance surrounding Federal Reserve Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings and noted that since 2023, Bitcoin’s average movement after such meetings has been about 1.5 times its prior week’s performance.

The FOMC, which sets US interest rates and guides monetary policy, often sees markets trade cautiously before meetings, followed by reactions once the uncertainty is resolved, with the expert concluding that despite the growing uncertainty, Bitcoin and the broader market could see a new leg up near record highs.

53800694,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=213380,1761782109,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/53800694.jpeg,"Urgent: Bitcoin Price Fall Sees BTC Plunge Below $110,000",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-fall-below-4/,"BitcoinWorld Urgent: Bitcoin Price Fall Sees BTC Plunge Below $110,000 The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a moment of significant volatility, as Bitcoin (BTC) has urgently plunged below the $110,000 mark. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, this notable Bitcoin price fall sees the leading digital asset now trading at $109,961.01 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden dip has captured the attention of investors globally, sparking discussions about market stability and future trajectories. What exactly triggered this sharp decline, and what does it signify for the broader crypto landscape? What Triggered This Urgent Bitcoin Price Fall? Understanding the forces behind such a significant market movement is crucial. While a single definitive cause is often elusive, several factors likely contributed to the recent Bitcoin price fall . The cryptocurrency market is highly sensitive to macroeconomic indicators, global financial news, and investor sentiment. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Concerns over inflation, rising interest rates, or broader economic uncertainties in traditional markets can often spill over into the crypto space. Investors might de-risk by selling off more volatile assets like Bitcoin. Profit-Taking: After periods of strong performance, it is common for some investors to take profits, leading to selling pressure. This can sometimes trigger a cascade effect, especially if large holders (whales) decide to liquidate significant positions. Technical Corrections: Markets rarely move in a straight line. A technical correction after a strong rally is a natural part of market cycles. This Bitcoin price fall could be seen as the market re-calibrating. Regulatory Speculation: Rumors or actual news regarding new regulations in major economies can create uncertainty and prompt investors to act cautiously, impacting prices. It is important to remember that such price movements are a normal, albeit sometimes dramatic, part of the crypto market’s dynamic nature. Navigating the Market: What Does This Bitcoin Price Fall Mean for Investors? For many, a sudden Bitcoin price fall can be unsettling. However, experienced investors often view such periods as opportunities rather than just setbacks. The key is to approach the situation with a clear strategy and a calm perspective. Consider the following: Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Short-term traders might feel the immediate impact more acutely. However, long-term holders often view these dips as temporary fluctuations in Bitcoin’s journey. Historically, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience and recovery after significant drops. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For those looking to invest, a price dip can be an opportune moment to employ a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price, which can average out the purchase price over time. Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: This is a good time to review your investment goals and risk tolerance. Ensure your portfolio allocation still aligns with your financial objectives. Do not make impulsive decisions based on fear. Education and research are your best allies during volatile times. Understanding market fundamentals helps in making informed decisions. Looking Ahead: The Future After This Bitcoin Price Fall While the immediate future of Bitcoin’s price action remains subject to market dynamics, several factors suggest its long-term potential remains robust. The underlying technology, increasing institutional adoption, and growing global interest continue to build a strong foundation for Bitcoin. Key aspects to monitor include: Support Levels: Watch for key technical support levels where the price might stabilize or find a floor. These levels are often psychological points where buying interest could increase. Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on overall market sentiment. A shift from fear to optimism can quickly change the trajectory of prices. News from major financial institutions or positive regulatory developments could also play a significant role. Broader Crypto Ecosystem: Bitcoin often leads the crypto market. Its recovery can signal a broader uptrend for altcoins, whereas continued weakness might indicate further consolidation across the board. The resilience of Bitcoin has been tested many times, and each major Bitcoin price fall has ultimately paved the way for new growth phases. While caution is always advised, history suggests that Bitcoin often emerges stronger from such corrections. Conclusion: Navigating Volatility with Wisdom The recent Bitcoin price fall below $110,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market. While such dips can be concerning, they are also a normal part of a maturing asset class. Investors are encouraged to remain calm, conduct thorough research, and stick to their long-term investment strategies. Understanding the potential causes and implications allows you to navigate these fluctuations with greater confidence. Bitcoin’s journey is far from over, and its capacity for innovation and adaptation continues to define its exciting future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is this Bitcoin price fall the start of a bear market? A1: It is too early to definitively declare the start of a bear market. Price corrections are normal. While a significant Bitcoin price fall can be alarming, it often represents a period of consolidation before potential recovery. Monitoring market trends and global economic indicators will provide more clarity. Q2: What should I do if I own BTC during this dip? A2: Your actions should align with your personal investment strategy and risk tolerance. Many long-term investors choose to hold (HODL) or consider dollar-cost averaging to buy more at a lower price. Avoid making emotional decisions and consult with a financial advisor if unsure. Q3: What are the primary reasons for such a sudden Bitcoin price fall? A3: Sudden drops can be attributed to a combination of factors, including macroeconomic concerns, large-scale profit-taking by institutional or whale investors, technical market corrections, and sometimes regulatory news or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) in the market. Q4: Is Bitcoin still considered a good investment after this price drop? A4: Bitcoin’s long-term investment thesis, driven by its limited supply, growing adoption, and role as a store of value, remains compelling for many. While short-term volatility is expected, its fundamental value proposition continues to attract investors looking for exposure to digital assets. Always conduct your own research.

In a recent statement shared with followers, UnknowDLT said he believes XRP’s future value extends far beyond current expectations and that its long-term impact could even benefit generations to come. His remarks come amid cautious sentiment in the broader market following weeks of volatility. Earlier this month, XRP dropped to nearly $1.20 during a widespread sell-off that affected most digital assets. Although the token has since recovered much of those losses, investor confidence remains mixed as large holders continue to reduce exposure. According to market analyst Ali Martinez , XRP whales have sold more than 140 million tokens over the past few weeks, signaling a phase of profit-taking. People, I want to be clear once and for all. There is no TA capable of estimating the price of XRP in a utility market. They tell you to sell XRP at $10-20 because of the Bitcoin speculative bullrun. The reality is that we are entering a new financial system that will last 70y — {x} (@unknowDLT) October 15, 2025 Growing Confidence Despite Market Uncertainty While some investors are exiting, others, including UnknowDLT, continue to express long-term optimism. He stated that XRP has the potential to become one of the greatest investment opportunities not only of this generation but possibly for future ones as well. His outlook aligns with the broader sentiment among supporters who argue that XRP’s real-world use cases are still undervalued by the market. Many within the community believe the asset’s underlying technology and adoption by financial institutions give it long-term staying power that goes beyond speculative trading cycles. Ripple’s Continued Commitment to XRP Adding to this sentiment, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently emphasized XRP’s integral role in Ripple’s ecosystem. He described the token as central to the company’s long-term objective of enabling global value transfer through blockchain technology. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple has already built partnerships with financial firms such as Tranglo and SBI Holdings , both of which utilize XRP for cross-border settlements. These implementations highlight XRP’s efficiency in offering faster and lower-cost payment solutions compared to traditional systems, reinforcing its relevance in global finance. Real-World Utility Drives XRP’s Value In his commentary, UnknowDLT also challenged the idea that XRP’s value can be accurately reflected through technical analysis alone. He argued that XRP’s significance lies in its real-world utility, particularly in the payments sector, and that its eventual price performance will depend more on its practical adoption than on short-term chart movements. He added that the current financial system is evolving toward one that could remain in place for several decades and suggested that XRP may play a foundational role in that transformation. According to him, the true impact of XRP’s growth might not be fully realized within this generation, as the infrastructure being built today could continue to yield value far into the future. Market observers note that if financial institutions continue adopting XRP for settlement and remittance purposes, the token could gain stronger institutional trust and long-term legitimacy. This growing confidence could, over time, lead to sustained demand and significant price appreciation, supporting the claim that XRP represents one of the most promising financial opportunities of the modern era.

53800829,616542,1761782429,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53800829.jpeg,Germany’s Poll-Leading Party Goes Full Pro-Bitcoin,https://bitcoinist.com/germany-poll-leading-party-goes-full-pro-bitcoin/,"Germany’s largest opposition force, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), has submitted a Bundestag motion positioning Bitcoin as a strategic technology and urging Berlin to protect the protocol—and its users—from what the party calls excessive government and EU control. The motion , under the title “Recognizing the Strategic Potential of Bitcoin – Preserving Freedom through Restraint in Taxation and Regulation,” is signed by the AfD parliamentary leadership and spearheaded by MP Dirk Brandes. In the text, the party explicitly separates Bitcoin from the broader “crypto-asset” category defined under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. It states that “Bitcoin is a decentralized, non-manipulable, and limited-supply digital asset, and fundamentally differs by its technical design from other so-called crypto-assets.” The motion warns that applying MiCA’s regulatory logic to “an open, decentralized protocol such as Bitcoin” would endanger innovation and digital sovereignty, calling excessive regulation a threat to “financial freedom.” Germany’s AfD Makes Its Pro-Bitcoin Stand On the regulatory front, the AfD asks the federal government not to impose licensing or registration requirements for non-custodial Bitcoin activity—explicitly naming self-hosted wallets, Lightning nodes, and infrastructure tools—so long as no customer funds are held in custody. Tax policy is a second focal point: the motion demands clear legal protection for Germany’s existing one-year holding period after which private gains are tax-free, and calls for a statutory distinction between Bitcoin and other crypto-assets. It further insists that BTC mining and Lightning operation for private purposes should not be classified as commercial activity. Beyond the regulatory and tax proposals, the AfD calls for a formal government strategy paper on Bitcoin’s role as “free, digital money,” exploring its technological, energy, and monetary implications. The AfD’s communications office paired the filing with a pointed attack on the European Central Bank’s “digital euro” project , framing BTC as a civil-liberties alternative. In a party release dated October 23, 2025, Dirk Brandes declared: “Freedom begins with money… The digital euro is nothing more than a tool for surveillance and control – the opposite of freedom. Bitcoin, on the other hand, stands for independence, property, and self-determination.” The statement further urges the government “to recognize Bitcoin as a strategic future technology, to build state Bitcoin reserves, to enable pilot projects for BTC payments in the public sector, and to end the tax discrimination of crypto-assets.” Brandes concluded that “Germany must finally become an innovation leader in this area – not a surveillance state.” However, the text of the official Bundestag motion itself is more restrained. It does not explicitly mandate the immediate accumulation of sovereign Bitcoin reserves or the launch of public-sector Bitcoin payments. Rather, it argues in principle that Bitcoin should be viewed as “outside money”—a neutral global base layer of value—and that it could be “conceivable” within state reserve management in an era of monetary and geopolitical uncertainty. The motion’s operative demands focus instead on regulatory restraint, tax clarity, and a comprehensive federal strategy. In its parliamentary briefing, the AfD summarized the goal concisely: to free BTC from unnecessary regulatory and tax burdens and to prevent the application of MiCA to a decentralized base protocol. The political backdrop adds weight to the move. Since spring 2025, multiple national polls have shown AfD leading Germany’s political field, edging out both major establishment parties. An April Ipsos survey placed AfD at 25%, ahead of the CDU/CSU at 24% and the SPD at 15%. These are polling figures, not electoral results, but they underscore why AfD has intensified its libertarian, pro-sovereignty messaging—using BTC as both a symbol of resistance to state control and a tangible policy wedge against the establishment parties. Institutionally, the motion faces steep odds. The AfD remains in opposition to the governing grand coalition of CDU/CSU and SPD, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, which was confirmed by the Bundestag on May 6, 2025. Without committee majorities or procedural control, AfD’s proposal is unlikely to advance to a vote in its current form. Still, several of its core elements—particularly legal certainty for the one-year tax exemption—may find cross-party resonance as part of upcoming MiCA transposition debates.

The standoff, according to a new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), could result in a decline in national economic output of between $7 billion and $14 billion. The economic damage will only grow the longer the stalemate over funding drags out, according to a report by the CBO released on Wednesday. The partial shutdown has left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay and idled many vital services. Although the administration has stated that it will ensure members of the military, border patrol officers, and employees at other law enforcement agencies are compensated for their lost pay during the shutdown, many civilians remain in a sort of no-man’s land. Small companies that depend on government work have already faced disruptions to cash flow, and federal contractors are feeling the hardest pinch. The economic effect primarily arises from the delay in federal spending, which includes paying the salaries of government employees, purchasing goods and services, or distributing food stamp benefits to low-income Americans. The delays seep into local economies, curbing consumer spending and business activity. CBO Director Phillip Swagel said in a letter to House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington that although most of the economic decline would likely be recovered in the coming years, between $7 billion and $14 billion in real output was expected to be lost permanently. Lawmakers deadlocked as losses mount And in Washington, lawmakers are mired in a partisan standoff. Senate Republicans were seeking a stopgap spending measure to reopen federal agencies through Nov. 21, in hopes of buying themselves several more weeks of bargaining room. But Democrats are cautioning that any deal also needs to extend the critical Affordable Care Act tax credits for those who can’t afford health insurance. The impasse is a symptom of deeper political polarization over what the government should and shouldn’t spend money on, how it should deliver social programs — a divide that nativists in Trump’s camp have used to sabotage budget negotiations for years. The White House is urging Congress to send it a “clean” continuing resolution, one free of policy riders, despite lawmakers’ deep divisions over the nation’s air travel safety and other issues. The White House explains that further gridlock would not only harm workers but also potentially damage the broader economy. The longer the shutdown continues, the more lasting its effects will be, the CBO said. Even if the shutdown were to be resolved immediately, the economy would suffer an estimated loss of around $7 billion in GDP. A six-week shutdown would increase the cumulative deficit to $11 billion, and an impasse lasting eight weeks would raise total losses to $14 billion, with the majority of these losses being permanent. Ripple effects spreading beyond Washington The impacts are national, not just in terms of numbers. Federal loan programs designed to help small farmers, students, and businesses have been placed on hold. Federal money for scientific research is frozen. Meanwhile, at airports across the country, longer lines are fraying travelers’ nerves, and warnings of security disruption have heightened tensions as unpaid workers with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) call out sick. Each side has stated that it is willing to return to the table, but little compromise is in sight. Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, has insisted that spending cuts and reforms be included in any new allocation. Yet Democratic leaders argue that the government should not be held hostage to political wars. *]:pointer-events-auto [content-visibility:auto] supports-[content-visibility:auto]:[contain-intrinsic-size:auto_100lvh] scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:261e8402-0c4c-46a7-8f2f-61a20445a413-42"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-6"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> Kevin Hassett, former economic advisor to Donald Trump, said Monday that the government shutdown is “likely to end sometime this week.” Speaking to CNBC, he added that “there’s a shot that this week, things will come together, and very quickly,” as the shutdown enters its third week without a deal. Speaking on Squawk Box , Kevin said the Trump White House is already preparing backup plans in case the standoff drags on. “If it doesn’t,” he warned, “the White House is going to have to look very closely, along with [budget chief Russell] Vought, at stronger measures that we could take to bring them to the table.” Still, pressure is mounting from business leaders, economists, and ordinary Americans for a solution, as the holiday season approaches and no end in sight.

Despite short-term weakness, several analysts suggest that ETH may be entering a bullish accumulation phase, with price action stabilizing around the key $4,000 level—a zone that has historically served as both strong resistance and support. The asset’s resilience amid market uncertainty reflects growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals and network activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Rises To 83.6% – Market Momentum Building Again Adding to the intrigue, on-chain data from Lookonchain revealed that an Ethereum ICO participant has re-emerged after nearly eight years of dormancy, transferring 1,500 ETH—worth approximately $6 million—to Kraken for the first time. This wallet originally received 20,000 ETH during Ethereum’s 2015 genesis sale, purchased for roughly $6,200, which would now be valued at more than $80 million. Such rare movements from early holders often capture the market’s attention, as they can signal renewed engagement or strategic repositioning. While Ethereum’s price remains in a consolidation phase, the network’s long-term value narrative—driven by layer-2 scaling, staking growth, and DeFi activity—continues to strengthen. If the current range holds, ETH could be positioning for a recovery as market confidence rebuilds. Dormant Ethereum Whale Awakens After 8 Years According to a recent report by Lookonchain, an early Ethereum participant—identified as wallet 0x3690—has resurfaced after nearly eight years of inactivity, sparking renewed discussions across the crypto community. This address was one of the original Ethereum ICO wallets, receiving 20,000 ETH at genesis in 2015 for a total investment of just $6,200. At current prices, that stash would be worth roughly $80.42 million, representing an extraordinary 12,971x return. On October 27, 2025, the wallet sent 1,500 ETH (around $6 million) to Kraken, marking its first-ever on-chain movement since Ethereum’s launch. Such activity from early holders often raises questions about investor sentiment and potential market shifts—especially as the broader crypto market remains in a fragile consolidation phase. While the transfer does not necessarily signal an immediate sell-off, it underscores how long-term participants are beginning to reposition as Ethereum hovers near the $4,000 level. Analysts suggest that the coming weeks will be decisive for the market, as both Bitcoin and Ethereum approach critical technical and psychological thresholds ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s next policy decisions. If Ethereum manages to hold its current range and sustain network engagement, it could confirm the start of a new bullish accumulation phase. Conversely, a breakdown below support might extend the correction before a stronger rebound forms later in the quarter. In either case, this event serves as a reminder of Ethereum’s resilience—and how early conviction in the network’s vision has yielded historic returns for those who held through multiple cycles. The market now watches closely to see whether this renewed on-chain activity signals a turning point or a moment of reflection before the next major move. Related Reading: Binance Whales Turn Active On Uniswap As Outflows Hit Multi-Month Highs – Details Ethereum Struggles To Break $4,200 As Consolidation Tightens Around Key Support Ethereum (ETH) is trading near $3,993, attempting to regain strength after weeks of sideways action. The chart shows ETH struggling to break above the $4,200 resistance, a level that has repeatedly rejected price advances since early October. The 50-day moving average (blue) currently aligns with this resistance, reinforcing it as a critical barrier that bulls must clear to confirm a short-term reversal. Below, the 100-day (green) and 200-day (red) moving averages provide solid structural support near $3,800 and $3,300, respectively. The convergence of these levels suggests that Ethereum remains in a broad consolidation range, with limited momentum on either side as the market digests recent volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Rises To 83.6% – Market Momentum Building Again A decisive close above $4,200 could open the path toward $4,500–$4,700, where liquidity from previous highs remains. Conversely, a breakdown below $3,800 would expose ETH to deeper retracements toward the $3,500 zone, where buyers previously stepped in during September’s correction. Market sentiment appears cautious but not bearish. Ethereum’s ability to hold near the $4,000 psychological level despite the broader market slowdown indicates resilience. As macro uncertainty persists, ETH’s next move will likely depend on whether buying pressure strengthens ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy update this week.

With gold prices having surged most of the year and demand for critical minerals climbing, North American miners have raised $2.9 billion across 185 deals in October alone. That’s the biggest monthly tally since November 2013, according to Bloomberg. Gold and silver miners made up one-third of October’s equity deals, even though the prices of both metals slipped after October 21. Still, investors haven’t flinched. There’s cash chasing deals left and right. “I can’t even think of a deal that’s struggled for the last while,” said Daniel Nowlan, vice-chairman at National Bank Capital Markets. “Almost everything’s been oversubscribed—many deals have been upsized, so the market’s been very strong.” Junior miners raise most of the cash, not the giants This record-setting run wasn’t driven by the big-name giants dumping blocks of shares. It came from the little guys. According to Peter Miller, head of equity capital markets at Bank of Montreal, “the activity in the market so far has been entirely dominated by a plethora of junior miners.” There haven’t been large deals by a few majors, it’s been a swarm of smaller companies grabbing every dollar they can. One of the biggest raises came from NexGen Energy Ltd., a uranium miner listed in Toronto, New York, and Sydney. They pulled in C$400 million ($287.2 million) in a bought deal, followed by an upsized A$600 million ($395.9 million) sale in Sydney. The largest precious metals deal came from Hycroft Mining Holding Corp., a Denver-based gold and silver producer. They raised $171.4 million, taking the top spot in the gold and silver category for October. Demand is strong because investors who missed out on gold’s run this year are now scrambling. “If you were an investor this year that didn’t have appropriate exposure to the sector, you will have lagged from a performance perspective,” said Michelle Khalili, global head of ECM at Bank of Nova Scotia. That underperformance is now pushing money back into precious and base metals, with investors trying to balance their portfolios. U.S. government backing and copper prices drive critical minerals deals There’s also a sharp rise in demand for critical minerals, helped by the U.S. government’s push into the space. Near-record copper prices are another driver. Nowlan said this mix of support and pricing strength will keep the deals flowing “for a while,” even though gold and silver prices dropped recently. According to Miller, metal prices don’t need to be at “stratospheric” levels for these companies to keep selling shares, just “buoyant” enough to justify market interest. Bloomberg data showed Bank of Montreal was the busiest advisor on these deals in October. Miller said they’re already seeing a full November lineup forming. This pace isn’t slowing. Every day brings a new batch of offers, and investors aren’t turning them down. John Ciampaglia, CEO at Sprott Asset Management, said, “We haven’t seen that much capital come into the space in a long time.” More IPOs, SPACs, and equity raises are expected. Subash Chandra, analyst at Benchmark Co., said, “You are going to see a lot of these companies come to market, IPO, SPACs, raise equity. They’re all going to be in this competitive froth to get to market first.” Gold stocks now make up 12% of the S&P/TSX Composite Index in Canada. And in the U.S., Newmont Corp. has doubled in value this year. Even with its recent pullback, it’s still one of the top ten stocks on the S&P 500.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a crucial barometer for market sentiment, has plummeted by 17 points, landing at a concerning 34. This shift from a neutral stance directly into ‘fear’ signals a significant change in how investors are currently perceiving the crypto landscape. What exactly does this sudden drop mean for you and your digital assets? What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Actually Mean? For many in the crypto world, understanding market sentiment is just as important as analyzing price charts. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool designed to measure these collective emotions. It operates on a simple scale: zero represents ‘extreme fear,’ while 100 indicates ‘extreme optimism’ or ‘greed.’ This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a carefully calculated metric. It aggregates data from various sources to provide a comprehensive view of market psychology. Here’s a breakdown of the factors it considers: Volatility (25%): Measures how much the Bitcoin price swings, indicating market uncertainty. Trading Volume (25%): Higher trading volumes in a negative market can signal panic selling. Social Media Mentions (15%): Analyzes keywords and sentiment on platforms like Twitter. Surveys (15%): Gathers direct insights from investors (though currently paused). Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): A rising dominance often suggests investors are fleeing altcoins for Bitcoin, a perceived safer haven. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search trends for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin crash,’ indicating public concern. Each of these components contributes to the overall score, giving us a snapshot of the prevailing crypto sentiment . Why Has Crypto Sentiment Shifted to Fear? The recent drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 34 isn’t just a number; it reflects a tangible shift in market psychology. Several factors likely contribute to this downturn, pushing investors from a neutral outlook into a state of apprehension. While the index doesn’t pinpoint exact causes, we can infer potential influences based on its components. Increased market volatility, often seen during price corrections or periods of economic uncertainty, would contribute significantly to the fear score. If trading volumes remain high during price drops, it suggests a wave of selling pressure, further fueling negative sentiment. Additionally, a surge in negative social media chatter or an increase in Google searches for ‘crypto crash’ terms would also pull the index lower. The collective weight of these indicators paints a picture of investors becoming more cautious, perhaps reacting to recent market performance or broader macroeconomic concerns. Navigating the Fear: What Should Investors Do When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is Low? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals ‘fear,’ it can be an unsettling time for investors. However, it’s crucial to remember that fear in the market often presents both challenges and potential opportunities. Succumbing to panic can lead to impulsive decisions, such as selling assets at a loss, which can be detrimental to your portfolio. Challenges: Emotional Decisions: Fear can drive irrational selling, leading to regret later. Short-Term Focus: Panicked investors often lose sight of long-term investment goals. Potential Opportunities & Actionable Insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Use this period to research projects with strong fundamentals. Avoid Impulsive Moves: Resist the urge to sell purely based on market sentiment. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: Gradually investing fixed amounts over time can mitigate risk during volatile periods. Reassess Risk Tolerance: Ensure your portfolio aligns with your comfort level for risk. Focus on Long-Term Vision: Historically, significant market dips have often preceded periods of recovery. Many seasoned investors view periods of extreme fear as potential buying opportunities, subscribing to the adage, ‘be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.’ However, this strategy requires careful consideration and a solid understanding of your investment goals. Always remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct buy or sell signal. Beyond the Numbers: Understanding Market Psychology with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The value of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index extends beyond just its numerical score; it offers a fascinating glimpse into the collective psychology of the market. Human emotions, particularly fear and greed, are powerful drivers in financial markets. When greed dominates, it can lead to irrational exuberance and asset bubbles, as investors chase ever-higher prices. Conversely, when fear takes hold, it can trigger widespread panic selling, even of fundamentally sound assets. This herd mentality can amplify market movements, both up and down. By observing the index, investors can gain a better understanding of these emotional cycles. It serves as a reminder to check personal biases and make decisions based on analysis rather than raw emotion. Recognizing when the market is overly fearful or overly greedy can help you adopt a more contrarian and disciplined approach to your investments, fostering better long-term outcomes. The recent plunge of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 34 is a stark reminder of the volatile and emotionally driven nature of the cryptocurrency market. While it signals a prevalent sense of fear among investors, it also serves as a critical indicator for those looking to make informed decisions. Rather than succumbing to panic, use this data to understand the broader market psychology, reassess your strategies, and make choices aligned with your long-term financial goals. Staying informed and disciplined is key to navigating these turbulent waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), providing a snapshot of how emotional or rational investors are. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? It’s calculated using several weighted factors, including market volatility (25%), trading volume (25%), social media sentiment (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin’s market cap dominance (10%), and Google search trends (10%). What does a low Crypto Fear & Greed Index (like 34) signify? A low score, such as 34, indicates that the market is experiencing significant fear. This often means investors are apprehensive, potentially leading to selling pressure, but it can also signal potential buying opportunities for those with a long-term perspective. Should I buy or sell when the index is in ‘fear’? The index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct financial advisor. While extreme fear can sometimes precede market bottoms (making it a potential buying opportunity for some), it’s crucial to conduct your own research (DYOR) and make decisions based on your personal financial situation and risk tolerance, not just the index score. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is updated daily, providing a fresh look at market sentiment every 24 hours.

This came during their bilateral meeting on Tuesday. Two Japanese government officials allegedly said she told Trump that cutting Russian LNG is “difficult” because Japan depends on it for energy. The U.S. has been urging countries, including Japan, to stop buying Russian energy and to impose sanctions on oil exporters Rosneft and Lukoil to pressure Moscow to end the war in Ukraine. But Takaichi-san wanted Trump to understand Japan’s situation and energy security needs. Russian LNG accounts for about 9% of Japan’s total LNG supply. Japanese companies Mitsui and Mitsubishi also hold stakes in Russia’s Sakhalin-2 LNG project located in the Russian Far East. If Japan suddenly stops buying from Sakhalin-2, the gap would have to be filled by more expensive imports. This would raise energy costs at home. According to the Nikkei, Takaichi-san, who became Japan’s first female prime minister last week, told Trump that stopping the imports would “only make China and Russia happy.” She said Japan cutting purchases would simply shift more Russian supply toward Beijing and possibly New Delhi, not reduce Moscow’s energy revenue. Japan weighs U.S. pressure against domestic energy needs China and India have been two of the largest buyers of Russian energy since the Ukraine war began. However, many Indian refiners paused new Russian oil orders after fresh U.S. sanctions last week and are waiting for more guidance from their government and suppliers. Japan has been increasing its imports of U.S. LNG in recent years. The goal is to diversify away from relying too heavily on one supplier. Japan is also preparing for the expiration of Sakhalin-2 supply contracts, which mostly end between 2028 and 2033. Japan’s industry minister said last week that replacing that gas will be costly and likely drive up electricity prices. Japan currently buys less than 1% of its crude oil imports from Russia. These purchases are allowed under a sanctions waiver that expires in December. The majority of Japan’s oil supply comes from the Middle East. Russia remains the world’s third-largest exporter of crude oil and the second-biggest exporter of diesel. It has exported more than 800,000 barrels per day of diesel this year, which is about 3% of global demand. Global diesel supply shifts under U.S. and EU sanctions The U.S. sanctions are adding to existing disruption in the diesel market. Earlier this month, the European Union approved a sanctions package that bans imports of fuel made from Russian crude. That ban goes into effect in January 2026.This closes a loophole that previously allowed refiners in India and Turkey to buy Russian crude, refine it, and export the fuel to Europe. With both the U.S. and EU tightening measures, traders are scrambling to secure new diesel supply sources, especially for Europe, which is the world’s largest diesel-importing region. As a result, the profit margin for refining crude oil into diesel has jumped nearly 20% over the past week to around $29 per barrel, the highest since February 2024, according to LSEG data. Shipping analytics firm Kpler reports that Rosneft and Lukoil have exported 182,000 barrels per day and 138,000 barrels per day of diesel this year, which together account for 39% of Russia’s total diesel exports. Turkey is the biggest buyer of Russian diesel, purchasing 36% of seaborne exports. Brazil is second with 18%. Large companies in both countries may reduce imports to avoid sanctions exposure. But smaller importers with no ties to U.S. banks will likely continue buying. China, with its network of traders and tankers designed to bypass Western sanctions, is expected to take some of the surplus diesel at discounted prices. Any leftover Russian diesel will likely end up in the shadow trading market, where fuel is blended or rebranded before being sent onward.

The storm led to power and internet outages that have crippled large parts of the region, essentially severing communication for millions of people. And now Dorsey’s creation, Bitchat , which allows people to send messages without an internet connection, has rapidly become the second-most downloaded app on both the Apple App Store and Google Play in Jamaica. It’s second only to a popular weather tracking platform, Zoom Earth. Staying informed and connected are undoubtedly the twin priorities on the island. The app’s rise in Jamaica coincides with Hurricane Melissa’s ongoing impact on large parts of the Caribbean, resulting in widespread power and internet outages . Many residents have turned to Bitchat as a crucial backup communication tool, helping families and communities stay connected despite broken infrastructure. Offline communication becomes a lifeline Bitchat, launched in July 2025, allows users to send encrypted messages without an internet connection or phone number . The app is praised for not requiring mobile data to function. The app utilizes Bluetooth mesh networking, a technology that enables nearby phones to exchange messages with each other. In essence, each phone becomes a small transmitter, and encrypted messages can be passed along from one phone to another until they reach their intended destination. The technology has been invaluable in places where mobile networks have failed, as was the case in parts of the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian. Local volunteers and community groups have also begun deploying Bitchat to organize humanitarian aid in the most severely affected regions. The design of the app fits in with Dorsey’s career-long mission to bring decentralization to technology. Unlike other mass-market messaging apps, Bitchat doesn’t use centralized servers or require a phone number to sign up for an account. It functions completely using peer-to-peer connections and end-to-end encryption, making it a trustworthy tool even in emergency mode. The spike in downloads in Jamaica mirrors a trend across other parts of the world. When the government blocked major social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and YouTube, in September during anti-corruption protests in Nepal, citizens turned to Bitchat. The app also experienced a surge in usage in Indonesia and Madagascar at the same time as unrest and service outages. Experts say these trends illustrate a growing need for communication tools that can operate beyond the reach of government or corporate control, particularly in crises — whether artificial, policy-driven, or natural. Experts raise security concerns While Bitchat is receiving a lot of attention for its original spin on messaging, cybersecurity experts cautioned that the app had only just begun. Experts say some security measures will need to be tested, and conversations are underway to ensure immunity from impersonation or spoofing attacks. Dorsey himself has stated many times that the app is growing and that updates are being issued to enhance end-to-end encryption, ensure message integrity, and other similar enhancements. And yet for many Jamaicans, Bitchat is a lifeline. However, the most useful feature of the app at the moment is that it works offline. The app’s success serves as a reminder of how technology can respond to real-world turmoil, especially in an era of heightened communal vulnerability. Bitchat’s quick deployment in Jamaica may serve as a model for future emergency communications systems. Humanitarian organizations and local governments are beginning to explore how mesh-based solutions like this can be integrated into emergency response plans. As more powerful and frequent hurricanes make landfall due to climate change, decentralized communication tools are necessary now more than ever. Bitchat has risen to the top of Jamaica’s app charts during a national crisis, another sign that people are constantly seeking ways to help themselves survive or prepare for disasters.

Recently, this index made a notable move, climbing to 32, a five-point jump from its previous reading. This shift isn’t just a number; it offers valuable insights into the broader market sentiment and the potential performance of various digital assets. For many investors, understanding the Altcoin Season Index is key to navigating the volatile world of crypto. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? Many new and experienced crypto enthusiasts often wonder how market trends are identified. The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap, serves as a vital barometer for the health and direction of the broader altcoin market. It helps investors gauge whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin, or vice versa. This fascinating metric is calculated by: Comparing the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to ensure a clear picture of speculative asset performance. Measuring this performance against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. A reading closer to 100 strongly suggests that the market is currently in an ‘altcoin season’. Conversely, a lower reading, especially closer to zero, points towards a ‘Bitcoin season’. Why Does a 32 Reading Matter for Your Portfolio? The recent rise of the Altcoin Season Index to 32, up five points, is more than just a statistical blip. It signals a subtle yet significant shift in market dynamics. While 32 is still far from the 75% threshold that officially declares an altcoin season, this upward movement indicates increasing momentum for altcoins relative to Bitcoin. Historically, an altcoin season is declared when 75% of the top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. A reading of 32 suggests that while Bitcoin may still be dominating, a growing number of altcoins are starting to show strength. This could be an early indicator for investors to: Diversify Research: Begin exploring promising altcoin projects that are showing resilience or growth. Monitor Market Sentiment: Pay closer attention to news and developments in the altcoin space. Consider Rebalancing: Evaluate their portfolio allocations between Bitcoin and various altcoins. Are We Entering an Altcoin Season or Still in Bitcoin’s Shadow? The distinction between an altcoin season and a Bitcoin season is crucial for strategic investment. When the Altcoin Season Index crosses the 75-point mark, it typically signifies a period where capital flows heavily into altcoins, often leading to substantial gains across a wide range of smaller cap assets. During these times, Bitcoin’s dominance might wane slightly as investors seek higher returns in alternative cryptocurrencies. However, the current reading of 32 tells us that we are still primarily in a ‘Bitcoin season,’ or at least a transitional phase. Bitcoin continues to be the dominant force, often leading market movements. This presents both challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Altcoins may still experience higher volatility and be more susceptible to Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. Benefits: Early signs of altcoin strength, like the recent index rise, can offer strategic entry points before a full-blown altcoin season takes hold. Investors can potentially accumulate assets at lower prices. The recent climb of the Altcoin Season Index to 32 is a compelling data point for anyone tracking the cryptocurrency markets. While it doesn’t immediately signal a full altcoin season, it certainly suggests a warming trend for alternative cryptocurrencies. This five-point jump encourages investors to remain vigilant, conduct thorough research, and prepare for potential shifts in market leadership. Staying informed about such indicators empowers you to make more strategic and timely investment decisions in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

ETH may still be the favorite among investors seeking stability, but scrutiny is increasingly being drawn to newer projects with greater early growth potential. One prime example is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which was recently ranked the best crypto to buy by investors seeking to diversify into high-upside projects. Now in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM has already raised over $18.15 million, with over 80% of tokens in this sold out at $0.035 each. Its Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending ecosystem of two makes the token a next-generation DeFi platform, providing investors with new earning and borrowing opportunities. For prospective buyers of the crypto that will boom during the next bull run, Mutuum Finance presents a unique opportunity to invest in a project with huge potential on the ground floor, ahead of mass market adoption and capturing a lot of upside. Ethereum (ETH) Prepares to Breakout as Symmetrical Triangle Emerges Ethereum (ETH) is currently coiled in a symmetrical triangle, making higher lows and lower highs, the hallmark sign of a potential breakout. A couple of clean breaks along each trendline confirm this formation, indicating the more time price is contained, the more intense the move will be when it breaks. A breakout at $4,265 could lead to $4,500, and a breakdown at $3,640 could reveal $3,300 as the next support. Traders need to monitor volume spikes and confirmations on candles prior to buying or selling and manage stops just outside triangle lines. With sentiment remaining high in the market and macro figures on the mend, ETH is poised to make a clear push in the short term. While Ethereum is gearing to potentially breakout, investors are also looking at fresh opportunities in DeFi projects offering early-stage potential along with pioneering utility. One of these projects gaining increased focus is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), whose presale traction and pioneering dual-lending arrangement are generating interest among investors on the look-out for high-potential alternatives. Presale Growth MUTM presale has seen strong initial traction. The token value of $0.035 in Phase 6 is 250% higher than $0.01 when the presale began. To date, the presale has tallied $18.15 million from more than 17,550 holders, with a front-end load sellout of approximately 80% of the existing phase. After Phase 6, the token price will go up by about 15%, very close to its estimated listing price of $0.06. This dramatic presale surge has also caught investors and experts off guard by demonstrating enormous faith in the project’s future. Mutuum Finance Ecosystem Mutuum Finance is built on an over-collateralized lending protocol with security for lenders being as much a priority as protocol stability. For instance, the lender who is giving $8,000 of ETH can lend $6,000 at 75% LTV and earn interest in the form of mtTokens, receipt tokens received 1:1, which appreciate with the passage of time. Analogously, lending stablecoins of $3,000 allows borrowers to borrow the same in other stable assets at fixed rates of interest, releasing yield farming opportunities without the need for selling their underlying holdings. Since borrowing enables higher volume, annual percentage yields (APYs) will increase, or rather, early liquidity providers are richly rewarded. Such a natural growth curve places MUTM in the league of the best-investment crypto for value appreciation and high early returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised a total of $18.15M from 17,550+ holders, with Phase 6 selling 80% at $0.035. Early investors are provided with access to its dual-lending DeFi platform before the next phase hits $0.04. Start investing in the presale today.

Here’s What Must Happen,https://timestabloid.com/can-cardano-ada-flip-solana-sol-heres-what-must-happen/,"Cardano (ADA) continues to face challenges regaining momentum in the crypto market despite brief periods of recovery. The asset’s recent performance highlights the scale of growth required for it to reclaim its former position above Solana (SOL) in global cryptocurrency rankings. Cardano saw renewed optimism earlier this week after its price briefly rose to $0.6913, prompting speculation that it could retest the $0.70 resistance level. However, the recovery was short-lived. The token declined to $0.6394 during Tuesday’s trading session before stabilizing slightly at $0.6402. Overall, Cardano remains down more than 3% over the past 24 hours and has recorded a monthly loss exceeding 20%. The broader market has also experienced a similar downturn, with Solana among the assets impacted. At the time of writing, Solana has declined by approximately 0.86% in the last 24 hours. Despite these temporary setbacks, both assets remain key players in the layer-one blockchain sector. Cardano Community Anticipates a Stronger November Members of the Cardano community remain optimistic about the project’s near-term outlook. Crypto commentator Tyler Burke recently pointed out that November has historically been a positive month for ADA. He referenced the 216% rally that occurred in November 2024, which coincided with major political and market events. Burke suggested that a similar pattern could repeat, encouraging investors to monitor the asset closely as November approaches. His remarks reflect broader sentiment among Cardano supporters who believe the token could soon regain lost ground despite recent volatility. Comparing Cardano and Solana’s Market Positions Currently, Solana ranks as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, while Cardano has fallen to tenth place. According to market data, Cardano’s valuation stands at roughly $23 billion, with each ADA trading near $0.64. Meanwhile, Solana maintains a significantly higher market capitalization of about $106.8 billion, supported by a trading price of approximately $197 per SOL. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For Cardano to overtake Solana , its market cap would need to exceed Solana’s current valuation. This means ADA’s total market capitalization must increase by roughly 365%, reaching around $107 billion. Given Cardano’s circulating supply of about 35.85 billion tokens, such a valuation would translate to a price of approximately $2.98 per ADA. This target remains slightly below Cardano’s previous all-time high of $3.10, recorded in September 2021. Realistic Prospects and Market Implications While these figures are technically achievable, they rely on the assumption that Solana’s market cap remains steady, an unlikely scenario given its ongoing network development, increasing adoption, and growing institutional interest. For Cardano to catch up, it would require substantial capital inflows and renewed enthusiasm among investors, as well as notable progress in ecosystem development, including dApp activity, DeFi participation, and scalability improvements. Despite current challenges, analysts acknowledge that ADA still holds long-term potential due to its strong community, consistent network upgrades, and academically driven approach to blockchain innovation. However, overtaking Solana in the near term would demand sustained momentum across both market sentiment and technological advancement.

53802540,616302,1761786041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53802540.jpeg,Bitcoin Buy Signal: Binance BTC/Stablecoin Ratio Hints at Incoming Supply Shock,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-buy-signal-binance-btc-stablecoin-ratio/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to reclaim key resistance levels this week as traders brace for the US Federal Reserve meeting later today—a pivotal event that could set the tone for risk assets heading into November. Market volatility has tightened in recent days, with investors watching whether the Fed will maintain its restrictive policy or hint at easing amid slowing macro indicators. According to top analyst Darkfost, on-chain data reveals that the BTC Stablecoin Reserve Ratio on Binance is once again flashing a buy signal, a pattern that has historically preceded upward price movements. The signal follows weeks of market turbulence triggered by the October 10th liquidation event, which erased billions in leveraged positions across exchanges. The resulting spillover in the derivatives market also rippled into spot markets, amplifying volatility and testing investor conviction. While some participants opted to hedge or rotate into stablecoins, others saw the downturn as an accumulation opportunity—a dynamic now reflected in Binance’s shifting reserve ratios. As Bitcoin consolidates around critical levels, traders are positioning for what could be the next significant move, with macro policy and liquidity conditions likely dictating direction. Bitcoin Indicator Flashes Buy Signal For The Third Time This Cycle According to on-chain analyst Darkfost, the recent market activity has triggered major shifts within Binance reserves, both in stablecoins and BTC holdings. Amid the post-liquidation recovery, one clear trend has emerged from the noise: the BTC/Stablecoin reserve ratio on Binance is now flashing a buy signal for the third time this cycle—a pattern that has historically preceded strong upward moves in Bitcoin’s price. Darkfost notes that this same signal has appeared at critical turning points in the past. In January 2023, Bitcoin rallied from $16,600 to $24,800. The second instance, in March 2023, preceded a surge from $20,300 to $73,000, marking the beginning of a major bullish phase. The most recent occurrence, in March 2025, was followed by another substantial move from $78,600 to $123,500. This recurring signal reflects a structural change within Binance’s reserves: stablecoin holdings are increasing relative to BTC reserves. In other words, there is a growing amount of stablecoins ready to enter the market while BTC reserves continue to fall. Such a dynamic often creates conditions for a supply shock, where buying demand begins to outpace available supply, setting the stage for a potential bullish reversal. What makes this setup particularly notable is its context. This pattern usually forms during bear markets or following deep corrections, when accumulation phases begin to rebuild market strength. Seeing it develop now—while Bitcoin consolidates near key support levels—is unusual and suggests that large holders and institutional participants may already be positioning for the next major upward phase. Bitcoin Faces Resistance As Bulls Attempt To Reclaim Momentum Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating around $112,900, showing early signs of recovery after bouncing from its 200-day moving average (red line) near $108,000. The price structure suggests that BTC is attempting to regain bullish momentum but continues to face notable resistance at $117,500, a level that has capped multiple rallies since late August. The 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages currently converge around $114,000–$115,000, reinforcing this zone as a short-term barrier. A clean break and daily close above this area would confirm renewed buying strength and potentially trigger a move toward $120,000–$123,000, where prior liquidity clusters exist. On the downside, the 200-day MA remains the critical support to monitor. As long as Bitcoin holds above it, the broader uptrend structure remains intact, despite recent volatility. A close below $108,000, however, could expose BTC to a deeper correction toward $102,500, where the next significant support lies. Market participants appear cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting this Wednesday, with traders balancing macro uncertainty against improving on-chain metrics. The ongoing consolidation may therefore act as a pre-breakout accumulation phase, with a decisive move likely to follow once policy clarity and liquidity direction are established.

The company pointed straight to the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on vehicles imported into the United States, and to weakening demand in China, which remains one of its most important markets. The company also noted that when the quarter is adjusted for €1.3 billion in one‑time charges, mostly tied to a voluntary redundancy program that began in Germany in April, the earnings decline was 17% compared to last year. Even with the weaker quarter, Mercedes reaffirmed its full‑year outlook, supported by strong sales in its top‑end luxury segment. Trump’s tariffs force strategic adjustments for Mercedes The new U.S. 15% import duty on European cars that took effect September 1 drove up costs at a critical time for the company. Ola Källenius, the chief executive, told analysts on a call that the company has been working to manage the impact. “We are very aware of the challenges,” Ola said. “We have a plan.” He said the company would continue to focus on efficiency and the “introduction of an array of new models.” Earlier in July, Mercedes cut its earnings projection for the year because of the U.S. tariff environment. The same pressure affected BMW, Volkswagen, and Porsche, forcing all of them to reassess whether expanding production inside the United States makes more sense than continuing to rely on imports. Ola said the United States is still considered a growth market, and confirmed that Mercedes is reviewing whether to expand production beyond its existing SUV plant in Alabama. When asked if the company will raise prices in the U.S. to offset increased import costs, he declined to provide details. Shares of Mercedes rose 3.8% in early trading on the German exchange following the release of the results. The movement came after the company confirmed it would repurchase €2 billion worth of shares. Analysts had expected a buyback, but the size of the program stood out. Patrick Hummel, an analyst at UBS, said in a note that “the relatively high amount sends a signal of confidence.” Chinese sales slump as local EV rivals gain ground China continues to be the company’s weakest market. Sales in the country were down 27% in the third quarter. Mercedes faces slowing demand from local buyers and intense competition from BYD, Xiaomi, and other Chinese brands that are expanding in the EV space. To respond, Mercedes plans to launch a semi‑autonomous model in China later this fall. The automaker also plans to introduce more than 40 new vehicles next year, spanning electric, hybrid, and V‑8 combustion engine models. This marks a shift away from its previous push toward an electric‑only future. At the same time, the restructuring program has sparked major workforce changes inside the company. Harald Wilhelm, the chief financial officer, said on the call that “a lot of workers are expected to leave the company by the end of the year.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",News|Mercedes,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-30 01:03:02

The trader paid $20.9 million in premium for the position, which is targeting a rally of more than 30%, even though the S&P 500 is currently hovering around 6,900. This trade was flagged by Christopher Jacobson, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group, in a client note seen by Cryptopolitan. “It’s a large trade even by SPX standards,” Jacobson wrote, calling attention to its sheer size. For the uninitiated, options like these are used daily by both retail and institutional investors, often to hedge risk or go directional. Trader positions for upside and volatility Jacobson said the trader appears to be looking for “limited-risk exposure to a significant move higher over the course of the next year and/or an increase in that upside volatility.” The setup gives this guy a chance to profit even if the S&P 500 doesn’t quite reach 9,000. As long as the index keeps pushing upward, or if volatility spikes, there’s money to be made. That angle on volatility is especially important, because you see, this year has been unusually quiet, as the market has mostly rallied and broken records multiple times without much drama, though with short-lived dips like the one in April offering brief tension. That low volatility has made US stock options pricing relatively cheap, so the timing of this trade, right before a flood of tech earnings and a major Fed meeting, might not be as random as we think. And the US options market has been running hot, with daily volumes hitting 67 million contracts in September, up by 40% from the same time last year, according to data tracked by the Options Clearing Corp. This surge is being driven by both the retail crowd and structured product flows. Markets react to Big Tech earnings and Powell’s rate signal That massive $21 million trade came just hours before tech giants Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft dropped earnings. Cryptopolitan reported that Alphabet popped 6% in after-hours on strong results, while Meta fell 8% and Microsoft dropped 4%, dragging futures lower. Futures tied to the S&P 500 dropped 0.2%, the Dow fell 95 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped 0.3%. The day before, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 74 points, or 0.2%, even after touching a record high. The S&P 500 finished flat. The Nasdaq was the only index that moved meaningfully, ending up nearly 0.6%.

Just as new crypto projects vie for mindshare, startups across all sectors are battling for visibility. This fierce competition has led some founders to embrace unconventional tactics, challenging traditional notions of brand building. One such visionary, Roy Lee of Cluely, recently unveiled his controversial ‘ragebait strategy’ for achieving rapid market penetration, sparking debate and driving unprecedented growth for his Cluely AI assistant. Decoding the Startup Marketing Blueprint For many emerging companies, particularly those not entrenched in deep technological breakthroughs, the pathway to success isn’t solely about product superiority; it’s about distribution. Roy Lee articulated this sentiment forcefully at Disrupt 2025, emphasizing that unless you’re in ‘deep tech,’ an intense focus on distribution is non-negotiable. This perspective underscores a critical shift in startup marketing : the product itself, no matter how innovative, struggles without a robust strategy to get it in front of the right audience. However, Lee also highlighted a stark reality: not every founder or team is inherently equipped for the cutthroat world of viral content creation. He provocatively stated, “If you’re any good at engineering, you’re probably not funny and you’re probably not going to be a content creator because you don’t have it in your blood. Realistically, most of these people have no chance of going viral.” This suggests a talent gap in the entrepreneurial landscape, where technical prowess doesn’t automatically translate into marketing savvy. The Power of Viral Marketing in a Crowded AI Space Cluely’s meteoric rise is a testament to the power of well-executed viral marketing . The company’s AI assistant shot to fame in April following a sensational, albeit disproven, claim: its ‘undetectable windows’ could “help you cheat on anything.” While proctoring services quickly debunked this assertion, the damage, or rather, the attention, was already done. In mere months, Cluely secured a hefty $15 million investment from Andressen Horowitz (a16z) and cemented its position as one of the most visible players in the increasingly saturated AI assistant market. This incident serves as a potent example of how controversy, when strategically deployed, can generate immense buzz. For startups, particularly those with limited marketing budgets, leveraging viral loops can be a game-changer. It shifts the focus from costly traditional advertising to creating content that inherently encourages sharing and discussion, regardless of its positive or negative sentiment. Embracing the Ragebait Strategy : Cluely’s Path to Prominence Lee openly embraces what many might call a ‘ragebait strategy,’ deliberately crafting his public persona and messaging to be controversial. “I think I’m particularly good at framing myself in a way that’s controversial,” he confessed. “I do a lot of things that are different. And everything I do that’s different, I frame it through the filter of my voice. And my voice is naturally just very enraging to a lot of people.” This approach is not accidental; it’s a calculated move to stand out. In a world awash with information, being bland is often worse than being disliked. The goal is not universal adoration, but universal awareness. By provoking strong reactions, Lee ensures that his message, and by extension, Cluely, becomes a topic of widespread conversation. This strategy, while risky, can deliver exponential reach that traditional PR efforts often fail to achieve. Key Aspects of the Ragebait Strategy: Deliberate Controversy: Crafting claims or statements designed to elicit strong, often negative, emotional responses. Authentic (or Perceived Authentic) Voice: Using a distinct personal voice that resonates, even if it irritates some. Focus on Attention: Prioritizing engagement and discussion over universally positive sentiment. Rapid Iteration: Quickly adapting and responding to public reaction to maintain momentum. Beyond the Hype: The Story of Cluely AI The journey of Cluely AI from a bold claim to a funded venture highlights the efficacy of this unconventional marketing. The “undetectable windows” stunt, while misleading, put Cluely on the map. It demonstrated that in the current digital landscape, the initial spark of attention can be more valuable than immediate factual accuracy, especially when followed by substantial product development and investment. However, Lee remains cagey about the company’s internal metrics, such as revenue or user numbers. He wisely noted, “What I’ve learned is that you should never share revenue numbers because if you’re doing well, nobody will talk about how well you’re doing. And if you’re doing poorly, people will only talk about how poorly you’re doing.” This discretion maintains an aura of mystery and prevents potential critics from fixating on figures rather than the broader narrative of growth and innovation. He simply states, “I’ll say we’re doing better than I expected, but it’s not the fastest growing company of all time.” Navigating the Attention Economy : Is Reputation Obsolete? Lee’s philosophy extends to a broader theory of social media, where attention is the ultimate currency. He argues that “reputation is sort of a thing of the past.” In an era where figures like Sam Altman and Elon Musk engage in often provocative and unpolished online behavior, the traditional model of safeguarding an ‘ironclad reputation’ like the New York Times seems increasingly outdated. “You just have to realize that the world is trending to a different place,” Lee asserted, “where you have to be extreme, you have to be authentic and you have to be personal.” This perspective suggests a new paradigm for brand building, one where raw, unfiltered engagement, even if polarizing, trumps carefully curated public images. For startups, this means being bold, taking risks, and understanding that silence in the digital age often equates to invisibility. Traditional Reputation vs. Attention Economy: Aspect Traditional Reputation Attention Economy Primary Goal Trust, Credibility, Esteem Visibility, Engagement, Virality Key Metric Public Perception, Brand Loyalty Impressions, Shares, Reactions Approach Controlled Messaging, PR Controversy, Authenticity, Personal Branding Risk Tolerance Low (Avoid Scandal) High (Embrace Polarization) Conclusion: The Future of Startup Growth? Roy Lee’s controversial ‘ragebait strategy’ for startup marketing offers a stark, yet compelling, vision for achieving rapid growth in today’s hyper-connected world. While not for the faint of heart, or perhaps, for every company, Cluely’s success demonstrates that in the battle for attention, being unforgettable, even if it means being infuriating to some, can be a powerful accelerator. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, founders must weigh the benefits of a carefully guarded reputation against the undeniable power of viral engagement. The era of extreme authenticity and personal branding, as championed by Lee, might just be the new frontier for securing venture capital and market dominance.

According to reliable sources, the issue began this week at Honda’s factories in North America and is anticipated to impact other carmakers globally. This was after the global car industry raised concerns about the impacts of Nexperia, a semiconductor manufacturer based in the Netherlands, following its move to halt shipments from China earlier this month. Sources have pointed to political instability between the Dutch, Chinese, and US governments as a potential cause of this problem, which has left some car makers and parts suppliers with only a small amount of chips, likely to be depleted. The microchip shortage follows pressure to force the sale of Nexperia’s microchip plant in Stockport, after senior politicians cautioned that the UK is exposing itself to national‑security risks by permitting Chinese ownership of the site. The plant, based in Greater Manchester, stands as one of the UK’s largest semiconductor manufacturing facilities, generating £192 million in revenue last year. Lawmakers have warned that keeping control in the hands of a company ultimately owned by a Chinese tech conglomerate poses national security concerns, including potential interference, access to industrial data, and leverage over a critical segment of Britain’s supply chain. The renewed scrutiny follows the Dutch government’s invocation of emergency powers earlier this month to seize control of Nexperia’s headquarters in the Netherlands. Honda reduces productivity amid escalating scarcity of Nexperia’s chip Although Nexperia does not manufacture advanced semiconductors , sources identified that it plays a significant role in the market for the production of basic chips used in many car parts. Industry executives and analysts have warned that a heavy reliance on these chips makes it difficult to find sufficient replacements if shipments do not resume soon. Regarding the situation , Håkan Samuelsson, Chairman of the Executive Board of Volvo Cars Corporation AB, stated, “These components are not very strategic, but there are hundreds of them, including tiny microprocessors in lock systems, climate controls, speedometers, among others.” Samuelsson made these comments during a recent interview. His remarks followed reports from sources indicating that Honda had reduced productivity by half at its assembly plant in Alliston, Ontario. Notably, in this assembly, workers manufacture the Civic sedan and the CR-V SUV. Honda’s move prompted Vito Beato, president of Unifor Local 1285, to predict that the slowdown will continue through next Wednesday. Unifor Local 1285 represents workers at a supplier for the assembly plant in Alliston, Ontario. Following his prediction, Beato shared a video on Facebook mentioning that the plant will shut down for a week starting Thursday and then gradually restart production late next week. When reporters requested a spokesperson from Honda to comment, the representative acknowledged that the company is facing a significant challenge in the semiconductor supply chain, impacting the industry. To ensure that its operations run smoothly, the spokesperson pointed out that Honda is making careful adjustments to manage the parts it has. Analysts warn that Nexperia might end up on a trade blacklist This week, Honda began implementing changes, including temporary production suspensions, at its major auto factories in North America. The situation highlights a growing threat to the automotive industry. It comes in as US President Trump visits Asia for a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Nexperia came into the spotlight after the Dutch government seized control of the chip maker amid a warning from American officials. According to a Dutch court document, the relevant authorities stated that unless Nexperia’s Chinese CEO is replaced, the company could end up on a trade blacklist due to national security concerns. Dutch Economy Minister Vincent Karremans stated that no other nation influenced the decision to acquire Nexperia. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The token, which launched just before Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration, could gain a new use case if the acquisition closes. One person familiar with the talks allegedly said the plan would let investors use the TRUMP token as a payment and investment asset, while also giving crypto startups a new place to raise capital. Another person said Republic is speaking with multiple strategic partners, and the discussions are ongoing. The timing is very interesting. You see, just days ago, Cryptopolitan reported that Coinbase was going to acquire of on‑chain fundraising platform named Echo for $375 million. Market players said they expect a new wave of crypto business expansion in the United States under a friendlier regulatory environment shaped by Trump’s return to the White House. In that environment, Fight Fight Fight appears to be positioning TRUMP as a token that can be used, not just traded. TRUMP’s token launch and market moves The TRUMP memecoin launched in January and quickly shocked analysts, after rallying by 2000% as supporters of the president poured in, while critics (specifically Congress Democrats) said the setup could create conflicts of interest because investors could hold the token without disclosure. According to CoinGecko data, TRUMP reached nearly $9 billion in market value at its peak before falling sharply, and at press time, it sits at about $1.6 billion. Fight Fight Fight held a dinner in May for holders of the token. Trump attended. But the subsequent price boost did not hold. The rise and fall of TRUMP mirrored the wider memecoin market, where tokens tied to memes, celebrities and hype reached extreme valuations in late 2024 and early 2025. Since then, many have crashed. Even Dogecoin is down almost 60% since December, based on CoinGecko data. Another token related to the Trump orbit, WLFI, issued by a company co‑founded by Trump family members, has also dropped. WLFI is down about 40% since it began trading in September. Investors said the wider memecoin market has cooled because many of these tokens have no underlying value or business use. Why Republic matters in this deal Republic.com has supported more than 3,000 fundraising rounds, according to its site. It lets both accredited and retail investors purchase stakes in smaller companies. The platform also allows tokenized assets that represent real‑world items such as equity and fund shares. Tokenization of real‑world assets has been gaining traction, with large financial firms like BlackRock Inc. now active in the space. Republic’s investor list includes Galaxy Digital and Binance Labs, the venture arm of Binance. Trump recently pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the co‑founder of Binance. If Fight Fight Fight acquires Republic’s US division, the company could introduce new financial features tied directly to TRUMP. Bloomberg said the company may issue grants in TRUMP, allow startup investment using TRUMP, and let users pay platform fees in TRUMP. A few websites already accept the token for payments, and Fight Fight Fight wants that to expand. Ownership of the token is concentrated. CIC Digital LLC, linked to The Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight together hold 80% of the token supply. That stake is locked for three years. Both CIC Digital and the owner of Fight Fight Fight receive a share of trading revenue from activity in the TRUMP token. Fight Fight Fight is also trying to raise at least $200 million to create a digital‑asset treasury company that would accumulate TRUMP and support market liquidity. The TRUMP memecoin is only one of several crypto projects tied to the Trump family. Trump’s sons Eric and Don are involved in Bitcoin mining and a stablecoin venture. Get seen where it counts.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000359. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000583 and an average trading price of $0.000560 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

A breakout above $0.000073 could open up targets at $0.000076–$0.000080. FLOKI on the daily timeframe As of October 30, Floki (FLOKI/USDT) currently trades at $0.00007210, showing a slight 0.39% dip, as the market continues its flat consolidation phase. The Bollinger Bands are extremely narrow, with the middle band at $0.00007187 acting as a pivot and upper resistance sitting at $0.00007975. The lower band at $0.00006398 forms the key support area. This tight range shows traders are in a holding pattern, waiting for a directional breakout. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Trading volume has declined to 14.06M, underscoring a lack of strong conviction from either side. The MACD remains modestly positive at 0.00000075, but the histogram is nearly flat, reflecting neutral momentum. Price stability above the mid-Bollinger level suggests accumulation, but bulls need a decisive push past $0.000073 to validate a short-term uptrend. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour chart, Floki trades at $0.00007208, down 0.41%, reflecting indecision. The Alligator indicator shows the green, red, and blue lines compressing, signaling a neutral setup after a short burst of buying momentum earlier in the session. The upper Alligator line ($0.00007285) caps the current price range, and a clean breakout above it would likely trigger a move toward $0.000074–$0.000075. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD has just flattened following a brief bullish crossover, confirming the stalling momentum seen on higher timeframes. Despite this, the structure shows no sharp selling pressure, suggesting the market is simply pausing before a potential directional shift. If the price reclaims $0.0000726–$0.000073, expect short-term strength; however, a drop below $0.0000715 would likely trigger a retest of the $0.000070 support level.

Holding above $0.000071 favors a mild bullish breakout, while losing that level could drag the price toward $0.000065. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

That is precisely the astounding reality for an early Ethereum investor profit story that has recently captured the attention of the crypto world. This incredible saga highlights the transformative potential of early adoption and long-term vision in the digital asset space, offering a powerful glimpse into what’s possible. What Sparked This Monumental Ethereum Investor Profit? An address linked to an individual who participated in Ethereum’s initial coin offering (ICO) has made a significant move. This investor recently deposited 2,000 ETH, valued at an impressive $7.92 million, onto the Kraken exchange, as reported by AmberCN. This single transaction alone represents an unbelievable 13,000-fold profit on their initial investment, a figure that truly boggles the mind. Moreover, this isn’t even the full extent of their holdings. The same address still retains a substantial 15,000 ETH, which is currently worth approximately $58.73 million. This remaining stash underscores the immense wealth generated from their early belief in Ethereum’s vision and its enduring potential. The Genesis of Such a Remarkable Ethereum Investor Profit To truly appreciate this level of Ethereum investor profit , we need to look back at Ethereum’s origins. The Ethereum ICO took place in 2014, a time when most people had barely heard of cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. Participants had the unique opportunity to acquire ETH at incredibly low prices, often around $0.30 to $0.40 per token. These early adopters demonstrated remarkable foresight and unwavering conviction. They invested in a nascent technology with no guarantees, enduring years of market volatility, technological hurdles, and widespread skepticism. Their patience and steadfast belief in the project’s long-term potential have now paid off handsomely, illustrating the profound power of a patient, long-term investment horizon in disruptive technologies. Early Adoption Advantage: Investing in a groundbreaking project during its infancy often offers the greatest potential for exponential returns, though it comes with higher risks. Patience is Key: The ability to hold through numerous market cycles, including significant bear markets and periods of uncertainty, was absolutely crucial for this investor’s success. Visionary Investment: Recognizing Ethereum’s potential not just as a digital currency, but as a robust platform for decentralized applications, was a truly transformative insight. Understanding the Astounding Scale of This Ethereum Investor Profit A 13,000x return is almost unfathomable in conventional investment terms. To put it into perspective, imagine investing just $100 and witnessing it grow to an astonishing $1.3 million. This isn’t just a good return; it’s a life-altering sum of money that reshapes futures. Such profits are exceedingly rare in traditional finance and vividly underscore the unique, albeit volatile, opportunities sometimes found within the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum, since its ICO, has not just survived but thrived, evolving into a foundational layer of the decentralized web. It powers countless decentralized applications (dApps), the booming non-fungible token (NFT) market, and the vast majority of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. This continuous innovation, widespread adoption, and growing utility have been key drivers behind its consistent price appreciation and, consequently, this incredible Ethereum investor profit . What Can Aspiring Investors Learn from This Phenomenal Ethereum Investor Profit Story? While such astronomical gains are not typical and always come with significant risks, this remarkable story offers several invaluable lessons for anyone interested in the crypto space: Conduct Thorough Research: Always understand the underlying technology, the development team, the project’s roadmap, and its long-term vision before committing any capital. Invest Responsibly: The crypto market is notoriously volatile. Never invest funds that are essential for your daily living expenses or financial security. Cultivate a Long-Term Perspective: Short-term trading is often fraught with difficulty and high risk. A patient, long-term holding strategy, much like this investor’s, can sometimes yield the most substantial rewards. Consider Diversification: While this particular investor focused heavily on ETH, diversifying your portfolio across different, promising assets can help mitigate risk and capture broader market growth. This early Ethereum investor profit serves as a powerful and inspiring reminder of the potential rewards for those who identify groundbreaking technologies early and possess the conviction and patience to hold through their developmental stages. It’s a testament to the idea that sometimes, the greatest financial gains truly come from unwavering belief and strategic patience. This story is not just about impressive numbers; it’s about a vision realized and a testament to the power of decentralized innovation. It inspires many to explore the future of finance and technology with an open mind, understanding that true innovation can indeed lead to astounding wealth creation.

The Fed confirmed a 25-basis-point interest rate cut, aligning with market expectations, but Bitcoin’s 6% slide from its Monday rally to $116,400 caught traders off guard. Analysts attributed the drop to short-term risk aversion before Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference, despite the anticipated cut. Market Expectations vs. Reality According to the Fed’s latest dot plot, policymakers expect three additional cuts in 2025. Analysts at Goldman Sachs project at least two more 25-basis-point cuts by mid-2026, potentially bringing the benchmark rate down to the 3–3.25% range. This outlook should theoretically support risk assets like Bitcoin, yet the crypto’s near-term movements diverged from expectations. “Recent history has shown that the FOMC leads to a price drop in BTC, followed by a move up,” said analysts at Hyblock, a crypto analytics firm. “If price does dip post-FOMC and signs of bullish confluence emerge, such as bid-heavy orderbooks, it would likely present good opportunities for investors.” Investors Eye Broader Economic Concerns With rate cuts largely priced in, traders are now focusing on broader macroeconomic risks. These include the rise in U.S. layoffs, the potential long-term impact of President Trump’s tariff measures, and uncertainty around whether the booming artificial intelligence sector represents a sustainable trend or a speculative bubble. These factors could play a more significant role in shaping Bitcoin’s medium-term trajectory than Wednesday’s Fed decision itself. End of Quantitative Tightening One key takeaway from the FOMC’s statement was confirmation that the Fed will end its balance sheet reduction on December 1, marking the conclusion of its quantitative tightening program. This policy shift may inject additional liquidity into markets over the coming months, potentially supporting risk assets like Bitcoin — though near-term volatility is expected to remain high.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-30 01:57:20

The investment shows a growing appetite for scalable, low-cost blockchain solutions beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana has been one of 2025’s standout performers, supported by its lightning-fast transaction speeds, affordable fees, and expanding DeFi and Web3 ecosystems. The Bitwise allocation signals institutional validation of Solana’s infrastructure and future potential, particularly as adoption accelerates tokenized asset markets. On-chain metrics reveal heightened activity, transaction volumes, developer participation, and staking inflows are all climbing. This combination of technological strength and real-world integration reinforces investor optimism, even as short-term volatility tests the $200 resistance level. Bitwise Expands Its Institutional Crypto Strategy Bitwise Asset Management’s latest Solana purchase reflects a deliberate expansion into diversified digital assets. Known for its research-driven, transparent investment approach, Bitwise has already established positions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and emerging crypto assets. The $69.5 million Solana investment strengthens its role as a key driver of institutional crypto adoption. Analysts note that this strategic pivot reflects a broader institutional shift toward next-generation blockchains capable of handling global-scale applications. Solana’s proven resilience, maintaining performance during periods of high network traffic, adds to its appeal for asset managers seeking reliability in volatile markets. The enthusiasm surrounding Solana also extends to the ETF space. Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) recently recorded the largest first-day trading volume of 2025, hitting $56 million. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas and ETF expert Nate Geraci highlighted the debut as a landmark moment for Solana’s institutional journey, potentially paving the way for future XRP and DeFi-based ETFs. Solana Bulls Eye $200 Breakout as Institutional Tailwinds Strengthen Currently, Solana trades around $195, hovering above short-term support at $191 and facing resistance at $203. Analysts suggest that a decisive break above $200 could ignite the next leg of Solana’s rally, driven by institutional inflows and bullish ETF momentum. Meanwhile, Western Union’s upcoming USDPT stablecoin launch on Solana adds another layer of credibility to the blockchain’s global adoption story. With financial firms integrating Solana’s stable infrastructure, the network’s role in cross-border payments and DeFi continues to expand. As institutions pour capital into Solana, the market narrative is shifting. The Bitwise investment doesn’t just fortify confidence, it signals that Solana is maturing into a long-term institutional asset, with bulls now fighting to reclaim the $200 resistance zone as the next milestone on its journey toward mainstream adoption.

53804292,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=845924,1761789635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/53804292.jpeg,"Bullish Window For Dogecoin Opens in November, Analyst Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/bullish-window-dogecoin-november/,"Crypto analyst VisionPulsed argues that Dogecoin is entering a seasonal window of strength in November—conditional on a broader “risk-on” handoff from US equities to crypto and, critically, Bitcoin maintaining support at a key moving average. In an Oct. 28 video update focused on Dogecoin, he linked the coin’s near-term upside to a now-familiar sequence: S&P strength → Russell 2000 catch-up → Ethereum breakout → DOGE momentum. “November could be repeating itself where we get a big push in November,” he said, citing what he frames as a recurring pattern of late-October bottoms followed by November reversals in recent years. He pointed to 2022 and 2023 as examples and opened the session by noting ongoing equity optimism, quipping that “the S&P is continuing to gap up,” and that a risk-bid in stocks historically creates favorable conditions for crypto beta. November Preview For Dogecoin The pathway he sketches is explicit and hierarchical. “If the S&P can push higher, then the Russell 2000 may actually follow… And as we’ve said 100 times, when the Russell breaks out, that increases the chance that Ethereum breaks out. Happened in 2017, happened in 2020. And if the Russell can break out and Ethereum can break out, slap Dogecoin on there.” His Dogecoin view is framed inside a rising channel, with price “grinding upwards on the trend line” into early November before a potential acceleration toward the channel top in mid-month. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bull Run Over? Analyst Predicts When DOGE Rallies Again The analyst is emphatic that the setup is constructive but not a done deal. “There’s probably no big bull run just yet, but it looks bullish from here to at least December.” From there, the branching outcomes hinge on whether an altseason materializes and whether DOGE can break beyond the upper boundary of its channel. If momentum stalls at resistance without evidence of declining Bitcoin dominance—his shorthand for capital rotating into altcoins—he warns of a familiar whipsaw: “If we come up to the top of the channel and we get stuck again… we’re going to see a crash to the bottom of the channel or at least the middle.” In that downside branch, he cites a drawdown scenario toward the low-teens, saying DOGE could “go back to 13 cents.” In the upside branch, if an altseason ignites, he floats a run toward “80 cents, 90 cents, whatever,” with the caveat that such a surge into December could also mark a local cycle top requiring reassessment in real time. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Struggles at $0.20 Support Amid Whale Selloff and Futures As a gating condition across all scenarios, Bitcoin’s trend integrity remains the fulcrum. “If for whatever reason, Bitcoin breaks this moving average, then there’s no bull run at all. It doesn’t exist—we’re in a bear market. But as long as we hold a moving average… the bull run will continue.” He analogizes the dynamic to a “blue circle” bounce on the S&P and expects a comparable moving-average response from BTC to keep the crypto risk cycle intact. The Ethereum leg is treated as both a beneficiary of small-cap equity strength and a validator for alt rotation: “If the S&P and the Russell can both push higher, that gives us a green light for Ethereum. And if Ethereum can push higher, then Doge could push higher.” Timing is central to his thesis. He anticipates a steady “grind” into early November, a push toward DOGE’s channel top “probably in the middle of November,” and then a decisive inflection as the market either confirms altseason into December—or fails and resets with one more flush before any sustained rotation. He also leaves room for a less popular possibility: “We always have to keep our open mind to the possibility that there is no altseason… I’m the last person that wants to say that… but we’ve got to be open to the possibilities.” VisionPulsed characterizes the current moment as tactically bullish with binary edges defined by the channel and BTC’s moving average. “I would say the top of the channel is in play as long as we hold the bottom of the channel.” The message to Dogecoin traders is ultimately conditional and sequence-driven: November offers the opening, but equities, Bitcoin trend support, and an Ethereum confirmation are the levers that must all click into place to turn an encouraging drift into a decisive breakout. As he signed off: “As always, none of this is financial advice.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19372.

53804340,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87945,1761789655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,BlockDAG’s $0.0015 Entry & TGE Code Turns Rank & Speed Into Instant Crypto Power: Presale Surpasses Record $433M+,https://timestabloid.com/blockdags-0-0015-entry-tge-code-turns-rank-speed-into/,"When you see a coin priced at $0.0015, it looks like a chance not to miss. That’s the highlight of BlockDAG (BDAG) presale, a clear entry point for those following crypto coins to watch. But this event is about more than price. It’s a timed race for ranking and access. By entering the special code “TGE”, buyers are not only joining the presale but also stepping into a leaderboard system where rank controls when they get their crypto. This is about speed and strategy. Only the top 300 ranks get their coins right when the network launches. Others must wait. That means the $0.0015 price is only half the story. The real benefit comes from acting fast and securing your spot early on the leaderboard. Understanding the Final $0.0015 Entry Tier Let’s break down the $0.0015 tier. This final access point opens when you use the TGE code, marking the last stop before BlockDAG shifts to full deployment. It’s not just a discount; it defines the entry price before launch and gives clarity, you know exactly what you’re getting in at. The urgency is real. When this stage ends, the price rises. For people comparing crypto coins to watch, this defined entry price gives structure and confidence. Still, the main insight is this: price alone isn’t what matters most. This entry ties directly to a rank-based distribution system that decides when holders receive their coins. Timing and placement make all the difference here. How the Ranking System Adds Competitive Speed Here’s where it becomes a true race. BlockDAG ranks every entry after the TGE code is used. The system works like this: Ranks 1–300: coins released instantly at launch Ranks 301–600: coins released after about 30 minutes Ranks 601–1000, 1500, 2000, 5000, and so on: delays up to 24 hours ( MEXC ) This isn’t just waiting, it’s about being ahead. Those who rank at the top get their coins before everyone else and can move or trade sooner. When comparing to other top crypto projects, the speed of access becomes a serious advantage. BlockDAG’s leaderboard transforms a normal presale into a global contest for early power. You’re not just buying; you’re racing for position. Why Getting Coins Early Can Be More Strategic Than the Price Many focus on cheaper entry prices, but in this presale, timing might matter just as much. Early access gives you a real edge. Those who get their coins first can: Trade or transfer before others Join liquidity pools early Benefit from early market energy while fewer coins are in circulation Being in the first 300 ranks isn’t only a status point; it’s a real strategic gain. Among leading crypto coins to watch, early access often shapes how a project performs at launch. BlockDAG turns that into a feature: the faster you act, the sooner you gain control. Paying $0.0015 is valuable, but pairing that with a top rank is far more rewarding. The formula is simple: price plus rank equals faster access. Why the Global Race for Rank Matters This ranking system builds urgency. You’re not just joining a presale; you’re competing for position. That carries a bigger meaning. First, when thousands of buyers are active, even a few minutes’ delay can change your launch advantage. Second, it adds a global edge, as you’re racing with people worldwide for limited early spots. Third, it shapes how participants think. You choose when you buy, but also how quickly you act. In many crypto projects, coin unlock times often drive market behavior and price movement. BlockDAG makes this open and strategic through its “TGE code + rank” rule. Turning access into a timed challenge adds excitement, and planning your rank decides your launch strength. Wrapping It Up: Speed Defines Crypto Coins to Watch The $0.0015 price for BlockDAG might seem like the main attraction, but the real win comes from your rank. Using the TGE code gets you in, but only speed decides if you’re in the top 300 or waiting hours later. For anyone following crypto coins to watch , this system blends timing, price, and performance in one race. It’s the final chance to join before the leaderboard closes.

The company reported 12.2 trillion Korean won in operating profit for Q3, more than double the previous quarter’s figure. Revenue hit 86.1 trillion won, beating the 85.93 trillion forecast from LSEG SmartEstimate. Samsung also crushed its own guidance, which had predicted around 12.1 trillion won. Compared to a year ago, revenue was up 8.85%, and operating profit rose 32.9%. But the bigger news is the bounce from the June quarter, when Samsung was buried under weak chip demand. Profit surged 160% from Q2. Revenue also climbed 15.5% quarter-over-quarter. After the announcement, Samsung’s shares jumped over 5% in early Asia trading. Chip unit more than doubles profit after brutal Q2 Samsung’s Device Solutions division (the group handling memory chips, foundry and logic) was the engine behind this surge, according to the earnings report. The chip division brought in 7.0 trillion won in operating profit, up from 3.86 trillion won in Q3 last year. Sales for the unit hit 33.1 trillion won, rising from 29.27 trillion won in the same quarter last year. That’s a 19% jump from Q2 alone. The reason? AI demand. Samsung’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, used in AI processing, saw record-high sales. The company said this was the highest quarterly revenue ever for the division. It was a clear comeback from the prior quarter when chips were bleeding. The memory segment alone set an all-time high, fueled by the global race to build AI data centers and large-scale compute. Samsung had recently fallen behind SK Hynix in HBM chips, losing its edge for the first time. But it reportedly passed Nvidia’s qualification tests for a new generation of advanced HBM chips last month, which would be a key win. According to a report by Counterpoint Research, Samsung also reclaimed the top spot in the memory market in Q3, beating SK Hynix after trailing in Q2. Looking ahead, Samsung plans to ramp up production of its HBM4 chips as it heads toward 2026. It’s gunning hard for market dominance in the next-gen AI memory war. Samsung’s mobile and network businesses, which handle smartphones, tablets, and wearables, also had a solid quarter. The unit posted 3.6 trillion won in operating profit, up from 2.82 trillion won a year ago. The company said the boost came from strong sales of its flagship devices, including the newly launched Galaxy Z Fold7. The overall device unit saw both higher sales and higher profit. Samsung forecasted that the rapid growth of the AI industry would open up new market opportunities for both its devices and chip businesses in the current quarter. To put it all together: Samsung was down bad in Q2, but came back swinging in Q3; on the back of chips, smartphones, and a little AI magic.

This proactive move comes as more publicly listed companies explore integrating digital assets into their financial strategies. It’s a crucial step towards bringing greater clarity and stability to the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, ensuring both innovation and investor protection. Why the Buzz Around Corporate Crypto Holdings? The financial world is constantly shifting, with digital assets increasingly becoming a part of mainstream corporate discussions. Many publicly listed companies are now looking at what’s known as a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) strategy. This means they hold cryptocurrencies as part of their company reserves, similar to traditional assets. This trend reflects a growing confidence in digital assets as a treasury diversification tool. Companies aim to potentially hedge against inflation or capitalize on market growth. However, this emerging practice introduces new complexities for regulators and investors. The SFC, led by Chairman Kelvin Wong Tin Yau, recognizes this trend. They are actively monitoring the market to understand how these strategies are being adopted and what implications they hold for financial stability and investor protection. The Regulatory Gap: What’s Missing for Corporate Crypto Holdings? Currently, there’s a notable absence of specific regulations in Hong Kong that govern how publicly listed companies manage their corporate crypto holdings . This lack of clear rules can create uncertainty for both companies and their shareholders. Chairman Wong highlighted this regulatory void, emphasizing the need for a structured framework. Without such guidelines: Companies might operate without consistent best practices for digital asset management. Investors may struggle to accurately assess the unique risks associated with these digital asset exposures. The SFC’s consideration of new rules signals a proactive approach to fill this gap, ensuring robust oversight evolves with the market. Safeguarding Investors: Understanding the Risks of Corporate Crypto Holdings Investor protection is a primary concern for the Hong Kong SFC. When companies hold cryptocurrencies, it introduces a new layer of risk that investors need to fully comprehend. The inherent volatility of digital assets can significantly impact a company’s financial health and valuation. Investors must be able to: Clearly understand the extent of a company’s crypto exposure. Assess the potential impact of crypto price fluctuations on company performance. Make informed decisions based on transparent and consistent reporting. The SFC’s upcoming guidelines are expected to mandate greater transparency and disclosure. This will empower investors with the necessary information to evaluate the risks tied to a company’s corporate crypto holdings , fostering a more secure investment environment. What’s Next for Hong Kong’s Crypto Landscape? The discussions around new rules for corporate crypto holdings mark another significant step in Hong Kong’s journey to become a leading global crypto hub. By establishing clear regulatory frameworks, the SFC aims to: Enhance overall market integrity and stability within the digital asset sector. Encourage responsible innovation and growth within the digital asset space. Solidify Hong Kong’s position as a well-regulated and attractive market for crypto-related businesses and investments. These guidelines could set an important precedent for other jurisdictions grappling with similar regulatory questions. It demonstrates a strong commitment to balancing financial innovation with robust investor safeguards, ensuring sustainable growth. In conclusion, the Hong Kong SFC’s initiative to develop guidelines for corporate crypto holdings is a pivotal moment for the digital asset industry. It underscores the increasing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies by public companies and the essential role regulators play in ensuring market integrity and investor confidence. By proactively addressing this emerging trend, Hong Kong is paving the way for a more transparent and secure future for digital asset integration into corporate finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Hong Kong SFC’s role in crypto regulation? A1: The SFC oversees Hong Kong’s financial markets, aiming to ensure market integrity, protect investors, and foster responsible innovation in the digital asset space. Q2: Why are companies interested in Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) strategies? A2: Companies adopt DAT strategies to diversify treasury holdings, potentially hedge against inflation, or gain exposure to the growing digital asset market by holding cryptocurrencies as corporate reserves. Q3: What risks do corporate crypto holdings pose to investors? A3: Risks include high crypto volatility impacting company finances and insufficient transparency without clear regulations, making it hard for investors to assess exposure. Q4: How will new SFC guidelines benefit the market? A4: Guidelines will bring clarity, consistency, and transparency to corporate crypto holdings , enhancing market integrity, investor protection through disclosures, and strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a regulated crypto hub.

This event abruptly concluded a promising four-day streak of net inflows, raising questions about market sentiment and investor behavior. This unexpected reversal, according to data from TraderT, provides a crucial snapshot of the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency investments. What Triggered the Sudden Reversal in U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The single-day outflow figure of $473 million (equivalent to 673.4 billion won) marked a significant moment for the nascent U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs market. After a period of consistent capital injection, this sudden withdrawal highlights the volatility and rapid changes that can occur within the crypto investment landscape. It’s a reminder that even established financial instruments tied to digital assets are subject to swift market reactions. Several prominent funds contributed to this dramatic outflow: Fidelity’s FBTC: Led the charge with $164.36 million exiting the fund. Ark Invest’s ARKB: Saw a significant withdrawal of $143.80 million. BlackRock’s IBIT: Experienced outflows totaling $90.48 million. Grayscale’s GBTC: Contributed $65.01 million to the net outflow. Bitwise’s BITB: Registered $6.03 million in exits. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC): Also saw $3.43 million depart. These figures demonstrate a broad-based withdrawal across various major players in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs sector, rather than an isolated event affecting a single fund. Why Do U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Matter to the Market? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a significant bridge between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency, offering regulated access and often greater liquidity. Their introduction was hailed as a major step towards mainstream adoption, attracting both institutional and retail capital that might otherwise be hesitant to enter the direct crypto market. Therefore, the flow of funds into or out of these ETFs is a key indicator of broader investor sentiment towards Bitcoin and the wider digital asset ecosystem. Positive inflows suggest growing confidence and increasing institutional interest, while outflows can signal profit-taking, shifting market dynamics, or a cautious retreat from risk assets. Understanding the Potential Causes Behind the Outflows What could be behind such a substantial single-day outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs ? While it’s challenging to pinpoint an exact cause without more granular data, several factors could be at play: Profit-Taking: After a period of inflows and potential price appreciation, some investors might have chosen to realize gains, leading to sell-offs. Broader Market Sentiment: Macroeconomic concerns, such as inflation data, interest rate expectations, or geopolitical events, can influence investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Fund Rebalancing: Large institutional investors often rebalance their portfolios, which can lead to significant buying or selling activity in a short period. News Events: Specific news or regulatory developments, even if seemingly minor, can sometimes trigger immediate reactions from traders. It is important to remember that a single day’s data, while noteworthy, does not necessarily define a long-term trend. The cryptocurrency market is known for its rapid fluctuations, and daily flows can be highly volatile. What’s Next for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Investors? For investors, monitoring the ongoing flow data for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs will be crucial. Consistent outflows could signal a more sustained shift in sentiment, whereas a quick return to inflows might indicate that the recent event was merely a temporary correction or profit-taking episode. The broader implications for Bitcoin’s price and market stability are often tied to these fund movements. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market news, economic indicators, and ETF flow reports. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid making rash decisions based on short-term fluctuations. Consider your long-term investment goals. Diversification: As with any investment, diversification can help mitigate risks associated with volatility in specific assets like Bitcoin. The journey of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continues to be a fascinating indicator of cryptocurrency’s integration into traditional finance. While the recent $473 million outflow marks a pause in an inflow streak, it underscores the dynamic and responsive nature of this evolving market. Investors and enthusiasts alike will be watching closely to see how these funds perform in the coming weeks. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Bitcoin as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a regulated financial product without directly buying, storing, or managing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why are net outflows from Bitcoin ETFs significant? Net outflows indicate that more capital is being withdrawn from these funds than is being invested. This can be a signal of decreased investor confidence, profit-taking, or a shift in market sentiment towards Bitcoin and digital assets in general. Does one day of significant outflows indicate a long-term trend? Not necessarily. While a single day’s large outflow is noteworthy, the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. Long-term trends are usually determined by consistent inflows or outflows over several days or weeks, coupled with broader market analysis. How do these outflows affect Bitcoin’s price? Significant outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs can exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, especially if the funds are selling their underlying Bitcoin to meet redemption requests. However, other market factors also heavily influence Bitcoin’s price. What factors typically influence Bitcoin ETF flows? Flows are influenced by various factors, including Bitcoin’s price performance, broader economic conditions, regulatory news, investor sentiment, and specific news related to the ETFs or their issuers.

Just as many anticipated a continued wave of optimism, U.S. spot ETH ETFs collectively recorded a significant net outflow of $81.07 million on October 29th. This reversal came merely one day after these funds had shifted into a positive inflow territory, leaving many to ponder the underlying dynamics. Spot ETH ETFs: A Glimpse into Recent Market Shifts This notable shift provides a fascinating snapshot of investor sentiment. After a brief period of net inflows, the market witnessed a sharp turn, with a substantial amount of capital exiting these investment vehicles. This volatility is a characteristic feature of the crypto landscape, but it also prompts a deeper look into which players are driving these movements. Fidelity’s FETH led the outflows, experiencing a significant $69.49 million departure. Grayscale’s Mini ETH and ETHE also saw considerable capital withdrawals, amounting to $16.18 million and $12.83 million respectively. These figures underscore a collective movement by various investors to pull funds from several prominent Ethereum-based ETF products. Decoding Individual Fund Performance: Who’s Leading the Charge? While many funds faced outflows, one particular player stood out against the tide. BlackRock’s ETHA, their specific offering in the spot ETH ETFs arena, was the sole fund to record a net inflow on that day. Attracting $21.74 million, BlackRock’s performance offers a stark contrast to the broader market trend. This divergence raises important questions about investor confidence, brand reputation, and the perceived stability of different fund providers. Why would investors flock to one fund while simultaneously withdrawing from others? Understanding the Dynamics: Why the Sudden Shift in Spot ETH ETFs? Several factors could contribute to such a sudden shift in the flow of capital for spot ETH ETFs . Market sentiment plays a crucial role; investors might be reacting to broader economic indicators, profit-taking after recent gains, or perhaps re-evaluating their risk exposure. It’s important to remember that daily fluctuations, while noteworthy, do not always indicate a long-term trend. However, they do provide valuable insights into the immediate reactions of institutional and retail investors to market conditions and specific fund performances. This particular outflow could signal a period of cautious optimism or strategic reallocation. The BlackRock Anomaly: What Makes Their Spot ETH ETF Different? BlackRock’s ability to attract inflows while competitors faced outflows is particularly intriguing. BlackRock, a global investment management giant, often brings a unique level of institutional trust and brand recognition to the crypto space. Their established reputation and extensive client base might offer a sense of security that encourages continued investment, even amidst broader market withdrawals. Furthermore, the specific structure or marketing of BlackRock’s ETHA could be resonating more effectively with certain investor segments, perhaps those seeking long-term exposure to Ethereum through a highly reputable and regulated entity. This phenomenon highlights the importance of institutional backing in the nascent spot ETH ETFs market. What Do These Spot ETH ETF Trends Mean for Investors? For investors, these trends in spot ETH ETFs offer a mixed bag of insights. On one hand, the outflows indicate ongoing volatility and the need for careful consideration when allocating capital to crypto-related products. On the other hand, BlackRock’s unique inflow suggests a growing bifurcation in investor preference, favoring established financial players. Investors should: Monitor fund performance closely: Pay attention to consistent inflows or outflows across different providers. Understand the broader market: Assess Ethereum’s price action and overall crypto market sentiment. Consider institutional backing: Recognize that major players like BlackRock might offer perceived stability. Avoid impulsive decisions: One day’s data is a snapshot, not necessarily a definitive long-term trend. Ultimately, the recent $81.1 million net outflow from U.S. spot ETH ETFs , contrasted by BlackRock’s robust inflows, paints a complex picture of the evolving institutional crypto landscape. It underscores the dynamic nature of digital asset investments and the varying levels of trust and strategy investors apply to different providers. As the market matures, such shifts will continue to provide crucial data points for understanding the future of Ethereum’s institutional adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a spot ETH ETF? A spot ETH ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment vehicle that holds actual Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. It allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly buying, storing, or managing the cryptocurrency themselves, trading like traditional stocks on an exchange. Why did U.S. spot ETH ETFs experience net outflows on October 29th? The exact reasons can be complex, but common factors include profit-taking by investors after recent price gains, broader market sentiment shifts, rebalancing of portfolios, or reactions to specific economic news. These outflows reflect a collective decision by many investors to reduce their exposure to these particular funds. Why was BlackRock’s ETHA an exception, seeing net inflows? BlackRock’s strong brand reputation and established trust within traditional finance likely played a significant role. Institutional investors, in particular, may feel more comfortable allocating capital through a globally recognized asset manager, even when other funds are experiencing withdrawals. Their specific offering or client base might also be more geared towards long-term accumulation. How do these outflows impact Ethereum’s price? While significant, a single day’s outflow from ETFs doesn’t necessarily dictate Ethereum’s long-term price trend. However, sustained or very large outflows could put downward pressure on the price as funds might need to sell underlying ETH to meet redemptions. Conversely, consistent inflows would be bullish. It’s one of many factors influencing market dynamics. What should investors consider after observing these spot ETH ETF trends? Investors should view these trends as part of a larger, evolving market. It’s crucial to conduct thorough research, understand the risks associated with crypto investments, and consider their personal investment goals and risk tolerance. Diversification and a long-term perspective are often recommended, rather than reacting solely to short-term fluctuations.

This event highlights the persistent security challenges within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and raises questions about asset traceability and recovery. What Just Happened? The Radiant Capital Hacker’s Latest Move In a recent development, the individual or group responsible for the attack on the DeFi protocol Radiant Capital (RDNT) has made a substantial move. Reports from AmberCN indicate that the Radiant Capital hacker utilized 5.836 million DAI to acquire 14.82 million ETH. This Ethereum is valued at approximately $39.38 million, and the transaction occurred just an hour ago from the time of reporting. This conversion represents a critical step for the hacker. It demonstrates an effort to consolidate stolen assets into a more liquid and widely accepted cryptocurrency, potentially preparing for further obfuscation or off-ramping. The sheer volume of the transaction underscores the scale of the initial exploit. A History of Exploits: The Original Radiant Capital Hack This recent transaction by the Radiant Capital hacker is not an isolated incident. Radiant Capital previously endured a significant security breach in October of last year. That attack resulted in a staggering loss of $53 million. These repeated incidents raise serious concerns about the robustness of security measures within DeFi protocols. They also emphasize the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between protocol developers and malicious actors. Users and investors often bear the brunt of these exploits, leading to a loss of trust and capital. Why Convert DAI to ETH? Understanding the Radiant Capital Hacker’s Strategy One might wonder why a hacker would choose to convert stablecoins like DAI into a volatile asset like Ethereum. There are several strategic reasons behind such a move: Increased Liquidity: Ethereum (ETH) is one of the most liquid cryptocurrencies globally. It is easily tradable on virtually every exchange, making it simpler to move large sums without significant price impact. Enhanced Anonymity: While all blockchain transactions are public, converting assets across different chains or protocols can add layers of complexity. This makes it harder for investigators to trace the funds’ ultimate destination. Future Movements: ETH offers more flexibility for further transactions, including using mixers, bridges, or other privacy-enhancing tools. These tools are often less effective with stablecoins tied to specific networks. Avoiding Freezes: Centralized stablecoin issuers can sometimes freeze funds associated with illicit activities. Converting to a decentralized asset like ETH reduces this risk, though it does not eliminate it entirely. This strategic conversion by the Radiant Capital hacker indicates a calculated approach to managing and ultimately cashing out the illicit gains. The Broader Impact on DeFi Security Each successful hack, particularly one involving such large sums, sends ripples through the entire decentralized finance ecosystem. These events erode investor confidence and prompt closer scrutiny from regulators. The actions of the Radiant Capital hacker highlight: The continuous need for rigorous security audits and bug bounty programs for all DeFi protocols. The importance of robust incident response plans to mitigate damages and protect user funds. The ongoing challenge of fund recovery in a decentralized, permissionless environment. The DeFi space promises innovation and financial freedom, but it must also deliver on security to achieve widespread adoption. Protocols must learn from these incidents and implement stronger safeguards. Protecting Your Assets in a Volatile Landscape For individual users, staying informed and exercising caution is paramount. While protocols strive for security, vulnerabilities can emerge. Consider these actionable insights: Diversify your investments: Do not put all your funds into a single protocol. Research thoroughly: Understand the risks associated with any DeFi platform before depositing funds. Use reputable protocols: Opt for platforms with a strong track record and multiple security audits. Stay updated: Follow news and security alerts from the projects you interact with. The incident involving the Radiant Capital hacker serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. While the community works towards more secure solutions, vigilance remains key. The audacious move by the Radiant Capital hacker to convert a significant amount of DAI into ETH is a stark reminder of the ongoing security challenges in the DeFi space. This event underscores the need for continuous vigilance, robust security measures, and a proactive approach from both protocols and users. As the crypto ecosystem matures, addressing these vulnerabilities will be crucial for fostering trust and ensuring long-term sustainability. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did the Radiant Capital hacker do recently? A1: The hacker converted 5.836 million DAI into 14.82 million ETH, valued at approximately $39.38 million, shortly after the initial exploit. Q2: What is Radiant Capital (RDNT)? A2: Radiant Capital (RDNT) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow various cryptocurrencies across different blockchain networks. Q3: Why would a hacker convert DAI to ETH? A3: Hackers often convert stablecoins like DAI to more liquid and decentralized assets like ETH to enhance anonymity, facilitate easier movement of funds, and potentially avoid asset freezes by centralized entities. Q4: When was the previous Radiant Capital hack, and how much was lost? A4: Radiant Capital suffered a previous hack in October of last year, resulting in a loss of approximately $53 million. Q5: How does this incident impact the broader DeFi ecosystem?

The cryptocurrency world is constantly buzzing with activity, and a recent development has captured significant attention: a substantial USDC minted event. Imagine 250 million new digital dollars suddenly appearing – that’s precisely what happened at the USDC Treasury, as reported by Whale Alert. This isn’t just a big number; it carries real implications for market liquidity, investor sentiment, and the broader stablecoin ecosystem. Let’s dive into what this massive influx of stablecoin means for you and the crypto landscape. What Does 250 Million USDC Minted Actually Signify? When we talk about USDC minted , it refers to the creation of new USD Coin (USDC) tokens. USDC is a prominent stablecoin, meaning its value is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. This makes it a crucial asset in the volatile crypto market, offering a stable haven for traders and investors. The recent minting of 250 million USDC at the Treasury indicates a significant expansion of the stablecoin’s supply. This process is usually initiated by Circle, the primary issuer of USDC, in response to increased demand from institutions or large individual investors. Essentially, for every USDC token minted, there’s an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars held in reserve, ensuring its stability and trustworthiness. This event highlights the ongoing growth and utility of stablecoins in the digital economy. Why Does a Large USDC Minting Event Matter to the Market? A substantial USDC minted amount like 250 million dollars doesn’t happen in a vacuum; it often signals underlying market dynamics. Here are a few key reasons why this event is noteworthy: Increased Liquidity: More USDC means more capital available to trade other cryptocurrencies. This can potentially lead to increased buying pressure on assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as investors move from stablecoins into riskier assets. Institutional Demand: Large mints often reflect significant deposits from institutional players. These entities use USDC for various purposes, including hedging, market making, and facilitating large-scale transactions, suggesting growing institutional interest in the crypto space. Market Confidence: The ability to seamlessly mint and redeem large quantities of USDC reinforces confidence in its stability and the underlying financial infrastructure supporting it. On-Ramp for Fiat: USDC acts as a primary bridge between traditional fiat currency and the decentralized crypto world. A large mint indicates fresh fiat capital entering the ecosystem. Understanding the USDC Treasury and Stablecoin Mechanics The USDC Treasury isn’t a physical vault but rather a designated address or mechanism through which new USDC tokens are issued. Circle, in partnership with Coinbase, manages the reserves that back every USDC in circulation. When USDC minted occurs, it implies that new fiat currency has been deposited into these reserve accounts, allowing for the creation of corresponding digital tokens. This transparency and auditability are core to USDC’s appeal. Users can verify that the stablecoin is fully backed, making it a reliable medium of exchange within the crypto economy. The mechanism ensures that the supply of USDC can expand or contract to meet market demand without compromising its dollar peg. What Could This Influx of USDC Signal for Future Trends? The recent USDC minted event could be a precursor to several market movements. It might indicate that: Imminent Buying Pressure: Large holders might be accumulating USDC in preparation to buy dips or enter new positions in other cryptocurrencies. OTC Deals: Over-the-counter (OTC) desks often use stablecoins for large, private transactions that don’t directly impact exchange order books. This mint could facilitate such deals. DeFi Expansion: USDC is a cornerstone of decentralized finance (DeFi). An increased supply could fuel more activity in lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and other DeFi applications. While a large mint is generally a positive sign for market liquidity, it’s essential to remember that it doesn’t guarantee an immediate price surge for other assets. It simply means there’s more stable capital ready to be deployed. Navigating the Evolving Stablecoin Landscape The continuous issuance of stablecoins like USDC underscores their growing importance in the global financial system. They offer a digital, programmable alternative to traditional fiat, enabling faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions. As the crypto market matures, the role of robust, regulated stablecoins becomes even more critical for fostering mainstream adoption and providing a reliable store of value and medium of exchange. This particular USDC minted event is a powerful reminder of the dynamic interplay between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. Keeping an eye on these on-chain movements can provide valuable insights into broader market sentiment and potential future trends. The minting of 250 million USDC at the Treasury is a significant on-chain event, signaling potential shifts in market liquidity and institutional interest. It reinforces the vital role stablecoins play in bridging traditional finance with the crypto economy. As this capital enters the ecosystem, it opens doors for new opportunities and further development within the decentralized space. Staying informed about such movements is key to understanding the pulse of the crypto market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDC? A1: USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin whose value is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. This means that for every USDC in circulation, there is an equivalent U.S. dollar held in reserve, making it a stable digital asset. Q2: Who is responsible for minting USDC? A2: USDC is primarily issued by Circle, in partnership with Coinbase, through the Centre Consortium. They manage the reserves and the minting/redemption process. Q3: Why is USDC important in the cryptocurrency market? A3: USDC provides stability in the volatile crypto market, serving as a reliable medium of exchange, a store of value, and a bridge for fiat currency to enter and exit the crypto ecosystem. It’s crucial for trading, lending, and other DeFi activities. Q4: Does a large USDC minted event always mean crypto prices will go up? A4: Not necessarily. While a large USDC minted amount often indicates fresh capital entering the crypto space and can precede buying pressure, it doesn’t guarantee immediate price increases for other cryptocurrencies. It simply means more stable capital is available for deployment. Q5: How can I track USDC minting events? A5: Services like Whale Alert monitor large on-chain transactions, including the minting of stablecoins like USDC, and report them in real-time. You can also track the total supply of USDC on various blockchain explorers. We hope this article helped clarify the significance of the recent USDC minted event.

ALGO is testing an important support level that could shape its next breakout attempt. The market is watching closely to see if buyers can hold momentum into November. At the same time, early investors are shifting focus toward Noomez ($NNZ) , a live presale that’s gaining traction with its deflationary model and transparent, stage-based structure. Algorand Price Prediction – ALGO Targets Recovery Toward $0.1841 Algorand is trading cautiously around the $0.18 range, showing mixed momentum as traders evaluate the next move. After several failed attempts to reclaim higher resistance levels, the market now focuses on a gradual recovery toward $0.1841 , which serves as the near-term target. Technical charts indicate that ALGO is forming a base around current prices, suggesting a possible short-term rebound if buying volume increases. Key levels traders are tracking: Support: $0.176 – consistent buying interest around this range Resistance: $0.184 to $0.188 – key area for bullish confirmation Breakout zone: Above $0.190 could open a run to $0.20 The broader Algorand price prediction 2025 points to steady gains if adoption metrics improve, while the Algorand price prediction 2030 depends heavily on network utility and sustained partnerships. For many holders, the question “ Is Algorand a good investment? ” hinges on its ability to reclaim long-term momentum. Market Indicators and Analyst Outlook for Algorand Traders watching Algorand this week have noted a steady pattern of accumulation across several sessions. Momentum indicators such as RSI remain balanced, reflecting a neutral stance between buyers and sellers. Analysts say that if the market sustains volume above current averages, ALGO could gradually build toward the next resistance near $0.19 before challenging the $0.20 range. Volume consistency has been the strongest signal so far, showing that long-term holders continue to accumulate instead of exiting positions. While volatility remains low, analysts suggest this calm phase could lead to a breakout once liquidity improves. The ALGO coin price prediction among traders remains cautiously optimistic, supported by its technical base and ongoing network development. Over the longer term, the ALGO price prediction will depend on consistent ecosystem growth and broader recovery across Layer-1 assets.

Then you need to pay close attention to an important announcement that impacts your ability to transact. Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has declared a temporary Binance Solana suspension for deposits and withdrawals on the Solana (SOL) network. This crucial step is part of an essential wallet maintenance check, ensuring the continued security and efficiency of the platform for all users. Understanding the Binance Solana Suspension The temporary Binance Solana suspension began promptly at 6:55 a.m. UTC today. While any service interruption can be inconvenient, it is vital to understand that such actions are taken for a greater purpose. Binance anticipates this maintenance period to last for approximately one hour. During this brief window, users will not be able to deposit or withdraw SOL tokens via the Solana network on Binance. What does this mean for your funds? Rest assured, your assets remain safe. The suspension is purely operational, designed to allow Binance’s technical team to perform necessary checks and upgrades without compromising user funds. It’s a proactive measure to prevent potential issues and enhance the overall reliability of the service. Why is Network Maintenance Crucial for Solana? You might wonder why such a prominent network like Solana requires temporary suspensions. The answer lies in the dynamic and evolving nature of blockchain technology. Regular maintenance, like the one causing this Binance Solana suspension , is fundamental for several reasons: Enhanced Security: Maintenance checks often involve patching vulnerabilities and upgrading security protocols to protect against new threats. Improved Performance: Optimizing wallet infrastructure ensures faster and smoother transaction processing once services resume. Bug Fixes: Identifying and resolving any underlying software issues helps maintain network stability. System Upgrades: Implementing new features or necessary adjustments to keep pace with technological advancements. These brief pauses are akin to a car needing a tune-up; they ensure the engine runs smoothly and reliably in the long term. For a high-speed, low-cost blockchain like Solana, maintaining peak performance is paramount for its ecosystem of dApps, NFTs, and DeFi protocols. What Should Solana Users Do During This Period? During the Binance Solana suspension , the primary advice for users is simple: exercise patience. Attempting to initiate deposits or withdrawals on the Solana network during the specified hour will likely result in failed transactions or delays. It is always best to wait until Binance officially announces the resumption of services. Here are some actionable insights for users: Check Binance Announcements: Always refer to the official Binance announcement channels for real-time updates on the suspension status. Plan Ahead: If you had urgent SOL transactions planned, consider the timing of such maintenance in the future. Explore Other Features: This might be a good time to explore other features on Binance or review your portfolio. Binance is known for its robust infrastructure and commitment to user experience. Such temporary measures are a testament to their dedication to providing a secure and efficient trading environment. The one-hour duration suggests a focused and efficient maintenance process, minimizing disruption. The Broader Impact of Binance’s Maintenance Checks While this particular event focuses on a Binance Solana suspension , it highlights a broader industry best practice. Reputable exchanges frequently conduct maintenance checks across various networks. These operations are essential for the health and integrity of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. They reinforce trust and stability, which are critical for both institutional and retail adoption of digital assets. The Solana network itself has gained significant traction for its high throughput and scalability, making it a favorite for developers and users alike. Ensuring that the gateway to this network, like Binance, operates flawlessly is a shared responsibility. This temporary halt is a small price to pay for sustained performance and security. Concluding Thoughts on This Essential Pause The temporary Binance Solana suspension for deposits and withdrawals is a standard, albeit brief, operational procedure. It underscores Binance’s commitment to maintaining a secure and high-performing platform for its users. While it might cause a momentary pause in your activities, the benefits of enhanced security and system stability far outweigh the minor inconvenience. Stay informed, remain patient, and anticipate the smooth resumption of services as Binance diligently works to uphold its service standards. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How long will the Binance Solana suspension last? A1: The suspension is expected to last for approximately one hour, starting from 6:55 a.m. UTC today. Q2: Can I still trade SOL on Binance during the suspension? A2: Yes, the suspension only affects deposits and withdrawals on the Solana network. Trading of SOL pairs on Binance’s spot and futures markets will generally remain unaffected. Q3: Are my SOL funds safe during this maintenance? A3: Absolutely. Your funds are secure on Binance. The maintenance is an operational check designed to enhance security and efficiency, not to impact user assets. Q4: What should I do if my SOL deposit or withdrawal is pending during the suspension? A4: If you initiated a transaction just before the suspension, it might be delayed. Binance will process all pending transactions once the network services are fully resumed. Q5: How will I know when deposits and withdrawals resume? A5: Binance will typically issue an official announcement once the maintenance is complete and services have been fully restored.

The state of US-China relations profoundly impacts everything from international trade to technological innovation and geopolitical stability. Recently, Chinese President Xi Jinping underscored the critical need for these relations to advance in the “right path” and “same direction,” even when faced with significant challenges and obstacles, as reported by Yonhap News. Why are US-China Relations So Important for Global Stability? President Xi’s remarks came during a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, highlighting that despite their distinct national situations, the relationship has largely maintained stability. It’s normal for nations to have disagreements, but the sheer scale of the interactions between the US and China means these disagreements have far-reaching consequences. These two economic giants are deeply intertwined, making their cooperation, or lack thereof, a central pillar of global affairs. Economic Interdependence: Both nations are massive trading partners, with their economies linked through supply chains, investments, and consumer markets. Disruptions here can ripple across the world. Global Challenges: Addressing issues like climate change, pandemics, and nuclear proliferation requires concerted effort from both the US and China. Their collaboration is essential for effective global governance. Technological Advancement: Competition and cooperation in technology shape future innovations and global economic competitiveness. Understanding the Headwinds in US-China Relations While President Xi acknowledged general stability, he also recognized the “headwinds and challenges.” These are not minor issues but complex areas of contention that often test the resilience of US-China relations . Identifying these helps in understanding the nuances of their interactions: Trade Disputes: Tariffs, trade imbalances, and intellectual property rights have been persistent sources of friction. Technological Competition: Areas like 5G, AI, and semiconductors have become battlegrounds, driven by national security and economic dominance concerns. Geopolitical Differences: Disagreements over Taiwan, the South China Sea, human rights, and regional influence often create diplomatic tensions. These differing national situations, as President Xi pointed out, naturally lead to varying perspectives and priorities. The key, however, is how these differences are managed. President Xi’s Vision: The Right Direction for US-China Relations Despite the existing friction, President Xi’s message was clear: the relationship must move forward. His emphasis on a “right path” suggests a call for constructive engagement rather than escalating confrontation. This vision implies: Dialogue Over Division: Prioritizing open communication channels to address grievances and find common ground. Mutual Respect: Acknowledging each other’s core interests and sovereign concerns, even when disagreeing. Shared Responsibility: Recognizing their joint role in maintaining international peace and prosperity. The idea that it’s “normal for the two countries to have disagreements” is a pragmatic acceptance of reality. What truly matters is the framework within which these disagreements are handled to prevent them from derailing broader cooperation and the overall stability of US-China relations . Actionable Insights: Fostering Stability in US-China Relations For observers and policymakers alike, the path forward for US-China relations isn’t about eliminating all disagreements, but about building mechanisms to manage them effectively. Here are some actionable insights: Sustained High-Level Diplomacy: Regular summits and ministerial meetings are vital to keep communication lines open and address emerging issues promptly. Crisis Management Protocols: Establishing clear channels and procedures to de-escalate potential conflicts, especially in sensitive areas. People-to-People Exchanges: Fostering cultural, academic, and business ties can build mutual understanding and trust at a grassroots level. Focus on Common Interests: Identifying and collaborating on shared challenges like climate change, global health, and economic recovery can create positive momentum. Ultimately, the health of this bilateral relationship is a barometer for global stability. Navigating the complexities requires foresight, patience, and a steadfast commitment to finding common ground. Conclusion: President Xi Jinping’s assertion that US-China relations must progress in the right direction, despite significant headwinds, serves as a crucial reminder of their global importance. While disagreements are inevitable between two such distinct powers, the imperative remains to manage these differences constructively. The future of international peace and economic prosperity hinges significantly on the ability of the United States and China to steer their relationship toward a path of stable, albeit challenging, cooperation. This ongoing dialogue and mutual effort are paramount for a more predictable and secure global future. Frequently Asked Questions About US-China Relations Q1: What are the main challenges in US-China relations? A1: Key challenges include ongoing trade disputes, intense technological competition (e.g., 5G, AI), and geopolitical differences concerning Taiwan, the South China Sea, and human rights. Q2: Why is stability in US-China relations so important globally? A2: Stability is crucial because both nations are major economic powers whose interactions impact global trade, supply chains, and financial markets. Their cooperation is also vital for addressing shared global challenges like climate change and pandemics. Q3: What does President Xi mean by “moving in the right direction” for US-China relations? A3: He emphasizes a path of constructive engagement, prioritizing dialogue over division, showing mutual respect for core interests, and acknowledging their shared responsibility in maintaining international peace and prosperity. Q4: How do economic factors influence US-China relations? A4: Economic interdependence is a double-edged sword. While it creates strong incentives for cooperation, issues like trade imbalances, tariffs, and intellectual property disputes can also become major sources of tension and conflict. Q5: Can US-China relations truly overcome their disagreements? A5: Overcoming all disagreements might be unrealistic given their distinct national interests. However, the goal is to establish robust mechanisms for managing these differences effectively through sustained diplomacy, crisis management, and focusing on areas of common interest to prevent escalation and ensure overall stability.

TD Sequential Has Given Another Signal For XRP In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal that has just formed for XRP. The TD Sequential is a technical analysis (TA) indicator that’s used for spotting points of trend reversal in a given asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cost Basis Map Reveals Key War Zone Between Bulls & Bears The indicator involves two phases. In the first of these, called the setup, it counts up nine candles of the same color on the asset’s chart. Once the nine candles are in, it signals that the price trend has reached a state of exhaustion. In other words, the asset has reached a point of turnaround. Naturally, this signal is a bullish one if nine red candles led to the setup’s completion. Similarly, the signal is bearish if green candles were involved instead. When the setup is done, the second phase begins. This phase, known as the countdown, works much like the setup, with the only difference being that it lasts for thirteen candles. The countdown’s finish coincides with another top or bottom for the asset. XRP has recently completed the former of the two TD Sequential setups on its daily price. Below is the chart shared by Martinez that shows this signal forming for the cryptocurrency. As displayed in the graph, the 1-day price of XRP has formed a TD Sequential setup with nine green candles. This means that the coin could be due a reversal to the downside, at least from the perspective of the indicator. During the last few months, the TD Sequential has given several signals for the asset, and interestingly, they have coincided quite well with local tops and bottoms. Considering this trend, it’s possible that the latest sell signal may also lead to a drawdown for the coin. Related Reading: Solana Eyes $210 Before Its Next Major Move—Uptrend Or Fakeout Ahead? XRP isn’t the only asset that the TD Sequential has lately been reliable for. As the analyst has explained in another X post, the indicator has also called the recent swings in the Bitcoin price. From the above chart, it’s apparent that the TD Sequential gave a sell signal for Bitcoin earlier in the day. Since then, the asset has witnessed a retrace, implying that the metric may have once again caught a trend reversal. XRP Price XRP has been trading sideways recently as its price is still floating around $2.62.

53806059,616545,1761793246,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53806059.jpeg,"Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Dump 325,600 BTC — Biggest Monthly Drop Since July ‘25",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-long-term-holders-dump-325600-btc/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to push above critical demand levels today as traders position ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting, a key event that could influence market direction for the weeks ahead. The market remains cautious but tense, with volatility expected to spike once the Fed reveals its stance on interest rates and quantitative tightening (QT). A dovish signal could ignite renewed buying momentum across risk assets, while a reaffirmation of restrictive policy might extend the current consolidation phase. According to fresh on-chain data from CryptoQuant, Long-Term Holders (LTHs) have been actively selling throughout the past month—a trend that points to an ongoing distribution phase in Bitcoin’s cycle. Over the last 30 days, these seasoned investors have offloaded significant amounts of BTC, signaling profit-taking behavior after months of accumulation earlier in the year. While short-term traders watch for a potential breakout, the sustained selling pressure from long-term holders introduces a layer of caution. Still, analysts note that such distribution patterns often occur during mid-cycle transitions, when capital rotates from patient holders to new participants. How Bitcoin reacts to today’s Fed announcement may determine whether this phase evolves into renewed strength or deeper consolidation. Bitcoin Prepares For Volatility According to data shared by top analyst Maartunn, Long-Term Holders (LTHs) have offloaded approximately 325,600 BTC over the past 30 days—the sharpest monthly drawdown since July 2025. This wave of distribution marks a significant shift in market dynamics, suggesting that even the most patient investors are realizing profits or repositioning amid growing macro uncertainty. Historically, such large-scale LTH sell-offs tend to occur near key market transitions—either during late-stage rallies or deep consolidation phases where capital begins rotating back into circulation. The timing of this distribution is particularly notable, coming just as Bitcoin consolidates around the $112,000–$113,000 range and the market braces for the US Federal Reserve’s policy announcement. While selling from long-term holders can initially pressure prices, it often sets the foundation for new market entrants to accumulate at more favorable levels. Once this supply redistributes and selling momentum fades, the market can stabilize and form a stronger base for the next upward move. Maartunn’s analysis suggests that this could be part of a healthy market rotation, not necessarily the start of a broader downtrend. If Bitcoin manages to hold above its 200-day moving average and liquidity remains resilient, the recent LTH distribution may ultimately serve as a reset phase—transferring supply from experienced holders to new investors ahead of a renewed bullish impulse. Looking ahead, the key to Bitcoin’s next major move will likely depend on macro conditions—specifically, the Fed’s tone on interest rates and liquidity management. A dovish or neutral stance could reignite demand and absorb the excess supply, while a more hawkish message may extend consolidation. Either way, this phase appears to be setting the stage for Bitcoin’s next decisive trend. Bitcoin Faces Rejection As Bulls Defend Key Support Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $113,130, showing mild weakness after failing to break above the $117,500 resistance, a critical supply zone that has rejected price advances multiple times this month. The 4-hour chart highlights a clear rejection near this level, followed by a short-term pullback that has brought BTC back toward its 50-period moving average (blue), currently acting as intraday support. Below current levels, the 100-period (green) and 200-period (red) moving averages sit between $111,000–$112,000, forming a solid confluence of dynamic support. As long as Bitcoin holds above this zone, the broader structure remains constructive, suggesting this pullback could be a retest before another breakout attempt. A confirmed break above $117,500 would invalidate the short-term bearish setup and potentially trigger a move toward $120,000–$123,000, where the next resistance cluster lies. However, if BTC closes below $111,500, it could invite deeper corrections toward $108,000, which served as a strong reaction zone earlier this month.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement! The Bitcoin price has just achieved a remarkable milestone, soaring past the significant $111,000 mark. According to recent Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at an impressive $111,003.13 on the Binance USDT market. This surge has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, signaling a potentially robust period for the leading digital asset. What’s Driving the Latest Bitcoin Price Surge? This impressive upward movement in the Bitcoin price isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors often contribute to such significant rallies in the crypto market. Understanding these elements can provide crucial insights into Bitcoin’s current momentum and future potential. Increased Institutional Interest: More traditional financial institutions are exploring and investing in Bitcoin, lending it greater legitimacy and capital. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and a search for alternative stores of value often push investors towards assets like Bitcoin. Technical Breakouts: Surpassing key resistance levels, such as the $111,000 mark, can trigger further buying pressure from technical traders. Halving Event Impact: While not recent, the long-term effects of Bitcoin’s supply-reducing halving events continue to influence its scarcity and perceived value. These combined forces create a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin, demonstrating its resilience and growing appeal as a global asset. How Does This Bitcoin Price Milestone Impact the Market? A significant jump in the Bitcoin price often has ripple effects across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin, being the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, frequently acts as a bellwether for the broader market. When Bitcoin performs well, altcoins often follow suit, experiencing their own rallies. For investors, this milestone can inspire renewed confidence and potentially attract new capital into the space. It highlights Bitcoin’s role as a leader and innovator in the digital finance landscape. Moreover, it strengthens the narrative around Bitcoin’s long-term viability and its potential to act as a hedge against traditional financial volatility. However, it is always crucial to remember that the crypto market can be volatile. While current sentiment is positive, market participants should remain informed and exercise caution. Navigating the Future: What Could Shape the Bitcoin Price Next? As the Bitcoin price consolidates above $111,000, many are looking ahead to what might come next. Predicting market movements is challenging, but several factors will likely influence Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming months. Regulatory Developments: Clearer regulatory frameworks in major economies could either boost confidence or introduce new challenges. Technological Advancements: Ongoing improvements to the Bitcoin network, such as the Lightning Network, enhance its utility and scalability. Global Economic Outlook: The overall health of the global economy and central bank policies will continue to play a role in investor sentiment towards decentralized assets. Market Sentiment: Social media trends, news cycles, and general investor psychology can significantly impact short-term price movements. Staying updated on these developments is key for anyone participating in the crypto market. The journey of Bitcoin is dynamic and ever-evolving. The recent surge in the Bitcoin price past $111,000 is a testament to its enduring strength and growing acceptance in the global financial arena. This significant achievement underscores Bitcoin’s potential as a transformative asset.

The accusation was made on the same day Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz published a long announcement stating that Blockworks will shut down its news division and fully transition into a software and data organization. Jason Yanowitz posted a statement explaining the company’s direction. He said that when he and Michael Ippolito founded Blockworks in 2017, they wanted to address what he called “the information problem,” during a period when crypto was expanding quickly and lacked reliable industry reporting. Jason wrote that Blockworks built events, podcasts, research products, data dashboards, and eventually a newsroom. He said the company had record revenues in 2025 and expected another record year in 2026, pointing to especially fast growth in its data division. Jason wrote that both investors and crypto protocols rely on Blockworks data daily, and that he and Michael view the data business as the company’s strongest opportunity since its founding. The Blockworks CEO then confirmed that Blockworks will exit news, saying that crypto media has matured and users now look primarily to data dashboards rather than traditional articles. Jason thanked the reporters on the news team and invited other organizations to hire them, then mentioned that Blockworks will continue to run newsletters, podcasts, and events, and that the DAS conference will take place next year in Abu Dhabi. DeFiLlama challenges Blockworks over paid data dashboards Shortly after Jason’s announcement, 0xngmi quoted the post and said: “Blockworks becoming a data first org is cool I guess, but you guys could start by not reselling our free data for $4.5k/yr against our Terms of Services, even after telling us you had removed all our data when we asked. Screenshot from blockworks paid platform, 1 min ago.” The attached screenshot displayed a chart that appeared to be generated from DeFiLlama’s data within a Blockworks paywalled dashboard. Check it out below:- Source: 0xngmi/X Then Dan Smith, the head of data at Blockworks, replied under the tweet, saying: “The charts you showed don’t show any data as we deprecated use of dl data in the platform months ago following your change in ToS – as we discussed over DMs. This is an edge case where the dashboard builder shows all charts ever created, regardless if they exist/the data is updated. Thanks for not just dming it, bonus points for a splashy tweet.” 0xngmi responded by calling Dan a liar, and adding that the ‘application revenue by chain’ chart showed in his screenshot worked and returned DeFiLlama data. Dan then replied, “Yeah, not updated since July, like my last DM said. No reason to not have followed up there like ‘Hey, there must be a bug’.” 0xngmi pointed out that:- “The chart I mentioned had data from this month (October 2025).” After that, Dan stopped replying. Engagement under the thread shows 0xngmi’s replies receiving more likes than Dan’s, a pattern commonly recognized on X as being ratioed, meaning the community is on DeFiLlama’s side on this one. The conversation continued circulating widely, with users sharing screenshots and commentary about Terms of Service compliance and platform transparency. Community responds to Blockworks laying off its newsroom At the same time, the decision to remove the news staff drew its own backlash. Many in the community are angry that Jason’s statement began by highlighting record revenue, and only after several paragraphs mentioned that the journalists who contributed to Blockworks’ visibility would be departing. Critics said the tone framed layoffs as an afterthought. Martyna MBL, Senior Director at Serotonin, commented that: “Ok this is pretty tone-deaf way to communicate a major layoff especially while leading with ‘record revenue’ and ‘massive growth’ It’s not just optics but also respect. When you announce redundancies as a footnote to a victory lap it gives people impression on how much you value the team that helped built your credibility in the first place. Really hoping the reporters affected get snapped up fast – they’re some of the best in the business honestly.” Other users echoed this sentiment, arguing that the Blockworks newsroom helped build the brand’s recognition inside the industry during market cycles when clear reporting was necessary. Some also pointed out that the timing of the data resale allegation amplified the reaction, since the company was positioning itself as a trusted data provider on the same day it was accused of misusing another project’s data.

This move, valued at tens of millions of dollars, prompts crucial questions about market sentiment and future price action. What’s Behind This Early Bitcoin Investor’s Latest Move? Owen Gunden, a notable early Bitcoin investor , deposited an additional 395.8 BTC, equivalent to $43.55 million, to Kraken. This follows a prior deposit of 1,447.56 BTC, valued at $163.19 million, made just the day before. Onchain Lens, a reputable analytics platform, reported these significant transactions, drawing immediate speculation from the crypto community. Profit-Taking: One common interpretation is that Gunden might be taking profits after a period of holding. Early investors often accumulate Bitcoin at much lower prices, making current market levels attractive for cashing out. Portfolio Rebalancing: Another possibility is a strategic rebalancing of his investment portfolio. Investors sometimes move assets to exchanges to diversify into other cryptocurrencies or traditional assets. Liquidity for Other Ventures: The funds could also be intended to provide liquidity for new investment opportunities, either within the crypto space or in other markets. Tax Implications: Large transactions often coincide with tax planning strategies, especially for those who have held assets for extended periods. Understanding the motivations of such a prominent early Bitcoin investor is key to deciphering potential market trends. How Does an Early Bitcoin Investor’s Deposit Influence the Market? The actions of an early Bitcoin investor , often referred to as a ‘whale’ in crypto terms, can significantly impact market sentiment. When a large amount of Bitcoin is moved to an exchange, it typically signals an intent to sell. This can create downward pressure on prices as the market anticipates increased supply. Conversely, some might view these deposits as a healthy sign of market liquidity, indicating that the asset can be moved and traded efficiently. It also shows that long-term holders are still actively participating in the market, even if it’s to realize gains. The sheer volume of these deposits means that even a fraction of them being sold could affect market dynamics, particularly in volatile periods. Market participants often monitor these ‘whale’ movements closely. On-chain analytics tools provide transparency into these large transfers, allowing traders and investors to make more informed decisions. Lessons from an Early Bitcoin Investor’s Strategy Observing an early Bitcoin investor like Gunden offers valuable insights into long-term crypto investment strategies. These individuals often demonstrate patience and a deep understanding of market cycles. Their decisions, whether to hold or to sell, are usually calculated and not impulsive. For newer investors, such events highlight the importance of: Risk Management: Having a clear strategy for taking profits and managing potential losses. Market Awareness: Staying informed about on-chain data and significant investor movements. Long-Term Vision: The power of holding valuable assets over extended periods to achieve substantial returns. While no single transaction dictates the entire market’s direction, consistent activity from a prominent early Bitcoin investor can certainly contribute to the overall narrative and influence short-term price movements. It serves as a reminder that the cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, driven by both retail and institutional actions. Conclusion: What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? The latest moves by this early Bitcoin investor underscore the dynamic nature of the crypto market. While the immediate impact of such large deposits is often a subject of debate and speculation, they provide valuable data points for market analysis. Whether Owen Gunden’s actions signal a broader trend of profit-taking or merely a personal portfolio adjustment, the crypto community will undoubtedly watch Bitcoin’s price action closely in the coming days. These events remind us of the significant wealth accumulated by early adopters and the ongoing evolution of Bitcoin as a mature asset class. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an “early Bitcoin investor”? An early Bitcoin investor is someone who acquired Bitcoin during its nascent stages, typically when its price was very low, often in the single or double-digit dollar range, or even less than a dollar. These individuals often held their assets for many years, witnessing monumental growth. Why are large Bitcoin deposits to exchanges significant? Large deposits of Bitcoin to exchanges are significant because they often precede selling activity. When a substantial amount of BTC moves from a personal wallet to an exchange, it indicates that the owner intends to sell, which can increase the supply on the market and potentially lead to price depreciation if demand does not match. Who is Owen Gunden? Owen Gunden is an identified early Bitcoin investor known for holding a significant amount of BTC. His transactions are often tracked by on-chain analytics firms due to their potential impact on market sentiment and supply dynamics. Does this deposit mean Bitcoin’s price will drop? Not necessarily. While large deposits to exchanges can indicate an intent to sell and potentially create downward pressure, the actual impact depends on various factors including market demand, overall sentiment, and whether the deposited BTC is indeed sold or simply held on the exchange. It’s a signal to watch, not a definitive prediction. How can I track similar investor movements? You can track similar investor movements using on-chain analytics platforms like Onchain Lens, Glassnode, or CryptoQuant. These services monitor blockchain transactions and provide insights into whale movements, exchange flows, and other key metrics that can help assess market sentiment.

Recently, the crypto market witnessed a significant event: a massive wave of crypto futures liquidations , with long positions bearing the brunt of the losses. This development has sent ripples through the trading community, highlighting the inherent volatility and risks associated with leveraged trading. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset landscape. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations, Anyway? For those new to the derivatives market, the term ‘liquidation’ can sound daunting. Simply put, crypto futures liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because they no longer have sufficient margin to cover potential losses. It is essentially a forced sale to prevent further negative equity. When the market moves against a trader’s prediction, especially with high leverage, their initial margin can quickly deplete. Exchanges then step in to close the position automatically. This mechanism protects both the exchange and other market participants from excessive risk, but it can be devastating for individual traders. Why Are Longs Facing Massive Crypto Futures Liquidations? Over the past 24 hours, the data paints a clear picture: long positions—bets that an asset’s price will rise—have accounted for the vast majority of these forced closures. This indicates a sharp downward price movement that caught many optimistic traders off guard. Let’s look at the numbers: Bitcoin (BTC): A staggering $232 million was liquidated, with 82.18% coming from long positions. Ethereum (ETH): Similarly, $158 million in ETH futures was liquidated, and 79.81% of that was from long positions. Solana (SOL): Not immune to the downturn, SOL saw $33.17 million liquidated, with longs making up 79.44%. These figures underscore a prevailing sentiment of over-optimism or perhaps a lack of robust risk management among a significant portion of traders. When a market experiences a sudden dip, highly leveraged long positions are the first to feel the squeeze, leading to cascading liquidations. Navigating the Storm: How to Mitigate Risks in Crypto Futures Trading The recent wave of crypto futures liquidations serves as a stark reminder of the perils of over-leveraging. However, it also offers valuable lessons for traders. How can one avoid becoming another statistic in these volatile market conditions? Firstly, understanding leverage is paramount. While leverage amplifies potential gains, it equally magnifies potential losses. Traders should use leverage cautiously and only when they have a deep understanding of market dynamics and their own risk tolerance. Secondly, implementing strict risk management strategies is non-negotiable. This includes setting stop-loss orders to automatically close positions at a predetermined loss level, thereby limiting downside exposure. Moreover, never invest more than you can afford to lose. Finally, staying informed about market news and technical analysis can provide an edge. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, and being prepared for various scenarios is crucial. Diversifying portfolios and not putting all your eggs in one basket can also help cushion the blow of sudden market downturns. The recent surge in crypto futures liquidations , particularly impacting long positions across major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, highlights the inherent risks of leveraged trading. While the allure of amplified gains is strong, the reality of sudden losses can be devastating. This event serves as a powerful cautionary tale, emphasizing the critical importance of prudent risk management, disciplined trading strategies, and a thorough understanding of market volatility. Traders who prioritize these principles are better equipped to navigate the unpredictable tides of the crypto market. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Futures Liquidations Q1: What exactly causes a crypto futures liquidation? A1: A liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position loses so much value that their margin collateral falls below the exchange’s maintenance margin requirement. The exchange then forcibly closes the position to prevent further losses. Q2: Why were long positions primarily affected in the recent liquidations? A2: Long positions are bets that the price of an asset will increase. When the market experiences a sudden and significant price drop, these long positions quickly become unprofitable, leading to forced liquidations as their collateral is exhausted. Q3: How can traders protect themselves from crypto futures liquidations? A3: Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, diversifying their portfolios, and only trading with capital they can afford to lose. Continuous education about market dynamics and risk management is also key. Q4: Does a high volume of liquidations indicate a market crash? A4: Not necessarily a full-blown crash, but a high volume of liquidations, especially of long positions, typically indicates significant downward price pressure and increased market volatility. It often suggests a sharp correction or a strong bearish trend in the short term. Q5: What is the difference between a ‘long’ and a ‘short’ position in futures trading? A5: A ‘long’ position is a bet that the price of an asset will go up, while a ‘short’ position is a bet that the price will go down. Traders go long when they are bullish and short when they are bearish. Did you find this analysis of crypto futures liquidations insightful?

This marks the second vote in two days pushing back on the president’s trade agenda, with the latest tally coming in at 50-46 on Wednesday. Four Republicans crossed the aisle to vote with Democrats: Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Rand Paul. All four had already backed the Tuesday resolution against tariffs on Brazil and previously voted to kill the Canada tariffs back in April. Wednesday’s vote was the second of three planned Senate actions this week challenging Trump’s use of emergency tariff powers. A final vote targeting his broader global tariffs is set for Thursday, and if this pattern holds, Trump’s entire tariff scheme could get shredded in the Senate… well at least symbolically anyway. The resolutions won’t have teeth until the House takes them up, and Republican leaders there have already delayed any votes until March, using a procedural block. Trump cut off Canada trade talks after Ontario aired Reagan ad Trump scrapped trade talks with Canada last weekend after a regional government in Ontario aired a baseball ad quoting Ronald Reagan blasting tariffs. The ad, which aired during playoff games, showed the late president from a 1987 radio address where he said, “The way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition.” Reagan was referencing tariffs on Japan, but also warned about trade wars. That clearly struck a nerve. Trump quickly called the ad fake and claimed Reagan actually supported tariffs. But McConnell wasn’t buying it. On Tuesday, he fired back: “The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule. And no cross-eyed reading of Reagan will reveal otherwise.” McConnell also confirmed he’ll support all resolutions to end emergency tariff authorities. Trump also threatened to raise the current 35% duty on Canadian goods by another 10%, but hasn’t followed through… yet. That threat is still hanging, even as Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney says he’s willing to get back to the table. Carney said before the talks collapsed, there had been “considerable progress” on issues like steel, aluminum, and energy tariffs. Senators split over Canada vs Brazil tariff justifications Not all Republicans were on board with killing the Canada tariffs.Sen. Thom Tillis from North Carolina voted to keep them, after voting against the Brazil tariffs a day earlier. “The Brazil tariff is very different,” Tillis said . “It appeared to center on a disagreement that had nothing to do with business or trade.” On the other hand, Collins, who represents a border state, said she’s directly seen the harm the tariffs have caused. “I’ve seen firsthand the damage that the Canadian tariffs have caused,” she told reporters. “I also believe the Canadians have worked very hard to try to stem the flow of drugs into this country… the vast majority of drugs arrive from the southern border, not the northern border. So I don’t think the basis for imposing tariffs on Canada is a valid one.” She was joined by Murkowski and Paul, who also co-sponsored the resolution. It was the same lineup of GOP senators that joined with Democrats to block the Brazil resolution on Tuesday. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Investors and analysts worldwide closely watched as the Bank of Japan interest rate was held steady at 0.5%. This move, marking the sixth consecutive time the central bank has kept its benchmark rate unchanged, carries significant weight for both the Japanese economy and global financial stability. Understanding this decision is crucial for anyone tracking market movements. Understanding the Bank of Japan Interest Rate Hold The Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced its decision to maintain its benchmark interest rate at 0.5%. This stability follows a 25-basis-point hike earlier in January, which ended years of negative rates. The consistent hold suggests the BOJ is taking a measured approach, carefully assessing the economic landscape before making further adjustments. This period of steady Bank of Japan interest rate policy allows the central bank to observe the effects of previous changes and gather more data. It signals a cautious stance, aiming to ensure long-term economic health rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations. Stability Maintained: The rate remains at 0.5%, indicating a cautious stance. Sixth Consecutive Hold: Demonstrates a consistent policy direction after the initial hike. Market Expectations Met: Most analysts anticipated this decision, avoiding market surprises. Why Did the Bank of Japan Maintain Its Interest Rate? Several factors likely influenced the BOJ’s decision to keep the Bank of Japan interest rate unchanged. Primarily, the central bank is focused on ensuring that inflation remains sustainably around its 2% target, driven by robust wage growth. While inflation has been above target, the BOJ wants to confirm that this trend is solid and not merely a temporary fluctuation. Global economic uncertainties, including geopolitical tensions and fluctuating commodity prices, also play a role. Moreover, the BOJ is keen to avoid any premature tightening that could derail a fragile economic recovery. They are looking for clear signs of domestic demand strengthening and a positive wage-price spiral taking firm root. This patient approach is a hallmark of their recent monetary policy strategy. Immediate and Broader Impacts of the Bank of Japan Interest Rate Stability The stability in the Bank of Japan interest rate has several implications. For instance, the Japanese Yen often reacts to such decisions. A steady rate might limit significant appreciation of the Yen, which can be favorable for Japan’s export-oriented industries. Globally, the low but positive Japanese rates continue to support the “carry trade,” where investors borrow in Yen at low rates to invest in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. This steady hand from the BOJ also influences bond markets, with Japanese government bond yields remaining relatively stable. International investors closely monitor these movements, as Japan’s monetary policy can have spillover effects on global capital flows and risk appetite. The predictability offered by this decision can foster a sense of calm in a sometimes volatile global financial environment. What’s Next for the Bank of Japan Interest Rate Policy? Looking ahead, the future trajectory of the Bank of Japan interest rate remains a key point of discussion. Market participants will be scrutinizing upcoming economic data, particularly regarding inflation and wage growth. If inflation proves to be more persistent and wage growth accelerates significantly, the BOJ might consider another rate hike. However, any such move would likely be gradual and data-dependent. Conversely, if economic growth falters or global headwinds intensify, the central bank could maintain its current stance for an extended period. The BOJ’s cautious stance underscores its commitment to achieving stable inflation in a sustainable manner, balancing growth considerations with price stability objectives. The path forward is uncertain, but the focus remains on data. Summary: A Steady Hand in Uncertain Times The Bank of Japan’s decision to hold its benchmark interest rate at 0.5% for the sixth consecutive time reflects a careful and data-driven approach to monetary policy. This stability aims to foster sustainable inflation while navigating global economic complexities. While the immediate impact might seem minimal, this consistent Bank of Japan interest rate policy plays a significant role in shaping both domestic economic conditions and broader international financial dynamics. Investors should continue to monitor Japan’s economic indicators and the BOJ’s communications for clues about future policy adjustments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the current Bank of Japan interest rate? The Bank of Japan’s benchmark interest rate is currently held steady at 0.5%. Why did the Bank of Japan keep its interest rate unchanged? The BOJ maintained its rate to carefully assess if inflation can sustainably reach its 2% target, driven by strong wage growth, and to navigate global economic uncertainties. How does the Bank of Japan interest rate affect the Japanese Yen? A steady interest rate can limit significant appreciation of the Japanese Yen, which generally benefits Japan’s export sector. What is the “carry trade” and how does the BOJ’s policy relate to it? The “carry trade” involves borrowing in currencies with low interest rates (like the Yen) to invest in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. The BOJ’s low but positive interest rate policy continues to support this activity. Will the Bank of Japan hike interest rates again soon? Future rate hikes by the BOJ will be data-dependent, closely monitoring inflation, wage growth, and overall economic conditions. The central bank is taking a cautious, measured approach.

Lawmakers in both parties now say Donald Trump could end up sending China one of America’s most powerful AI chips, even if it is a scaled-down model. This is about the Nvidia Blackwell system, the chip that is supposed to keep the U.S. ahead in AI computing power. When the idea came up that China might get a downgraded version of it, the reaction in Washington was instant and loud. House Select Committee on China Chairman John Moolenaar said selling Nvidia’s top AI hardware to China “would be akin to giving Iran weapons grade uranium.” He said on X that he made it clear to the administration that, “we cannot sell the latest advanced AI chips to our country’s primary adversary.” Moolenaar added that these chips should go to “U.S. companies that are building American AI dominance for years to come, not the future of the Chinese military.” The warning came right after Trump suggested he might allow Nvidia to sell a weaker version of the Blackwell chip , known as the B30A, to China. Congress presses Trump not to lift export limits U.S. trade officials and national security analysts say that exporting even a scaled-down model could break the entire U.S. export control strategy that started in 2022. Those restrictions were built to block Beijing’s military from benefiting from American AI breakthroughs. They were also intended to slow down China’s AI growth curve. Now, experts argue that if the B30A is approved for China, the U.S. would lose the core advantage it currently holds in AI computing power. Tim Fist, co-author of a recent analysis on the chip, said, “If we decide to export B30As, it would dramatically shrink the U.S.’s main advantage it currently has over China in AI.” He explained that the B30A is basically the same Blackwell chip but in different packaging. In his words, China could simply buy twice as many and get the same computing output, likely at the same price. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and 11 other Democratic senators also urged Trump to avoid lifting the chip restrictions as part of any trade negotiation with President Xi. Analysts lay out best and worst outcomes The analysis from Fist and his co-authors examined nine export scenarios. In the best case, where no powerful chips are exported to China next year, the United States would maintain 30 times China’s AI computing power. In the worst case, if the U.S. allows exports of B30A chips and similar products from other U.S. firms, China could gain enough computing power to surpass the United States by 2026. Even the middle scenario shows the U.S. advantage shrinking down to only four times China’s capacity. Fist, who is the director of emerging technology policy at the Institute for Progress, said, “If any meaningful quantities are allowed, it’s a huge change.” He argued that allowing these chips to ship would be “functionally ending the export control regime that we have today.” Chris McGuire, a national security and technology analyst who worked in the U.S. State Department until last summer, echoed the same view. He said , “If this chip is allowed to go, there are effectively no AI chip export controls anymore.” Chris added that the reason the U.S. leads in AI now is because it leads in chips and computing power. If that advantage is traded away, “best case is, it’s like a tie. Worst case, we fall behind.” “We would be trading China our most advanced technology for soybean purchases,” said Chris.

The world of currency markets is a complex tapestry woven with central bank decisions, geopolitical negotiations, and economic data. Recently, the Asia FX landscape experienced a period of muted activity, a calm before what many believe could be a significant storm or a strategic pause. This quiet period was largely influenced by the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) cautious stance and the high-stakes discussions between former US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, which cast a long shadow over trade relations. Simultaneously, the US dollar saw some fluctuations following a series of mixed signals from the Federal Reserve, leaving investors pondering the future direction of the world’s reserve currency. Understanding these interconnected forces is paramount for anyone navigating the global financial markets, especially those with an interest in how traditional finance impacts the broader economic landscape. Understanding the Muted Tone in Asia FX Markets The recent quiet in Asian currency markets wasn’t a sign of indifference but rather a reflection of significant uncertainty. Investors often adopt a wait-and-see approach when major economic or political events are on the horizon, leading to reduced trading volumes and narrower currency movements. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the highly sensitive Asia FX region, where economies are deeply intertwined with global trade and central bank policies. What Factors Contributed to the Muted Asian Currency Performance? Central Bank Caution: The Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its ultra-loose monetary policy, providing little impetus for significant Yen movement. Other Asian central banks also held their ground, opting for stability amid global headwinds. Geopolitical Tensions: The anticipation surrounding the Trump-Xi talks created a sense of unease. Any escalation or de-escalation in trade tensions directly impacts export-oriented Asian economies and their currencies. Global Economic Slowdown Concerns: Broader worries about a potential global economic slowdown tempered risk appetite, making investors less inclined to engage in high-volume currency trades. Commodity Price Fluctuations: Many Asian economies are commodity importers or exporters. Volatility in oil, gas, or metal prices can influence their trade balances and, consequently, their currency valuations. This period of relative calm in Asia FX allowed market participants to consolidate positions and reassess strategies, preparing for potential shifts once key decisions were announced or negotiations concluded. The Enduring Influence of BOJ Policy on the Yen and Beyond The Bank of Japan (BOJ) stands out among major central banks for its persistent commitment to an ultra-accommodative monetary policy. For years, the BOJ has battled deflation and sluggish growth, employing negative interest rates and massive asset purchases to stimulate the economy. This unwavering approach has profound implications, not just for the Japanese Yen but for global financial markets as well. How Does BOJ Policy Shape Global Markets? The BOJ’s stance on interest rates and quantitative easing creates a unique dynamic: Yen as a Funding Currency: Low Japanese interest rates make the Yen an attractive funding currency for ‘carry trades.’ Investors borrow Yen at low rates and invest in higher-yielding assets elsewhere, impacting other currencies. Impact on Global Yields: The BOJ’s yield curve control (YCC) policy, which aims to keep long-term government bond yields around zero, suppresses global bond yields. This can make other developed market bonds relatively more attractive, influencing capital flows. Risk Sentiment Indicator: Changes in BOJ rhetoric or policy shifts can signal broader changes in global central bank thinking or economic outlook, affecting overall risk sentiment. Regional Economic Spillover: As a major trading partner and investor in Asia, Japan’s economic health, heavily influenced by BOJ policy , directly impacts its regional neighbors. The consistent dovishness of the BOJ provides a stable, low-cost funding environment, but it also raises questions about the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of such prolonged easing measures. Any hint of a shift from this policy could trigger significant volatility across asset classes, including a substantial rally in the Yen. The US Dollar ‘s Rollercoaster: Reacting to Mixed Fed Signals The US dollar , often seen as the ultimate safe-haven currency, has been anything but static. Its recent performance reflects the market’s continuous attempt to decipher the Federal Reserve’s intentions. Mixed signals from the Fed can arise from various sources: differing opinions among committee members, conflicting economic data, or carefully worded statements designed to maintain flexibility. This ambiguity often leads to choppy trading conditions for the greenback. Deciphering the Federal Reserve’s Messaging The Fed’s communication is a crucial driver of dollar movements. Here’s why mixed signals create volatility: Interest Rate Expectations: The primary driver for the US dollar is the market’s expectation of future interest rate changes. If some Fed officials suggest a hawkish stance (higher rates) while others lean dovish (lower rates or continued easing), the market struggles to price in a clear path. Economic Outlook: The Fed’s assessment of inflation, employment, and economic growth heavily influences its policy decisions. Conflicting data points or varying interpretations among policymakers can lead to mixed signals. Quantitative Tightening/Easing: Beyond interest rates, the Fed’s balance sheet policy (e.g., tapering asset purchases or resuming them) also impacts liquidity and, consequently, the US dollar ‘s value. When the Fed’s outlook appears less clear, investors often reduce their exposure to the dollar or engage in hedging strategies, contributing to its dips and rallies. A strong dollar can make US exports more expensive and impact corporate earnings, while a weaker dollar can stimulate economic activity but potentially fuel inflation. The delicate balance the Fed tries to maintain directly translates into the dollar’s performance on the global stage. High Stakes: The Impact of Global Trade Talks on Currency Markets The specter of global trade talks , particularly those involving major economic powers like the US and China, always sends ripples through financial markets. The discussions between then-President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping were no exception. Trade disputes can lead to tariffs, restrictions, and uncertainty, directly impacting global supply chains, corporate profits, and ultimately, national economies and their currencies. Why Do Trade Talks Matter So Much for Currencies? The outcome of global trade talks can significantly alter currency valuations: Economic Growth Outlook: Positive outcomes can boost business confidence and investment, leading to stronger economic growth expectations and a stronger currency. Conversely, negative outcomes can trigger recession fears and currency depreciation. Export/Import Dynamics: Tariffs and trade barriers directly affect a country’s exports and imports. A nation facing higher tariffs on its goods may see its trade surplus shrink or deficit widen, putting downward pressure on its currency. Capital Flows: Uncertainty stemming from trade disputes can deter foreign direct investment and portfolio investment, leading to capital outflows and currency weakness. Safe-Haven Demand: During periods of intense trade tension, investors often flock to traditional safe-haven currencies like the US dollar, Japanese Yen, or Swiss Franc, impacting their values relative to other currencies. The Trump-Xi talks were a prime example of how political negotiations can become central economic events, dictating market sentiment and the direction of major currency pairs. The ongoing narrative of US-China relations continues to be a critical factor for anyone assessing global market stability and currency movements. Navigating the Complex Interplay: Challenges and Opportunities The interconnectedness of central bank policies and geopolitical events presents both challenges and opportunities for investors. The muted Asia FX response, the US dollar ‘s volatility, the steadfast BOJ policy , the ambiguous Fed signals , and the tension of global trade talks all contribute to a dynamic and sometimes unpredictable market environment. Key Challenges for Investors: Policy Divergence: Major central banks are not always synchronized in their policy approaches, leading to complex interest rate differentials and carry trade dynamics. Geopolitical Risk: Trade wars, political instability, and international disputes can quickly shift market sentiment and currency valuations, often with little warning. Data Overload: Sifting through a constant stream of economic data, central bank statements, and political rhetoric to identify actionable insights can be overwhelming. Increased Volatility: Periods of uncertainty often lead to heightened currency volatility, increasing risk for short-term traders. Emerging Opportunities: Strategic Hedging: Understanding the drivers of currency movements allows businesses and investors to implement effective hedging strategies to mitigate foreign exchange risk. Carry Trade Potential: Persistent policy divergence, particularly the BOJ policy , can create opportunities for carry trades, though these come with their own risks. Relative Value Plays: Identifying undervalued or overvalued currencies based on economic fundamentals and central bank expectations can lead to profitable long-term positions. Diversification: A well-diversified portfolio that considers currency exposures can help cushion against regional economic shocks. In this intricate landscape, staying informed and adaptable is crucial. The interplay between these powerful forces means that a move in one market can trigger a chain reaction across others, demanding a holistic view from market participants.

These are primary drivers for the Yen and US dollar . Subtle shifts in language can signal major policy changes. Trade Talk Analysis Stay updated on the progress and rhetoric surrounding global trade talks , especially US-China relations. Trade outcomes directly impact economic growth, corporate earnings, and therefore, currency valuations, particularly for Asia FX . Economic Data Review Pay attention to key economic indicators: inflation, employment, GDP growth, and manufacturing data from major economies. These data points influence central bank decisions and market sentiment, affecting currency strength. Risk Management Implement robust risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders and diversification across different currency pairs. High volatility, especially with mixed Fed signals , demands careful risk control to protect capital. Long-Term Trends While short-term news creates noise, focus on identifying long-term trends driven by fundamental economic shifts and structural changes. This helps in making more informed decisions beyond immediate market reactions. By adopting a disciplined approach and integrating these insights into your investment strategy, you can better navigate the complexities of the global currency markets, turning potential challenges into opportunities for growth and stability. FAQs: Your Burning Questions About Global Currency Dynamics Answered Q1: How do global trade talks specifically affect the Japanese Yen given BOJ policy ? A1: Japan is a major export-oriented economy. Positive outcomes from global trade talks , especially between the US and China, typically boost global trade volumes and demand for Japanese goods, which can strengthen the Yen. Conversely, trade tensions can lead to a weaker Yen due to reduced export prospects. However, the Yen also acts as a safe-haven currency, meaning it can strengthen during periods of extreme global uncertainty, even if that uncertainty stems from trade disputes. The Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) ultra-loose monetary policy generally keeps the Yen weaker than it might otherwise be, but significant global events can temporarily override this influence. Q2: What are ‘mixed Fed signals ‘ and why do they cause US dollar volatility? A2: ‘Mixed Fed signals ‘ refer to situations where the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) communication or actions are not clearly indicative of a consistent monetary policy direction. This could involve some Fed officials expressing hawkish views (suggesting higher interest rates) while others lean dovish (favoring lower rates or continued easing), or economic data presenting a conflicting picture (e.g., strong employment but weak inflation). This ambiguity causes volatility because currency traders and investors struggle to anticipate the Fed’s next move regarding interest rates, which are a primary driver of the US dollar ‘s value. Uncertainty leads to less conviction in trading decisions, resulting in wider price swings. Q3: Why is Asia FX often muted during periods of significant global news? A3: Asia FX markets often become muted or range-bound during periods of major global news (like central bank meetings or high-level political talks) because investors tend to adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ approach. Rather than making large directional bets before key announcements, they prefer to hold positions or reduce exposure. This leads to lower trading volumes and narrower spreads. Asian economies are highly sensitive to global trade and capital flows, so uncertainty surrounding events like global trade talks or the Fed’s policy direction can cause market participants to pause, leading to a temporary lull in activity. Q4: How does the BOJ’s yield curve control affect Asia FX markets? A4: The BOJ’s yield curve control (YCC) policy aims to keep long-term Japanese government bond yields around a target level, typically near zero. This makes Japanese bonds less attractive compared to higher-yielding assets in other countries. Consequently, Japanese investors often seek better returns abroad, leading to capital outflows. These outflows can influence other Asia FX markets by increasing demand for foreign assets and potentially putting upward pressure on other Asian currencies or asset prices, as Japanese money seeks yield in neighboring economies. Conversely, it also reinforces the Yen’s role as a funding currency for carry trades, indirectly impacting other currencies as investors borrow cheap Yen to invest elsewhere. Conclusion: Navigating the Currents of Global Finance The recent period of muted Asia FX activity, the persistent influence of BOJ policy , the fluctuating fortunes of the US dollar driven by mixed Fed signals , and the overarching shadow of global trade talks collectively paint a picture of a financial landscape in constant flux. These forces are not isolated; they interact in complex ways, creating a dynamic environment that demands vigilance and a deep understanding from all market participants. For investors, businesses, and anyone interested in the future of finance, staying abreast of these developments is not merely an academic exercise but a practical necessity. The ability to decode central bank rhetoric, anticipate geopolitical shifts, and interpret economic data will be paramount in successfully navigating the currents of global currency markets and seizing opportunities as they arise.

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire described Arc as purpose-built to connect every local market to the global economy, emphasizing its ability to facilitate lending, capital markets, foreign exchange, and global payments. Arc’s design centers on USDC as the native gas token, offering predictable dollar-based transaction fees and sub-second finality, features that make it uniquely appealing for regulated financial operations. A Global Push Toward Blockchain-Based Finance Arc’s debut underscores a growing institutional appetite for blockchain infrastructure that balances regulatory compliance with decentralized programmability. Participants such as Apollo, BNY Mellon, and State Street join payment titans and fintech leaders in testing Arc’s capabilities. Circle has also enlisted developer partners like Alchemy, Chainlink, and Anthropic, while Coinbase and Uniswap are providing liquidity support. The network integrates optional privacy controls to ensure compliance with data-protection standards while enabling transparency for audits and settlements. This balance is crucial for large financial institutions exploring tokenized assets, real-time settlements, and programmable payments. In a significant regional development, South Korean firm BDACS announced it will issue its Korean won-backed stablecoin (KRW1) on Circle’s Arc blockchain, a move aimed at expanding South Korea’s regulated stablecoin presence on the global stage. Toward Decentralized Governance and Institutional Adoption While Circle currently oversees Arc’s testnet operations, the company plans to transition toward community-governed decentralization in the future. Compliance partners like Elliptic are already integrating monitoring tools to strengthen transparency across the ecosystem. Industry analysts view Arc as Circle’s most ambitious project yet, a move that could reshape how banks, fintechs, and enterprises conduct cross-border payments and tokenized finance.

Traders are now searching for the next crypto to take off, focusing less on hype and more on solid fundamentals, real adoption, and sustainable growth. XRP is holding steady above $2, Cardano is progressing quietly through consolidation, and Solana’s recovery signals technical strength returning to the market. Still, one project continues to dominate discussions: BlockDAG (BDAG) . Its mathematically designed presale structure and technology-first approach have placed it among the most talked-about developments of the year. As the larger market prepares for its next phase, these four names are defining the potential breakout path ahead. 1. BlockDAG: The Numbers and Technology Driving Its Momentum BlockDAG’s progress stands on verifiable results that have caught market attention. The presale started at $0.001 and, with a total supply of 150 billion coins, reaching $1 would reflect a $150 billion market cap, positioning BDAG among leading crypto assets. This structure has many calling it the next crypto to take off as its mainnet launch nears. So far, BlockDAG (BDAG) has raised over $433 million and sold more than 27.2 billion coins across 31 batches, supported by a growing community of more than 312,000 holders. The TGE price of $0.0015 offers one of the last opportunities before the $0.05 launch phase begins. Beyond its financial success, the project’s hybrid Proof-of-Work and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model delivers both Bitcoin-level security and high throughput of up to 15,000 transactions per second. With two completed audits from CertiK and Halborn, and over 20,000 mining units distributed globally, BlockDAG’s scalability and transparency have set new benchmarks. This combination of verified performance and expanding adoption makes it a strong contender for the next crypto to take off in 2025’s bullish landscape. 2. XRP: Building Stability Before the Next Move XRP has maintained a stable range between $2.40 and $2.60, showing consolidation after earlier volatility in October. Analysts identify $2.26 as an important support level and $3.30 to $3.50 as the resistance zone that could trigger a breakout if momentum strengthens. Institutional attention toward XRP is rising, with renewed talks about potential ETF approvals adding to the optimism. Despite some selling from larger holders, the recent surge in trading volume points to improving sentiment. Its continued relevance comes from its established role in global cross-border payments and growing adoption among financial institutions. Technical indicators suggest that if current levels hold, upward continuation is possible. While regulatory challenges remain, many market watchers see XRP as a strong candidate for the next crypto to take off if the right market catalysts emerge before the end of the year. 3. Cardano: Quiet Phase Before a Potential Climb Cardano (ADA) has been trading calmly between $0.65 and $0.70, signaling a consolidation stage before any significant move. Analysts see resistance forming near $0.80, with possible long-term targets between $0.90 and $1.00. The network keeps expanding through steady development updates, even as recent large-scale sell-offs by major holders caused temporary pressure on prices. This could have reset short-term support levels, paving the way for a more stable rise. Cardano’s outlook remains positive as it focuses on scalability improvements and gradual network upgrades. Many analysts expect ADA to break above $1 once overall market sentiment strengthens. For now, its progress remains quiet but consistent, keeping it in focus as one of the next cryptos to take off when confidence returns to layer-1 platforms. 4. Solana: Pushing Higher with Strong Technical Support Solana continues to show resilience, trading between $189 and $195 while maintaining steady volume growth and upward momentum toward the $200 threshold. Analysts mark $215 as the main resistance, with a potential breakout leading toward $230 or even $245. The $184 support level remains solid, providing a strong technical base for future gains. The upcoming “Alpenglow” upgrade, aimed at reducing transaction finality times, has captured the attention of institutions looking for faster blockchain performance. Although new address growth has slowed, liquidity and overall demand remain healthy. If Solana breaks through resistance, it could easily become the next crypto to take off in 2025, supported by innovation and market confidence. Why These Coins Could Lead the 2025 Surge The next crypto to take off will likely emerge from projects combining utility, adoption, and technical progress rather than hype. XRP shows strong institutional appeal, Cardano continues steady development, and Solana leads with technical upgrades and consistent volume growth. Yet, BlockDAG stands apart with measurable success and a clear, data-backed roadmap. Having raised over $433 million and sold more than 27.2 billion coins, BlockDAG’s presale momentum highlights its distinct position in the evolving crypto landscape. As the market prepares for the next major phase, its blend of innovation and verified progress suggests BlockDAG could define 2025’s standout breakout story.

Despite the volatility, some analysts have predicted that the King of Altcoins may soon start its long-awaited price discovery rally, while whales pour millions into the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitwise CIO Predicts Solana Staking ETF Will Be ‘Huge’ As First Day Volume Hits $56M Ethereum Price Set For $8,000 On Wednesday, Ethereum fell below the $4,000 level once again, falling to a two-day low of $3,926. After a massive Q3 rally, the King of Altcoin has struggled to hold the crucial psychological barrier as support and has been unable to reclaim the $4,200 resistance for most of October. Earlier this week, the cryptocurrency retested the key resistance level after surging 7% over the weekend, but retraced on Tuesday alongside the rest of the market. Amid this performance, some analysts suggested that ETH will likely experience more volatility, fueled by the Federal Reserve (Fed)’s interest rate cut announcement. Daan Crypto Trades noted that ETH’s big test is around its previous cycle highs near the $4,100 level. To the trader, “this is the level to break and hold if the bulls want to get back to the highs in due time.” On the contrary, a new rejection from this area could send the price to retest $3,800 and turn the level into a major resistance in the larger timeframes. Nonetheless, Crypto Yhodda stated that Ethereum is “getting ready for the last euphoric run,” as its performance resembles its 2021 price action, when the altcoin recorded a massive price discovery rally after breaking out of its four-year consolidation. Similarly, analyst Crypto Jelle asserted that shakeouts at key support levels are expected, adding that the cryptocurrency’s rally “still looks very promising.” Jelle highlighted an 18-month bullish megaphone formation on Ethereum’s chart, which it broke out of during the Q3 rally. The analyst emphasized that ETH is still holding the previous highs and the breakout level as support, suggesting that a “hated rally” to the $8,000 target could happen soon. Whales Bet Big On ETH Online reports highlighted that large-scale investors have been on a buying spree despite the altcoin’s pullback. As reported by NewsBTC, Santiment data showed that whales added 218,470 ETH in the past week, signaling that major investors are gradually re-entering the market. Meanwhile, on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that whales continued to buy ETH over the past 24 hours. Notably, two newly created addresses received a total of 33,948 ETH, worth $135 million, from digital asset prime brokerage FalconX on Wednesday morning. According to Lookonchain, the two addresses likely belong to BitMine, the largest Ethereum-based treasury company, which recently unveiled another 27,316 ETH purchase, worth $113 million.

With the recent purchases, the company has achieved 55% of its goal, currently holding 2.75% of ETH’s supply. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $3,990, a 3.5% drop in the daily timeframe.

While traditional media focuses on diplomatic outcomes, for those in the digital asset space, the immediate question arises: what are the US-China summit crypto implications ? Geopolitical events, especially involving two economic giants, often send ripples through global markets, and cryptocurrency is no exception. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for investors navigating the volatile crypto landscape. What Does a Brief US-China Summit Mean for Global Stability and Crypto? The brevity of the summit, as reported by CCTV via JoongAng Ilbo, can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it might signal efficient communication and a focused agenda, potentially reducing immediate tensions. On the other hand, a short duration could suggest a lack of substantial breakthroughs on complex issues. Both scenarios carry distinct US-China summit crypto implications . Reduced Tensions: If the summit successfully diffused immediate flashpoints, it could foster a sense of global stability. This often translates to increased investor confidence, potentially leading to capital flowing into risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Unresolved Issues: Conversely, if critical topics remain unaddressed, it might perpetuate uncertainty. Market volatility thrives on uncertainty, and digital assets often bear the brunt of such sentiment, experiencing price fluctuations. The cryptocurrency market, by its very nature, reacts sensitively to macroeconomic indicators and geopolitical shifts. Major diplomatic engagements like this summit are closely watched for any signals regarding trade policy, technological competition, and regulatory frameworks that could indirectly influence the crypto ecosystem. How Do Geopolitical Shifts Influence Digital Asset Markets and US-China Summit Crypto Implications? The relationship between the United States and China is a cornerstone of the global economy. Any significant development, positive or negative, inevitably affects investor sentiment worldwide. For cryptocurrencies, this influence manifests in several ways: Investor Sentiment: A positive outlook on US-China relations can bolster risk-on assets. Conversely, heightened tensions can drive investors towards perceived safe havens, or simply out of volatile assets like crypto. Economic Stability: Stable US-China relations contribute to global economic stability, which is generally favorable for growth assets. Disruptions can lead to economic slowdowns, impacting disposable income and investment in crypto. Regulatory Landscape: While not directly discussed at a general summit, the broader tone of US-China relations can influence national approaches to digital asset regulation. For instance, competition in areas like central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could accelerate or hinder crypto adoption globally. The ongoing debate around stablecoin regulations and digital yuan initiatives often mirrors these geopolitical dynamics. It is not always about direct announcements. Often, the market reacts to the unspoken signals and the perceived trajectory of future cooperation or competition. The US-China summit crypto implications are therefore often subtle but profound. What Should Crypto Investors Monitor Following This Summit for US-China Summit Crypto Implications? Given the swift conclusion of the summit, crypto investors should pay close attention to subsequent developments and official statements. Here are key areas to monitor: Official Readouts: Look for detailed statements from both US and Chinese officials regarding the specific topics discussed and any agreements reached. These will provide clearer insights into the summit’s actual impact. Trade Policy Updates: Any hints about changes in trade tariffs or economic sanctions could directly affect global supply chains and economic growth, which in turn influence crypto market liquidity and investment flows. Technological Competition: Keep an eye on announcements related to technology, particularly concerning semiconductors, AI, and blockchain. Competition or cooperation in these areas can have significant long-term US-China summit crypto implications , especially for innovation and development within the crypto space. Market Reactions: Observe how major indices and traditional financial markets react in the days following the summit. Cryptocurrency markets often follow broader economic trends, albeit with higher volatility. The brief encounter might be a precursor to more substantial discussions, or it might be a strategic pause. Regardless, understanding the underlying currents of US-China relations is essential for making informed decisions in the cryptocurrency market. This summit, though short, serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of global politics and digital finance. The recent US-China summit, despite its brevity, underscores the intricate link between global geopolitics and the volatile cryptocurrency market. While no direct crypto policies were announced, the overarching tone of US-China relations significantly influences investor confidence, economic stability, and the future regulatory landscape for digital assets. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, staying informed about these high-level diplomatic exchanges is not just about political awareness; it is about understanding the foundational forces that shape the digital economy. The US-China summit crypto implications , though indirect, are undeniably impactful, requiring careful observation of ongoing developments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What was the primary outcome reported from the brief US-China summit? A1: The primary outcome reported was the conclusion of the summit after approximately one hour and forty minutes. Specific details on agreements or breakthroughs were not immediately disclosed, leading to interpretations ranging from efficient discussions to a lack of significant progress. Q2: How do US-China relations generally influence cryptocurrency markets? A2: US-China relations significantly influence global economic stability and investor sentiment. Positive relations can foster confidence, potentially boosting risk assets like crypto. Conversely, tensions can increase market volatility and lead investors to divest from digital assets. The broader economic and regulatory signals emanating from these interactions are key US-China summit crypto implications . Q3: Were specific cryptocurrency regulations discussed during this summit? A3: It is highly unlikely that specific cryptocurrency regulations were a direct agenda item for such a high-level, brief summit. However, broader discussions on economic policy, technological competition (like AI and blockchain), and financial stability can indirectly shape the regulatory environment for digital assets in both nations and globally. Q4: What key indicators should crypto investors monitor after such geopolitical events? A4: Crypto investors should monitor official statements from both governments, updates on trade policies, developments in technological competition (especially concerning blockchain and CBDCs), and the overall reaction of traditional financial markets. These factors provide insights into the long-term US-China summit crypto implications . Q5: Could the brevity of the summit itself have specific crypto implications? A5: Yes, the brevity can lead to differing market interpretations. Some might see it as a sign of unresolved issues, fostering uncertainty and potential volatility in crypto markets. Others might view it as an indication of focused, efficient dialogue that prevents escalation, which could be seen as a positive for overall market stability.

A recent statement from Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer, Faryar Shirzad, sheds crucial light on a significant misunderstanding: banks’ strong hostility toward stablecoins . Shirzad argues that this resistance stems not from a fundamental flaw in stablecoins themselves, but from a basic ignorance of their actual real-world utility and impact. What Are Stablecoins, Really? Demystifying Digital Dollars For many in traditional finance, the term “cryptocurrency” often conjures images of volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, stablecoins are fundamentally different. They are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, or to a commodity such as gold. This pegging makes them a reliable digital equivalent of traditional money, offering the speed and efficiency of blockchain technology without the price swings. Shirzad’s perspective, as reported by Cointelegraph, highlights that the vast majority of demand for these digital assets originates beyond U.S. borders. This crucial detail often gets overlooked, leading to a skewed perception of their purpose and threat level within domestic banking circles. In essence, stablecoins are becoming a global financial utility, not merely a speculative investment tool. Why Do Banks Perceive Stablecoins as a Threat? Unpacking the Concerns The banking sector’s apprehension isn’t entirely unfounded from their viewpoint. U.S. banks recently sent a letter to Congress, expressing significant warnings. They cautioned that the increasing influence of stablecoins could potentially trigger large-scale deposit outflows from traditional banks. Furthermore, they raised concerns about an increase in systemic financial risk, painting a picture of potential instability within the established financial system. However, Shirzad offers a powerful counter-narrative. He asserts that this dynamic actually expands the global dominance of the U.S. dollar, rather than creating direct competition for domestic U.S. banks. Imagine the U.S. dollar, but with superpowers – faster, cheaper, and more accessible for international transactions. This is the role stablecoins are increasingly playing, particularly in regions with less stable local currencies or high remittance costs. Unpacking the Global Impact: How Stablecoins Bolster the Dollar’s Reach The real story of stablecoins unfolds on the international stage. In many emerging markets, individuals and businesses face challenges with volatile local currencies, high inflation, or expensive cross-border payment systems. Here, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin offers a stable, reliable, and efficient alternative. It allows people to save, transact, and send money globally with greater ease and lower fees than traditional banking channels. Facilitating Remittances: Millions of dollars are sent across borders daily. Stablecoins can significantly reduce the cost and time involved in these transfers, directly benefiting families and economies. International Trade: For businesses engaged in global trade, stablecoins provide a faster and more transparent settlement layer, mitigating foreign exchange risks and operational delays. Financial Inclusion: In regions with limited access to traditional banking, stablecoins offer a pathway to digital finance, enabling greater participation in the global economy. This widespread adoption of dollar-backed stablecoins effectively extends the reach and utility of the U.S. dollar, solidifying its status as the world’s reserve currency in the digital age. It’s not about taking deposits from a local U.S. bank branch; it’s about providing a digital conduit for dollar utility worldwide. Bridging the Knowledge Gap: Towards a Clearer Understanding of Stablecoins The core issue appears to be a lack of comprehensive understanding within the traditional banking sector regarding the unique applications and benefits of stablecoins , especially outside the U.S. This knowledge gap can lead to policy decisions based on incomplete information, potentially hindering innovation rather than fostering a robust, integrated financial future. For a truly secure and prosperous financial ecosystem, it’s vital for banks, regulators, and policymakers to engage in constructive dialogue with the digital asset industry. This collaboration can lead to: Informed Regulation: Developing frameworks that manage risks effectively without stifling the legitimate and beneficial uses of stablecoins. Enhanced Services: Exploring how traditional financial institutions can leverage stablecoin technology to improve their own offerings, particularly in cross-border payments. Global Leadership: Ensuring the U.S. maintains its leadership in financial innovation by embracing, rather than resisting, these technological advancements. Ultimately, Faryar Shirzad’s insights from Coinbase underscore a critical point: the perceived threat of stablecoins by banks often stems from an incomplete picture. By understanding their true global utility – particularly in expanding the U.S. dollar’s reach – a path emerges for collaboration rather than conflict. Embracing this innovation could not only strengthen the global financial system but also ensure the continued dominance of the U.S. dollar in the digital era. It’s time to move beyond ignorance and towards informed integration. Frequently Asked Questions About Stablecoins and Banking Q1: What exactly are stablecoins? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar or another stable asset. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, they aim to offer the benefits of blockchain technology with price stability. Q2: Why do traditional banks view stablecoins as a threat? Banks often express concern that the growing popularity of stablecoins could lead to significant deposit outflows from traditional banking institutions. They also worry about potential increases in systemic financial risk, viewing stablecoins as a competitor to their established services. Q3: How do stablecoins contribute to the U.S. dollar’s global dominance? According to Coinbase’s Faryar Shirzad, the majority of demand for stablecoins originates outside the U.S. These dollar-pegged digital assets expand the reach and utility of the U.S. dollar globally, particularly in areas where local currencies are volatile or traditional banking services are expensive, thus reinforcing the dollar’s international standing. Q4: What are some practical uses of stablecoins outside the U.S.? Outside the U.S., stablecoins are widely used for facilitating faster and cheaper international remittances, enabling more efficient cross-border trade, and promoting financial inclusion for individuals without access to traditional banking services. They offer a stable digital medium for transactions and savings. Q5: What is Coinbase’s perspective on the relationship between banks and stablecoins? Coinbase, through its Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad, believes that banks’ hostility towards stablecoins largely stems from a misunderstanding of their real-world applications. Shirzad emphasizes that stablecoins primarily serve global demand and actually enhance the U.S. dollar’s influence, rather than competing directly with domestic U.S. banks.

Cardano (ADA) is battling to hold crucial support, Ethereum (ETH) continues to hover just below $4,000, and traders are searching for the next coin that combines speed, scalability, and substance. Market sentiment is shifting rapidly toward projects demonstrating proven progress and long-term stability. Many believe that the project has already arrived, BlockDAG (BDAG) . With its record-breaking presale, cutting-edge hybrid design, and over 312,000 global holders, BlockDAG is being called the “Bitcoin 2.0” that could lead crypto’s next decade, redefining performance standards, institutional confidence, and long-term network reliability in the process. BlockDAG: Bitcoin’s Evolution for the Utility Generation Bitcoin changed finance forever, but remained limited by slow transaction speeds and scalability. BlockDAG aims to finish what Bitcoin started. It fuses Bitcoin’s PoW security model with DAG technology capable of handling up to 15,000 transactions per second. This combination preserves Bitcoin’s unmatched security while making it efficient enough for real-world use, from instant payments to large-scale enterprise applications. That technical leap is why analysts and early investors now consider BlockDAG the top crypto to buy. It doesn’t discard the principles that made Bitcoin great; it upgrades them for modern utility. Its architecture supports high throughput, low fees, and total transparency, the perfect blend for a market shifting toward functionality and adoption. The project’s presale momentum reinforces that confidence. Nearly $435 million has already been raised, with 27 billion BDAG coins sold to 312,000+ holders worldwide. Currently priced at $0.0015 in Batch 31, the coin is expected to launch at $0.05, creating a massive window for early-stage ROI. With the “TGE” code granting presale access, new buyers can still join before the official listing and Genesis Day event. BlockDAG’s leadership adds another layer of credibility. CEO Antony Turner and advisor Dr. Maurice Herlihy, a Gödel Prize-winning computer scientist, have built an open, doxxed team backed by independent audits from CertiK and Halborn. With 3.5 million X1 mobile miners and 20,000 hardware miners already distributed, BlockDAG is more than a presale; it’s a functioning ecosystem preparing for a massive global rollout. Cardano Support Level Holds, But Buyers Stay Cautious The Cardano (ADA) support level has become a critical technical battleground near $0.62, as traders gauge whether bulls can defend the price from deeper declines. Analysts note that holding this range could trigger a short-term rebound toward $0.70, while a breakdown might drag ADA to $0.55. The $0.60–$0.62 range has now formed a “demand zone,” where traders have consistently stepped in to accumulate tokens. Despite near-term weakness, sentiment around Cardano remains steady. Cardano’s fundamentals are among the strongest in the market, supported by a loyal community that views this consolidation as a natural cooldown after months of volatility. If ADA holds above its current support and Bitcoin stabilizes the broader market, analysts predict a recovery phase could begin by late Q4. Still, many investors are shifting toward utility-driven projects like BlockDAG, drawn by its mix of scalability and transparency, two elements Cardano has struggled to balance at speed. Ethereum Price Update Shows Range-Bound Movement The Ethereum (ETH) price update shows ETH trading around $3,845, struggling to break past $4,100 after brief dips below $3,800. Analysts highlight a narrow consolidation range, suggesting the market is preparing for its next directional move. Key resistance lies between $4,100–$4,300, while support rests at $3,700. Institutional activity remains a stabilizing factor. Ethereum continues to see inflows into staking contracts and increasing on-chain volume as L2 scaling projects like Arbitrum and Optimism expand. However, traders remain cautious amid broader market uncertainty and rotational capital flowing into newer assets with more aggressive ROI potential. Analysts view the current pattern as a “calm before the breakout.” If sentiment improves and Bitcoin resumes its climb, Ethereum could reclaim its previous high near $4,300. For now, ETH remains a cornerstone of stability, but investors searching for asymmetrical growth are eyeing projects like BlockDAG for higher upside. Final Take Cardano (ADA) fights to maintain its support, and Ethereum (ETH) stabilizes below $4,000 as investors seek clarity. Both remain solid, but neither offers the transformative leap that BlockDAG does. Its momentum continues to grow globally. With a high-speed, developer-friendly ecosystem and verified transparency, it’s being called the top crypto to buy for 2025 and the next evolutionary phase beyond Bitcoin itself. BlockDAG isn’t aiming to replace Bitcoin; it’s here to complete what Bitcoin began, a decentralized, secure, and globally usable financial system. For many, this is not just another presale opportunity; it’s the foundation of what could become the 1000x “Bitcoin 2.0” movement.

Ondo Finance Expands To BNB Chain On Wednesday, Ondo Finance announced the expansion of its tokenized securities platform, Ondo Global Markets, to the BNB Chain, aiming to bring tokenized stocks and exchange-traded funds to the blockchain at scale. Since its launch in September, Ondo Global Markets has offered a selection of more than 100 tokenized US stocks and ETFs, surpassing $350 million in total value locked (TVL). Additionally, it has driven over $669 million in total on-chain volume. According to the statement, the integration aims to enable access to the tokenized securities platform’s over 100 tokenized US stocks and ETFs on-chain for BNB Chain’s 3.4 million daily active users and DeFi ecosystem, supported by leading ecosystem projects like PancakeSwap. “By joining BNB Chain’s extensive ecosystem of wallets, exchanges, and DeFi protocols, Ondo tokenized stocks will integrate with key infrastructure partners to expand global access and liquidity for tokenized securities,” the announcement explained. Sarah Song, Head of Business Development at BNB Chain, noted that Real-World Assets (RWAs) are “one of the fastest-growing segments on BNB Chain,” adding that having the tokenized securities platform join the BNB ecosystem “is another strong validation of that momentum.” As reported by Bitcoinist, the BNB Chain, which had a remarkable ecosystem performance over the past few months, recently expanded its RWA ecosystem with a partnership with CMB International Asset Management Limited. Additionally, the BNB Chain joined the Ondo Global Market Alliance in July. “We’re excited to see Ondo Finance utilising BNB Chain to expand access to high-quality financial assets and driving the next wave of adoption that connects traditional markets with blockchain technology,” Song added. Tokenized RWAs Momentum Grows Nathan Allman, Founder and CEO of Ondo Finance, stated that the integration marks a “major step toward making U.S. markets globally accessible through blockchain technology,” as it builds on Ondo’s cross-chain strategy, which already has support live on Ethereum. Notably, Ethereum had an 83.69% share of the total Real-World Asset market cap by chain in August, highlighting the network’s position in RWAs, one of the fastest-growing sectors in the industry. Allman noted that the BNB Chain is “home to one of the largest and most engaged global user bases in Web3,” which will give access to millions of users worldwide to a fast, cost-efficient, and “highly interoperable” environment. Per the statement, Ondo Finance has additional deployments planned to advance its mission to “democratize” access to high-quality US financial assets and ensure tokenized assets move seamlessly across major blockchains. The DeFi platform has solidified its position as a key leader in the real-world asset sector with strategic partnerships and the launch of its own Layer-1 blockchain, which aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance. Ondo Global Markets continues to lead the tokenized securities category in both scale and accessibility. The platform’s momentum reflects growing global appetite for U.S. financial exposure, as investors seek trusted, compliant, and efficient onchain alternatives to traditional intermediaries. It’s worth noting that a White House report from earlier this year recognized the sector as foundational to the future of the global financial system and named the DeFi platform among the key players.",Crypto News|BNB Chain|BNB Chain RWA|Ondo|Ondo Finance|Ondo Global Market|ONDOUSDT|real-world assets|RWA|RWA tokenization|tokenized securities|Tokenized stocks,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BNB|ONDO|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-30 05:00:59

Here’s Why SWIFT Should Worry,https://timestabloid.com/wall-street-is-quitely-moving-in-on-xrp-heres-why-swift-should-worry/,"Crypto enthusiast Diana has drawn attention to a significant transformation occurring within traditional finance — a shift that places XRP at the center of emerging institutional strategies. For years, XRP has been dismissed by traditional banking institutions as a niche digital asset with limited real-world applications. However, Diana emphasized that this perception is changing as Wall Street and major financial entities begin building infrastructure around the asset. According to her analysis, the reason for this renewed interest lies in the inefficiencies of the existing global payments network. The SWIFT system, which handles over $5 trillion in daily transactions, remains burdened by slow settlement times, high costs, and reliance on multiple intermediaries. Ripple’s payment technology, on the other hand, enables instant cross-border transfers using XRP as a bridge asset. This operational efficiency, Diana explained, transforms how liquidity is managed, converting idle or delayed capital into immediately usable funds. WALL STREET IS QUIETLY MOVING IN ON XRP — AND SWIFT SHOULD BE WORRIED For years, $XRP was brushed off as “the banker’s coin.” It was too early, too different, and too fast for the old guard to understand. But now, those same institutions that once ignored it… are quietly… pic.twitter.com/VpuN2TdEHE — Diana (@InvestWithD) October 26, 2025 Institutional Moves Signal Confidence Diana noted that several established asset managers are positioning themselves early. Firms such as Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Bitwise, and WisdomTree have already submitted applications for XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Their involvement mirrors the early institutional activity that preceded Bitcoin ETF approvals, a development that led to billions of dollars in inflows and elevated market legitimacy. In her view, these firms are anticipating a similar trajectory for XRP and are taking early positions before broader retail recognition follows. This institutional confidence aligns with Ripple’s broader corporate strategy. Diana highlighted that Ripple has expanded beyond payments into full-scale financial infrastructure. The acquisition of GTreasury , which grants Ripple access to the $120 trillion corporate liquidity market, is one example. Additionally, Ripple’s purchase and rebranding of Hidden Road into Ripple Prime positions it as a comprehensive institutional brokerage platform. Complementing these moves, Ripple’s introduction of its stablecoin RLUSD serves as a regulated collateral function, further strengthening its presence in global finance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Growing Role in Global Settlements Diana pointed out that Ripple’s long-term objective is not to compete with banks directly but to become the system banks rely upon for faster and cheaper settlements. Market analysts cited in her post suggest Ripple could capture between 10% and 15% of SWIFT’s transaction volume within five years. This projection represents between $500 billion and $750 billion per day, potentially moving through Ripple’s infrastructure with XRP facilitating these settlements. She concluded that while retail investors continue to debate potential price movements, the larger transformation is unfolding within institutional finance. Ripple’s network is increasingly viewed as an alternative foundation for global transactions. As Diana summarized, both Wall Street and SWIFT appear aware of this shift — and Ripple is already implementing it. At a time when traditional payment systems struggle to modernize, Diana’s observation suggests the real momentum behind XRP may now rest in the hands of the institutions once least expected to embrace it.

It rose to a high of $0.2918, up by 87% from its lowest level this month. This article explores why the Pi crypto jumped and what to expect in the near term. Why the Pi Network price jumped The value of Pi jumped by over 80% from its lowest level this year for several reasons. First, the rally was in line with the broader crypto market jump as traders waited for the Federal Reserve interest rate decision and the meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping at the APEC Summit. Economists were expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates based on the recent macro data on the labor market and inflation. A report released on Friday showed that the headline Consumer Price Index rose to 3.0% in September from 2.9 % in August, while core inflation fell to 3.0%. Another report had shown the economy lost over 36,000 jobs in September, a trend that will continue after companies like Target and Amazon said that they would fire thousands of workers. These numbers, and the previous statement from Fed officials, confirmed that the bank would cut rates. Second, the Pi Network price rose after rumors that Pi had received an ISO certification alongside other cryptocurrencies like Ripple and Stellar. Such a move would be good news for the token as it would take it mainstream and simplify its interoperability with the banking sector. It would also push more exchanges to list it.

Is Pi Coin a good token to buy? Pi Network is a high-risk and high-reward token. Its high risk comes from the fact that it has not achieved its original goal of creating a universal payment solution better than Bitcoin. Pi Network has a small and relatively inactive ecosystem, unlocks millions of tokens a day, is highly centralized, has no roadmap, and is not listed by exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. These major challenges are also the biggest opportunities that may lead to a Pi Network price surge. For example, there is a slim chance that at least one major crypto exchange will list it, a move that would push it up by double or triple digits. Additionally, the developers can announce a major token burn event to offset the ongoing token unlocks. Such a move would be bullish as we saw with the recent OKB price surge. Pi Network price would also surge if the developers came up with a roadmap and a strategy to fuel decentralization. In the current phase, the network is highly centralized, with the obscure Pi Network Foundation controlling over 90 billion tokens. A commitment to decentralization would likely push it higher by raising the odds of more exchange listings.

Whereas, AI-focused miner TeraWulf announced a $500 million fundraise, and Binance unveiled a transparency partnership with Bubblemaps. The Federal Reserve’s rate cut to 4.00% from 4.25% added short-term volatility, with traders eyeing $108,900 as Bitcoin’s key support zone. Germany’s Opposition Pushes to Recognize Bitcoin as National Asset The largest opposition party of Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD), has proposed recognizing BTC as a strategic national asset. It’s urging policymakers to separate it from other cryptocurrencies under the EU’s MiCA regulatory framework. The motion argues that excessive regulation could stifle innovation and weaken Germany’s position in digital finance. It calls for maintaining VAT exemptions, protecting citizens’ right to self-custody, and preserving the 12-month tax exemption for Bitcoin profits, a rule that currently benefits long-term holders.

If only Germany kept their Seized Bitcoin back in January 2024 pic.twitter.com/0zJvvxrdOa — CryptoChatter (@crypto_chatter1) October 29, 2025 AfD lawmakers also suggested that Germany consider adding Bitcoin to its national reserves, similar to how central banks hold gold. The proposal echoes recent debates in France, where legislators are pushing for more crypto-friendly policies to attract investment and strengthen Europe’s blockchain sector. Investors interpreted the move as a sign of growing political acceptance for Bitcoin across Europe. The news supported a modest price uptick, as traders bet that broader institutional recognition could follow if the motion gains traction in Berlin. TeraWulf Shifts From Bitcoin Mining to AI With $500M Fundraise Bitcoin miner TeraWulf plans to raise $500 million through a convertible note offering to build a new AI-focused data center in Abernathy, Texas. The notes, due in 2032, may expand by another $75 million depending on demand. The funds will support the company’s pivot from Bitcoin mining to AI infrastructure, leveraging its existing energy and hardware assets to meet surging demand for GPU-powered computing. This follows TeraWulf’s previous $3 billion financing round with Morgan Stanley, a $1.4 billion Google guarantee, and a $3.7 billion hosting deal with Google-backed Fluidstack. Investors see the shift as a strategic diversification move, strengthening the long-term stability of crypto mining firms amid changing market dynamics. Bitcoin prices edged slightly higher following the announcement, as traders viewed TeraWulf’s AI transition as a positive signal for broader industry adaptation. Binance and Bubblemaps Join Forces to Expose Insider Trading Binance has partnered with blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps to boost transparency and detect insider trading. The integration allows Binance Web3 Wallet users to visualize token distribution and identify suspicious wallet connections using Bubblemaps’ interactive “bubble” interface.

Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Bulls Defend $108,900 as RSI Turns Oversold Bitcoin price prediction is bearish as BTC is hovering near $108,850, holding just above key support at $108,900, which aligns with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement. The level has acted as a reliable demand zone in recent weeks. Price action shows a double-top near $117,700 followed by a correction, with bulls now defending the ascending channel’s lower boundary from early October. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Multiple long lower wicks on the 4-hour chart signal aggressive dip-buying, even as the 50-EMA flattens. The RSI near 31 indicates oversold conditions, often a precursor to a technical rebound. A daily close above $110,700 could trigger recovery toward $112,200–$114,950, while a break below $108,900 may expose $106,100–$103,500. Traders favor long positions above $109,000, targeting $114,950, as oversold momentum hints at a potential rebound into November. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana?

Instead of focusing on Ripple (XRP), traders are turning their interest to three very successful projects: Solana, Hyperliquid and Remittix (RTX) . Each of these tokens is capturing market confidence through innovation, institutional growth, and real-world utility. As capital rotates, analysts believe this trio could lead the next bullish wave and outperform Ripple in the ongoing crypto cycle. Solana Gains Momentum As Traders Bet On Altcoins To Beat Ripple Solana (SOL) is emerging as one of the top contenders in the new market rotation as traders back it to outperform Ripple (XRP) this cycle. SOL price today hovers around $198, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, as optimism surges following the launch of Grayscale’s Solana staking ETF (GSOL). The new ETF offers institutional investors both exposure and staking rewards, solidifying Solana’s place as a leader in the altcoin space. Analysts tracking Solana price prediction models note that the token’s consolidation near $200 could mark a pivotal moment. If SOL price should close above $202, the next target on the upside is around $214-$225. On-chain metrics show steady accumulation. This suggests traders are quietly positioning for a breakout. Momentum remains positive, backed by institutional inflows and robust support above $187. With ETF access, liquidity, and strong technicals aligning, Solana’s trajectory looks increasingly bullish. Hyperliquid Price Today Surges As ETF Filing Boosts Sentiment Hyperliquid (HYPE) is capturing trader attention after a sharp 110% rebound since its October crash. The HYPE price today sits near $49 after breaking out from a descending wedge, a pattern often signaling trend reversals. This surge, paired with an ETF filing by 21Shares, has reignited optimism across Hyperliquid news circles. Analysts believe the HYPE price prediction could soon test the $50 mark, a key resistance before new highs. With growing institutional exposure and solid technicals, Hyperliquid price momentum mirrors rising confidence seen in Solana and Ethereum as it is expected to outperform Ripple (XRP) this cycle. Remittix Rises As Traders Bet On It To Outperform XRP Remittix (RTX) is quickly emerging as one of the most promising payment-focused crypto projects this cycle. While most tokens remain speculative, Remittix is solving a real financial problem turning crypto into cash instantly. It enables users to send digital assets directly to any bank account in over 30 countries without high fees or long waits. Analysts say this real-world use case gives Remittix an edge over Ripple (XRP) in the payments arena. Facilitates instant crypto-to-fiat transfers with over 40 supported assets Global coverage in 30+ countries for fast and direct payments Verified by CertiK and ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens Beta testing live ahead of public release Remittix has already surpassed $27.7 million raised, securing listings on BitMart and LBank.

The dispute follows Trump’s controversial pardon of Zhao, which some critics linked to a $2 billion Binance investment tied to Trump’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. At the same time, Zhao warned investors not to buy a new “CZ Statue” meme coin that was launched in his likeness, calling it a cash grab. CZ Prepares to Sue Warren Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao is reportedly preparing to file a libel lawsuit against US Senator Elizabeth Warren over what his legal team claims are false and defamatory remarks linking him to bribery and corruption surrounding his recent presidential pardon by Donald Trump. According to a report from the New York Post, Zhao’s attorney, Teresa Goody Guillén of Baker & Hostetler, confirmed that the former Binance chief intends to pursue legal action unless Warren retracts statements that were made in an Oct. 23 post on X . In the post, the Massachusetts senator alleged that Zhao “pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge” and suggested that he bribed Trump in exchange for clemency. The post is still live, but now includes some reader-added context, which caused widespread backlash in both political and crypto circles. Zhao’s legal team maintains that Warren’s claims are inaccurate and damaging. In November of 2023, Zhao pleaded guilty to one count of failing to maintain an adequate Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program at Binance. This is a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, but not money laundering itself. \He served a four-month prison sentence earlier in 2024. Goody Guillén explained that Zhao “will not remain silent while a United States Senator seemingly misuses the office to repeatedly publish defamatory statements that impugn his reputation,” and said that he is demanding an immediate retraction both on social media and in the official congressional resolution that allegedly references the same claims. The controversy follows Trump’s unexpected decision to pardon Zhao on Oct. 23, which quickly drew sharp criticism from lawmakers. Some accused the president of favoring Zhao after an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm reportedly injected $2 billion into Binance using the USD1 stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial — a crypto venture tied to Trump’s family. Warren later claimed that Zhao “financed President Trump’s stablecoin,” calling the situation “corruption.” X post from CZ Zhao, however, denied the allegations by saying Warren “can’t get her facts right.” This isn’t the first time CZ took legal action against media outlets over defamation. In 2022, he threatened to sue Bloomberg Businessweek over a Chinese-language report calling Binance a Ponzi scheme, which was later retracted with an apology and a charitable settlement. CZ Warns Against New Meme Coin CZ currently has his hands quite full trying to defend his honor. He recently warned crypto investors against buying a new meme coin that was created to exploit his name and image, warning that such projects often pose serious financial risks. The warning came after a fan page unveiled a golden statue of Zhao and announced plans to send it to him, which quickly inspired the launch of a so-called CZ-themed “golden statue” token. In a post on X on Wednesday, Zhao said that while he appreciated the gesture, the existence of a token tied to it suggested that the creators were trying to profit from his reputation rather than contribute anything meaningful to the blockchain ecosystem. “While I want to appreciate the gesture, the fact that there is a meme coin associated with this means the creator probably just wanted to make a quick buck off an interaction from me,” Zhao wrote. “This is something I don’t appreciate. Don’t buy the meme.” CZ statue His warning definitely sent a message to investors as the token, known as CZ STATUE (CZ STATUE), lost 86% of its value within hours of launch after briefly hitting a market cap of about $5.1 million, according to data from Nansen . The analytics firm also flagged the token’s distribution as a potential red flag, as more than 15% of the supply was held by a newly created wallet—an indicator of possible insider activity and poor transparency. Many of these kinds of tokens have no technical substance or long-term purpose beyond social hype, making them highly volatile and often short-lived. Earlier this month, Binance Smart Chain meme coins briefly created new crypto millionaires during a speculative frenzy that ended with a record $19 billion liquidation event, wiping out much of the market’s short-term gains. In one example , a trader turned $3,000 into $2 million after a previous X post from Zhao boosted a BNB-based meme coin—which perfectly proves how sentiment can drive massive but unsustainable profits in meme coins.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-30 05:30:00

Hougan said that an XRP ETF “could easily reach $1 billion in size within the first few months.” Hougan argued that this forecast would far exceed the expectations of those wary of XRP: “People underestimate XRP because the median opinion in the crypto world is generally negative. But it is the community that buys the asset that determines the flow of funds, and the XRP Army is extremely passionate and loves XRP.” There are currently approximately 20 XRP ETF applications pending approval with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This number is just behind Bitcoin and Solana's 23 applications. Ethereum has 16 applications, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. Balchunas predicts that the number of crypto assets with ETFs will surpass 200 within the next 12 months. Just yesterday, Bitwise's new Solana ETF launched, making a strong debut. Related News: First Expert Commentary on the Fed Interest Rate Decision and Powell's Speech: Here's What You Need to Know According to on-chain analytics platform Santiment, large investors purchased approximately $560 million worth of XRP in the past week. These purchases coincide with the approaching SEC decision dates on three XRP ETF applications. According to Hougan, an ETF doesn't need the general approval of the crypto community to be successful; what matters is a base of buyers willing to invest capital. “The XRP Army has shown incredible commitment despite years of regulatory uncertainty. Funding flows will therefore be much higher than many expected. ETFs die of lack of interest; that will not be the case with XRP.” Hougan noted that many altcoins, despite being technically strong, don't have as passionate a community as XRP. Conversely, XRP stands out for its user loyalty despite criticisms of its centralization. Criticisms of XRP often focus on Ripple's control over the token supply, its centralized structure, and its corporate partnerships. However, Hougan argues that these criticisms miss the core dynamic: demand: “Institutional adoption requires clear buyer demand, not approval from the crypto-native community.

The IPO would take place as early as next year, Axios said citing unnamed sources. Consensys IPO Ambitions Follow MetaMask Token Tout Consensys’ best-known product, MetaMask, which serves as a digital crypto wallet, recently reignited speculation hinting that a long-awaited token airdrop could be imminent . It also announced a $30 million rewards initiative designed to incentivize users for on-chain activity. In September, Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin confirmed that MetaMask would launch its native token “ sooner than you would expect .” Additionally, the wallet provider teased an upcoming integration with prediction market – Polymarket. Apart from MetaMask, Consensys also backs Ethereum treasury management firm SharpLink. It has also notably supported the development of node infra service Infura and Layer 2 network Linea. “Exploring Opportunities” After Clearing Regulatory Hurdles In February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notified Consensys that it would drop its lawsuit against MetaMask for providing staking functionality, clearing a key regulatory hurdle. The lawsuit claimed that the San Francisco-based organization was acting as an unregistered broker of securities while collecting over $250 million in fees through staking programs. A Consensys spokesperson told Decrypt that the company is “constantly exploring opportunities” to expand its foothold. “While we continuously evaluate strategic options for growth, we have nothing to announce at this time,” the spokesperson added when asked about the planned listing.

Founded in 2017, Chicago-based Zerohash provides the plumbing that lets fintechs, brokers and merchants add crypto, stablecoin and tokenization features via APIs, including compliant custody, conversions and payouts. Bringing that stack in-house would give Mastercard more direct control over how fiat funding and digital assets settle across its rails, a priority as banks and payment companies experiment with 24/7 money. Mastercard Joins Stripe and Coinbase in Bidding for the Future of Tokenized Money If completed, the acquisition would be one of Mastercard’s biggest bets on stablecoins, reflecting a broader shift as large payment providers look to blockchains for faster cross-border transfers and lower operating costs. The company has already rolled out on- and off-ramp services with crypto partners and piloted programs that translate crypto balances into spendable fiat at the point of sale. According to Fortune, Mastercard is in talks to acquire crypto infrastructure startup Zerohash for between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. Zerohash builds stablecoin and crypto trading infrastructure, including tokenization APIs and other services for institutional clients. If… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 29, 2025 The competitive backdrop is heating up. Stripe recently bought stablecoin infrastructure firm Bridge in a deal reported around $1.1b, while Coinbase has been in advanced talks to acquire London-based BVNK in what could become the largest pure-play stablecoin acquisition to date. Those moves signal a race to secure enterprise-grade issuers, compliance tooling and payout networks before stablecoin volumes migrate from trading venues into mainstream payments. Zerohash’s White-Label Model Gives Mastercard Ready Infrastructure for Crypto Access For Mastercard, Zerohash could accelerate stablecoin settlement for corporate and marketplace flows, and help the network offer programmable payouts that match crypto’s always-on cadence. Banks are also testing tokenized deposits and on-chain treasury tools, creating demand for intermediaries that can bridge fiat accounts, compliance checks and public chains without forcing merchants to rebuild their stacks. Zerohash has raised capital from financial incumbents and market-structure investors, and has positioned itself as a white-label provider that lets regulated firms add crypto features without taking on direct custody risk. Folding that capability into a global scheme could shorten integration timelines for merchants and fintechs that already process through Mastercard. Patchy Networks and Varying Compliance Rules Still Slow Stablecoin Integration The push comes as stablecoins gain traction with corporates for payroll, treasury and cross-border supplier payments, thanks to near-instant settlement and transparent ledgers. But the infrastructure remains patchy, with fragmentation across chains, compliance regimes and cash-out options. Consolidation by large processors and banks is aimed at standardizing those rails. Neither Mastercard nor Zero Hash has publicly confirmed the terms. A final agreement, if reached, would underline how quickly crypto payments are moving from experiments to core product road maps at the world’s biggest payment companies.

This rapid wipeout is a stark reminder of the inherent volatility in digital asset trading. Over the last 24 hours, the total figure swelled to an alarming $813 million. These events underscore the high stakes involved in leveraged trading and the swift shifts that can occur in market sentiment. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Happen? For those new to the space, understanding crypto futures liquidations is crucial. Futures contracts allow traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. Many traders use leverage, borrowing funds to amplify their potential gains. However, leverage also magnifies potential losses. Margin Call Trigger: A liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin (the collateral they put up) falls below a certain threshold. This usually happens due to a sharp, unfavorable price movement in the underlying asset. Forced Closure: Exchanges automatically close these leveraged positions to prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange. This forced closure is what we call a liquidation. Market Impact: Large-scale liquidations, like the $167 million seen recently, can create a cascading effect, pushing prices further in the direction of the initial move. This can trap more traders in similar situations, leading to even more liquidations. The Immediate Impact: Who Felt the Brunt of These Crypto Futures Liquidations? The recent wave of crypto futures liquidations didn’t discriminate, affecting both long and short positions, though the majority of the pain was felt by those betting on price increases. When the market makes a sharp move, traders on the wrong side of that move face significant losses. This event highlights the precarious nature of leveraged positions. A sudden price swing, often triggered by a major news event, a whale movement, or even a technical breakdown, can quickly erode margin and lead to forced selling. This cycle can be brutal for individual traders who are caught off guard. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Traders In a market prone to such dramatic swings, how can traders protect themselves from significant crypto futures liquidations ? It’s not just about predicting the next move, but also about managing risk effectively. Here are some actionable insights: Understand Leverage: Always be aware of the leverage ratio you are using. Higher leverage means higher risk of liquidation. Consider starting with lower leverage, especially if you are new to futures trading. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These are essential tools. A stop-loss order automatically closes your position if the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses before a full liquidation occurs. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your capital into highly leveraged futures contracts. Balance your portfolio with less volatile assets or spot holdings. Monitor Market Sentiment: Stay informed about market news, technical analysis, and overall sentiment. Sudden shifts can precede major price movements. Manage Your Emotions: The cryptocurrency market can be emotionally taxing. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or greed, especially during periods of high volatility. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Futures Liquidations? The recent $167 million in crypto futures liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the market’s dynamic nature. Such events are not uncommon in the fast-paced world of digital assets. They often precede periods of increased volatility or consolidation as the market digests the sudden shifts. For regulators, these incidents fuel ongoing discussions about consumer protection and risk management in the crypto space. For traders, they reinforce the importance of a well-thought-out strategy, prudent risk management, and a deep understanding of the instruments they are trading. The market will continue to evolve, but the principles of sound trading remain constant. Conclusion: Learning from Market Shocks The recent $167 million worth of futures liquidated in a single hour is a significant event that reverberates through the crypto community. It underscores the incredible speed at which wealth can be created or lost in leveraged trading. While such dramatic events can be daunting, they also offer invaluable lessons about risk management, market dynamics, and the importance of continuous learning. By adopting a disciplined approach and prioritizing capital preservation, traders can better navigate the unpredictable currents of the cryptocurrency market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly causes crypto futures liquidations? A1: Liquidations are primarily caused by sharp, unfavorable price movements against a leveraged position. When a trader’s margin (collateral) falls below a certain threshold set by the exchange, their position is automatically closed to prevent further losses. Q2: Are large liquidations common in the crypto market? A2: Yes, large-scale liquidations are relatively common in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market, especially during periods of significant price swings or major news events. They can often create a cascading effect. Q3: How can I protect myself from crypto futures liquidations? A3: Key strategies include using lower leverage, consistently setting stop-loss orders, diversifying your portfolio, staying informed about market conditions, and managing your emotional responses to market fluctuations. Q4: Do liquidations only affect individual traders? A4: While individual traders bear the direct financial loss, large-scale liquidations can also impact overall market sentiment and price action, potentially leading to further volatility across the broader crypto market. Q5: What’s the difference between a ‘long’ and ‘short’ liquidation? A5: A ‘long’ liquidation happens when a trader betting on a price increase (going long) sees the price drop significantly. A ‘short’ liquidation occurs when a trader betting on a price decrease (going short) sees the price rise sharply. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

The trade negotiations between the two nations have severely impacted BTC’s price in the past. Recall the events that transpired when Trump announced a new set of tariffs on October 10 and bitcoin’s immediate plunge from over $121,000 to under $110,000 on most exchanges. Earlier today, the asset had dumped below $108,000 for the first time in a week, which was rather surprising given the Fed’s rate cut announced yesterday. Nevertheless, BTC bounced off to over $110,000 as of press time when the US-China deal news went live. Still, BTC’s plunge on a daily scale has liquidated more than $360 million in bitcoin-related longs, while the overall wrecked positions across the entire market are worth over $800 million, according to CoinGlass.

According to the Federation of Small Businesses, nearly 33% of small companies expect to downsize, sell, or shut down next year, with only 18% anticipating expansion. The group attributed the gloomy prognosis to a combination of weak growth, high taxation, and rising employment costs. Falling optimism could lead to reduced spending and investment in the run-up to the budget. Tina McKenzie, policy chair at the FSB, explained, “Millions of small businesses shrinking, closing, or selling up instead of growing means a vicious cycle of a lower tax take, higher unemployment, and greater demands on the state, all exacerbating each other in a downward spiral.” This comes as ambiguities around taxation in the run-up to the UK budget are likely to weigh on homebuilding for the next six months, pushing the government further away from achieving its housing target. *]:pointer-events-auto [content-visibility:auto] supports-[content-visibility:auto]:[contain-intrinsic-size:auto_100lvh] scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:d93b63b8-a55f-491a-9f1c-93d7299acc82-9"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-4"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> Over 40% of developers anticipate housing starts to decline through the final quarter of 2025 as firms delay decisions until after the Nov. 26 budget, according to a survey of more than 60 homebuilders by Knight Frank. The broker warned that budget uncertainty will likely continue affecting development into 2026, as delays in tax clarity further prolong the already lengthy housebuilding process. The IoD reported a score of minus 74 on its business confidence index for September According to a survey of approximately 1,500 business owners, the picture remains bleak, with insolvencies in the first nine months of 2025 roughly matching those of 2023, which reached a three-decade high . The majority of insolvencies were voluntary liquidations; however, this indicates that many small businesses are opting to close due to ongoing financial pressure. It is not just entrepreneurs who are preparing to bear an even heavier tax burden. The whole working population faces this risk. When asked about the possibility of higher taxes, Prime Minister Keir Starmer did not rule out a rise in income tax, an increase in national insurance contributions, or even a rise in VAT level, all of which indicate that the government may have to revisit its manifesto commitments on balancing the books. In September, business executives had warned of a decline in confidence across the business sector. Anna Leach, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors (IoD), noted: “Business confidence has plumbed new depths in September, following a fleeting improvement at the tag-end of summer. Conditions worsened across the board, with cost expectations hitting a record high, driven notably by employment costs.” At the time, she appealed to Chancellor Rachel Reeves to deliver a pro-growth budget in November that prioritizes businesses. The IoD’s analysis showed that for the month, the main reason for the slipping outlook was increasingly rising wage costs. An overwhelming 83% of business leaders attribute the decline in confidence to the rise in labour costs. Overall, the industry group reported a September reading of minus 74 on its business confidence index. The BoE had warned that high inflation may persist in the coming months The Bank of England had stated that the cooling of inflation could be more gradual than expected and persist well into 2026, primarily due to food price pressures. Clare Lombardelli, the Bank’s deputy governor, warned that policymakers should not think inflation shocks will fade quickly. Although inflation is still high, Catherine Mann, a member of the monetary policy committee (MPC), believes there’s still a chance for more rate cuts . She remarked that “an inflation persistence scenario is playing out.” However, she voted against the BoE’s interest rate cut in August. Nonetheless, MPC member Sarah Breeden anticipates that it’s unlikely the current inflationary pressures will continue into 2026. She added that there was no reason to believe that the disinflationary momentum from earlier price shocks had weakened.

However, market analyst Crypto Birb has identified ten indicators suggesting a potential surge may be on the horizon. Bitcoin Price Holds Above Key Moving Averages At the time of the expert’s post, BTC traded at $112,000. He pointed that with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) gaining traction and market fear subsiding, the Bitcoin price appears to be consolidating before a significant upward movement, indicating that a breakout is imminent. Currently, the Bitcoin price trades comfortably above the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) of $102,934 and the 200-week SMA of $54,756. The correlation with the S&P 500 stands at -0.02, suggesting that Bitcoin’s movements are largely independent of broader equity market trends. Related Reading: HYPE Nears All-Time High With HyperEVM Integration, Can Buybacks Sustain the Rally? On the daily chart, Bitcoin is supported by the 200-day SMA at $109,267 and a key trend line at $113,100. The relative strength index (RSI) is neutral at 50, while the average true range (ATR) has decreased to 3,495, indicating a calmer market environment. In terms of short-term bias, the market shows balance but is not bullish yet. The CTF Trailer indicates a bearish mode with a stop at $115,623, while the higher time frame trailer reflects a bullish mode with a stop at $114,601. Currently, Bitcoin’s trading range is between $110,000 and $117,800, and this compression indicates that an equilibrium is forming. The next significant movement is expected to occur once this range is broken. Calm Before The Storm? Sentiment within the market appears balanced, with the Fear & Greed Index sitting at 51, which reflects a neutral stance. Crypto Birb asserts that emotions have reset following last week’s spike in fear, creating a stable environment for sustainable price movements. Volatility is also cooling off, with a 50-day volatility of 3,080 and an ATR of 3,495. This contraction in trading range suggests that traders are reloading positions rather than capitulating, and history shows that periods of calm consolidation often precede volatility shocks. On the mining front, the economic landscape is looking favorable, with mining costs at $106,400 and a ratio of 0.94, indicating that miners remain moderately profitable after last week’s compression. Stable costs suggest no immediate pressure for forced selling, and network fundamentals remain solid. Looking at the October outlook, the month-to-date performance shows a minor decline of 0.53%, which is still an improvement over the typical historic October average of 19.78%. This suggests a healthy reset within an otherwise strong seasonal backdrop. A Potential 51% Surge Ahead? The expert further highlighted that historically, the fourth quarter has been bullish for the Bitcoin price, with an average gain of 51.04% over the past 15 years, resulting in nine winning years. If the current structure holds, Q4 is poised to remain a high-probability accumulation zone.

The total assets under management have reached $24.88 billion, and rising liquidity in altcoins complements the ongoing flows into Bitcoin, supporting a narrative of market rotation. At the time of writing, however, the Bitcoin price has retraced back towards $110,439. Yet, still inside its current consolidation range that could result in a new uptrend for the leading crypto.

53811166,616873,1761804046,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53811166.jpeg,Bitcoin Beats The Euro — France Chooses Crypto Over CBDC,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-beats-the-euro-france-chooses-crypto-over-cbdc/,"France’s National Assembly moved to block European Central Bank’s planned digital euro and to favor Bitcoin and euro stablecoins. Based on reports , the resolution was filed on October 22, 2025 by Éric Ciotti and UDR members. Call For A National Bitcoin Reserve The motion asks for a public body to build a strategic Bitcoin holding equal to 2% of the total supply — about 420,000 BTC — over seven to eight years. Funding ideas include using surplus energy to mine, retaining seized Bitcoin, and sending a slice of Livret A and LDDS savings to daily BTC purchases. The plan would allow tax payments in Bitcoin if constitutional checks approve it. Supporters say a centrally run digital currency could let authorities track and freeze people’s money, and they compared the plan to China’s digital yuan. They warned a digital euro might let users move deposits straight to the ECB and weaken banks, raising the risk of shifts that could destabilize lenders. The ECB began a preparation phase in November 2023 and expects that phase to end by the end of 2025; officials say circulation could start around 2029, according to Piero Cipollone. Euro Stablecoins And Market Size The motion presses for stronger euro-denominated stablecoins to cut dependence on dollar tokens. According to IMF data cited in the proposal, 91% of stablecoin market capitalization — roughly $210 billion of $230 billion — is dollar-based, while the largest euro stablecoin is about $259 million. Lawmakers want MiCA rules adjusted so European banks and companies can issue euro tokens more easily. Calls To Adjust Banking Rules As part of the package, the resolution seeks a lighter touch on Basel prudential rules that now treat some crypto-backed loans as highly risky and impose capital buffers up to 1,250%. Backers say those rules discourage crypto-collateral lending and want a “targeted deviation” to encourage bank participation. France has opened doors to more regulated crypto work. The AMF approved BPCE’s Hexarq for custody and trading, and Lise, a tokenized equity platform, got a DLT Pilot Regime green light. Based on Chainalysis, France processed about $180 billion in crypto flows from July 2024 to June 2025, placing it among Europe’s busiest markets. The proposal faces legal and political tests, but it makes clear France aims to shape how digital money works in Europe. The debate is expected to draw intense public attention.

Weekly Golden Cross Has Officially Formed,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-strap-up-weekly-golden-cross-has-officially-formed/,"In a recent post on X, Crypto analyst ChartNerd shared a weekly golden cross formed on the Stochastic Relative Strength Index for XRP . According to the analyst’s chart, the indicator’s fast and slow lines have crossed upward on the weekly timeframe — a technical event the analyst associates with significant upward price momentum when it has occurred previously. ChartNerd emphasized the formation as a noteworthy signal for holders and traders, given the historical context shown on the same chart. $XRP Holders, strap up! A weekly golden cross has now officially formed on the weekly Stoch RSI On the last 2 occasions, $XRP witnessed HUGE rallies: 1) Nov 2024 = 500% increase. 2) April 2025 = 128% increase. 3) October 2025 = ??? Increase. I wouldn't fade this signal https://t.co/Yts6qSLjZB pic.twitter.com/xG4CVnLkhP — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 27, 2025 Historical moves cited as precedent The chart presented by ChartNerd identifies two prior instances on the weekly Stoch RSI where a similar bullish crossover preceded large rallies. The first instance is shown around November 2024, which the analyst links to a multi-hundred percent increase that followed. The second instance, marked in April 2025 on the chart, is associated with a more modest but still substantial advance. ChartNerd used these precedents to suggest that the current weekly crossover warrants attention due to the correlation between the indicator’s previous signals and subsequent price behavior. Current Implications and Market Sentiment ChartNerd framed the current signal as one that should not be ignored. The analyst suggested that fading the weekly Stoch RSI golden cross could be risky, based on the prior outcomes illustrated. The attached chart also includes highlighted zones where the indicator reached lower levels before reversing, reinforcing the analyst’s interpretation that the weekly setup may be an early confirmation of renewed upside momentum. A secondary commentator, using the handle DailyDoseYos, echoed that sentiment, expressing confidence in the signal and a positive long-term view of the asset . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What this means for traders and holders ChartNerd focused on the technical setup rather than fundamental drivers, positioning the weekly Stoch RSI golden cross as a timing signal that has historically coincided with large moves. The analyst did not prescribe a specific price target or trading strategy on the chart; however, the emphasis was on the repeatability of the indicator’s behavior and the potential for significant upside if the pattern unfolds similarly. Observers are therefore being invited to monitor weekly momentum readings and price action closely rather than relying on short-term oscillations. ChartNerd’s presentation is strictly technical in nature: it reports a repeatable indicator pattern, shows two historical instances where that pattern aligned with notable rallies, and highlights the current weekly crossover as a condition that market participants should consider when forming positions.

The decision came despite the country experiencing inflation levels exceeding the central bank’s 2% goal for 41 consecutive months. The Bank of Japan revealed that the vote was not unanimous, with a 7-2 split among board members. Two officials, Naoki Tamura and Hajime Takata, pushed for a quarter-point increase instead. Financial markets showed limited response to the announcement, which had been widely anticipated. Japanese government bonds with 10-year terms saw almost no change in their yields. Krishna Bhimavarapu, who works as an APAC economist at State Street Investment Management, wrote in a statement following the announcement that chances have grown for a rate increase during one of the next two policy meetings. This would happen after officials get a better read on worldwide trade uncertainties. “Nonetheless, the Bank is still likely to move only gradually in the next year as well,” she added as quoted by CNBC. The timing of this decision holds particular significance given recent diplomatic exchanges. On Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent held talks with Satsuki Katayama, who serves as finance minister in Takaichi’s government. Bessent appeared to criticize Tokyo regarding the yen’s declining value and made observations about Japan’s monetary approach. A statement released by the US Treasury Department on Tuesday said Bessent “highlighted the important role of sound monetary policy formulation and communication in anchoring inflation expectations and preventing excess exchange rate volatility.” Typically, raising interest rates makes a currency stronger by attracting money from other countries, while cutting rates has the opposite effect. Currency weakness persists The yen’s decline of more than 3% against the dollar this month makes it the worst performer among G-10 currencies. Markets are factoring in Takaichi’s preference for easy monetary policy and increased government spending. With the yen still considered undervalued and domestic price increases running high, the possibility of a rate hike in the near future remains. Growth strategy minister Minoru Kiuchi recently stated he will continue watching how the weak yen affects the economy. As reported by Cryptopolitan , Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda indicated earlier this month that the central bank will keep normalizing policy if confidence in meeting its economic projections grows stronger. Trump administration raises currency concerns The falling yen has become a source of friction with US President Donald Trump. In March, Trump claimed Tokyo had deliberately weakened its currency to gain unfair advantages in trade. Trump has met with Takaichi, who previously supported keeping interest rates low and once described the Bank of Japan’s rate increases as “stupid.” Though Takaichi seems to have moderated her position, efforts to make the yen stronger clash with her proposals for large-scale government spending and relaxed monetary conditions. “What’s most important is for the BOJ and government to coordinate policy and communicate closely,” Takaichi said on Oct. 21, according to Reuters. Observers view Takaichi as a supporter of “Abenomics,” the economic approach used by the late Shinzo Abe that combined easy monetary policy, government spending, and structural changes. On Wednesday, Bessent posted on X that “the government’s willingness to allow the Bank of Japan policy space will be key to anchoring inflation expectations.” Katayama stated in March that the yen’s actual value should probably be around 120-130 against the dollar, roughly 26% higher than current levels near 152. According to specialists, Takaichi’s policies will likely push the yen’s value down. This has already occurred through what traders call the “Takaichi trade,” which drove the Nikkei 225 to record heights while the yen weakened past the 150 mark against the dollar. The bank’s decision also unfolds amid struggles in Japan’s export sector. The country’s exports shrank for four straight months before recovering in September, though shipments to the United States continue falling. Investors now await Ueda’s press conference later today for hints about when the Bank of Japan might make its next move. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

When news broke about Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s pardon, a U.S. Senator quickly linked it to a new stablecoin listing on Binance.US. This created a narrative that needed immediate clarification. What’s the Buzz About the Binance.US USD1 Listing? U.S. Senator Chris Murphy made a public claim that Binance.US listed World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin, USD1, as a direct reward following President Donald Trump’s pardon of Changpeng Zhao. This assertion, reported by The Block, suggested a quid pro quo, raising questions about the independence of business decisions within the crypto exchange. Such claims can erode public trust and create unnecessary controversy in an already scrutinized industry. It’s crucial for exchanges to maintain transparent and unbiased listing processes to ensure market integrity. Setting the Record Straight: The Truth Behind the Binance.US USD1 Listing Binance.US was quick to address the speculation, firmly stating that its Binance.US USD1 listing was purely a business decision. They emphasized that this move was entirely unrelated to Changpeng Zhao’s pardon. According to the exchange, their internal listing committee had already approved the USD1 stablecoin long before the pardon was granted. This pre-approval timeline directly contradicts the Senator’s claims, highlighting a robust, independent evaluation process. Furthermore, Binance.US pointed out that USD1 is not exclusive to their platform. Major industry players like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Kraken already feature the token, indicating its broader acceptance and market presence. This context further supports Binance.US’s position that their Binance.US USD1 listing was a standard operational choice. Why Does This Clarification Matter for Binance.US? The swift and clear response from Binance.US is vital for several reasons. Firstly, it reinforces their commitment to operating as an independent entity, distinct from Binance Global and its founder’s personal legal matters. This separation is crucial for regulatory compliance and building trust with U.S. users. Secondly, transparency in listing decisions upholds the exchange’s credibility. In a volatile market, users rely on exchanges to make decisions based on merit and due diligence, not external political events. Maintaining this integrity is paramount for their long-term success and user confidence. Key takeaways from this incident include: Reinforced Autonomy: Binance.US operates with an independent listing committee. Due Diligence: Listing approvals are based on business metrics and market demand. Market Context: USD1’s presence on other major exchanges validates its broader acceptance. Understanding Stablecoins and Exchange Listings Stablecoins like USD1 are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility, typically by pegging their value to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. They play a critical role in the crypto ecosystem, facilitating trading and providing a stable store of value. Crypto exchanges follow a rigorous process to decide which tokens to list. This often involves evaluating factors such as a token’s liquidity, community support, technological stability, regulatory compliance, and market demand. The Binance.US USD1 listing went through this standard vetting, emphasizing a commitment to proper procedures. In conclusion, the Binance.US clarification regarding its USD1 listing serves as an important reminder of the due diligence and independent decision-making processes that major cryptocurrency exchanges aim to uphold. Their prompt response effectively debunked the claims, reinforcing their operational autonomy and commitment to transparency in the U.S. market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USD1? USD1 is a stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial, designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is used in the cryptocurrency market for various transactions and as a stable store of value. Who is Changpeng Zhao (CZ)? Changpeng Zhao, often known as CZ, is the founder of Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. He recently faced legal issues in the U.S. and received a presidential pardon. Why was the Binance.US USD1 listing controversial? The listing became controversial after U.S. Senator Chris Murphy suggested it was a reward for Changpeng Zhao’s pardon. Binance.US quickly clarified that the listing was an independent business decision approved before the pardon. How do exchanges decide which tokens to list? Exchanges typically have a listing committee that evaluates tokens based on various criteria, including market demand, liquidity, technological robustness, regulatory compliance, and the project’s overall viability. This ensures new listings benefit users and the platform. Does this incident impact Binance.US’s regulatory standing? By promptly clarifying the situation and demonstrating an independent decision-making process, Binance.US aims to reinforce its commitment to compliance and transparency, which is crucial for maintaining a strong regulatory standing in the U.S. Did you find this clarification helpful?

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the Bitcoin price has just shattered a significant psychological and financial barrier, surging above $110,000. This remarkable milestone, as reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring, sees BTC trading at an impressive $110,085.7 on the Binance USDT market. For many, this isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to Bitcoin’s enduring strength and growing appeal in the global financial landscape. What does this phenomenal rise signify for the market, and what factors might be fueling such an extraordinary rally? What’s Driving This Historic Bitcoin Price Rally? When the Bitcoin price makes such a dramatic move, it’s rarely due to a single cause. Instead, it’s often a confluence of factors creating a powerful upward momentum. This recent surge above $110,000 is likely no exception, reflecting a combination of market sentiment, institutional interest, and broader economic narratives. Several key elements often contribute to such significant price movements: Increased Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions and corporations are increasingly integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios and services. This legitimizes the asset and brings substantial capital into the market. Growing Retail Investor Confidence: As Bitcoin gains mainstream media attention and demonstrates resilience, more individual investors are entering the market, contributing to demand. Macroeconomic Factors: In times of economic uncertainty or inflationary concerns, investors often seek alternative stores of value. Bitcoin, with its limited supply, is increasingly seen as ‘digital gold.’ Technological Advancements: Continuous development within the Bitcoin network, improving its scalability and utility, enhances its long-term appeal. Halving Events: While not recent, the effects of previous Bitcoin halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, can continue to influence long-term price appreciation. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone trying to make sense of Bitcoin’s volatile yet often rewarding journey. How Does This Bitcoin Price Impact the Broader Crypto Market? Bitcoin’s dominance in the cryptocurrency market means that its price movements often have a ripple effect on altcoins. When the Bitcoin price experiences such a substantial increase, it typically brings positive sentiment to the entire crypto ecosystem. This phenomenon, often referred to as the ‘altcoin season’ or ‘trickle-down effect,’ can lead to: Increased Altcoin Valuations: As Bitcoin’s market capitalization grows, investors often reallocate some profits into other promising cryptocurrencies, leading to their price appreciation. Renewed Investor Interest: A soaring Bitcoin price attracts new investors to the crypto space, many of whom then explore other digital assets beyond BTC. Enhanced Market Liquidity: The overall increase in market activity and trading volumes benefits all cryptocurrencies by providing better liquidity. However, it’s also important to remember that while a rising tide lifts all boats, individual altcoins have their own fundamentals and risks. Not all will perform equally, and careful research remains paramount. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities with a High Bitcoin Price? While a surging Bitcoin price presents exciting opportunities, it also comes with its own set of challenges that investors and regulators must navigate. On the opportunity side, a higher price can: Attract More Capital: Further validate Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, drawing in more institutional and retail investment. Spur Innovation: Encourage more developers and entrepreneurs to build on the Bitcoin network and in the broader crypto space. Increase Mainstream Acceptance: Push more merchants and service providers to accept Bitcoin as a payment method. Conversely, the challenges include: Increased Volatility: Higher prices can sometimes lead to more dramatic price swings, which might deter risk-averse investors. Regulatory Scrutiny: A larger market capitalization often attracts more attention from governments and financial regulators, potentially leading to new rules. Accessibility Concerns: For new investors, a high Bitcoin price might seem prohibitive, leading to concerns about affordability, though fractional ownership addresses this. Navigating these aspects requires a balanced perspective and a clear understanding of one’s investment goals. Is Now the Time to Consider Bitcoin? Actionable Insights For those observing the incredible ascent of the Bitcoin price , the question often arises: what now? While this article does not constitute financial advice, understanding some actionable insights can help you approach the market more thoughtfully. Consider the following: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before any investment, thoroughly research Bitcoin’s technology, market dynamics, and historical performance. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is a volatile asset. Only invest what you are comfortable losing. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of a lump sum investment, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy can help mitigate the impact of volatility. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is powerful, a diversified portfolio across various asset classes is generally a sound investment strategy. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves quickly. Keep up-to-date with news, technological developments, and regulatory changes. The journey of Bitcoin has been one of unprecedented growth and innovation. Its recent surge above $110,000 is a powerful reminder of its potential to reshape the financial world. The monumental rise of the Bitcoin price above $110,000 marks a truly historic moment in the cryptocurrency market. This surge underscores Bitcoin’s growing maturity, its increasing acceptance among institutional players, and its undeniable appeal as a hedge against traditional economic uncertainties. While the path ahead may still hold volatility, this latest achievement reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a dominant force and a fascinating asset to watch. As the digital economy continues to evolve, Bitcoin remains at the forefront, challenging conventional finance and offering new possibilities for investors worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a Bitcoin price of $110,000 mean for its future? A Bitcoin price of $110,000 indicates strong market confidence and growing demand. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, such a significant milestone often fuels further interest and can potentially set new higher price targets in the long run, depending on market conditions and adoption rates. Q2: Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin at this price? Whether it’s ‘too late’ is subjective and depends on your investment horizon and risk tolerance. Many investors believe Bitcoin still has significant growth potential due to its finite supply and increasing utility. However, it’s crucial to understand the risks and consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging. Q3: What factors could cause the Bitcoin price to drop after such a rise? Potential factors include increased regulatory pressures, significant sell-offs by large holders (‘whales’), global economic downturns affecting risk assets, or unexpected technological issues. Market sentiment shifts and profit-taking can also lead to corrections. Q4: How does the current Bitcoin price compare to its all-time high? While the article highlights a significant surge to $110,000, specific comparisons to previous all-time highs would depend on the exact historical data. This price point represents a remarkable achievement and a new benchmark in its journey. Q5: Where can I monitor the live Bitcoin price? You can monitor the live Bitcoin price on various cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, or financial data websites that track crypto markets. Many platforms also offer charting tools and historical data. If you found this insight into the incredible surge of the Bitcoin price valuable, please consider sharing it with your network!

Cole made pessimistic assessments of the US financial structure, saying, “Bitcoin is the only answer to the debt crisis and the devaluation of fiat currencies.” With the rise of cryptocurrency prices, many companies around the world have begun creating digital asset-focused treasuries, adopting the balance sheet strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor's Strategy. Strive has joined the trend. The firm was prominent in asset management before shifting to its Bitcoin-focused strategy. Strive manages several exchange-traded funds focused on large U.S. stocks, including the $1 billion Strive 500 ETF (STRV).

Working directly with the Treasury and the Fed convinced me, once skeptical of Bitcoin, that Bitcoin is the only answer to the debt crisis and currency devaluation.” Cole argued that the debt crisis is a bipartisan issue and expressed little hope that the US could solve it: “I don't believe the US government will stop printing money. This is a headwind for Bitcoin and its investors.” Cole stated that Bitcoin is not only an investment tool but also offers financial freedom and a way out of the current system. *This is not investment advice.

He believes Bitcoin (BTC) has the potential to rally as much as 12% over the next seven days. The analyst based his assessment on Bitcoin's performance before and after the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. Peterson noted that in analyses conducted since 2023, Bitcoin's average post-FOMC meeting movement has been approximately 1.5 times its weekly movement prior to the meeting. This means that the trend that begins before the meeting typically strengthens after the decision. Related News: Big Bull Michael Saylor Reveals Year-End Bitcoin Price Prediction - “Long-Term Target of $20 Million...” Peterson said, “In this case, Bitcoin has risen by 4% in the last 7 days. Therefore, an average increase of 7% can be expected for the next week. The most likely range is between 0% and 15%.” The FOMC is the committee that sets US interest rates and directs monetary policy.

Key Takeaways: Coinbase says stablecoins don’t threaten US banks, arguing most demand comes from international users seeking dollar exposure. Two-thirds of stablecoin activity happens on DeFi platforms. Stablecoins strengthen, not weaken, the US dollar’s global role. In a market note shared Wednesday , Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s chief policy officer, argued that the “stablecoins will destroy bank lending” narrative ignores how the market actually functions. “Most stablecoin demand comes from outside the US, expanding dollar dominance globally, not competing with your local bank,” Shirzad said, adding that concerns echo misplaced fears raised during earlier financial innovations such as money market funds. Stablecoin Demand Driven by Global Markets According to Coinbase, the majority of stablecoin users are international investors seeking access to the US dollar, not domestic savers. In countries facing currency depreciation or limited access to banking, dollar-pegged stablecoins serve as a lifeline for the underbanked, providing stability and a bridge to global commerce. The report noted that roughly two-thirds of all stablecoin transfers occur on decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain platforms, systems that operate independently from traditional banks. “They are the transactional plumbing of a new financial layer that runs parallel to, but largely outside, the domestic banking system,” the firm said. Shirzad emphasized that treating stablecoins as a threat “misreads the moment,” arguing that they reinforce the dollar’s international role rather than compete with it. The company said US policymakers should see stablecoins as a strategic tool for dollar expansion, not as a risk to community banks or deposits. “Community banks and stablecoin holders barely overlap,” Shirzad said. “In fact, banks could improve their services with stablecoins.” The ""stablecoins will destroy bank lending"" narrative ignores reality. U.S. banks are sitting on trillions in reserves—they have plenty of liquidity. Meanwhile, most stablecoin demand comes from outside the U.S., expanding dollar dominance globally, not competing with your local… pic.twitter.com/3wCOEm6Zr0 — Faryar Shirzad (@faryarshirzad) October 29, 2025 Coinbase also pushed back against claims that trillions in stablecoin assets would flow out of US bank deposits, noting that any future growth would likely remain foreign-held or locked in digital settlement systems. Even if global stablecoin circulation reached $5 trillion, Coinbase estimates the majority would sit outside the US, with little effect on domestic deposits, which currently exceed $18 trillion. The firm argues that, if anything, stablecoins will extend US monetary influence while giving American financial firms a competitive edge in the digital asset economy. The defense comes as more banks explore stablecoin products following the passage of the GENIUS Act , the US regulatory framework governing stablecoin issuers and payment systems. Western Union to Launch Dollar-Backed Stablecoin on Solana Western Union is also entering the stablecoin market with plans to launch the US Dollar Payment Token (USDPT) on the Solana blockchain in the first half of 2026. The token, issued by Anchorage Digital Bank, will allow users to move money globally with lower fees and faster settlement times, reducing reliance on traditional banking intermediaries and volatile currency conversions. CEO Devin McGranahan described the move as a continuation of Western Union’s 175-year mission to simplify money transfers, this time through blockchain technology. He said Solana was chosen for its speed, scalability, and low-cost transactions, which are crucial for the company’s high-volume remittance business. By leveraging blockchain rails, Western Union aims to make remittances nearly instantaneous and more transparent.

Sources cited by foreign media said the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has yet to approve any listing or transformation application related to DATs. The exchange reportedly questioned the intentions of several firms that planned to change their business models to that of holding or managing crypto reserves. Hong Kong has no regulations governing DATs Huang Tianyou, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), told reporters that Hong Kong lacks legislation regulating listed companies’ participation in cryptocurrency investment or treasury arrangements. He explained that the regulator is monitoring market developments closely and will issue a directive if new guidance is needed to safeguard investors. “The DAT model has gained popularity in the United States,” Huang said, referencing the trend of firms that allocate cash reserves to buy digital assets as treasury holdings. “There are many documents and analyses showing that when a company buys $1 billion in virtual currencies, its market value can rise by more than double. But that situation is also under review in the United States.” The CSRC chairman also warned that most local investors have little understanding of what DATs actually are. “As a regulatory agency, investor education is essential. After education, investors will realize that stock prices and valuations of companies transforming into DATs often carry significant premiums. If these activities become officially regulated one day, those premiums could disappear overnight,” he surmised. He added that if any DAT company were to apply for a Hong Kong initial public offering, the firm would have to fully convince both the CSRC and the Stock Exchange during the approval process. “It should be impossible to list it in Hong Kong in the form of a DAT right now,” he said. Regulatory grey zone on digital asset treasury limits Huang further explained that the absence of clear rules makes it difficult to determine how far a listed company can go in purchasing digital assets with its cash reserves. “Are we not allowed to buy one Bitcoin? What about ten? What about a hundred?” he asked. “If all corporate cash were converted into Bitcoin, could that be justified simply because Bitcoin is a liquid asset?” The regulator has confirmed Hong Kong’s “same share, different rights” (WVR) mechanism, introduced in 2018, is under review. The city’s Chief Executive announced in this year’s policy the intention to optimize the system to better accommodate high-quality innovation and technology companies. Huang said the review would be comprehensive, with the primary objective of protecting small shareholders and distinguishing legitimate innovation firms from exploitation. “The first principle is to ensure that the interests of minority shareholders are not infringed,” he concluded. Hong Kong crypto businesses worried about stablecoin law enforcement The city’s regulatory caution over DAT structures comes against the backdrop of the Chinese special jurisdiction’s efforts to build a regulated digital asset ecosystem. In August, the government introduced new legislation to allow licensed entities to issue stablecoins, cryptos pegged to real-world currencies like the US dollar. However, economists believe Hong Kong is “too cautious” about its stablecoin laws, which counters the expansion seen in the United States after the West imposed similar crypto-friendly regulatory efforts. Recent reports suggest that Beijing’s increased involvement in digital asset oversight has cast uncertainty over Hong Kong’s crypto trajectory. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) reportedly summoned several mainland firms under its jurisdiction, including banks and non-bank payment providers, instructing them to hold off on stablecoin initiatives until further notice. The Financial Times reported that Ant Group and JD.com were among the firms told not to proceed with their stablecoin projects. According to individuals familiar with the matter cited by FT, some of these potential issuers were once enthusiastic about applying for Hong Kong’s first stablecoin licenses, but have now taken a wait-and-see stance.

The Filecoin (FIL) price drop has sparked caution among investors, while the XRP price prediction is heating up again on ETF optimism. But amid these shifting narratives, one project is capturing serious developer and institutional attention, BlockDAG. With nearly $435 million raised, 27 billion coins sold, and over 312,000 holders globally, BlockDAG is now being recognized as the top crypto to buy in 2025 , thanks to its EVM-compatible high-speed framework, transparent execution model, and near-ready Genesis Day launch that has ignited global excitement among traders and developers alike. BlockDAG’s EVM Compatibility Ignites DeFi and GameFi Adoption BlockDAG is fast emerging as a top choice for developers migrating from congested networks like Ethereum . Its EVM compatibility allows existing Ethereum-based dApps to move seamlessly to BlockDAG’s chain without rewriting code. What sets it apart is the network’s ability to deliver speeds of up to 15,000 transactions per second (TPS) while maintaining Proof-of-Work (PoW) security and decentralization. This means faster DeFi interactions, cheaper GameFi transactions, and a broader capacity for real-world applications, all within a familiar development environment. Analysts say this mix of scalability and compatibility positions BlockDAG as a “next-generation EVM magnet,” capable of pulling liquidity and projects from slower ecosystems. The presale’s growth underscores this confidence. Nearly $435 million has already been raised, and Batch 31 coins are priced at $0.0015, with a projected listing at $0.05,a potential 3,233% return for early participants. Users leveraging the TGE code gain discounted access and early unlock benefits. Beyond software, hardware integration adds another layer of utility. Over 20,000 X-Series miners have been sold, while 3.5 million users mine via the X1 mobile app, contributing directly to the network’s Proof-of-Engagement model. With audits completed by CertiK and Halborn, and branding tied to the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team, BlockDAG’s credibility matches its technical ambition, making it the top crypto to buy in 2025 for those seeking both innovation and reliability. Filecoin Faces Pressure After Breaking Below $1.55 The Filecoin (FIL) price drop has drawn trader concern after falling from $2.41 to around $1.55, testing crucial support levels. Analysts link the decline to weakening on-chain demand and collateral adjustments on Binance, which increased liquidation risks for leveraged traders. The move also coincided with concerns about decentralized storage reliability following a brief AWS outage on October 20. At present, Filecoin trades just above $1.55, with support around $1.52 and resistance near $1.65. If selling continues, analysts warn of a potential slide toward $1.40, while a recovery above $1.65 could signal a short-term bounce. Longer-term confidence will depend on whether Filecoin can demonstrate consistent data demand growth rather than speculative hype. Source: CoinGecko Despite its robust storage model, the project’s token price continues to lag behind expectations, leaving traders cautious about its near-term recovery. XRP Climbs on ETF Hype and Institutional Interest The XRP price prediction has turned optimistic as speculation builds around a potential XRP-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF). Currently trading near $2.40, XRP has stabilized after previous volatility. Market sentiment was boosted by reports of Evernorth, a Ripple-backed fund, planning a $1 billion treasury vehicle focused on XRP adoption. Analysts project XRP could range between $2.30 and $2.68 by year-end, with upside potential to $4–$6 if ETF approval materializes. Longer-term forecasts target $6–$10 by 2025, depending on institutional inflows and broader market recovery. Resistance remains firm around $3.50, and short-term corrections could occur if momentum fades. Still, Ripple’s expanding network of financial partners and cross-border payment infrastructure keeps long-term confidence intact. Investors view XRP’s current price zone as a potential accumulation range ahead of its next breakout phase. Final Thoughts The Filecoin (FIL) price drop underscores how utility tokens must rebuild trust after setbacks, while the XRP price prediction proves how speculation can revive interest around institutional catalysts. Yet neither matches BlockDAG’s blend of verified technology, community growth, and presale momentum. With nearly $435 million raised, a thriving mining network, and a transparent roadmap leading into Genesis Day, BlockDAG represents more than hype; it’s a full-scale shift toward blockchain practicality, scalability, and user empowerment across DeFi, gaming, and enterprise ecosystems worldwide. For developers, miners, and long-term investors, BlockDAG is the top crypto to buy in 2025, standing out as the network most likely to define the next phase of crypto growth.

53812871,616988,1761807640,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53812871.jpeg,Hyperliquid ETF On The Horizon: 21Shares Submits HYPE Filing To US SEC,https://bitcoinist.com/hyperliquid-etf-on-the-horizon-21shares-filing/,"On Wednesday, 21Shares, the world’s largest issuer of cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs), submitted a regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking approval to launch a passive Hyperliquid ETF designed to track the price of the HYPE token. 21Shares’ Passive Hyperliquid ETF Passive exchange-traded funds, like the one proposed by 21Shares, are structured to track the performance of a specific index or asset by holding it in consistent proportions, rather than actively selecting and managing investments. This passive management approach typically results in lower expense ratios and reduced management fees, as there is no need for a highly compensated portfolio manager to make frequent trading decisions. Additionally, passive ETFs usually disclose their holdings on a daily basis, offering investors clear insight into the fund’s assets. They are also known for their tax efficiency, as lower portfolio turnover generally leads to fewer capital gains taxes. In its Hyperliquid ETF filing, 21Shares announced that it has selected Coinbase (COIN) and BitGo as custodians for the Hyperliquid ETF. The Trust will hold the HYPE token and assess its value daily based on a specified Pricing Benchmark. Furthermore, 21Shares disclosed that it may explore alternative methods for engaging in staking activities, specifically through liquid staking protocols (LSPs). These protocols allow for the issuance of a freely tradeable digital token, known as a “Liquid Staking Token,” which represents the HYPE staked with the protocol. The Youngest Crypto Asset To Seek ETF Approval Notably, the HYPE token is the youngest cryptocurrency asset to have an ETF application submitted to date, underscoring the growing interest from money managers and institutions in gaining exposure to these digital assets. Additionally, HYPE has been among the top performers since its launch back in November 2024, with a major 1,140% surge since its market debut, with a market cap nearing the $13 billion market capitalization. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has received a wave of ETF filings related to cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) as the demand continues to rise throughout the year. However, it is important to note that the approval process for these numerous crypto ETF applications remains pending. The SEC is currently operating with limited staff due to a government shutdown, which has slowed down the review process. In September, the agency did remove the last significant barrier for several new spot ETFs linked to various cryptocurrencies, paving the way for potential future approvals. Despite the Hyperliquid ETF application, the HYPE token has failed to react positively to the news with a 2% drop toward $46 in the 24-hour time frame. This puts the token 20% below its record peak of $59 reached earlier this year.

Aljarrah said that Fink’s remarks confirm long-held views among XRP supporters about the coming transformation of global markets. In his post, Aljarrah wrote that “every central bank currency will be digitized, every ETF and asset will be tokenized, and they’ll all need a cross-border settlement layer,” calling XRP the foundation of the new financial system . Larry Fink just confirmed what we’ve been saying for years, every central bank currency will be digitized, every ETF and asset will be tokenized, and they’ll all need a cross-border settlement layer. The plumbing of global finance is being rebuilt, and #XRP is the foundation. pic.twitter.com/hu0yArQeX7 — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 29, 2025 BlackRock’s View on Tokenization and Digital Currencies In the video, Fink raised what he described as major questions facing central banks and the financial sector. He asked, “What is the role of tokenization and digitization? How quickly should they think about digitizing their own currency?” He went on to discuss how the shift to digital currencies could affect the dollar, the banking sector, and major payment companies such as MasterCard and Visa. Fink said that while much attention has been given to artificial intelligence, “we’re not spending enough time talking about how quickly we’re going to tokenize every financial asset .” He added that this transformation will allow investors to move exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other assets through digital wallets, describing the process as one that “will happen worldwide very rapidly.” According to Fink, most countries are not yet ready for this change. He said they “underappreciate how technology is changing” the financial system, comparing the pace of innovation in finance to the acceleration seen in artificial intelligence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why XRP Supporters See Opportunity Fink’s acknowledgment of a coming wave of tokenization aligns closely with what many in the XRP community have long argued. They believe that the infrastructure being developed by Ripple positions XRP as a key player in cross-border payments and settlement. XRP is designed to enable instant, low-cost transfers across different currencies and jurisdictions, addressing one of the main challenges Fink described, which is the need for new financial plumbing in a digitized world. For XRP advocates, Fink’s comments serve as validation of years of discussion around digital transformation in finance. Aljarrah and others interpret his remarks as evidence that the world’s largest asset managers recognize the inevitability of tokenization and the digitization of money. Supporters say that as tokenization expands and central banks pursue CBDCs, an efficient settlement layer will become essential. They argue that XRP’s speed, scalability, and established regulatory footprint make it one of the few digital assets ready for institutional use.

53813222,617128,1761808322,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53813222.jpeg,Bitcoin Hyper Unveils Scalable Layer-2 That Could Redefine Bitcoin’s Future,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-unveils-scalable-layer-2-that-could-redefine-bitcoins-future/,"Quick Facts: 1️⃣ Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) introduces a high-performance Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine and anchored to Bitcoin, drastically improving transaction speed and scalability. 2️⃣ The network uses zero-knowledge proofs and a Bitcoin Canonical Bridge to batch micro-transactions and settle them efficiently on-chain, reducing fees and congestion. 3️⃣ Bitcoin Hyper expands Bitcoin’s utility from ‘digital gold’ to ‘digital payments backbone,’ supporting micropayments, retail transactions, remittances, and tokenized DeFi applications. 4️⃣ With $HYPER powering transaction fees and wrapped BTC serving as liquidity, the project could drive demand for both tokens. Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) just updated its guidance, declaring that many digital assets, including stablecoins, wrapped tokens, and yield-bearing staking programs, will likely be treated as financial products under the Corporations Act 2001. This announcement marks both a tightening of oversight and an implicit recognition that digital assets and blockchain-based payment infrastructures are becoming increasingly integrated into mainstream financial services. It’s also part of the development of the global regulatory landscape for crypto. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) emerges as a key infrastructure play, aiming to address the current limitations of Bitcoin and scale it for tomorrow’s high-demand transaction economy. Bitcoin’s Bottlenecks While Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and remains the foundational store of value in the cryptocurrency universe, it faces significant operational challenges that limit its utility in a high-velocity, global payment context. Key pain points include: Transaction speed and throughput: Bitcoin’s base layer processes roughly 7 transactions per second (tps) in normal conditions, vastly lower than major payment networks (Visa, Mastercard) that can handle thousands of tps. Inability to meet modern demands: With Web3 apps, DeFi, tokenized real-world assets, micropayments, IoT payments, and other novel uses emerging, the base Bitcoin layer is not optimized for high-frequency, low-value transactions. The high cost of on-chain fee spikes during congestion also undermines small-value payments. Cost and latency during congestion : When the Bitcoin network is busy, users face higher transaction fees and longer confirmation times. This undermines its competitiveness versus alternative chains like Solana and Ethereum. Bitcoin achieved dominance as a digital store of value, but as a global payments backbone, it still has work to do. Without solving these scalability and speed issues, Bitcoin risks falling behind newer networks optimized for high throughput. Enter Bitcoin Hyper with its proposal to extend Bitcoin into a high-velocity payments and transaction infrastructure for the modern era. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Layer 2 with $25M Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is designed to build on Bitcoin’s brand, security, and decentralized base-layer strength with a cutting-edge Layer 2 solution . Architecture & Mechanism Bitcoin Hyper proposes a high-performance Layer-2 infrastructure powered by the Solana Virtual Machin e that anchors into the Bitcoin main chain. This leverages Bitcoin’s security while offloading high-volume transaction traffic to a specialized Solana-driven network. The model groups large numbers of microtransactions into batches via zero-knowledge proofs and settles them periodically to the Bitcoin layer. This reduces on-chain fee burden and increases throughput. The platform supports both the native $HYPER utility token and wrapped Bitcoin through the Bitcoin Canonical Bridge . Those tokens (and potentially more) can transact swiftly on the Bitcoin Hyper network and settle back to Bitcoin as needed. This opens new utility: merchants, gig-economy payments, micro-tipping, game-economy payments, and content-creator payouts, all using Bitcoin. By leveraging Bitcoin’s brand and liquidity, Bitcoin Hyper presents a payment rail tied to the world’s largest cryptocurrency, rather than some lesser-known chain. Businesses gain confidence via Bitcoin’s established security, decentralization, and network effect. Utility & Real-World Use Cases Bitcoin Hyper transforms Bitcoin from a passive store of value into an active utility layer, unlocking real-world use cases that include: Micropayments, as Bitcoin Hyper enables lightning-fast, low-fee payments for millions of small-value transactions that would be impractical on base Bitcoin. Retail transactions, enabling merchants to accept ‘Bitcoin-based’ payments via Bitcoin Hyper, with near-instant confirmations. Remittance payments, as remittance corridors using Bitcoin Hyper become more cost-efficient, leveraging Bitcoin’s liquidity. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) by supporting tokenized assets and high-frequency transactions. Bitcoin Hyper allows developers to build dApps that interact with Bitcoin’s base layer indirectly, but at modern speeds. What is Bitcoin Hyper? It’s not a Bitcoin replacement, but an enhancement that accelerates the development of Bitcoin’s core utility. In doing so, Bitcoin Hyper can only strengthen Bitcoin’s ranking and crypto market dominance. How Far Can $HYPER Go? With Bitcoin Hyper in place, Bitcoin’s position as the king of crypto could be reinforced. As Bitcoin expands into the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2, the native $HYPER token could experience phenomenal growth from its discounted presale price — learn how to buy it now with our guide. $HYPER can be used to cover transaction fees on the Bitcoin Hyper network, freeing up investors to deploy their wrapped $BTC for the best yield. The case for $HYPER is bullish; by functioning alongside wrapped $BTC in a potentially transformative Layer 2 upgrade, $HYPER stands to benefit from $BTC’s growing utility. That’s one reason our price prediction sees $HYPER climbing from its current $0.013195 to $0.20 by the end of 2026, delivering 1415% returns to current investors. The presale has already raised over $25M, with multiple whale buys as big as $200K +. Bitcoin Hyper represents a compelling next chapter for the Bitcoin ecosystem. It addresses the real, structural problems of Bitcoin’s blockchain, while leveraging Bitcoin’s existing dominance and trust. With a layer-2 infrastructure built to handle modern payment demands, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) positions Bitcoin not only as digital gold but as the digital payments backbone of the future. Invest in Bitcoin’s next chapter at the Bitcoin Hyper presale. Do your own research. As always, this isn’t financial advice.

Speaking at a media briefing on Tuesday, Securities and Futures Commission chair Kelvin Wong Tin-yau said the agency is tracking how listed firms use cryptocurrencies to manage excess cash or pivot toward digital assets as a core business. “The SFC is concerned about whether DAT companies’ share prices are traded at a substantial premium above the cost of their DAT holdings,” he said, according to the South China Morning Post . Hong Kong Firms Face Tighter Scrutiny Over Crypto Treasury Pivots Wong pointed to cases in the US that “showed that the premium could be very high, which may add risks to investors trading in these stocks”. He added that many Hong Kong retail investors may not fully understand the risks tied to digital asset treasury, or DAT, strategies. Attention has sharpened after the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing reportedly challenged plans from at least five companies seeking to pivot to DAT-focused models as their main business, citing rules that restrict excessive holdings of liquid assets. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has pushed back the applications of five firms seeking to pivot to core digital asset treasuries (DAT). #HKEX #DigitalAssetTreasury #BitcoinTreasury https://t.co/3v12b4ged7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 22, 2025 Similar proposals faced resistance in India and Australia, reflecting regulatory unease with listed firms that tether valuations to volatile token balances rather than operating cash flows. US Examples Show How Crypto Holdings Can Distort Equity Valuations “The SFC is closely monitoring DAT developments,” Wong said. “We caution investors to fully understand the underlying risks of DAT.” He said the commission will strengthen public awareness and investor education on DAT and its risks. The push comes as some US-listed companies that hold large pools of Bitcoin have at times traded at notable premiums to the value of their coin holdings, amplifying boom-and-bust cycles for shareholders. These episodes showed how equity prices can drift away from net asset value when sentiment, leverage and momentum collide, creating an unstable link between a company’s core operations and its crypto balance sheet. DAT’s appeal is straightforward, treasury managers see liquid tokens as an alternative store of value and a marketing signal to crypto-savvy customers. For listed issuers, however, regulators worry that heavy token exposure can blur disclosures, complicate fair-value accounting and inflate market caps during rallies, then magnify drawdowns during downturns. Regulators Tighten Rules To Prevent Listed Firms From Mimicking Crypto Funds Digital asset treasuries have gained traction among a narrow set of US firms and crypto-native businesses. They have been less popular in markets where rules limit listed companies from holding outsized liquid assets or where exchange operators scrutinise business pivots that lack clear operating substance. India and Australia fit that pattern, with exchanges and regulators taking a conservative line on token-heavy balance sheets. Hong Kong has courted digital asset activity through a licensing regime and the debut of spot crypto exchange-traded funds, seeking to channel demand into regulated venues. Officials now appear intent on drawing a bright line between regulated market infrastructure and listed issuers that rely on speculative token holdings to drive valuations.

53813469,617079,1761808858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53813469.jpeg,FED 25 BPS Rate Cut Sparks Dovish Pivot – Find Out the Next Crypto to Explode,https://bitcoinist.com/fed-cuts-interest-rates-25-bps-next-crypto-to-explode/,"Quick Facts: 1⃣ The Fed has cut interest rates by 25 BPS and confirmed QT will end on December 1st. 2⃣ Lower rates and fresh liquidity often push investors back toward high-risk assets like crypto. 3⃣ $BTC usually dips after a FOMC meeting. But, in the long term, it tends to make all-time highs before the next one rolls around. 4⃣ Projects like $HYPER, $BEST, and $ASTER are well-positioned to benefit as capital rotates back on-chain. The Fed just hit the brakes again. In its yesterday meeting, on October 29, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to cut interest rates by 25 basis points down to 4%. This marks the second rate cut of 2025 and it’s the clearest signal yet that a dovish pivot is well underway. Two members dissented, though. Jeffrey Schmid wanted no cut, while Stephen Miran pushed for a deeper 50-bps cut. But the market will likely read the message loud and clear: the era of tightening is over. Liquidity is coming back. The central bank has also announced it will end Quantitative Tightening (QT) on December 1st. Why does this matter? It effectively reopens the door to Quantitative Easing (QE). This means the Fed will no longer be pulling money out of the system. Instead, it will start putting that money into treasury bills. That means more cash will flow into the financial system, which in turn makes borrowing cheaper and pushes investors toward riskier assets like stocks, gold, and crypto. Historically, $BTC has dropped 6–8% immediately after the last three FOMC meetings. So, expect volatility. However, it has then gone on to make a new all-time high before the next meeting. If that pattern holds, the setup into year-end looks explosive. With fresh liquidity back on the menu, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , and Aster ($ASTER) are three tokens that could well be the next crypto to explode as the crypto market heats up. Here’s why these altcoins stand out. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Finally Gets an Execution Layer Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is aiming to rewrite what’s possible on Bitcoin. $BTC may be the most popular asset in crypto, but its slow transaction times and high gas fees make it impossible to use for anything modern. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper comes in as a solution to Bitcoin’s ongoing issues. Hyper will be a faster, cheaper, and fully trustless Layer 2 (L2) running alongside Bitcoin’s network. By being built using Solana’s Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper combines Solana-level speed with Bitcoin-level security. Here’s how it works. You can bridge your $BTC into the L2 network, transact at sub-second speed, and settle back to Bitcoin’s L1 using zero-knowledge proofs. There are no middlemen or custody issues here. Learn how to buy the Bitcoin Hyper token with this quick walkthrough. You’re simply getting 1:1 your $BTC’s worth, and you’re able to move freely on an execution layer designed for real utility. This unlocks the possibility of having DeFi, meme coins , and dApps made with $BTC in mind. It’s no surprise that investors have been piling in. $HYPER has already raised over $25.2M in its presale, with tokens currently priced at $0.013195 and staking rewards of up to 46% on offer. Considering presale trends and its promising fundamentals, our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction forecasts a price of $0.2 being possible in 2026 — a whopping 15x growth potential, based on today’s presale price. With rate cuts lowering capital costs, a project that makes Bitcoin usable (not just holdable) will likely outperform many. If $BTC is money, $HYPER could be where that money moves. Join $HYPER before the next price jump. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Crypto Self-Custody Meets Compliance Best Wallet is an all-in-one Web3 wallet that plans to support 60+ chains in the near future. Top ones like Bitcoin, Solana, BSC, and Ethereum are already integrated, giving the app broad asset support for hundreds of tokens. It’s also built with Fireblocks-grade MPC-CMP security , which is the same tech trusted by many institutional custodians. In other words, it provides effortless asset protection without compromising on hot wallet convenience. Inside the app, users can swap, stake, and even join presales through the ‘Upcoming Tokens’ feature. The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers this entire ecosystem and gives holders notable perks. By holding $BEST, you can get fee reductions, higher staking rewards, early access to top crypto presales , and governance rights to vote on the direction of the Web3 wallet. With over $16.7M raised and a token price of $0.025865, the $BEST presale is showing great momentum. Staking rewards are as high as 79% for those who buy in early. Looking ahead, we believe a $BEST token price prediction of $0.82 is achievable by 2030 with continued momentum post-launch. The team is working on delivering more than just in-app features. The roadmap also includes a release of the Best Card — a crypto debit card that will let you spend crypto worldwide wherever Mastercard is accepted, bridging Web3 utility with everyday finance. Those who hold and stake $BEST will get reduced transaction fees and cashback rewards once this feature rolls out. Discover how to buy Best Wallet Token in our step-by-step guide. As rates fall and retail traders step back into the crypto market, wallets and wallet tokens like $BEST become essential to infrastructure on-chain. Get $BEST today and stake for 79% APY. 3. Aster ($ASTER) – The DeFi DEX Reclaiming Liquidity When interest rates drop, traders hunting yield come back fast. And few DeFi protocols are better positioned for that than Aster ($ASTER). The project operates as a multi-chain Decentralized Exchange (DEX) for both spot and perpetual trading, offering MEV-free execution that keeps your slippage low, even during volatility. $ASTER currently sits at $1.015 , with a market cap of $2.12B and daily volumes surpassing $500M — serious numbers for an exchange still in its early days. Recently, a new wallet moved $3.2M into $ASTER , signalling continued confidence from whales. The team has also announced plans to allocate 70–80% of all trading fees toward buybacks to strengthen token demand and help stabilize the price — that’s very bullish. Aster is built for speed and flexibility, running across BNB, Ethereum, Solana, and Arbitrum. Its ‘Pro Mode’ gives traders advanced tools like stock perpetuals and grid trading, while ‘Simple Mode’ caters to retail traders looking for one-click swaps. With rate cuts and an end to QT likely to push liquidity into yield-generating protocols, many in the community are eyeing a big rebound on $ASTER. Find $ASTER on Binance today. Recap: The Fed’s latest 25 BPS rate cut and plan to end QT mark a clear pivot toward easier money. With liquidity returning, risk assets like $HYPER , $BEST , and $ASTER could be the first to ride the next crypto move. This article is not financial advice. Crypto and presales carry inherent risks.

While XRP continues to hold market confidence for its established use case in cross-border payments, attention is increasingly shifting to Remittix (RTX) a new blockchain payment token that combines traditional finance connectivity and next-generation decentralized payment technology. XRP Price Prediction: Market Stability and Gradual Growth XRP is currently selling at $2.62 after a loss of about 0.76% in the last 24 hours with a market cap of $157.19 billion. XRP price prediction trackers show that, notwithstanding short-term fluctuations, XRP is among the most stable and institutionally embraced cryptocurrencies in the payments sector. The broader search now is for emerging tokens that can match the use-case utility of XRP but with the added features of faster transaction layers, lower fees and native direct fiat conversion. That’s where tokens like the so-called “XRP 2.0” are beginning to receive some serious market attention. Remittix: The New Challenger in Cross-Border Crypto Payments One of the standout projects in this section is Remittix currently valued at $0.1166 per token, which has attracted over $27.7 million in private investment and sold over 681.4 million tokens. As a next-generation crypto-to-fiat payment solution, Remittix aims to make cross-border transfers as simple as sending an email, with users capable of sending crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries. Its vision is an echo of Ripple’s original ambitions but extends further by calling for a “PayFi” model, blending decentralized finance accessibility and real-world payment rails. Remittix has already publicized future listings on BitMart and LBank, signaling a planned push for liquidity growth and global exposure. Meanwhile, its Wallet Beta Testing program is expanding, inviting more iOS users to join by rewarding the Top 10 weekly buyers with early test access. The wallet enables users to experience instant transfers and test new payment features, a big step toward the full PayFi launch. Verified by CertiK and Backed by Community Trust On the blockchain security platform CertiK Skynet, Remittix currently holds the #1 global ranking among pre-launch tokens following its successful verification. This milestone reinforces the project’s legitimacy, transparency, and long-term viability qualities that continue to attract both institutional and retail investor attention. Remittix has also introduced some initiatives, such as a $250,000 community giveaway and a 15% referral program with USDT rewards every 24 hours. Remittix also reinstated a 50% token reward for new purchasers prior to reaching the $30 million threshold, which created additional market activity. Why Analysts are Calling Remittix The ‘Next XRP’ Confirmed by CertiK and #1 ranked pre-launch project Over $27.7Million raised from private investors Seamless crypto-to-bank payments in 30+ countries Launching Wallet Beta Testing for real-world use BitMart and LBank listings announced With strong investment, established security, and an expanding ecosystem, Remittix is proving that the future of payments in blockchain may not be in speculation but in viable, usable technology. If XRP’s climb toward $3 proves anything, it’s that payment-focused tokens remain one of the strongest narratives in crypto and Remittix is rapidly inheriting that spotlight Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here: Website: https://remittix.io/ Socials: https://linktr.ee/remittix $250,000 Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-30 07:24:00

Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has made an important announcement regarding RUNE deposits and withdrawals . This temporary suspension is a routine measure to ensure a smooth transition for an upcoming network upgrade. Understanding these temporary pauses is crucial for all crypto enthusiasts. Why Are RUNE Deposits and Withdrawals Being Halted? Binance announced that it will temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals for THORChain (RUNE) starting at 4:00 p.m. UTC on November 4th. The primary reason for this action is to support an essential network upgrade for THORChain. Such upgrades are vital for the blockchain’s health, security, and future development. Network Upgrade Support: This suspension allows Binance to safely manage the upgrade process without risking user funds or transaction integrity. Enhanced Security: Upgrades often include security patches and improvements, making the network more robust against potential threats. Improved Functionality: New features or performance enhancements can be introduced, leading to a better user experience for THORChain participants. In essence, this temporary halt on RUNE deposits and withdrawals is a proactive step. It protects users and ensures that once the upgrade is complete, the THORChain network, and by extension, RUNE transactions on Binance, will operate more efficiently and securely. What Does This Mean for Your RUNE Holdings? For most users, this temporary suspension requires minimal action. Your RUNE assets held on Binance remain safe and unaffected during this period. However, there are a few key points to keep in mind: Trading Unaffected: Trading of RUNE on Binance will continue as normal. You can still buy, sell, and trade RUNE pairs on the exchange. No New Deposits: After 4:00 p.m. UTC on November 4th, any attempt to deposit RUNE into your Binance account will likely not be credited. It is crucial to avoid initiating new RUNE deposits and withdrawals during the suspension window. Withdrawals Paused: Similarly, you will not be able to withdraw RUNE from Binance until the network upgrade is complete and the services are reinstated. Therefore, if you anticipate needing to move your RUNE tokens off Binance around this time, plan to do so before the suspension begins. This helps you avoid any inconvenience or delays in accessing your funds. When Will RUNE Services Resume? Binance has stated that the suspension of RUNE deposits and withdrawals is temporary. They will resume these services once the THORChain network upgrade is successfully completed and deemed stable. The exchange typically monitors the upgraded network closely to ensure everything is functioning correctly before reopening deposits and withdrawals. Users are generally not required to take any specific action for the resumption of services. Binance will usually announce when deposits and withdrawals are reactivated, so staying updated through their official channels is always a good practice. These network upgrades, while sometimes causing temporary pauses, are a testament to the continuous development and improvement within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In conclusion, the temporary halt of RUNE deposits and withdrawals on Binance is a standard procedure designed to facilitate a critical THORChain network upgrade. This ensures the long-term health and security of the RUNE network. While it might require minor adjustments to your transaction plans, your assets remain secure, and trading continues. Always stay informed via official announcements to manage your crypto assets effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is Binance suspending RUNE deposits and withdrawals? Binance is temporarily suspending RUNE deposits and withdrawals to support an upcoming network upgrade for THORChain, ensuring a smooth and secure transition. Q2: When will the suspension of RUNE deposits and withdrawals begin? The suspension of RUNE deposits and withdrawals will begin at 4:00 p.m. UTC on November 4th.

The report, titled “BNB: The Core Force Behind the Global Web3 Economy,” argued that BNB has become one of the cornerstones of the global Web3 infrastructure. YZi Labs stated that BNB (“Build N Build”) is not only the native token of BNB Chain but also positions itself as the transaction engine of the “Global Web3 Economy.” According to the report, BNB offers a more efficient transaction layer compared to Ethereum’s DeFi infrastructure and Bitcoin’s store of value. The token also stands out for its deflationary nature and decentralized on-chain ownership: approximately 67% is public, 27% has been burned, and CZ's share is under 1%. This, according to the report, reduces centralized risks and increases institutional trust. According to Dune and Nansen data, the BNB Chain ecosystem is currently: The highest trading volume in decentralized exchanges (DEX), The most active users, It is the network with the most active stablecoin wallets. Related News: Big Bull Michael Saylor Reveals Year-End Bitcoin Price Prediction - “Long-Term Target of $20 Million...” The ecosystem encompasses a wide range of sectors, including DeFi, artificial intelligence, meme tokens, real-world assets (RWA), and consumer applications. BNB provides access to these areas through a single token, giving investors integrated participation in on-chain growth. The YZi Labs report argued that BNB has performed strongly in past cycles, outperforming ETH, BTC, and SOL with an average annual price increase of up to 113%. The report noted that BNB has had a limited presence in the US market until now, but that this is starting to change. BNB listings on major platforms like Robinhood and Coinbase, along with ETF/DAT applications, signal the beginning of this process. YZi Labs also stated that CZ's amnesty decision is a positive signal for BNB, stating that this period offers a special window of opportunity that will accelerate adoption in North America and globally. *This is not investment advice.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is among those few tokens whose price is lower than $0.05 but analysts believe that it might rise by two or more times before the next bull market. Once the main milestones in its presale are achieved and MUTM approaches launch on testnet, it can become a leading crypto investment at present. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending protocol that is simple and efficient. It is not custodial and allows the borrowers and lenders to transfer crypto using transparent smart contracts. The design will be based on the use of mtTokens that are interest-bearing tokens representing a share of the pool of the user. Upon placing assets like ETH or USDT, a user is issued with mtTokens that will generate yield automatically. The mtTokens show the percentage of a user within the liquidity pool, which enables them to earn different variable APY , which increases with a larger percentage of liquidity in the liquidity pool. MUTM is appealing to passive and active DeFi investors as depositors will gain more appreciation as the number of people using a pool rises. The protocol also accepts a peer-to-peer lending model, in which the borrowers dictate the individual terms of loans. They are allowed to take variable or fixed rates where the latter is initiated at a relatively higher amount in forecastable repayment. All the loans are completely collateralized and liquidation events are prevented by automated liquidator bots. Progress of Presale Presale of Mutuum Finance has created an enormous hype in the crypto world. The presale sold over 780M tokens of its total 1.82 billion presale token supply, generating over $18,000,000 and bringing in over 17,500 holders, which is evidence of good organic momentum. All the presale stages have a set price and distribution. The demand is fast and the exposure to tokens is increased as the demand is high and the demand is fast. The token is priced at $0.035, although its price started at $0.01 during the early rounds. There has already been a 250% MUTM value increase for early buyers. Another part of presale growth is a 24-hour leaderboard, which grants the daily top contributor $500 in MUTM. This increased community participation and openness in the presale momentum. Security, Investor Confidence and Product Launch Mutuum Finance passed a CertiK audit scoring 90/100 on Token Scan which reflects excellent security of smart-contracts. Transparency and trust was also ensured by the team by implying a bug bounty of $50,000 ahead of launch. The project is scheduled to launch on the Sepolia testnet in V1 in Q4 of 2025. This is the initial step to launching Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot on the first assets of the platform, which are ETH and USDT. All these factors indicate that MUTM is transitioning off the concept to a live functional protocol, which enhances investor confidence and token utility. MUTM has a good growth potential due to the buy-and-distribute feature, among other mechanisms. It automatically buys MUTM in the open market with platform fees and lending revenue and sells them to those who stake mtTokens in the safety module. This sets up pressure to buy in the long run and compensates holders, which has been a successful strategy in successful crypto projects. Analysts predict that, with its current presale price of $0.035 and on its expected mainnet milestones, MUTM could move upwards by more than 1,000% in the medium term. They mention practical utility, initial-stage pricing, and open tokenomics as some of the reasons why they are optimistic about MUTM. The Next Growth Phase Mutuum Finance plans to introduce a USD-pegged stablecoin in their ecosystem that is over-collateralized by loans. It is possible to mint or burn the stable coin on demand, forming a self-regulating system that promotes long-term stability. Additional development will focus on Layer-2 to accelerate transactions and reduce expenses and incorporate decentralized price oracles, such as Chainlink to value assets accurately. The aim of these developments is to scale the protocol and offer high liquidation accuracy which is attractive to both institutional and retail users. Phase 6 of the presale is proceeding depending on whale inflows and increasing community involvement. When there are huge buys, the sellout of the token is faster, which indicates that there is a lot of confidence in the project fundamentals. In the predetermined distributions the fast sellout implies that the price will increase earlier. Since the initial launch price is fixed at $0.06, the individuals who were first to the second stage might have a token appreciation advantage. The observation that MUTM’s price momentum is increasing toward the launch price, helps in assuming that it may be a low-cost, 20x opportunity in 2026.

This puts the meme coin in a perilous position that could see its decline deepen from here. One thing that could make a difference would mean a rise in momentum, but volume is already down by a significant amount, so this route has remained a problem. Another major problem is the resistance mounting at $0.21 that could stop any recovery rally in its tracks. What Happens If The Dogecoin Price Breaks $0.218 Crypto analyst Diana Sanchez has highlighted the bullish potential of Dogecoin, suggesting that the price has been showing strength. This comes with the recent market fluctuations ahead of the decision from the Federal Reserve following the FOMC meeting. At this point, though, there is an important level where there is still a lot of resistance. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Crashes 50% From October Highs, Volume Is Worse, What’s Going On? The first thing the analyst points out is that despite the current struggle, the Dogecoin price has already increased by over 43%. This makes it one of the best performers among the top cryptocurrencies by market cap, and the momentum could turn bullish once again. However, the major problem now lies at the $0.218 level, where the bears are now mounting their defense. As for now, it continues to maintain the support at $0.2, and this has become the major source of interest for the bulls who are looking to continue the rally. The main point right now, the crypto analyst explains, is to break the resistance at $0.218. If this resistance is broken, then the Dogecoin price is expected to continue to rally. With this, the analyst says the Dogecoin price rising to the $0.5 target is no longer a dream. Low Volume Could Be A Hindrance To Recovery Despite the bullishness that is showing on the Dogecoin price chart, the fact that the meme coin’s daily trading remains low continues to put a damper on things. At the start of October, the daily trading volume had spiked above $20 billion before seeing a retracement.

A founder’s personal investment in their project’s native token is more than just a financial stake; it’s a powerful signal to the market. CZ’s decision to retain his substantial Changpeng Zhao BNB holdings carries immense weight for several reasons: Market Confidence: It signals strong belief in the project’s future, instilling confidence among investors and the broader community. Long-Term Vision: Not selling implies a commitment to the project’s longevity, suggesting a focus on sustainable growth rather than short-term gains. Debunking FUD: Direct statements like CZ’s help to effectively counter negative allegations and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), strengthening community resolve. Alignment of Interests: His personal success remains intrinsically linked to BNB’s success, creating a powerful incentive for the ecosystem to thrive. This unwavering commitment acts as a cornerstone of trust in the often-volatile cryptocurrency landscape, demonstrating ‘skin in the game’ from the top. How Does Founder Commitment Shape Crypto Projects? The principle of founder commitment extends beyond just CZ and his Changpeng Zhao BNB holdings . Across the crypto industry, the retention of significant founder tokens often acts as a key barometer for a project’s perceived health and future prospects. When founders hold onto their tokens, it typically suggests: Shared Financial Destiny: Their financial well-being is directly tied to the project’s performance, encouraging responsible development. Reduced Exit Risk: A lower likelihood of founders abandoning the project after an initial surge. Investor Trust: It fosters greater confidence among retail and institutional investors, knowing that leadership’s interests are aligned with their own. Conversely, projects where founders quickly dump their tokens often face skepticism and can struggle to build a loyal community. Therefore, CZ’s stance provides a valuable case study in leadership ethics within the digital asset space. Navigating Crypto Rumors: A Lesson from CZ’s Transparency The cryptocurrency space is unfortunately rife with misinformation and FUD, which can significantly impact market sentiment and investor decisions. CZ’s proactive response regarding his Changpeng Zhao BNB holdings offers important lessons for both project leaders and community members on how to navigate this challenging environment. For investors, the key takeaway is the importance of verifying information from official and primary sources. Relying on direct statements from project founders or official channels can prevent falling victim to false narratives. For leaders, CZ’s example underscores the power of transparency and direct communication in maintaining credibility and trust. His clarification serves as a prime example of how proactive engagement can effectively counter speculation and foster a more informed community, demonstrating that clear communication is vital for stability in the crypto world. Changpeng Zhao’s recent statement isn’t merely about his personal finances; it’s a powerful affirmation of his belief in BNB and the broader Binance ecosystem. His unwavering commitment, reflected in his retained Changpeng Zhao BNB holdings , offers a valuable lesson in leadership, transparency, and building long-term trust in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. This approach helps solidify the foundation of trust, which is essential for the sustained growth and adoption of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

53814089,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=848840,1761809793,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53814089.jpeg,Beijing to phase out EV subsidies in upcoming five-year plan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-ditches-ev-subsidies/,"China has abandoned EV subsidies for the first time in over a decade, following the industry’s exclusion from the top policymakers’ five-year development plan for 2026-2030. The government’s support has fueled a boom that has left China struggling with an oversupply of EVs, prompting it to seek alternative global markets. Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group, said the exclusion of EVs from the next five-year development plan is an official acknowledgment that they no longer need prioritized policies. She emphasized that China has already dominated the EV and battery markets, so there is no point in prioritizing them, adding that EV subsidies will likely fade. Wang says the market will now determine who survives from here on out. Research firm Jato Dynamics noted that 93 of the 169 automakers operating in China have market shares below 0.1%. Cryptopolitan reported that China’s EV companies are expanding abroad amid domestic price wars that have bankrupted startups and crushed profits. The government launched an anti-innovation campaign targeting excessive, self-defeating competition, but nothing much has changed on the ground. However, automakers have found workarounds, offering free upgrades, skipping the obvious price cuts to avoid government attention, and launching cheaper models. Dingshu expects policymakers to take more targeted measures The secretary-general of China’s Passenger Car Association, Cui Dongshu, stated that the current plan suggests Chinese policymakers will adopt more targeted measures compared to the previous broad approach. He believes this will help wean the industry off government support. However, this official shift means that EV automakers must face the reality that their futures will be decided by market competition. Dongshu expects the policymakers to press EV makers to focus more on curbing the production of lower-quality cars and delivering more innovative products. However, Shaochen Wang, a research analyst at Counterpoint, believes that automakers will need to sufficiently build their core strengths to establish proper footholds in the Chinese market. “For instance, brands like BYD and Leapmotor have strengthened their cost advantages by enhancing supply chain integration capabilities and launched more cost-effective products; meanwhile, Xiaomi and brands under HIMA (Huawei Intelligent Mobility Alliance) have attracted consumers with their strong brand influence and leading intelligent features.” – Shaochen Wang , Research Analyst at Counterpoint A Chinese policy adviser, who requested anonymity, also said that excluding EVs from government support does not mean the industry is no longer important. Tu Xinquan, Dean and Professor of the China Institute for WTO Studies of the University of International Business and Economics, expects China’s state planner and industry ministry to announce more specific plans to guide the industry’s future. Policymakers say EV exclusion is part of their years-long plan Chinese policymakers reportedly said that their ultimate intention was for the EV industry to stand independently, adding that they have been gradually phasing out major subsidies and tax breaks for the NEV (New Energy Vehicle) sector. They mentioned that the Chinese government ended a national purchase subsidy program for EV consumers in 2022 and intends to phase out tax rebates for purchases by 2027. However, some of the country’s auto industry associations are lobbying for the purchase tax rebates to be phased out at a gentler pace. Chinese President Xi Jinping reportedly reiterated the importance of avoiding rushed developments in the EV sector and investing in the same new productive forces. He asserted that his government aims to guide all concerned parties to adopt a realistic, sound, and rational approach in their initiatives. Xi also questioned earlier this year whether every province needs to develop industries like EVs and AI. Meanwhile, the 15th Five-Year Plan prioritizes biomanufacturing, nuclear fusion, quantum technology, and hydrogen energy as the new drivers of China’s economic growth. The complete plan is expected to be released at a parliamentary meeting in March 2026.

Bitwise: Which Solana ETF Is Better?,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835216-grayscale-vs-bitwise-which-solana-etf-is-better?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary Bitwise Solana ETF and Grayscale Solana Trust now offer spot ETF exposure to Solana in the US market. BSOL stands out with a lower expense ratio (0.2% with a fee waiver) and a higher staking ratio compared to GSOL's 0.35% fee. Both ETFs provide easier, tax-advantaged Solana access for IRA accounts, with BSOL offering superior cost efficiency for most investors. I initiate BSOL with a 'buy' rating, citing its lower fees, higher staking ratio, and better long-term suitability over GSOL and other alternatives. Despite a government shutdown in the United States that was widely believed to put a pause on any new digital asset ETFs in the American market, the SEC is indeed approving new crypto ETFs and existing closed-end fund conversions. One of the assets that is getting the ETF wrapper in the US is Solana ( SOL-USD ). On October 29th, the Grayscale Solana Trust ( GSOL ) will begin trading as a spot ETF rather than as a closed-end fund. This comes one day after the Bitwise Solana ETF ( BSOL ) began trading as well. In this article, I'm not going to get into the investment thesis for Solana other than disclosing that I am still personally long SOL and believe it's one of the better opportunities in the digital asset space. Rather, in this piece we'll explore a comparison between GSOL, BSOL, and a third-party option that I've personally used as well. Brief Recap Mike Fay GSOL Coverage (Seeking Alpha) For the benefit of clarity, I've covered GSOL a handful of times throughout the last several years. I've generally always called the fund a 'sell' mainly because it has historically traded at a significant premium to the net asset value of the fund's underlying shares. Now that the structure of the fund has changed, it's time to update my view on GSOL and compare it to a notable peer fund in BSOL. Grayscale vs. Bitwise Solana Funds As spot ETFs, both of these funds are designed for simple, inexpensive exposure to Solana without needing private keys, DeFi competency, or any on-chain activity at the user end. More importantly, GSOL's days of trading at sizable premiums (or discounts) to NAV should be over. Unlike the other two products in the table below, BSOL and GSOL are 100% weighted to spot Solana. The first thing that will likely matter when choosing between GSOL, BSOL, and alternative Solana-based financial products is the expense ratio of the funds: Solana Exposure Expense Ratio Market Cap Structure Yield? Solana ETF ( SOLZ ) 0.95% $229.6m Futures Fund No REX Shares-Osprey SOL ( SSK ) 0.75% $413m C-corp Yes GSOL 0.35% $102.7m Spot ETF Yes BSOL 0.20% $288.9m Spot ETF Yes Source: Seeking Alpha, Grayscale, Bitwise Up until this point, Grayscale had always charged 2.5% for its GSOL product. That expense ratio is now down to just 0.35%. This is a great sign in my view and an indication that Grayscale is finally willing to compete in this market from a fee standpoint. Still, Bitwise is charging just 0.2% on a gross expense ratio and 0% for the duration of its introductory fee waiver. That waiver will last for either three months or until the fund reaches $1 billion in assets under management. At $289 million in AUM, there is still a bit of a runway for BSOL buyers before fees actually begin to kick in. As you can see in the table above, each fund is more competitive than the non-spot options in the market. From where I sit, SOLZ and SSK are likely losers here just on the management fee alone. But it's presumably worse for the Volatility Shares Solana ETF ( SOLZ ) because it is the only product of the four that doesn't offer yield from staking. This brings us to the next important metric: what can investors expect as a staking return from these funds? Staking Ratio Staking Reward Rate GSOL 74.9% Not provided BSOL 82% 7.32% Sources: Grayscale, Bitwise As far as I can tell from Grayscale's ETF page and from the fund's prospectus, GSOL doesn't provide an expected staking rewards rate estimate. BSOL shows 7.3% as of October 28th. However, I believe that figure will prove to be overly optimistic over the next 12 months. For instance, the REX Shares Osprey SOL fund currently has a 5.1% distribution rate. Furthermore, we can already see through on-chain data that staking rewards on Solana have been falling with the increased supply of staked SOL: 12mo Staked SOL Trend (StakingRewards) The chart above shows the one year trend for both staked SOL and Solana's staking rewards rate. As would be expected, the more SOL that is staked for rewards, the lower that staking rewards yield will ultimately go. Solana's inflation rate is declining as well. So without significant growth in transaction fees, the long-term expectation for SOL staking yield would be down even with staking supply remaining the same. As of article submission, the reward rate for staked Solana is 6.4%. Another Option for Staked Solana One of the reasons why I'm fairly excited about the launch of spot staking ETFs for Solana is that I've been staking Solana through a third-party platform called iTrustCapital. My account with that company is a traditional IRA. Thus, it is not required that I pay taxes yet on any rewards or realized gains. The same is now true for both BSOL and GSOL through a traditional IRA with a non-crypto niche broker. Factoring in iTrustCapital's 1% transaction fee when buying or selling Solana, the spot ETFs are now a significantly better short-to-medium-term opportunity for exposure due to the dramatically lower fees. For example, say I buy SOL through iTrust Capital and hold it for 5 years; my total expense will be 2%. However, if I buy BSOL through something like a traditional IRA or Roth IRA and pay a 0.2% management fee for 5 years, my net expense is just 1%. Of course, if I plan to hold the Solana for 10 to 20 years, then iTrustCapital would make more sense in theory. Yet, I'd still have to pay taxes on those gains and rewards whenever I end up taking the capital out of that account when I retire. Such would not be the case with BSOL (or GSOL) through something like a Roth IRA. Closing Comments My personal pick between both GSOL and BSOL at this juncture is BSOL. I like the fee waiver. I like the smaller net expense ratio when that fee waiver ends. I like the higher staking ratio. Bitwise's target for its staking ratio is ultimately 100%. For me, it's tough to beat a lower-fee product with more SOL staked. And the fact that BSOL can be purchased in a Roth IRA makes it likely a far better long-term option than what I'm currently doing for my staked Solana approach. While I'm definitely going to upgrade GSOL from a 'sell' given its conversion to a spot ETF, I still like BSOL better today. I'm initiating BSOL with a 'buy.'",GSOL|BSOL,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-30 07:36:56

For those active in derivatives, the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio offers a crucial snapshot of how traders are positioning themselves. This metric helps gauge the collective bullish or bearish outlook, providing invaluable insights into potential price movements. What Does the BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Reveal? The long/short ratio for BTC perpetual futures represents the proportion of long positions (bets on price increase) versus short positions (bets on price decrease) held by traders. A higher long percentage suggests a bullish outlook, while a higher short percentage indicates bearish sentiment. This ratio offers a quick pulse check for the market. Over the past 24 hours, the collective sentiment across the world’s top three crypto futures exchanges, ranked by open interest, showed a slight bearish tilt. Here’s the breakdown: Overall: 48.47% long / 51.53% short This overall figure suggests slightly more traders were betting on a price decline for BTC perpetual futures than on an increase. However, individual exchanges provide a more nuanced picture. Diving Deeper into Exchange-Specific BTC Perpetual Futures Data Different exchanges often show varying sentiment, influenced by their user base and trading volumes. Examining data from Binance, Gate.io, and Bybit, leaders in open interest for BTC perpetual futures , highlights these distinctions: 1. Binance: 47.73% long / 52.27% short 2. Gate.io: 49.37% long / 50.63% short 3. Bybit: 48.28% long / 51.72% short Binance and Bybit showed a stronger lean towards short positions, with over half their traders holding bearish bets. Gate.io, however, displayed a more balanced, though still net short, distribution. These variations are important, sometimes signaling localized trends. Considering individual platform dynamics is wise for broader market analysis. Actionable Insights for Your BTC Perpetual Futures Trading Strategy Understanding the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio is a powerful tool. It offers insight into crowd psychology but shouldn’t be the only factor in your decisions. Here are actionable insights: Identify Potential Reversals: Extreme imbalances (e.g., overwhelmingly long or short) can sometimes precede price reversals. A heavily short market might trigger a short squeeze. Confirm Trends: If the ratio aligns with an existing price trend, it can confirm the trend’s strength. Beware of Contrarian Signals: When the majority is heavily positioned one way, the market sometimes moves opposite. This is a “contrarian indicator.” Combine with Other Metrics: Always use this ratio with other technical indicators like price action, volume, and order book depth. Remember, the market is complex. No single indicator provides a complete picture, especially with volatile BTC perpetual futures . Beyond the Ratios: A Holistic View of BTC Perpetual Futures Market While the long/short ratio offers valuable insights, an effective strategy for BTC perpetual futures demands a holistic approach. Macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and significant whale movements can dramatically impact Bitcoin’s price. A sudden positive news event, for example, could quickly flip sentiment. Traders should also monitor funding rates for perpetual futures. High positive funding rates indicate bullish pressure (longs pay shorts), while negative rates signal bearish pressure (shorts pay longs). Combining this with the long/short ratio offers a more comprehensive view of market dynamics and position costs. Staying informed about these broader market conditions is crucial. It allows you to anticipate shifts and adapt your trading strategy effectively, moving beyond reliance on a single data point. The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio serves as a vital barometer for market sentiment. The recent data, showing a slight lean towards short positions on top exchanges, indicates a cautious or moderately bearish outlook among traders in the immediate term. However, successful trading requires more than just one metric. By integrating this ratio with other technical and fundamental analyses, you can develop a more robust and informed trading strategy. Always remember to consider the bigger picture and manage your risk prudently. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are BTC perpetual futures? BTC perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without an expiry date. They are “perpetual” because they do not expire, unlike traditional futures contracts. How is the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio calculated? This ratio is calculated by dividing the total number or value of open long positions by the total number or value of open short positions on an exchange or across multiple exchanges. A ratio above 1 means more longs, below 1 means more shorts. Does a high short ratio for BTC perpetual futures always mean a price drop is coming? Not necessarily. While a high short ratio suggests bearish sentiment, it can sometimes act as a contrarian indicator, leading to a “short squeeze” if the price starts to rise, forcing shorts to cover their positions and further driving up the price. Which exchanges are included in this BTC perpetual futures analysis? This analysis focuses on the world’s top three crypto futures exchanges by open interest, specifically Binance, Gate.io, and Bybit, to provide a broad market overview. How can I use this BTC perpetual futures data in my trading? You can use this data to gauge overall market sentiment, identify potential imbalances, and confirm or challenge existing trends. However, always combine it with other technical analysis tools and fundamental market insights for a comprehensive strategy. Did you find these insights into BTC perpetual futures helpful?

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as Bitcoin (BTC) has achieved a remarkable milestone, soaring past the $111,000 mark . This incredible Bitcoin price surge has captivated investors and analysts alike, marking a significant moment in the digital asset landscape. According to real-time market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at an impressive $111,086.58 on the Binance USDT market, showcasing robust momentum. What’s Fueling This Bitcoin Price Surge? Understanding the forces behind such a significant move is crucial. Several factors often contribute to a sudden rally in Bitcoin’s value. This recent ascent above $111,000 isn’t happening in a vacuum; it’s likely a confluence of various market dynamics and investor sentiment. Increased Institutional Interest: More large corporations and financial institutions are exploring or actively investing in Bitcoin. This growing adoption signals confidence and brings substantial capital into the market. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties can often push investors towards safe-haven assets or inflation hedges, and many now view Bitcoin in this light. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s fixed supply and periodic halving events inherently create scarcity. As demand rises against a limited supply, price appreciation is a natural outcome. Positive Market Sentiment: A general wave of optimism, often fueled by positive news or influential figures, can create a ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) effect, driving further buying pressure. The sustained interest in Bitcoin as a store of value continues to strengthen its position in the global financial ecosystem. This latest Bitcoin price surge is a testament to its enduring appeal and growing acceptance. Navigating the Excitement: What Does the Bitcoin Price Surge Mean for You? For both seasoned traders and newcomers, a price movement of this magnitude prompts important questions. Is this the start of a new bull run, or a temporary spike? While no one can predict the future with absolute certainty, understanding the potential implications can help you make informed decisions. Benefits for Holders: Increased Portfolio Value: Existing Bitcoin holders see a direct increase in the value of their digital assets. Renewed Market Confidence: A strong rally can boost overall confidence in the crypto market, potentially drawing in new investors. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: While the Bitcoin price surge is exciting, crypto markets are known for their volatility. Prices can fluctuate rapidly. Market Corrections: After significant upward moves, minor or major corrections are common as investors take profits. It’s always wise to conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. The journey of Bitcoin has always been dynamic, and its path above $111,000 adds another thrilling chapter to its history. Looking Ahead: Sustaining the Bitcoin Price Surge Momentum The current momentum is undeniable, but what will it take for Bitcoin to maintain its elevated position or even climb higher? Continued innovation in the blockchain space, clearer regulatory frameworks, and broader mainstream adoption will be key. The ongoing development of layer-2 solutions and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms also contributes to Bitcoin’s utility and long-term value proposition. This impressive rise above $111,000 underscores Bitcoin’s resilience and its growing acceptance as a legitimate asset class. The global interest in this digital currency only seems to intensify with each new milestone. The future trajectory of Bitcoin will be fascinating to watch, especially as more individuals and institutions recognize its transformative potential. In conclusion, the recent ascent of BTC above the $111,000 threshold is a significant event that highlights the ongoing evolution and maturation of the cryptocurrency market. This Bitcoin price surge reflects a combination of growing demand, institutional confidence, and macro-economic tailwinds. As Bitcoin continues to forge new paths, it remains a compelling asset for those looking to understand and participate in the future of finance.

53814660,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/top-7-high-potential-tokens-to-watch-in-november-2025,1761811003,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/53814660.jpeg,Top 7 High-Potential Tokens to Watch in November 2025,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/top-7-high-potential-tokens-to-watch-in-november-2025,"As the crypto market recalibrates after months of uneven momentum, investors are shifting focus toward projects with strong fundamentals, working products, and clear utility. November 2025 marks a return to quality — and several standout tokens are leading this shift. Below are seven high-potential cryptocurrencies that deserve close attention this month, spanning Web3 gaming, interoperability, infrastructure, and legacy networks preparing for renewed cycles. 1. TRUE (TRUE) — Web3 Gaming Built on Real Revenue TRUE World by TRUE LABS continues to redefine what “utility” means in GameFi. It’s the first token launch in the sector backed by a functioning gaming business with verified revenue, millions of players, and a mature partner ecosystem. Unlike most gaming tokens that rely on hype or speculative staking, $TRUE connects gameplay directly with economic value through a closed-loop model: Player engagement fuels in-game fees, NFTs, and upgrades. A share of revenue funds buybacks and deflationary burns. The token powers staking, governance, and exclusive in-game progression. With listings on top exchanges expected before the year’s end, the TRUE token launch could be the blueprint for sustainable Web3 economies — where token value is rooted in real user activity and consistent cash flow. Watch for official announcements of $TRUE listing details at x.com/TRUExWorld 2. Polkadot (DOT) — Rebuilding Momentum Through Decentralized Parachains Once a top-three project by market cap, Polkadot (DOT) has spent much of 2025 consolidating after years of heavy development. Its focus on modular parachains and decentralized governance is finally beginning to mature. The new OpenGov framework has streamlined treasury proposals and expanded staking rewards, while ecosystem projects in DeFi and identity are regaining traction.If network activity continues to rise, DOT could enter a new accumulation phase, paving the way toward a medium-term recovery above US$ 9,50. 3. Litecoin (LTC) — Legacy Chain with Renewed Utility Often dismissed as a legacy coin, Litecoin (LTC) is quietly benefiting from broader adoption. It remains one of the most used payment cryptocurrencies thanks to fast, low-cost transactions and Lightning Network compatibility. Recent integration with Layer-2 bridges has revived on-chain activity, and increased merchant acceptance is sustaining daily volume. LTC’s modest valuation relative to Bitcoin leaves room for upside — especially if risk sentiment improves and payment-focused assets come back into favor. 4. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) — The NFT Brand That Refused to Fade Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has evolved from an NFT collection into a fully-fledged entertainment and brand ecosystem. Its token bridges Web2 merchandise success with Web3 ownership through collectibles, licensing, and gaming. The project’s strong retail presence and partnership expansion continue to give it an edge in cultural adoption. As NFT-native brands converge with metaverse and social gaming, Pudgy’s loyal community keeps it relevant — and potentially one of the few tokens to balance fun with functionality. 5. Aptos (APT) — High-Performance Layer-1 With Institutional Interest Aptos (APT) remains a standout among next-gen Layer-1 blockchains. Despite volatility, the network boasts steady growth in DeFi protocols and developer tools. Institutional attention around parallel execution and fast finality keeps APT on watchlists for Q4. If liquidity flows back into Tier-1 ecosystems, APT could revisit US$ 4,80 or higher, reaffirming its position as one of the most technically advanced Layer-1s. 6. Aster (ASTER) — Cross-Chain Connectivity Rebound Candidate Aster (ASTER) continues to pursue its mission of linking disparate ecosystems through efficient cross-chain communication. After enduring a correction in October, the token’s fundamentals — developer adoption and bridge performance — remain solid. In a more risk-on market, interoperability narratives tend to resurface quickly. If Bitcoin stabilizes, ASTER could stage a move toward US$ 1,70, supported by rising usage of its multi-chain DeFi integrations. 7. Internet Computer (ICP) — Innovation Waiting for Rediscovery Internet Computer (ICP) stays one of crypto’s most ambitious projects, aiming to decentralize the internet itself. With smart contracts that run at web speed and scalable storage, its technology continues to impress developers even as market sentiment fluctuates. ICP’s current challenge is visibility rather than capability. Should optimism return and investors rotate toward infrastructure plays, ICP could regain ground toward the US$ 4,40–4,50 range. Its potential remains vast — it simply needs the market’s attention back. Final Take November 2025 reveals a telling pattern: investors are rewarding projects with tangible ecosystems and moving away from hollow narratives. TRUE leads this trend as the clearest example of Web3 backed by real-world revenue, signaling a new phase where blockchain utility converges with established business models. Legacy players like Polkadot and Litecoin show that longevity still counts when fundamentals are solid. Meanwhile, Aptos, Aster, and ICP continue to drive technical innovation — and Pudgy Penguins keeps cultural momentum alive in a cooling NFT market. If the next bull cycle is built on sustainability rather than speculation, these seven projects could define it.

53814677,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=848843,1761811026,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53814677.jpeg,Binance.US responds to Senator Murphy over TRUMP coin allegations,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/binance-senator-murphy-trump-coin-promotion/,"Binance.US has bashed claims from US Senator Chris Murphy, accusing the exchange of favoring President Donald Trump-related assets, following its decision to list stablecoin USD1. On Wednesday, Binance.US defended its listing of USD1, the stablecoin issued by Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial, after Senator Murphy wrote a message on X yesterday claiming the exchange was promoting the asset because of Trump’s business relationship with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. As reported by Cryptopolitan last week, Trump granted a presidential pardon to Zhao, who had been previously convicted of violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, wrote on X that the USD1 listing is “payback” for the pardon. “One week after Trump pardoned Binance’s owner for a stunning array of crimes related to terrorist and sex predator financing, Binance started promoting Trump crypto. The White House is a full-time, 24/7 corruption machine,” he wrote. In a statement replying to the Liberal Senator, Binance.US said its listing decisions are subject to a rigorous review process. “We conduct comprehensive due diligence and legal review before listing any asset on Binance US, whether it’s a stablecoin, a new ecosystem project, or a meme token,” the firm reiterated . Binance US: Business decision unfairly politicized The exchange’s US arm noted that both USD1 and WLFI are already listed on more than 20 major exchanges, including Coinbase, Robinhood, and Kraken. “These assets have both been approved for some time by our listing committee in its ordinary course of business,” the statement continued. “To be clear, this was a business decision on the part of Binance US and nothing more. It’s unfortunate that even routine business decisions are now unfairly politicized by our elected officials.” On paper, the listing on Binance.US is meant to be an expansion of stablecoin options for US traders. However, it became politically charged after Zhao’s pardon, which opponents of the Trump administration insist is an example of undue influence by powerful crypto interests. Zhao, who co-founded Binance in 2017, pleaded guilty in 2023 to failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering program. The plea was part of a settlement in which Binance admitted to criminal charges and agreed to pay more than $4.3 billion in penalties to the US government. The Binance co-founder personally paid a $50 million fine and served four months in federal prison before being released last year. On Monday, Representative Rohit Khanna of California’s 17th congressional district accused Trump of engaging in open corruption in an interview with CNBC. “You’ve got a foreign billionaire who was basically engaged in money laundering, having money go to Hamas, having money go to Iran, having money go to child abusers. He was convicted. He served four years in prison. And then he petitions for a pardon from Donald Trump after basically funneling money to terrorists,” the 49-year-old California Rep asserted. The pardon of Zhao is corrupt. I explain simply what's going on. I am today introducing legislation to ban the president, his family, members of Congress, and all elected officials from trading crypto or stocks. @unusual_whales has been sounding the alarm on this for years. pic.twitter.com/OgibgdnqkK — Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) October 27, 2025 Khanna propounded that Zhao offered financial support to World Liberty and, in return, received a pardon. “Donald Trump gives him a pardon while he’s basically financing Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency stablecoin. It is so illegal. It is right in our faces,” he said. Do Trump’s businesses present a conflict of interest? At the start of his first term, Trump refused to divest his assets or place them in a blind trust, a departure from modern presidential norms established by figures like Jimmy Carter, who sold his peanut farm to avoid conflicts. The US President placed his holdings in a trust controlled by his family, with himself as the sole beneficiary. During his first tenure at the Oval Office, he faced repeated accusations of profiting from foreign and domestic interests, including visits from officials representing 20 foreign governments to Trump-owned properties. The Secret Service reportedly spent more than $10 million on lodging at his hotels. After winning back the top seat in the US, Trump agreed to hand everything over to a trust managed by his sons, although naysayers believe he is making decisions that are directly benefitting the companies. “Such unprecedented disregard for time-honored ethical boundaries was shocking at the time. Now it looks merely quaint,” said Danielle Caputo, senior legal counsel for ethics at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit watchdog group. “With this new administration, there’s not just a disregard for ethics rules, there’s contempt.” Get seen where it counts.

53814582,616449,1761811243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53814582.jpeg,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows Flip Positive, But Demand Still Muted: Glassnode",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-inflows-positive-demand-muted-glassnode/,"On-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out how Bitcoin spot ETF inflows are still not at the intensity seen during previous rallies this cycle. Bitcoin Spot ETF Inflows Are Currently Under 1,000 BTC Per Day In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the inflows of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . The spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to an asset’s price movements without having to directly own it. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot ETFs for Bitcoin back in January 2024. Whenever a trader invests into one of these products, the fund buys and holds BTC on their behalf. This means that an investor of a spot ETF never has to deal with anything involving the blockchain, like an exchange or wallet. This convenience of these investment vehicles has made them a popular mode of exposure for cryptocurrencies among the traditional investors. Institutional entities , in particular, prefer to invest through these regulated products. The netflow related to the spot ETFs can, therefore, be worth keeping an eye on, as the trend in it may contain information about how institutions are feeling about Bitcoin. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows how the BTC US spot ETF netflow has changed over the past year. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin spot ETF netflow fell into the negative territory earlier in the month, indicating that capital was flowing out of these funds. This phase of outflows coincided with the cryptocurrency’s decline toward $104,000. The price recovery that has followed since then, however, has brought with it a renewal of inflows into the spot ETFs. Thus, it would appear that demand for the asset has made a comeback. That said, the netflow is currently still sitting at a positive level below 1,000 BTC per day. For comparison, other major rallies in this cycle started with inflows above 2,500 BTC per day. “Demand is recovering, but not at the intensity of recent rallies,” concluded Glassnode. The spot ETF netflow isn’t the only indicator that’s hinting at weak demand among institutions. As CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post , the Coinbase Premium Gap is also relatively neutral at the moment. The Coinbase Premium Gap tracks the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). Coinbase is the preferred cryptocurrency exchange of the US institutional entities, including being the custodian for the spot ETFs themselves. A positive value on the metric can imply Coinbase users are currently applying a higher amount of buying pressure compared to Binance traders. Recent rallies involved such a trend, but the metric is sitting at just neutral values right now. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $112,400, up 3.5% over the last week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin demand|Bitcoin ETF Inflows|Bitcoin Spot ETFs|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-30 08:00:43

Do This Now,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-xrp-is-about-to-explode-do-this-now/,"Crypto analyst Ripple Bull Winkle has signaled that technical indicators on the XRP chart are aligning to form a decisive accumulation pattern. In an attached video, he urged viewers to focus on a sequence of timing and price signals that, in his view, indicate systematic buying pressure and repeated successful retests of support. He described the price action as orderly and repeatedly defended on dips, and characterized the recent formation as preparatory for a significant upward move in the token’s price . #XRP IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE! (DO THIS NOW)!!! pic.twitter.com/ydmBi98r6v — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 27, 2025 Market behavior, as presented by the analyst The analyst emphasized that recent pullbacks have been met with consistent buying and that multiple technical signals are converging simultaneously. He argued these signals are not isolated noise but instead represent coordinated accumulation by market participants. The narrative presented in the video stresses that momentum is building and that traders should be alert to a near-term breakout if the technical setup happens as portrayed. Political developments cited as reinforcing catalysts Alongside the technical analysis, the analyst connected market optimism to recent public events involving Ripple as a company. He referenced the firm’s inclusion on a disclosed list of private donors to the White House ballroom project and the announcement that a White House digital assets representative will appear on a Ripple conference keynote stage. Media reports and the donor list confirm that Ripple appears among contributors to the privately funded White House ballroom initiative, a development widely reported across outlets. The company also publicly announced that a White House digital assets official will join its Swell conference as a keynote speaker. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Assessment and implications for traders The analyst positioned the combination of technical accumulation and heightened institutional visibility as a compound signal that could influence short-to-medium-term market sentiment. He urged market participants to recognize the technical setup and the potential for outside developments to act as reinforcement. The presentation framed these elements as a cautionary alert to traders: monitor the chart for confirmation of the technical breakout and consider risk management in the event the anticipated momentum fails to materialize. Ripple Bull Winkle’s video links a technical read of the XRP chart with recent public developments involving the company to make a case for an imminent price move. The account offered a clear call to attention rather than a guarantee, presenting chart structure and external visibility as the primary reasons for heightened vigilance among traders. Media coverage of the donor disclosures and the announced White House speaker appearance corroborates the contextual facts referenced by the analyst.

In 2025, several licensed crypto exchanges now support SEPA and SEPA Instant transfers, letting European users fund their accounts and purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins quickly — and at transparent rates. Below, we review the best regulated platforms for buying crypto through SEPA transfers, what makes them reliable, and how to use them safely. Why Choose a Licensed Crypto Exchange Platform Using a regulated exchange or payment service ensures that your card transactions are processed securely and that both your funds and data are protected. Here’s what sets licensed platforms apart: Regulatory oversight — ensures transparency and AML/KYC compliance. Better security — card transactions are encrypted and monitored. Fewer hidden fees — clear exchange rates and fee breakdowns. Consumer protection — compliance with EU financial and payment rules. If you plan to buy crypto frequently, choosing a regulated service can help you avoid unnecessary costs and risk. How SEPA Crypto Purchases Work Choose a licensed exchange or platform that supports SEPA deposits. Verify your identity (KYC) — required by all regulated providers. Link your euro bank account and get an assigned deposit reference. Send EUR via SEPA from your bank app. Buy crypto — once funds arrive (often instantly), purchase any supported token. Most platforms credit funds within minutes if both banks support SEPA Instant, or within one business day for standard SEPA transfers. Top Licensed Platforms for Buying Crypto via SEPA 1. Clapp — All-in-One Licensed Platform for Instant Crypto Purchases Clapp.finance is one of the most seamless and compliant options to buy crypto directly in euros using SEPA or SEPA Instant. Licensed as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in the Czech Republic, Clapp offers instant card purchases for major assets such as BTC, ETH, USDT, and popular DeFi tokens. What sets Clapp apart is its integrated ecosystem: users can buy crypto, manage portfolios, rebalance automatically, and even convert assets back to euros through SEPA withdrawals — all within one secure app. Security is handled by Fireblocks, the institutional-grade custody provider trusted by major banks and exchanges. Why choose Clapp: EU-licensed and compliant Fireblocks-secured wallet Real-time rates sourced from multiple liquidity providers Fiat on/off-ramp integration (SEPA & SEPA Instant) Best for: Users who value regulatory assurance and simplicity in one unified app. 2. Coinbase — The Simplest Card Gateway Coinbase remains one of the most beginner-friendly exchanges for card purchases. It supports Visa and Mastercard payments across most European countries and delivers instant crypto settlement. Fees are higher (around 3.99% per transaction), but Coinbase’s trusted brand, strong security, and simple interface make it an excellent option for newcomers to crypto. Best for: First-time buyers who want a familiar, regulated entry point. 3. Binance — Fast Purchases with Global Reach Binance supports credit and debit card payments in EUR, alongside Apple Pay and Google Pay options.

Top Platforms for Buying Crypto via SEPA Platform Regulatory Status Fees / Spread Best For Clapp EU VASP License (CZ) Competitive Regulated all-in-one app Coinbase Licensed in EU / US ~3.99% Beginners Binance Multiple EU registrations 1.8–2.5% Active traders Bitstamp Licensed (Luxembourg CSSF) Transparent, ~2% Conservative investors Kraken US & EU regulated ~1.5–2% Professional users OKX Global licenses Low spreads Cost-focused users Revolut Licensed fintech (UK & EU) ~1–2% Everyday buyers Tips for Safe Crypto Purchases Use trusted, licensed exchanges only. Avoid platforms that don’t display regulatory information. Check for hidden conversion spreads. A “0% fee” may still include inflated exchange rates. Verify your card provider’s crypto policy. Some banks block direct crypto transactions. Enable two-factor authentication to secure your account and prevent unauthorized access. Avoid using credit cards for leveraged purchases. Treat crypto buying as investment, not credit spending. Final Thoughts SEPA transfers remain the most efficient and compliant way for Europeans to buy crypto. In 2025, platforms such as Clapp , Kraken, and Bitstamp offer regulated, transparent, and secure access — while Binance and Revolut deliver unmatched speed and convenience. For investors who value both compliance and control, SEPA-based buying bridges the gap between traditional banking and digital assets — reliably, affordably, and fast.

Buying Bitcoin is fast and simple — but converting BTC into euros or other fiat currencies safely and efficiently can still be confusing. In 2025, however, a growing range of regulated crypto off-ramps now makes this process as simple as any online banking transaction. Below, we explain how BTC-to-bank transfers work, what to check before cashing out, and which platforms offer the smoothest, safest experience for European users. How BTC-to-Fiat Transfers Work A crypto off-ramp is a service that lets you sell Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies) for fiat currency — euros, dollars, pounds — and withdraw directly to your bank account. Here’s the simplified flow: Sell BTC for fiat (EUR or USD) using an exchange or bridge platform. Verify your identity (KYC) if required by the provider. Link your bank account via SEPA, SWIFT, or card payout. Withdraw funds — usually within one business day, or instantly with SEPA Instant. Most modern platforms combine this process into a few clicks. The main differences come down to fees, speed, licensing, and withdrawal options. What to Look For in a Crypto Off-Ramp Before transferring BTC to your bank account, consider these factors: Regulation: Always use licensed exchanges or payment providers. Speed: Look for SEPA Instant or card withdrawal options for faster access. Fees and spreads: Hidden conversion costs can eat into profits. Limits: Verify daily and monthly withdrawal caps. Security: Use platforms that store crypto with institutional-grade custody. Best Crypto Off-Ramps for BTC-to-Bank Transfers in 2025 1. Clapp — Regulated, Secure, and Fully Integrated Clapp.finance offers one of the most streamlined BTC-to-fiat experiences in Europe. Operating under a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in the Czech Republic, Clapp connects crypto management, fiat conversion, and Fireblocks-secured storage under one roof. Users can sell BTC directly to EUR and withdraw via SEPA or SEPA Instant transfers. Liquidity is sourced from multiple providers to ensure the best real-time rates. Beyond an off-ramp feature, Clapp includes portfolio management tools, rebalancing automation, and customizable portfolios for long-term investors. Best for: Investors seeking a compliant, all-in-one crypto platform with reliable fiat access. 2. Kraken — Transparent and Reliable Kraken is one of the most trusted exchanges globally and offers BTC/EUR pairs with deep liquidity. European users can sell Bitcoin and withdraw directly to their bank accounts through SEPA transfers. Withdrawals typically complete within 24 hours, and trading fees remain among the lowest in the market (0.16–0.26 %). Kraken’s strong regulatory record and clear fee structure make it a favorite for professional investors and institutions. Best for: Users who prioritize transparency and reliability. 3. Binance — Fast Card Withdrawals and SEPA Support Binance provides multiple BTC off-ramp methods: SEPA transfers, instant card withdrawals, and P2P marketplace sales. The exchange’s “Sell-to-Card” feature allows near-instant euro payouts, making it one of the fastest bridges for BTC-to-cash conversion. While card withdrawals incur a small fee (around 1.8–2 %), SEPA transfers are cheaper and usually processed the same day. Best for: Active users and traders who value speed and flexibility. 4. Bitstamp — Europe’s Oldest Regulated Exchange Bitstamp, founded in 2011, remains a staple among European crypto investors. It supports direct BTC → EUR sales and SEPA withdrawals with transparent pricing — a €3 withdrawal fee and competitive trading rates. The platform’s focus on compliance and long-term stability appeals to investors who prefer regulation and simplicity over complex features. Best for: Long-term holders seeking a steady, secure off-ramp. 5. Coinbase — User-Friendly Fiat Withdrawals Coinbase has built its reputation on simplicity. Users can sell BTC for euros directly in-app and withdraw to linked bank accounts through SEPA transfers or debit cards. Fees are higher (around 1 % plus spread), but the platform’s reliability, mobile experience, and strong customer support make it a go-to choice for newcomers. Best for: Beginners and everyday users looking for convenience. 6. OKX — Competitive Rates and Global Reach OKX supports BTC-to-EUR conversions with low spreads and high liquidity. Its interface caters to both retail and professional traders, and European users can withdraw euros through SEPA and third-party partners. OKX’s broad network ensures competitive pricing across major crypto pairs, while maintaining solid security and compliance credentials. Best for: Users looking for competitive conversion rates and advanced features. 7. Revolut — Instant Banking App Conversion Revolut is not a traditional exchange but offers one of the easiest ways to convert BTC to EUR within a mobile banking app. Users can sell Bitcoin directly, and funds appear instantly in their Revolut account. The convenience comes with slightly higher spreads, but for small or frequent cash-outs, the ease of use outweighs the cost. Best for: Everyday users who want instant access to euros in a familiar fintech interface. Best Crypto Off-Ramps 2025 Platform Withdrawal Type Strength Best For Clapp SEPA / SEPA Instant Licensed, Fireblocks-secured, all-in-one app Retail users & professionals Kraken SEPA Transparent, highly regulated Advanced users Binance SEPA / Card Fastest withdrawals, large liquidity Active traders Bitstamp SEPA Reliable, long-standing EU exchange Conservative investors Coinbase SEPA / Card Simple UX, beginner-friendly Newcomers OKX SEPA / Partners Wide access, low fees Cost-conscious users Revolut Internal account Instant, mobile-first Everyday users Tips for Smooth BTC Bank Withdrawals Check your bank’s crypto policy: Some banks restrict or delay crypto-related transfers. Use SEPA Instant when possible: It can settle in seconds within the EU. Withdraw moderate amounts first: Test transaction speed and fees. Keep transaction records: For compliance and tax reporting. Enable 2FA and verified accounts: Security first — especially for large withdrawals. Final Thoughts Cashing out Bitcoin has never been easier — provided you choose the right bridge. In 2025, platforms like Clapp , Kraken, and Bitstamp lead the pack for secure, compliant, and user-friendly BTC-to-bank transfers. Whether you prioritize speed, regulatory assurance, or simplicity, there’s a trusted option to fit your needs. Just remember: always verify withdrawal fees, limits, and your bank’s compatibility before selling. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Arthur Hayes, the outspoken co-founder of BitMEX, recently ignited significant discussion on X by declaring Zcash (ZEC) an “unstoppable train.” His bold forecast suggests that ZEC could skyrocket to an astonishing $10,000. Arthur Hayes’ Bold Zcash Price Prediction: An Unstoppable Train? Arthur Hayes is known for his sharp market insights and sometimes provocative statements. On X, he emphatically stated that “nothing can stop the Zcash (ZEC) train,” directly implying an inevitable and significant upward movement for the privacy-focused cryptocurrency. This isn’t his first optimistic take on ZEC; he had previously shared positive sentiments about Zcash’s potential on October 26. Hayes’s confidence stems from a deep understanding of market dynamics and the inherent value propositions of various digital assets. When a figure of his caliber makes such a strong Zcash price prediction , it naturally captures the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. His conviction suggests underlying factors he believes will propel ZEC to new heights. Understanding Zcash (ZEC): Why Privacy Matters To appreciate Hayes’s perspective, it is important to understand what Zcash is. Zcash (ZEC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency that offers enhanced privacy and selective transparency of transactions. It achieves this through advanced cryptographic techniques, specifically zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs). Here’s what makes Zcash stand out: Shielded Transactions: Users can choose to send ZEC with complete privacy, where the sender, receiver, and transaction amount remain confidential. Zero-Knowledge Proofs: This technology allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. Transparency Option: Zcash also supports transparent transactions, similar to Bitcoin, offering flexibility for users. In an increasingly digital world, the demand for financial privacy is growing. Zcash aims to meet this demand by providing a robust, secure, and verifiable private digital cash system. This fundamental utility is often cited as a key driver for its long-term value. The Mechanism Behind Hayes’ Zcash Price Prediction What could be fueling Arthur Hayes’s belief in this remarkable Zcash price prediction ? While he did not elaborate on specific catalysts in his brief post, several factors might contribute to such an optimistic outlook: Increasing Demand for Privacy: As digital surveillance becomes more prevalent, individuals and institutions may increasingly seek out cryptocurrencies that offer true privacy. Zcash is a leader in this niche. Limited Supply and Halving Cycles: Like Bitcoin, Zcash has a capped supply and undergoes halving events, which reduce the rate of new ZEC entering circulation. Scarcity can drive up value over time. Technological Advancements: Continuous development and improvements to Zcash’s protocol, including scalability and usability enhancements, could attract more users and developers. Broader Market Bull Runs: In a general cryptocurrency bull market, even niche assets like Zcash often see significant gains as capital flows across the ecosystem. Hayes’s prediction likely considers a confluence of these elements, positioning Zcash as a high-potential asset in the evolving crypto landscape. He understands the power of narrative and technological utility. Challenges and Opportunities for Zcash’s Future While the prospect of a $10,000 ZEC is exciting, it is important to consider both the opportunities and challenges ahead. Every ambitious Zcash price prediction must navigate real-world hurdles. Opportunities: Mainstream Adoption: As privacy becomes a more accepted and demanded feature in finance, Zcash could see wider adoption. Institutional Interest: If institutions begin to value privacy features, Zcash could attract significant capital. Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulations could provide a framework for privacy coins to operate, fostering growth. Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: Privacy coins often face challenges from regulators concerned about illicit activities. Competition: Other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and layer-2 solutions are emerging, creating a competitive landscape. Usability: Shielded transactions can sometimes be more complex for average users, impacting adoption rates. The path to $10,000 is not without obstacles, but Zcash’s dedicated community and ongoing development efforts are geared towards overcoming these challenges. What Does This Zcash Price Prediction Mean for You? Arthur Hayes’s bold Zcash price prediction serves as a compelling talking point and a reminder of the speculative nature of the crypto market. For individuals considering Zcash or any cryptocurrency, it is crucial to conduct thorough research and understand the associated risks. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Do not rely solely on predictions, even from influential figures. Understand Zcash’s technology, use cases, and market position. Consider Diversification: Avoid putting all your capital into one asset. Diversifying your portfolio can help mitigate risk. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Hayes’s call highlights Zcash’s potential, but informed decision-making remains paramount for any investor. Arthur Hayes’s declaration that Zcash is an “unstoppable train” and his $10,000 Zcash price prediction has certainly injected excitement into the crypto community. This bold forecast underscores the unique value proposition of Zcash as a privacy-centric cryptocurrency. While the journey to such a lofty price target will undoubtedly involve challenges, Zcash’s foundational technology and the growing demand for digital privacy position it as a cryptocurrency with significant long-term potential. As always, market dynamics are complex, and while expert opinions offer valuable perspectives, individual due diligence is key. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Arthur Hayes and why is his Zcash price prediction significant? A1: Arthur Hayes is the co-founder of BitMEX, a prominent cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. His predictions are significant due to his extensive experience, deep market understanding, and influence within the crypto community. Q2: What makes Zcash (ZEC) different from other cryptocurrencies? A2: Zcash distinguishes itself through its advanced privacy features, primarily shielded transactions powered by zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs). This allows users to conduct transactions with optional confidentiality regarding sender, receiver, and amount. Q3: Is a $10,000 Zcash price prediction realistic? A3: While highly ambitious, a $10,000 Zcash price prediction reflects a significant belief in ZEC’s long-term potential, driven by factors like increasing demand for privacy, limited supply, and technological advancements. However, it is a speculative target and depends on numerous market conditions and adoption rates. Q4: What are the main challenges Zcash faces? A4: Zcash faces challenges such as regulatory scrutiny concerning privacy coins, competition from other privacy-focused projects, and the ongoing need to improve user experience for shielded transactions to foster broader adoption. Q5: Should I invest in Zcash based on this prediction? A5: Any investment decision should be based on your own thorough research (DYOR), understanding of the risks involved, and personal financial situation. While expert predictions can be insightful, they are not financial advice. It’s wise to consider diversification and only invest what you can afford to lose.

Key Takeaways: 21Shares seeks SEC approval for a fund tracking the HYPE token, signaling growing institutional demand for altcoin exposure. Asset manager Bitwise recently filed for a similar product. Strong trading volumes in new Solana, Litecoin, and Hedera ETFs show Wall Street’s appetite for altcoin-linked products. According to the filing submitted Wednesday , the proposed 21Shares Hyperliquid ETF will track the native token of the Hyperliquid perpetual futures protocol and blockchain. The document did not specify a ticker symbol or management fee, though it listed Coinbase Custody and BitGo Trust as custodians. Asset Managers Race to Launch Hyperliquid ETFs as HYPE Token Surges The move comes just weeks after Bitwise filed for a similar Hyperliquid ETF , underscoring intensifying competition among asset managers to capture investor demand for exposure to decentralized trading ecosystems. The HYPE token powers Hyperliquid’s decentralized exchange, offering users fee discounts and serving as the gas token for its blockchain. Its price has climbed steadily this year, mirroring the protocol’s rising trading volume and user base. The filing arrives as Wall Street’s interest in altcoin-based ETFs continues to grow. In recent days, Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) has drawn strong market attention , posting $72 million in trading volume on its second day, according to Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, who called the figure “a huge number” and a sign of sustained investor engagement beyond debut hype. $BSOL did more volume on Day Two.. $72m is a huge number. Good sign. pic.twitter.com/KpTbiQxZnv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 29, 2025 BSOL launched Tuesday alongside Canary Capital’s Litecoin (LTC) and Hedera (HBAR) ETFs . It recorded $55.4 million in first-day trading, making it the largest crypto ETF debut of 2025. Meanwhile, Grayscale joined the fray with the Grayscale Solana Trust ETF (GSOL), which began trading Wednesday with $4 million in volume. While smaller than Bitwise’s launch, Balchunas said GSOL’s performance was still “healthy” and competitive given its timing. The SEC’s review of 21Shares’ Hyperliquid ETF will determine whether another altcoin-focused product joins the fast-growing roster of US-listed crypto ETFs in 2025. Bitcoin ETFs See $470M Outflows as BTC Slips Below $110K After Fed Rate Cut US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $470 million in outflows on Wednesday, marking their worst day of the week as Bitcoin briefly dropped to $108,000 before recovering, according to Farside Investors. Fidelity’s FBTC led the withdrawals with $164 million, followed by ARK Invest’s ARKB at $143 million and BlackRock’s IBIT at $88 million. The setback follows two strong sessions earlier in the week, when the products collectively attracted over $350 million in inflows. Total cumulative net inflows have now fallen to $61 billion, while assets under management have slipped to $149 billion, representing about 6.75% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization, according to SoSoValue. Bitcoin’s price action mirrored the ETF outflows, trading between $108,201 and $113,567 over the past 24 hours. The drop came despite the US Federal Reserve’s 25 basis-point rate cut, though sentiment appeared to improve slightly after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping eased investor concerns over trade tensions.

53815121,https://cryptonews.com/?p=445448,1761812255,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53815121.jpeg,AUSTRAC Puts CryptoLink on Notice After Finding ‘Weaknesses’ in AML Framework,https://cryptonews.com/news/austrac-puts-cryptolink-on-notice-after-finding-weaknesses-in-aml-framework/,"Australian financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, has slapped a AU$56,340 fine (US$37,085) on crypto ATM operator CryptoLink on Thursday. The action comes after the regulator’s Crypto Taskforce, established last year, found late reporting of large cash transactions and “weaknesses” in CryptoLink’s AML rules. AUSTRAC has sent an infringement notice to the crypto firm, to make sure “useable intelligence does not slip through the cracks,” AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said in an official statement . “The infringement notice addresses previous non-compliance around reporting and the enforceable undertaking seeks assurance that CryptoLink has improved its risk assessments and strengthened its AML/CTF controls.” Crypto ATMs Become “High Risk Money Laundering Channels” in Australia: AUSTRAC As reported earlier by Cryptonews , Australia experienced a drastic surge in Bitcoin ATM installations over the past few years. As of August 2024, Australia hosted approximately 1,608 Bitcoin ATMs, which has now risen to 2,000, per CoinTimeATM data. Early this month, AUSTRAC said it uncovered “a hidden world of scams and dodgy dealings,” from several kiosks. “They pose serious risks for scams and money laundering, with dozens of scam victims identified,” it said. “Scams are one of the biggest drivers of suspicious activity and criminals have been using crypto ATMs to move and cash out stolen funds,” Thomas noted. CryptoLink to Engage Third-Party Reviewers The financial crime agency has mandated CryptoLink to engage third-party reviewers for validating its entire required transactions to AUSTRAC. Additionally, the reviewers will assess if CryptoLink has implemented effective controls for large cash transactions and its AML and terrorism financing risk assessment. “Cryptolink has fully cooperated with AUSTRAC and paid the infringement notice in full,” the announcement read. AUSTRAC CEO Thomas said that the agency will work with digital currency exchanges “to harden the sector against exploitation.” He added that the regulator will take action if crypto operators fail to take risks seriously.
