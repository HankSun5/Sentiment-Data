According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, the premier digital asset reached a trading price of $96,020.22 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This move represents a crucial psychological and technical threshold for the asset, fueling intense analysis and discussion across financial sectors. Consequently, this price action signals a potential new phase in the ongoing market cycle, drawing comparisons to previous bull market structures. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Breaking Down the $96,000 Rally The ascent to $96,020.22 did not occur in isolation. Market data reveals a consistent upward trajectory over the preceding week, characterized by strong buying volume and resilient support levels. Analysts immediately scrutinized on-chain metrics for context. For instance, exchange net flows showed a notable decrease, suggesting accumulation by long-term holders rather than speculative short-term trading. Furthermore, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index, a popular sentiment gauge, entered “Extreme Greed” territory, a typical characteristic of strong bullish phases. However, seasoned observers note that such readings often precede increased volatility. Several technical factors converged to enable this breakout. Firstly, Bitcoin had consolidated for several days above the key $92,000 support level, building energy for an upward move. Secondly, a decisive break above the $94,500 resistance, which had capped previous attempts, triggered a cascade of buy orders. The rally’s momentum was subsequently amplified by liquidations of leveraged short positions on major derivatives exchanges. This created a classic “short squeeze,” propelling the price higher with accelerated velocity. Comparative Market Performance Table Asset Price (USD) 24h Change Key Support Level Bitcoin (BTC) $96,020.22 +5.8% $92,000 Ethereum (ETH) $7,850.41 +4.2% $7,500 Solana (SOL) $385.67 +8.1% $350 Contextual Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Macroeconomic conditions continue to play a foundational role in digital asset valuations. The current rally aligns with a period of renewed institutional adoption. Major asset managers have recently expanded their spot Bitcoin ETF offerings, facilitating easier access for traditional finance capital. Simultaneously, ongoing discussions about potential central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have paradoxically heightened public and institutional interest in decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin. This institutional narrative provides a fundamentally different backdrop compared to previous retail-driven cycles. On-chain activity provides further evidence of a maturing market. The hash rate, a measure of network security and miner commitment, remains near all-time highs, indicating robust underlying infrastructure. Additionally, activity on the Bitcoin Lightning Network for small payments has grown steadily, demonstrating utility beyond pure speculation. Regulatory clarity in several major jurisdictions has also reduced systemic uncertainty for large investors. These factors collectively create a more stable foundation for price appreciation than in earlier, more volatile eras. Institutional Inflows: Spot Bitcoin ETFs report consistent net positive inflows for the quarter. Macro Hedge: Some investors view BTC as a hedge against potential currency devaluation. Supply Dynamics: The upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024 continues to influence long-term supply models. Expert Perspective on Market Sustainability Financial analysts emphasize the importance of volume in validating the breakout. “A price move of this magnitude must be supported by proportional trading volume to be considered sustainable,” notes a market strategist from a leading crypto research firm. “The volume profile we observed during the climb past $96,000 was convincing, but the key test will be the formation of a new support base.” Historical data shows that after similar major breakouts, Bitcoin often experiences a period of retest and consolidation before establishing a new trading range. Market participants are now closely watching whether the $94,500-$95,000 zone can transition from resistance to support. Historical Precedents and Future Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey past $96,000 invites comparison to previous cycles. The asset first surpassed $1,000 in 2013, $10,000 in 2017, and $60,000 in 2021. Each milestone was followed by a period of heightened volatility and eventual market revaluation. The current price places Bitcoin’s market capitalization well over $1.8 trillion, solidifying its position as a major global financial asset class. This growth trajectory reflects a compounding network effect, where increased adoption drives utility and value, which in turn drives further adoption. The path forward likely depends on several interconnected variables. Global liquidity conditions, as influenced by central bank policies, remain a primary external factor. Internally, network development progress, such as upgrades to improve scalability and privacy, will affect long-term utility perceptions. The behavior of long-term holders, often called “HODLers,” will be critical; if they begin distributing coins at these prices, it could create significant sell-side pressure. Conversely, continued holding would indicate strong conviction in even higher future valuations. Conclusion Bitcoin’s surge above $96,000 marks a definitive moment in the 2025 financial landscape. This Bitcoin price achievement is underpinned by a complex mix of technical breakout dynamics, strengthening institutional participation, and a shifting macroeconomic backdrop. While market sentiment is euphoric, historical patterns advise cautious monitoring of volatility and support levels. The BTC $96,000 level now serves as a new benchmark, setting the stage for the next chapter in digital asset evolution. Ultimately, this milestone reinforces Bitcoin’s enduring narrative as a transformative, albeit volatile, store of value and technological innovation. FAQs Q1: What was the exact Bitcoin price when it crossed $96,000? According to Bitcoin World market data, BTC reached a price of $96,020.22 on the Binance USDT market during this rally. Q2: What typically happens after Bitcoin hits a major new price high? Historically, new all-time highs are often followed by increased volatility, a period of profit-taking, and an attempt to establish the previous resistance level as a new support zone. The market then seeks direction based on fresh catalysts. Q3: Are other cryptocurrencies rising alongside Bitcoin? Yes, major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) often experience correlated positive momentum during broad market rallies, though the magnitude of gains can vary based on individual asset narratives. Q4: What does “short squeeze” mean in this context? A short squeeze occurs when traders who have bet on the price falling (short positions) are forced to buy back the asset to limit their losses as the price rises rapidly. This forced buying can accelerate the upward price movement. Q5: How does the current rally compare to Bitcoin’s 2021 bull market? The current environment features greater institutional involvement through regulated ETFs, more developed market infrastructure, and a different macroeconomic setting (e.g., interest rate environment). While volatility persists, the participant base and market maturity have evolved significantly.

Kirk West, arrested last year, now claims he is a victim and is entitled to a significant portion of the very assets he is accused of stealing. This complex case, first reported by Decrypt and Rolling Stone, intertwines grief, romance, digital finance, and alleged betrayal, offering a stark lesson in crypto asset security. XRP Theft Case Takes Unexpected Legal Turn The legal saga centers on Nancy Jones, widow of the legendary singer George Jones, who passed away in 2013. According to court documents, Kirk West approached Nancy Jones after her husband’s death, initially expressing interest in purchasing the Jones family home. Subsequently, the two began a romantic relationship. West reportedly presented himself as a cryptocurrency investment expert during this time. The relationship ultimately soured, leading Nancy Jones to ask West to leave her home in early 2023. Following his departure, Nancy Jones made a distressing discovery. Her Ledger hardware wallet, a device used to securely store the private keys to her cryptocurrency holdings, was missing from a safe. This discovery triggered a legal and criminal investigation. Authorities arrested West on charges of stealing $400,000 in cash and 5.5 million XRP. At the time of the alleged theft, the XRP was worth approximately $11.6 million. Countersuit Alleges Fraud and Defamation In a dramatic reversal, Kirk West has now filed a civil countersuit against Nancy Jones. His legal claim presents a completely different narrative of the events. West alleges that his sound financial and cryptocurrency investment decisions were instrumental in building joint wealth during his relationship with Jones. Consequently, he argues he is entitled to half of the assets in question. West’s lawsuit frames him as a victim of fraud and defamation. He is seeking not just a portion of the contested XRP but also other substantial assets. His claim specifically includes: Approximately 483,000 XRP (currently valued over $1 million) still unrecovered. $5 million in gold and silver bullion and coins. $1 million in cash . Other precious metals and assets. This legal move complicates the ongoing criminal proceedings and introduces a contentious civil dispute over asset ownership. Cryptocurrency Security and Inheritance Challenges This case highlights critical, real-world issues at the intersection of cryptocurrency, estate planning, and personal security. Hardware wallets like Ledger are considered among the most secure methods for storing crypto assets because they keep private keys offline. However, their physical nature makes them susceptible to traditional theft if not stored in a truly secure location, such as a safety deposit box. Furthermore, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency valuations adds another layer of complexity. The 5.5 million XRP alleged to have been stolen was worth $11.6 million at the time but has fluctuated significantly since. Through prior legal action, Nancy Jones has recovered over five million XRP, but the remaining 483,000 XRP underscores the challenge of tracing and recovering digital assets once they move across the blockchain. Timeline of a High-Stakes Dispute Understanding the sequence of events is crucial for contextualizing this legal battle. The following timeline outlines the key milestones: Year Event 2013 Country music legend George Jones passes away. Post-2013 Kirk West approaches widow Nancy Jones; a romantic relationship begins. 2023 Relationship ends; West leaves the home; missing hardware wallet discovered. 2023 West arrested on charges of stealing cash and XRP worth ~$12M. 2023-2024 Nancy Jones recovers over 5 million XRP through legal channels. 2024 Kirk West files a countersuit claiming fraud, defamation, and asset rights. This timeline shows a relationship that spanned nearly a decade before deteriorating into serious criminal allegations and complex civil litigation. Broader Impact on Crypto and Legal Precedent This case is being closely watched by both the legal and cryptocurrency communities. It touches on several evolving areas of law. First, it tests how traditional concepts of theft, joint assets, and fiduciary duty apply to digital currencies like XRP. Second, the countersuit’s success or failure could set a precedent for how disputes over co-mingled cryptocurrency assets are adjudicated, especially when one party claims expertise. Experts in digital asset law note that cases like this emphasize the importance of clear, formal agreements for individuals managing crypto investments for others, even in personal relationships. The lack of such documentation often leads to protracted “he said, she said” legal battles. Additionally, the high-profile nature of the case, involving a celebrity widow, brings mainstream attention to the very real risks and complexities of cryptocurrency ownership and security. Conclusion The XRP theft case involving Nancy Jones and Kirk West has evolved from a straightforward allegation of cryptocurrency theft into a multifaceted legal war. With West’s shocking countersuit claiming fraud and a right to shared assets, the courts must now untangle deeply personal and financial histories. This case serves as a critical, high-stakes example of the intersection between digital finance and human relationships. Its outcome will not only determine the fate of millions in XRP and other assets but may also influence how similar disputes are handled in the future, underscoring the paramount importance of security and clear financial boundaries in the digital age. FAQs Q1: What is Kirk West accused of stealing from Nancy Jones? Kirk West was arrested and charged with stealing $400,000 in cash and 5.5 million XRP, a cryptocurrency, from Nancy Jones. The XRP was valued at approximately $11.6 million at the time of the alleged theft. Q2: What is Kirk West claiming in his new lawsuit? In his countersuit, Kirk West claims he is a victim of fraud and defamation. He alleges that his investment expertise helped build joint wealth during his relationship with Nancy Jones and that he is therefore entitled to half of the disputed assets, including cryptocurrency, cash, and precious metals. Q3: How much XRP has been recovered so far? Through legal action, Nancy Jones has recovered over five million of the 5.5 million XRP initially alleged to be stolen. Approximately 483,000 XRP, worth over $1 million at current prices, remains unrecovered. Q4: Why is this case significant for cryptocurrency owners? This case highlights the physical security risks of hardware wallets, the challenges of recovering stolen digital assets, and the legal complexities that can arise when cryptocurrency is involved in personal relationships without clear agreements. It underscores the need for robust security and formal financial planning with digital assets. Q5: What is a Ledger hardware wallet? A Ledger hardware wallet is a physical device that stores the private keys to cryptocurrency holdings offline. It is designed to be highly secure against online hacking attempts. However, as a physical object, it can be vulnerable to traditional theft if not stored in a secure location like a bank safety deposit box.

One recent contribution to this conversation came from community commentator Oscar Ramos, who addressed the topic by emphasizing that there is no universal standard for an ideal XRP holding. Instead, he argued that appropriate allocation depends on individual financial capacity, timing, and personal investment objectives. Ramos explained that many early XRP participants were able to build sizable positions primarily because they entered the market when prices were substantially lower. During periods when XRP traded below $1, accumulating large quantities required far less capital than it does today. This historical context, he suggested, often creates unrealistic comparisons between early adopters and newer investors who face higher entry costs. How Much XRP is actually Enough? My take, never 50 cents again. pic.twitter.com/pTBi7BWotp — Oscar Ramos (@realOscarRamos1) January 12, 2026 Early Accumulation Versus Current Market Reality To illustrate his point, Ramos referenced his own experience, noting that he accumulated a significant XRP position when prices were near $0.50 . At those levels, reaching a six-figure token balance required a capital commitment that, while still substantial, was far more accessible than it would be under current conditions. With XRP now trading around $2.07, achieving the same number of tokens would require more than four times the original investment. This comparison highlights how price appreciation alters perceptions of what constitutes a reasonable or attainable holding. A portfolio size that once appeared achievable may now seem out of reach for many market participants, not due to lack of conviction, but because of increased capital requirements. Cost Basis as a Key Influencing Factor According to Ramos, an investor’s cost basis plays a major role in shaping opinions about what amount of XRP is enough. Holdings that appear large today often reflect favorable entry points rather than extraordinary purchasing power. As XRP continues to mature and prices trend higher, the challenge of accumulating large quantities is likely to increase, reinforcing the importance of timing in long-term investment outcomes. He emphasized that newer investors should avoid anchoring their expectations to the experiences of those who entered the market years earlier. Market conditions evolve, and strategies that were viable in the past may not translate directly to the present environment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Personal Financial Capacity Over Community Benchmarks Rather than promoting a fixed numerical target, Ramos encouraged investors to determine their XRP exposure based on personal financial comfort and risk tolerance. He rejected the notion that portfolio size should function as a status symbol within the community, echoing similar views previously expressed by other XRP commentators. From this perspective, long-term success is more closely tied to disciplined strategy and informed decision-making than to matching the holdings of early adopters. He further noted that market participants enter at different stages of an asset’s lifecycle, and comparisons across entry points can be misleading. What matters most is whether an investment aligns with an individual’s broader financial plan. Broader Community Perspectives Ramos’s comments align with a range of opinions shared by other XRP-focused analysts over the past market cycle. Some observers have highlighted that relatively modest XRP holdings still place wallets high within distribution rankings, while others have outlined larger benchmarks for investors seeking greater exposure. These differing views underscore that holding targets are inherently subjective and shaped by assumptions about XRP’s future performance. While many community figures remain optimistic about XRP’s long-term potential, Ramos and others stress that accumulation decisions should not be driven solely by bullish expectations. Price appreciation is never guaranteed, and investors should evaluate risks carefully before committing capital. Ultimately, determining how much XRP is sufficient is a personal calculation that balances opportunity, affordability, and individual financial goals rather than adherence to any single benchmark.

Standard Chartered Global Head of Digital Assets Research, Geoffrey Kendrich, argues that Ethereum has found deeper relevance in this institution-led market cycle.

And Ethereum’s growing exposure could fuel it. Exchange-traded products and corporate treasury vehicles have created multiple touch points for demand in mainstream TradFi markets, making capital access broader and more persistent than in previous cycles. These drivers position 2026 as a year where adoption, sentiment, and capital flows converge, a backdrop Kendrick believes could mirror 2021-style outperformance, when the BTC-ETH ratio was around 0.08.

The Ethereum price has confirmed a local bottom at $2,750, forming higher lows in a fresh uptrend that solidifies the right shoulder. Momentum indicators add validity to the trend. The RSI is compressing against the 50 neutral line after several higher lows, suggesting strength beneath the surface. The MACD has also reversed towards the signal line in a potential golden cross setup, a sign that buyers may soon control the prevailing trend. A fully realized right shoulder targets the key breakout of the channel, past all-time highs around $4,950. With a channel breakout to follow, Kendrick’s 2028 expectations could be in focus at $18,000 – a 460% gain . But for 2026, the breakout path could see conservative targets surpassed, eying the $10,000 milestone for a 220% gain . Though this outcome likely hinges on traditional financial activity moving on-chain and expanding regulation outside of U.S. markets. However, a $100,000 Ethereum price is likely to be realized in the next decade if Ethereum infrastructure establishes itself for real-world use cases. Bitcoin Hyper: Bitcoin Can’t Be Ruled Out Just Yet Institutions that chose Ethereum as their TradFi bet may soon need to reconsider, as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally tackles its biggest limitation: scalability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana tech , creating a new Layer-2 network that unlocks scalable, efficient use cases Bitcoin couldn’t support on its own. Just Layer-2s like Ondo did for Ethereum, Bitcoin Hyper could bring Bitcoin deeper into the DeFi conversation. The project has already raised over $30 million in presale , and post-launch, even a small fraction of Bitcoin’s massive trading volume could send its valuation significantly higher. Bitcoin Hyper is fixing the slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability that have long capped Bitcoin’s potential – just as the market turns bullish.

This breakthrough follows months of intense negotiations and could potentially reshape how stablecoins operate within the United States financial system. The compromise represents a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency legislation that has faced numerous obstacles since its initial proposal. Stablecoin Interest Ban Compromise Reached According to a recent post on X by Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, Senate Republicans have reached agreement on the controversial stablecoin interest ban provision. This development comes after weeks of internal debate within Republican ranks about how to approach interest-bearing stablecoins. Terrett, a respected journalist covering digital asset policy, noted that some Democratic offices remain dissatisfied with the compromise terms. Consequently, the legislative path forward remains uncertain despite this Republican consensus. The compromise reportedly addresses concerns about consumer protection while attempting to preserve innovation in the digital asset space. Legislative staffers have worked extensively to balance these competing priorities. However, Terrett emphasized that it remains unconfirmed whether this compromise language has been incorporated into the final legislative text. The bill’s sponsors continue to negotiate with Democratic counterparts to achieve broader bipartisan support. Background of Stablecoin Legislation The stablecoin bill represents one of the most significant attempts to regulate digital assets in United States history. Lawmakers first introduced comprehensive stablecoin legislation in 2022 following the TerraUSD collapse. That event highlighted systemic risks within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Since then, multiple congressional committees have held hearings, drafted proposals, and debated appropriate regulatory frameworks. Key provisions in the current draft legislation include: Issuer requirements: Mandating specific capital and reserve standards Consumer protections: Establishing disclosure and transparency rules State vs. federal oversight: Determining regulatory jurisdiction Interest payment restrictions: The subject of the current compromise The interest payment provision has proven particularly contentious. Some lawmakers argue that interest-bearing stablecoins resemble unregulated securities. Others contend that reasonable interest payments represent legitimate financial innovation. This debate mirrors broader discussions about how to classify and regulate various digital assets. Expert Analysis of the Compromise Financial regulation experts note that the Republican compromise likely attempts to distinguish between different types of interest mechanisms. According to Dr. Marcus Chen, Professor of Financial Technology at Georgetown University, “The compromise probably creates a regulatory distinction between algorithmic yield and traditional interest payments. This distinction could allow certain stablecoin models to continue operating while restricting others.” Industry representatives have expressed cautious optimism about the development. Sarah Johnson, Director of Policy at the Digital Asset Alliance, stated, “While we haven’t seen the specific language, any movement toward clarity represents progress. The industry needs regulatory certainty to innovate responsibly.” However, consumer advocacy groups remain concerned about potential loopholes in any compromise language. Political Dynamics and Democratic Opposition Despite Republican agreement, Democratic offices reportedly maintain significant reservations about the compromise. According to multiple sources familiar with the negotiations, key Democratic senators worry that the compromise doesn’t provide adequate consumer protections. These concerns center on potential risks to retail investors who might not understand the complexities of interest-bearing digital assets. The political landscape complicates the legislative process further. With control of Congress divided between parties, bipartisan support becomes essential for passage. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s office has been particularly vocal about strengthening consumer protections in digital asset legislation. Meanwhile, more moderate Democrats seek balanced approaches that don’t stifle technological innovation. This dynamic creates a challenging negotiation environment. Legislative staffers must bridge significant policy differences while maintaining political viability. The upcoming election cycle adds additional pressure to either pass legislation quickly or delay until the next congressional session. Market Implications and Industry Response The cryptocurrency market has closely monitored stablecoin legislation developments. Major stablecoin issuers like Circle (USDC) and Tether (USDT) operate significant portions of their business within United States jurisdictions. Regulatory clarity could significantly impact their operations and market positions. Industry analysts suggest that clear regulations might actually benefit established players by creating barriers to entry. Market participants have expressed mixed reactions to news of the Republican compromise. Some view it as a positive step toward regulatory certainty. Others worry that interest restrictions might limit innovation and competitive offerings. The table below summarizes potential market impacts: Scenario Potential Market Impact Full interest ban Reduced stablecoin yields, possible market contraction Partial restrictions Continued innovation with guardrails, moderate growth No restrictions Maximum innovation potential, increased regulatory risk Regulatory uncertainty continues Market volatility, reduced institutional participation International considerations further complicate the regulatory landscape. Other jurisdictions, including the European Union and United Kingdom, have implemented their own stablecoin regulations. United States policymakers must consider global competitiveness while ensuring financial stability. This balance proves particularly challenging in fast-moving technological sectors. Historical Context and Legislative Timeline The current stablecoin legislation represents the culmination of years of congressional attention to digital assets. The legislative journey began in earnest after the 2021 President’s Working Group report on stablecoins. That report highlighted risks and recommended congressional action. Since then, multiple committees have developed competing proposals. Key milestones in stablecoin legislation include: July 2022: House Financial Services Committee advances first comprehensive bill September 2023: Senate Banking Committee holds series of stablecoin hearings January 2024: Bipartisan working group forms to negotiate compromise November 2024: Draft legislation circulates with interest restriction provisions March 2025: Republican compromise reached on interest payments This timeline demonstrates the complex, multi-year process of developing financial legislation. The technical nature of digital assets adds additional complexity to traditional legislative processes. Staffers with specialized knowledge in both technology and finance have become increasingly valuable during these negotiations. Conclusion Senate Republicans have reached a significant compromise on the stablecoin interest ban provision, marking a potential turning point in digital asset legislation. However, Democratic dissatisfaction and ongoing negotiations mean the final outcome remains uncertain. The stablecoin interest ban compromise represents just one piece of a larger regulatory puzzle that lawmakers must solve. Market participants, consumers, and innovators await final legislative language with keen interest. The coming weeks will determine whether this compromise becomes law or requires further modification. Regardless of the immediate outcome, the legislative process highlights growing recognition of digital assets’ importance in modern finance. FAQs Q1: What exactly does the stablecoin interest ban compromise involve? The specific language remains confidential, but it likely creates distinctions between different types of interest mechanisms on stablecoins, potentially allowing some models while restricting others based on their risk profiles and structures. Q2: Why are some Democratic offices dissatisfied with the Republican compromise? Democratic lawmakers reportedly believe the compromise doesn’t provide sufficient consumer protections, particularly regarding retail investors who might not fully understand the risks associated with interest-bearing digital assets. Q3: How might this legislation affect existing stablecoin issuers like Circle and Tether? Established issuers would need to adjust their operations to comply with new regulations, which could involve changing their interest payment structures or reserve requirements, potentially affecting their competitive positions. Q4: What happens if Congress doesn’t pass stablecoin legislation this session? Regulatory uncertainty would continue, potentially leading to increased state-level regulation, continued enforcement actions by federal agencies, and possible market volatility as participants operate without clear federal guidelines. Q5: How does United States stablecoin regulation compare to other countries? The European Union has implemented comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, while the United Kingdom has proposed its own framework. United States legislation attempts to balance similar consumer protection goals with innovation considerations.

XRP commentator Zach Rector described the progress as “massive for XRP,” highlighting the potential impact of the upcoming protocol enhancements. The discussion was sparked by a post from XRPL validator Vet, who shared updates on the ongoing development of the XRPL lending protocol. At the center of this effort is Ripple engineer Ed Hennis, leading work on XLS-66, a proposal designed to implement fixed-term lending directly on the ledger. Rector suggested that this evolution could significantly broaden XRP’s utility beyond its established payment use cases. Protocol Update and GitHub Progress Vet emphasized a recent GitHub merge, PR #6161, which refines XLS-66’s lending code. The update does not alter the protocol’s functionality but optimizes the implementation for efficiency and maintainability. Ed Hennis is cooking with the upcoming lending protocol for the XRP Ledger. pic.twitter.com/1oSXY6zyzm — Vet (@Vet_X0) January 12, 2026 The changes remove redundant code and improve processing efficiency, correct typographical errors, eliminate unused variables, simplify loan withdrawal and balance logic, and enhance documentation to align more closely with the XLS-66 specification. These improvements strengthen the foundational code, preparing XRPL’s lending functions for a smoother transition toward production readiness. Key Features of XLS-66 XLS-66 is designed to support uncollateralized, fixed-term loans with predetermined interest rates using pooled liquidity in on-chain vaults. Unlike most DeFi protocols that rely on overcollateralization, this approach allows predictable repayment schedules and interest structures. Borrowers can benefit from grace periods and are subject to penalties for late payments, while early repayment and overpayment are also supported. The system incorporates first-loss protection to reduce lender risk and provides full on-chain transparency without requiring custom smart contracts. By enabling these functions, XRPL could host structured credit markets using XRP and Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, expanding the ledger’s applications beyond traditional payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Integration With RippleX Framework XLS-66 builds on the previously proposed XLS-65 standard, which introduces Single Asset Vaults. These vaults pool deposits from multiple users while restricting each vault to a single asset, reducing cross-asset risk. XLS-66 layers lending capabilities atop these vaults, facilitating institutional-style credit issuance on-chain. While underwriting remains off-chain, enforcement occurs directly on the ledger, combining the security of on-chain settlement with institutional credit management practices. Implications for the XRP Community For over a decade, XRPL’s development has primarily focused on fast, low-cost, and reliable payments. Although this approach established XRP’s reputation in cross-border transactions , it limited the ledger’s competitiveness in DeFi markets. The addition of native lending represents a shift toward broader financial functionality. By embedding credit operations into the protocol, XRPL aims to increase liquidity, strengthen utility, and create new opportunities for institutional finance use cases. This context clarifies why XLS-66’s progress has attracted strong attention. Community members and observers see the update as an important step that positions XRP to play a larger role in on-chain credit markets, signaling a strategic evolution of the ledger’s capabilities.

The bill is being filed as the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act , a name that also appears in earlier House paperwork filed last year. Crypto: Bill Aims To Protect Non-Custodial Developers The draft would create a safe harbor for developers who do not control user funds, making liability turn on actual custody or control of assets rather than on the act of creating software. That change would mean node operators, protocol maintainers, and many open-source coders could avoid money-transmitter rules so long as they do not hold or direct users’ tokens. Writing code is not the same as controlling money and developers who build blockchain infrastructure without touching user funds shouldn’t be treated like banks. @RonWyden and I are ensuring that won’t happen. pic.twitter.com/9zIgh07e0b — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) January 12, 2026 Industry Pressure And A History Of Concern Reports have disclosed months of lobbying from exchanges, developer groups, and advocacy coalitions that urged lawmakers to clarify this point. Those groups warned that without clear language, developers could face licensing and enforcement risks that would chill US-based development. The House version of the measure first appeared in May last year and set out similar safe-harbor text. Senate Markup Delayed As Negotiations Continue Lawmakers have paused a larger Senate market-structure push while they work through a range of open issues, including stablecoin policy and yield rules. With that broader package pushed later into the month, sponsors moved the developer protections into a standalone bill to give that issue its own spotlight. Reports suggests the pause means Congress may act on the developer language sooner than the full market bill. What Developers And Advocates Are Saying Some protocol teams and industry lawyers welcomed the step as a much-needed clarification, saying it would reduce legal uncertainty for projects that do not custody funds. Others urged care, noting that clear definitions will be crucial to prevent loopholes and to make sure bad actors cannot hide behind the safe harbor. Coverage indicates sponsors emphasized the bill’s goal is narrow: protect those who build and maintain, not those who handle other people’s assets. The proposal for a separate law is being introduced while there are still many uncertainties surrounding how cryptocurrencies will be regulated in the US. In the latter part of 2025 and into 2026, the crypto sector has demonstrated that it has a great deal of clout within political circles in Washington D.C. There has been a significant increase in lobbying by large crypto-related businesses as legislators review various options for regulating this industry. Several reports have linked the current political environment to the legislative actions taken to regulate crypto in Congress, as well as how interest in legislative action has increased due to Trump’s administration.

Potential Bitcoin Return To $100,000 Nic Puckrin, a digital asset analyst and co-founder of Coin Bureau, commented on the recent price movements, suggesting that the uptick is more likely a reflexive response from investors who are rebalancing their portfolios after last year’s heavy sell-off, rather than an indication of a fundamental trend shift. “The bounce in Bitcoin we’re seeing this week is most likely a reflexive move by investors rather than something indicative of a major shift in trend,” Puckrin explained. Related Reading: New Hope For Crypto: Senators Introduce Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act Currently, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain momentum after rejecting the $94,700 resistance level. Puckrin warns that a failure to break through this barrier could lead to another decline in value. However, if BTC does breach this resistance, he believes a return to the $100,000 level may be achievable. Looking further ahead, Puckrin anticipates another all-time high in 2026, although he advises caution regarding the extent of that potential rise. “In the longer term, I expect to see another all-time high this year, but it won’t be as dramatic as some are predicting, and the possibility of a reversal into bear territory remains very real,” he added. Key Resistance Level Contrasting this optimism, some analysts express skepticism about Bitcoin’s immediate prospects. Vince Stanzione, CEO and founder of First Information, maintains a bearish outlook, arguing that the risk-reward ratio at current prices is unappealing. Stanzione evaluates Bitcoin against gold rather than the dollar, asserting that Bitcoin has considerable ground to cover. “I was negative on Bitcoin throughout 2025, and I’m sticking with that view in 2026,” he noted. He pointed out that while the market’s leading cryptocurrency experienced a decline of about 6% by the end of 2025, gold surged by 66%, resulting in a significant disparity in performance. Related Reading: Coinbase Mulls Exiting Support For Crypto Market Structure Bill Ahead Of January 15 Deadline Stanzione believes gold will continue to outperform Bitcoin this year, predicting that the digital asset will close the year at a lower price. “There are no compelling reasons to buy Bitcoin at the current $92,000 level,” he stated. Meanwhile, market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a crucial price level for Bitcoin in the short term, stating on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that $94,555 is the “bullish trigger” for the cryptocurrency. Should Bitcoin break through this level, Martinez indicated that the next target could be $105,291, representing a potential 12% increase. This move would significantly narrow the gap to the all-time high of over $126,000 reached last October.

This crucial legislation specifically aims to establish a legal framework for a won-pegged stablecoin by March 2025, potentially reshaping the nation’s digital economy. The closed-door meeting represents the culmination of months of deliberation, with the eligibility criteria for stablecoin issuers emerging as the final, significant hurdle. Won Stablecoin Framework Nears Legislative Completion According to a January 14 report from DataNews, financial authorities and the Democratic Party’s digital asset task force will convene to resolve the remaining disputes. The proposed Digital Asset Basic Act represents South Korea’s most comprehensive attempt to regulate digital assets since the market’s explosive growth. Consequently, this legislation could set a precedent for other Asian economies exploring central bank digital currencies and private stablecoins. The government’s March deadline underscores the urgency regulators attach to establishing market order and consumer protection. Financial Services Commission (FSC) officials consistently emphasize market stability as their paramount concern. Their preferred model involves granting initial issuance rights exclusively to consortiums where a traditional bank maintains a majority stake exceeding 50%. This bank-led approach, regulators argue, would leverage existing financial infrastructure, risk management protocols, and public trust. Furthermore, it aligns with global financial stability recommendations from bodies like the Financial Stability Board and the Bank for International Settlements. The Core Conflict: Bank Control Versus Innovation The Democratic Party’s digital asset task force, however, expresses strong opposition to this restrictive structure. Lawmakers and their advisors worry that excessive bank control could stifle innovation and concentrate power within traditional financial institutions. They advocate for a more inclusive framework that could allow regulated fintech companies or specially licensed digital asset firms to participate. This philosophical divide between conservative stability and progressive innovation defines the current debate. Analyzing the South Korean Stablecoin Regulatory Landscape South Korea’s move follows a global trend of nations seeking to regulate stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like fiat currency. The country’s approach appears more cautious than some jurisdictions but more proactive than others. For instance, Japan has already implemented a registration system for stablecoin issuers, while the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation provides a comprehensive regional framework. The potential impacts of this legislation are multifaceted: Market Legitimization: A regulated won stablecoin could attract institutional investment and integrate digital assets with traditional finance. Consumer Protection: Clear rules would reduce fraud risks associated with unbacked or poorly managed stablecoins. Payment System Evolution: A digital won could streamline cross-border payments and domestic transactions. Technological Advancement: The legislation could spur blockchain development in banking and financial services. Comparison of Stablecoin Regulatory Approaches (2025) Jurisdiction Key Model Issuer Eligibility Status South Korea Bank-led Consortium (Proposed) Banks with >50% stake Legislation Pending Japan Registration System Banks, Trust Companies, Registered Funds Implemented European Union MiCA Framework Licensed Credit Institutions or E-Money Institutions Implemented Singapore Single-Currency Peg Requirement Banks with Full Banking License Implemented Historical Context and Global Precedents South Korea’s journey toward digital asset regulation began in earnest after the cryptocurrency market turbulence of 2022. The collapse of several algorithmic stablecoins, most notably TerraUSD (UST) which had strong Korean connections, highlighted systemic risks. Subsequently, the government established multiple task forces and conducted extensive consultations with industry stakeholders, academics, and international regulators. This January 20 meeting therefore represents the final legislative step in a multi-year process. Expert analysis suggests the bank-led model draws inspiration from Singapore’s stringent approach, where only fully licensed banks can issue major stablecoins. Conversely, the Democratic Party’s position reflects concerns heard in European debates about maintaining competition. Financial technology experts note that whichever model prevails will significantly influence whether South Korea becomes a cautious follower or an innovative leader in the digital asset space. Economic Implications and Market Reactions The banking sector has generally welcomed the regulators’ conservative proposal. Major Korean banks like KB Kookmin, Shinhan, and Hana possess the capital reserves and regulatory experience to manage stablecoin issuance. However, blockchain associations and cryptocurrency exchanges argue that excluding native crypto firms could disadvantage South Korea in the global digital economy. Market observers will closely watch the January 20 outcome, as it will determine investment flows and strategic partnerships in East Asia’s competitive fintech landscape. Conclusion The January 20 meeting between South Korea’s ruling Democratic Party and financial regulators will decisively shape the future of the won stablecoin and the broader Digital Asset Basic Act. The resolution of the issuer eligibility debate will determine whether stability or innovation receives greater emphasis in South Korea’s digital financial framework. This legislation, expected by March 2025, will establish crucial guardrails for one of the world’s most active cryptocurrency markets. Ultimately, the finalized won stablecoin bill will influence not only domestic finance but also regional approaches to digital asset regulation. FAQs Q1: What is the main purpose of South Korea’s Digital Asset Basic Act? The primary purpose is to establish comprehensive legal frameworks for digital assets, with immediate focus on creating regulated, won-pegged stablecoins to ensure market stability and consumer protection. Q2: Why do financial regulators prefer bank-led consortiums for stablecoin issuance? Regulators cite market stability concerns, arguing that banks have established risk management systems, regulatory compliance experience, and public trust that newer fintech companies may lack, reducing systemic risk. Q3: What is the Democratic Party’s main objection to the bank-led model? The party’s digital asset task force worries that restricting issuance to bank-majority consortiums could stifle innovation, reduce competition, and prevent specialized blockchain firms from contributing their technical expertise. Q4: How does South Korea’s approach compare to Japan’s stablecoin regulations? Japan implemented earlier regulations allowing banks, trust companies, and registered funds to issue stablecoins, while South Korea’s proposed rules appear more restrictive by potentially requiring bank majority control in issuing consortiums. Q5: When will the won stablecoin legislation take effect if passed?

Semler Scientific stockholders gave their blessings by voting in support of the acquisition, which Strive’s executives have called the first acquisition of a publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company. The transaction will add Semler Scientific’s 5,048.1 Bitcoins to Strive’s existing holdings of 7,749.8 BTC, bringing the combined entity’s total to 12,797.9 BTC. The merged company will become the 11th largest corporate holder of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency globally. Strive also announced that it had purchased 123 Bitcoins for its corporate treasury at an average price of $91,561 per coin, all of which is worth over $11.2 million, and this includes fees and expenses. The deal comes as Ramaswamy pivots back to the private sector following his brief tenure as co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency. The entrepreneur resigned from the position on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2025, after reported tensions with Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk over the department’s vision and approach. Ramaswamy, who co-founded Strive in 2022, is now pursuing a bid for Ohio governor in the 2026 election. Strive manages over $2 billion in assets through its wholly owned subsidiary, Strive Asset Management, an SEC-registered investment adviser that launched its first exchange-traded fund in August 2022. What is Strive’s plan for Semler Scientific? Matt Cole, chairman and CEO of Strive, said, “The Semler Scientific deal will continue Strive’s leading yield generation since inception of our Bitcoin strategy, boosting our 2026 1st quarter Bitcoin yield to over 15%, and is a win for both Strive and Semler Scientific shareholders,” while adding that they are showing the market how to execute with Bitcoin as the hurdle rate. In the announcement, it was also disclosed that Strive has outlined plans to monetize Semler Scientific’s operating healthcare business within 12 months of closing the transaction. The company also intends to pursue opportunities to retire Semler’s $100 million convertible note and $20 million Coinbase loan while taking into account the market conditions. Semler Scientific , which develops FDA-cleared medical devices, including its flagship QuantaFlo test for early detection of peripheral arterial disease, was among the first US public companies to adopt Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. The company accumulated its digital holdings through equity and debt financing as well as operating cash flows. Preferred equity strategy gains traction The acquisition follows Strive’s successful November 2025 initial public offering (IPO) of its perpetual preferred equity instrument, known as SATA. The company increased the IPO from $125 million to $200 million after the offering was more than twice oversubscribed. Following the IPO, Strive received unsolicited demand inquiries for over $100 million in additional preferred equity issuance. Jeff Walton, the firm’s chief risk officer, said the SATA instrument offers investors a differentiated risk profile. According to Walton, “the balance sheet is comprised of a transparent, digitally native asset, allowing risk to be observed and measured in real time, compared to more traditional balance sheets comprised of illiquid physical risks.” The company plans to issue more SATA shares over the next 12 months to fund its strategy of retiring Semler Scientific’s legacy debt while maintaining amplification exclusively through preferred equity rather than traditional debt financing. Along with the merger, Strive’s board approved a 1-20 reverse stock split for shares of the Class A and Class B common stock of the combined company. Ben Werkman, chief investment officer, stated, “This proactive reverse split aligns our share price with institutional participation standards and opens our stock to a wider universe of investors.” How is the market reacting? The market did not react to the news with enthusiasm, as the shares of both companies fell following the announcement. Strive’s stock dropped more than 11%, while Semler Scientific declined by over 9%. The transaction is expected to close in the coming weeks. Upon completion, Semler Scientific executive chairman Eric Semler will join Strive’s board of directors. Public companies now hold nearly 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply.

Spain’s laws against unlawful AI use include exceptions for creative content involving public figures that are clearly labeled as AI generated. Other countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have also made moves to prevent the spread of inappropriate AI generated content. What are Spain’s laws regarding deepfakes? Spain’s cabinet has approved a draft legislation that establishes new consent requirements for digital images and AI deepfakes. The legislation will strengthen protections for minors and establish 16 as the minimum age at which individuals can consent to the use of their own image. This law directly addresses concerns about children’s digital safety in an era where AI tools can easily manipulate or replicate personal content. Justice Minister Felix Bolanos stated that individuals sharing their personal or family images on social media does not give others the freedom to use those images as they like. The law includes exceptions for creative, satirical, or fictional uses. For instance, content involving public figures will remain permissible, provided the content is clearly identified as AI-generated. New EU rules also require all member states to criminalize non-consensual sexual deepfakes by 2027. Are deepfakes legal in Spain? Elon Musk’s xAI chatbot Grok, has recently faced investigations over sexually explicit deepfake images. As Cryptopolitan reported last week, Grok ran into trouble generating roughly one non-consensual sexualized image per minute at its peak, placing women and minors in revealing poses or removing clothing from uploaded photos. During the incident earlier this month, the Spanish government requested that prosecutors determine whether certain AI-generated content could be considered as child pornography. Before becoming law, the draft will go through consultations with stakeholders and then return to the government for final approval before it is submitted to parliament. Aside from Spain, Indonesia and Malaysia have also taken action against Grok after it generated thousands of non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes, including images of children. Both countries were the first to completely block the chatbot. The UK’s media regulator Ofcom is launching a formal investigation into the incident that could result in fines up to 10% of X’s global revenue or a complete ban.

According to data from the analytics platform Onchain Lens, this address staked an additional 92,160 ETH on March 15, 2025. This substantial move, valued at approximately $293 million, represents one of the largest single staking actions recorded this year. Consequently, the address now controls a staggering 1,436,384 staked ETH. This position carries a total value of $4.77 billion at current market rates. Bitmine’s Expanding Ethereum Staking Position The recent transaction dramatically increases Bitmine’s already substantial presence within the Ethereum staking ecosystem. Initially, the address began accumulating staked ETH positions in early 2023. Since that time, it has methodically increased its holdings through periodic, large-scale deposits. This latest addition of 92,160 ETH follows a pattern of strategic accumulation rather than sporadic investment. Onchain analysts note the transaction occurred during a period of relative price stability for Ethereum. This timing suggests a long-term confidence strategy rather than short-term market timing. Ethereum staking involves locking cryptocurrency to support network security and operations. Validators who stake ETH help process transactions and create new blocks. In return, they earn rewards typically ranging from 3% to 5% annually. The Ethereum network currently has over 32 million ETH staked. This represents roughly 26% of the total supply. Bitmine’s position now constitutes approximately 4.5% of all staked ETH. This scale grants the entity significant influence within the validator community. The Mechanics and Scale of Institutional Staking Institutional staking operations differ substantially from individual participation. Entities like Bitmine typically utilize sophisticated infrastructure and multiple validator nodes. They often employ dedicated security teams and geographic distribution for their operations. The scale of this latest transaction—92,160 ETH—equates to funding 2,880 individual validator nodes at the standard 32 ETH requirement. Running this many nodes requires substantial technical resources and coordination. The following table illustrates the growth of this specific address’s staked position over recent quarters: Time Period ETH Staked Approximate Value Percentage Change Q4 2023 850,000 ETH $2.1B — Q1 2024 1,100,000 ETH $3.3B +29.4% Q2 2024 1,250,000 ETH $3.9B +13.6% Q3 2024 1,344,224 ETH $4.3B +7.5% Current (Q1 2025) 1,436,384 ETH $4.77B +6.9% This consistent growth pattern indicates a deliberate accumulation strategy. It contrasts sharply with the more variable trading patterns observed in many investment funds. The staking mechanism itself provides several distinct advantages for large holders: Yield Generation: Staked ETH generates rewards, creating a revenue stream. Network Participation: Validators help secure the network and influence governance. Reduced Market Supply: Staked ETH becomes illiquid, potentially supporting price stability. Long-term Alignment: Staking demonstrates commitment to Ethereum’s ecosystem health. Expert Analysis of Staking Trends Blockchain analysts emphasize the broader implications of such large-scale staking activities. According to industry reports, institutional participation in Ethereum staking has increased by approximately 40% year-over-year. This growth coincides with regulatory clarity in several major jurisdictions. Furthermore, traditional finance institutions have begun offering staking services to clients. This development has created additional demand for staking infrastructure and expertise. The concentration of staked ETH among large holders remains a topic of discussion within the community. While decentralization remains a core Ethereum value proposition, practical considerations often favor institutional-scale operations. These entities can achieve higher reliability scores and better reward optimization through professional management. However, the community continues to develop technical solutions, like distributed validator technology (DVT), to enable secure decentralized staking pools. Market Impact and Future Implications The immediate market response to the staking news has been relatively muted. Ethereum’s price showed minimal movement following the transaction’s visibility. This reaction suggests that markets had already priced in continued institutional accumulation. However, the long-term implications are more substantial. Each staked ETH becomes locked until future network upgrades enable withdrawals. This locking mechanism effectively removes coins from circulating supply. Reduced supply, coupled with steady demand, typically creates upward price pressure over extended periods. Other institutional players are likely monitoring Bitmine’s strategy closely. Several cryptocurrency funds and corporate treasuries have announced Ethereum positions in recent months. Many have chosen staking as their preferred method of holding these assets. The growing institutional acceptance of staking represents a maturation phase for cryptocurrency markets. It signals a shift from speculative trading toward infrastructure investment and yield generation. The regulatory environment for staking continues to evolve. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission has provided some guidance through enforcement actions. Other jurisdictions, particularly in Europe and Asia, have developed more comprehensive frameworks. These regulations typically focus on consumer protection, anti-money laundering compliance, and operational transparency. Institutional participants like Bitmine generally welcome clear regulatory guidelines. Such clarity reduces operational uncertainty and facilitates larger allocations. Conclusion Bitmine’s additional $293 million Ethereum staking commitment reinforces several key trends in cryptocurrency markets. First, institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability remains strong. Second, staking has emerged as the preferred method for large-scale ETH accumulation. Third, the growing proportion of staked ETH continues to reshape the asset’s supply dynamics. This Bitmine ETH staking transaction, while substantial on its own, forms part of a broader institutional migration toward blockchain infrastructure participation. As Ethereum continues its development roadmap, including further scalability improvements, such strategic commitments from major players will likely play a crucial role in network security and decentralization. The market will watch closely for similar moves from other institutional entities throughout 2025. FAQs Q1: What does it mean to “stake” Ethereum? Staking Ethereum involves depositing ETH into the network to act as a validator. Validators verify transactions and create new blocks. In return, they receive network rewards. Staking requires a minimum of 32 ETH per validator node and helps secure the blockchain. Q2: Why would an institution like Bitmine stake such large amounts of ETH? Institutions stake ETH for several reasons: to generate yield (typically 3-5% annually), to support network security, to demonstrate long-term commitment, and to potentially benefit from reduced circulating supply effects on price. Q3: Can staked ETH be sold or traded immediately? No, staked ETH becomes locked and illiquid. Withdrawals are enabled through specific network upgrades. Currently, staked ETH cannot be freely traded until the validator exits the staking process, which involves a queue and unbonding period. Q4: How does large-scale staking affect Ethereum’s decentralization? Large-scale staking by single entities can potentially centralize validation power. However, the Ethereum community and developers actively work on solutions like Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) to allow secure staking through decentralized pools, mitigating centralization risks. Q5: What are the risks associated with Ethereum staking? Primary risks include technical failure (leading to slashing penalties), ETH price volatility during the lock-up period, potential protocol bugs, and future regulatory changes that might affect staking operations or taxation.

With cryptos being sold off early, we could see attraction as other assets trade to elevated all-time highs. Ethereum and Solana are facing a key test for a general market rally. By Elior Manier Crypto is back in beast mode today after a 1.5-month-long consolidation across all major tokens. Digital assets have a funny way of fading into the background when interest and prices drop, often following a few crashes or scandals. And make no mistake-the latest correction was no small matter. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the most sought-after and respected crypto, corrected by 36%, with the total crypto market cap suffering a similar drop. Others were hit even harder, with 50% corrections seen in XRP ( XRP-USD ) and Solana ( SOL-USD ), and brutal 70% drops in names like Cardano ( ADA-USD ). Crypto Total Market Cap Monthly Chart - Source: TradingView But zooming out, cryptos actually led the sensational rally that eventually spread to other assets. Bitcoin kicked off the 2024-2025 frenzy as early as January 2024, trading at $40,000 before peaking at $126,000 19 months later - a +3X increase. As a matter of fact, looking at past cycles, cryptocurrencies have often acted as a leading indicator, rising and falling weeks or even months before other asset classes. This happens for a simple technical reason: they sit at the very top of the risk spectrum. Consequently, they are the first to see demand dry up when uncertainty arises - conditions we saw clearly during the October-November period as layoffs rose and fears of an ""AI Peak"" bloomed. So, where do things stand now? Current Session in Cryptos - January 13, 2026 (15:14). Source: FInviz Digital assets have been largely off the radar since November, with volatility staying surprisingly contained. However, with stocks hovering at all-time highs and metals posting record performances, cryptocurrencies could be primed for some mean reversion higher. As geopolitical uncertainty looms and the Fed's independence comes under fire yet again, traders may look to crypto for risk diversification in assets that have corrected already. Expect things to remain volatile in this environment. Let's dive right into the daily charts and technical levels for Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), and Solana ( SOL-USD ). Bitcoin Daily Chart and Technical Levels Bitcoin Daily Chart, January 13, 2026 - Source: TradingView Bitcoin is now breaching its 50-day moving average on strong momentum after an initial test last week. Supported by the formation of an uptrend (higher lows, strong trendline) and confirmed by a bounce on neutral from the RSI Index, the path for a higher retest is forming. Two tests will be coming for Bitcoin: Breaking the January 5 highs ($94,810) - short-term test (looks close to breaking) Passing the test of the $100,000 resistance. This one will need a review if prices get there. A huge psychological resistance that will surely dictate risk appetite for cryptos in 2026.

A triangle formation will help to spot the direction of an imminent breakout. Showing similar RSI developments as BTC, Ethereum should see its price blaze as long as bulls manage to break above its 200-day moving average, coming in as an immediate test ($3,216). A rise in ETH could also help the broader altcoin market to rally. Levels of interest for ETH trading: Support Levels: 50-Day Moving Average: $3,100 $3,000 to $3,200 Major momentum pivot (test of the $3,000) $2,500 to $2,700 June Key Support (November lows) $2,620 Session and weekly Lows $2,100 June War support $1,385 to $1,750 2025 Support 2025 Lows: $1,384 Resistance Levels: $3,216 200-Day MA (Immediate test) $3,300 breakout region $3,500 (+/- $50) Key Resistance $3,800 September lows $4,000 Dec 2024 Top Main Resistance zone $4,950 Current new all-time highs Solana Daily Chart and Technical Levels Solana Daily Chart, January 13, 2026 - Source: TradingView Solana is forming an interesting uptrend to follow its peers but seems to lack a bit of momentum. However, with the current rally being young in global crypto, it may easily catch up as it trades well above its 50-day MA ($132.00).

57141525,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261288,1768350311,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Achieves Crucial Equilibrium, Shifts to Neutral at 48",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-neutral-48/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Achieves Crucial Equilibrium, Shifts to Neutral at 48 Global cryptocurrency markets registered a significant psychological shift this week as the widely monitored Crypto Fear & Greed Index climbed 22 points to settle at 48, decisively entering the Neutral zone for the first time in months. This pivotal move away from fear-dominated territory signals a potential recalibration of investor psychology, according to data from analytics provider Alternative.me. The index, a composite measure of market emotion, now sits precisely at the midpoint of its scale, where 0 represents ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed.’ Consequently, this movement warrants a detailed examination of its components, drivers, and historical context to understand its full implications for the 2025 digital asset landscape. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s Neutral Shift The Crypto Fear & Greed Index functions as a daily sentiment thermometer for digital asset markets. Its calculation relies on a multifaceted methodology designed to capture both on-chain and social signals. Specifically, the index aggregates data from six core sources, each assigned a specific weight. Market volatility and trading volume each contribute 25% to the final score. Social media sentiment and market surveys each account for 15%. Finally, Bitcoin’s dominance share of the total crypto market capitalization and relevant Google search trends each provide the remaining 10%. This composite approach aims to filter out noise and present a holistic view of collective market emotion. The jump from 26 (Fear) to 48 (Neutral) within 24 hours represents one of the most substantial single-day sentiment improvements recorded this year. Analysts often view a move into the Neutral band, typically between 46 and 54, as a period of market consolidation and rational decision-making, contrasting sharply with the impulsive trading frequently observed during extreme fear or greed phases. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Sentiment Rebound Several concurrent factors likely propelled the index into neutral territory. Firstly, a notable decrease in market volatility provided a primary boost. Major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, exhibited reduced price swings over the preceding week. This stability directly positively impacts 25% of the index’s calculation. Secondly, trading volume across major exchanges saw a measured increase. This rise was not explosive but indicated renewed, steady participation rather than panic selling or frenzied buying. Thirdly, social media analysis revealed a shift in conversation tone. Discussions moved away from doom-laden predictions and toward technical analysis and project fundamentals. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s market cap dominance held relatively steady near 52%, suggesting a balanced interest between the flagship asset and alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). This equilibrium prevented the dominance metric from skewing the sentiment score excessively in either direction. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis Placing the current 48 reading in historical context offers valuable perspective. For instance, during the market troughs of late 2022, the index languished in ‘Extreme Fear’ (below 25) for prolonged periods. Conversely, during bull market peaks, it has soared into ‘Extreme Greed’ (above 75). The neutral zone often acts as a pivot point. A sustained move above 50 can precede extended bullish trends, while a fall back below 45 can signal renewed caution. The table below illustrates recent index categories and their general market implications: Index Range Sentiment Label Typical Market Behavior 0-24 Extreme Fear Panic selling, high volatility, potential buying opportunity 25-45 Fear Cautious selling, negative bias, consolidation 46-54 Neutral Rational analysis, balanced buying/selling, low volatility 55-74 Greed FOMO buying, increasing risk appetite, rising prices 75-100 Extreme Greed Speculative frenzy, bubble risk, correction likely Market technicians also compare this sentiment shift to on-chain data. Metrics like exchange net flows and dormant coin movement have shown patterns consistent with a holding mentality, not a distribution phase. This on-chain behavior corroborates the neutral sentiment reading, suggesting investors are neither rushing to exit nor aggressively accumulating. The Practical Impact on Trader and Investor Psychology The shift to a neutral sentiment reading carries tangible psychological effects. In fear zones, investors often make decisions based on emotion, potentially selling assets at a loss. In greed zones, they may chase overvalued projects. The neutral zone, however, fosters a more analytical environment. Key behavioral impacts include: Reduced Emotional Trading: Decisions are more likely to stem from research and strategy. Focus on Fundamentals: Project development, tokenomics, and adoption metrics regain importance. Healthy Skepticism: Both overly bullish and bearish narratives face greater scrutiny. Strategic Accumulation: Long-term investors may view this as a period for disciplined dollar-cost averaging. This environment can be particularly beneficial for new market participants. It provides a less emotionally charged atmosphere for education and portfolio construction. Seasoned analysts often advise using neutral periods to review and rebalance portfolios without the pressure of extreme market moves. Expert Insights on Sentiment as a Contrarian Indicator Financial historians frequently cite investor sentiment as a reliable contrarian indicator at its extremes. The famous dictum ‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful’ aligns with this index’s utility. While a reading of 48 is not an extreme, its movement from fear toward neutrality can signal a change in market phase. Some institutional analysts interpret a climb out of sustained fear as a prerequisite for the next sustainable bullish leg. However, they caution that sentiment alone does not drive prices. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and technological advancements remain the primary fundamental drivers. The sentiment index thus serves as a gauge of market mood surrounding those fundamentals, not a standalone predictor. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s ascent to a neutral 48 marks a critical inflection point for market psychology. This movement reflects a complex interplay of reduced volatility, steady volume, and more balanced social discourse. While not predictive of future price action, this shift indicates a departure from fear-based decision-making and a move toward a more rational, analytical market environment. For observers and participants, the index provides a valuable, quantified snapshot of collective emotion—a tool for grounding individual decisions in broader market sentiment. Monitoring whether the index stabilizes in neutrality or trends toward greed or fear in the coming weeks will offer essential clues about the next major phase for cryptocurrency markets. FAQs Q1: What does a ‘Neutral’ reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A neutral reading (typically 46-54) suggests a balance between fear and greed in the market. It indicates a period where investor sentiment is not dominated by extreme emotion, often correlating with lower volatility and more decision-making based on fundamentals rather than hype or panic. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how often is it updated? The index is created and maintained by the data analytics platform Alternative.me. It is updated daily, providing a near real-time gauge of market sentiment based on the previous 24 hours of data from its six source components. Q3: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable tool for predicting Bitcoin’s price? No, the index is not a direct price prediction tool. It is a sentiment indicator. Historically, extreme readings (below 25 or above 75) have sometimes preceded market reversals, but it should be used in conjunction with fundamental and technical analysis, not in isolation. Q4: Why does the index give equal weight (25% each) to volatility and volume? Volatility measures the magnitude of price changes, with high volatility often associated with fear or uncertainty. Volume measures market activity and participation. Together, they provide a strong foundation (50% of the index) for understanding current market dynamics and trader behavior. Q5: Can the index be manipulated by social media campaigns? While social media sentiment is a component (15%), the index’s multi-factor design makes it difficult to manipulate meaningfully. A coordinated campaign might briefly affect the social score, but it would need to coincidentally influence volatility, volume, dominance, and search trends to significantly alter the final number, which is highly improbable.

57142150,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261291,1768352111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Altcoin Season Index Surges to 30, Signaling a Potential Crypto Market Shift",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-rises-30/,"BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Surges to 30, Signaling a Potential Crypto Market Shift Global cryptocurrency markets observed a notable shift on April 10, 2025, as CoinMarketCap’s pivotal Altcoin Season Index climbed to a score of 30, marking a two-point increase from the previous day and igniting discussions among analysts about a potential change in market structure. This movement, while still distant from the definitive threshold, represents one of the most significant weekly gains for the metric this quarter, prompting a closer examination of underlying capital flows and historical cycle patterns. The index serves as a critical barometer for investor sentiment, measuring the relative performance of major alternative cryptocurrencies against the market’s foundational asset, Bitcoin. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Mechanics CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index provides a quantitative framework for understanding market cycles. The platform calculates this figure by analyzing the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization over a rolling 90-day period. Crucially, the calculation excludes stablecoins like USDT and USDC, as well as wrapped assets like WBTC, to focus purely on volatile, speculative assets. The core comparison pits these altcoins against Bitcoin’s performance during the same window. A definitive “altcoin season” is declared when 75% or more of these top assets outperform Bitcoin over those 90 days, resulting in an index score of 100. Conversely, a “Bitcoin season” occurs when less than 25% of altcoins outperform BTC. The current score of 30 indicates that approximately 30% of the monitored altcoins have beaten Bitcoin’s returns in the recent quarter. This methodology offers a clear, data-driven alternative to anecdotal market sentiment. Calculation Basis: Top 100 coins (excluding stablecoins/wrapped assets). Time Frame: Rolling 90-day performance window. Benchmark: Direct comparison to Bitcoin’s (BTC) price action. Thresholds: 75% for Altcoin Season, 25% for Bitcoin Season. Historical Context and Market Cycle Implications The index’s rise to 30 cannot be viewed in isolation. Historical data from previous crypto cycles reveals a common pattern. Typically, a sustained bull market begins with capital flowing into Bitcoin, driving its dominance. Subsequently, as investor confidence grows and narratives around decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, or other sectors gain traction, capital begins rotating into altcoins. This rotation often pushes the Altcoin Season Index higher in a series of steps, not a single jump. For instance, in the 2020-2021 cycle, the index hovered at similar levels before a multi-month ascent that culminated in a prolonged period above the 75 threshold. Analysts from firms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant often correlate rising index scores with increased activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and rising Ethereum gas fees, signaling robust on-chain activity for altcoin projects. The current increase coincides with reported growth in Total Value Locked (TVL) across several non-Ethereum Layer 1 blockchains, providing fundamental context for the metric’s movement. Expert Analysis on the Current Movement Market strategists emphasize caution alongside optimism. “A move from 28 to 30 is statistically minor but directionally important,” noted a recent report from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment. The report highlighted that social media discussions around “altcoin season” have increased by 40% week-over-week, often a contrarian indicator if sentiment becomes overly euphoric too quickly. Furthermore, data shows that while some large-cap altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) have posted gains, the breadth of performance across the top 100 remains mixed. This suggests the current movement may be sector-specific rather than a broad-based altcoin rally. Institutional commentators point to macroeconomic factors, such as anticipated interest rate policies from major central banks, as a primary driver for Bitcoin’s recent consolidation, which naturally allows altcoins to catch up on a relative basis. The key question for traders is whether this represents a temporary rebalancing or the early phase of a longer-term trend reversal. Impact on Investor Strategies and Portfolio Allocation The rising index directly influences both retail and institutional investment frameworks. Many portfolio management models use the index as a signal for tactical asset allocation. A rising score may prompt a gradual rebalancing from a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio toward a diversified basket of high-quality altcoins. However, risk management remains paramount. The volatility of altcoins is significantly higher than Bitcoin’s, meaning any allocation shift must be proportionate to an investor’s risk tolerance. Seasoned investors often use a phased approach, increasing exposure to altcoins in increments as the index climbs through key levels like 40 and 50, rather than making a single large bet at the first sign of movement. This strategy is supported by historical volatility data, which shows that altcoin markets can experience sharp, corrective downturns even during a broader season. The current environment underscores the importance of fundamental research, focusing on projects with clear utility, active development, and sustainable tokenomics, rather than chasing momentum alone. Recent Altcoin Season Index Milestones Date Index Value Key Market Event Jan 15, 2025 18 Post-ETF approval Bitcoin rally peak Mar 1, 2025 22 Layer 2 scaling solutions narrative gains traction Apr 9, 2025 28 Beginning of current upward movement Apr 10, 2025 30 Multi-chain DeFi activity shows notable increase Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s rise to 30 serves as a critical, data-point for market participants, signaling a measurable shift in relative performance dynamics. While far from confirming a full altcoin season, this movement provides essential context for capital rotation trends within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Investors should monitor this index alongside on-chain metrics, fundamental project developments, and broader macroeconomic signals. The path from 30 to the decisive threshold of 75 will require sustained outperformance across a wide range of assets, a process that historically unfolds over weeks and months rather than days. This index remains one of the most objective tools for navigating the complex transitions between Bitcoin and altcoin market cycles. FAQs Q1: What exactly does an Altcoin Season Index score of 30 mean? It means that approximately 30% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) have outperformed Bitcoin in price appreciation over the past 90 days. The market is in a neutral phase, not yet in a defined “altcoin season” (75+) or “Bitcoin season” (below 25). Q2: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? CoinMarketCap updates the Altcoin Season Index daily, reflecting the latest 90-day rolling performance data. This allows for near real-time tracking of market cycle shifts. Q3: Does a rising index guarantee that altcoins will continue to rise? No, it does not guarantee future price increases. The index is a lagging indicator based on past performance. While it can signal a trend, altcoin markets remain highly volatile and susceptible to rapid reversals based on news, regulation, and macroeconomic factors. Q4: Why are stablecoins and wrapped assets excluded from the calculation? Stablecoins are designed to maintain a fixed price and do not exhibit the speculative volatility being measured. Wrapped assets like WBTC are simply tokenized representations of Bitcoin, so their performance directly mirrors BTC and would skew the comparative data. Q5: What other indicators should I watch alongside the Altcoin Season Index? Key complementary metrics include Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), total cryptocurrency market capitalization excluding Bitcoin, trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEX volume), and funding rates for altcoin perpetual futures contracts to gauge market sentiment.

More stable coins and digital assets are on Solana, but individual investors are not contributing to it. This is what is causing the SOL price to be low. However, a new cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is preparing for its initial launch. It is in presale, potentially offering a massive return on investment for investors. It is said to return 45x their investment, making it the best cryptocurrency to invest in, especially for those in search of massive growth. Solana’s Scalability Analysis Currently, the value of real things such as stocks turned into tokens on the Solana network is above $931 million. The balance of stablecoins is also at a record high of above $15 billion. Large companies such as BlackRock are now collaborating with Solana. Despite all this happening, the SOL coin is yet to rise to the value it was at ATH. Currently, the coin is lagging. Evidence indicates that common investors are not investing in SOL at the moment. This is why the coin is not rising in value yet. For investors looking to make quick gains, Solana is not the best crypto to buy at the moment. Mutuum Finance has emerged as the new crypto that is preferred by smart investors. Mutuum Finance Presale: Acquire MUTM at Lower Prices Mutuum Finance is holding a presale, which is a great investment deal for investors. It has already raised $19,750,000 from over 18,800 people. The presale has entered Phase 7, and tokens are selling at $0.04 each. It should be noted that this is four times more expensive than what was being sold during Phase 1 of the presale. Phase 7 is selling out extremely rapidly. When this phase sells out, Phase 8 commences with a cost of $0.045 per token, meaning those who delay today will have to pay more. The tokens will eventually cost $0.06 upon launch. This implies that investors who are currently investing in this presale would witness as little as $500 grow to $750 in a very short while. It has been anticipated that the cost may escalate higher after the launch, potentially reaching $0.10 per token. This presale has the potential of generating a huge ROI from what may seem like a small amount of investment currently. If MUTM hits $0.10, the same $500 becomes $1250, generating a $750 profit. Two Methods of Loaning Money and Earning Interest Mutuum Finance allows users to earn money by lending crypto. There are two aspects of the platform. First, it is via lending pools for common coins such as Ethereum and USDT. In addition, it allows users to lend funds to each other directly. It is helpful for a user that currently owns crypto and would like to generate passive ROI. To earn more, the user can lend it. If a user contributes $10,000 of Ethereum to a pool, he or she may earn 12% per year. The user gets $1,200 free money without having to sell Ethereum. For another crypto like Shiba Inu, they may lend directly to a borrower and negotiate a slightly higher interest e.g. 18% to earn $1,200 on the $10,000. It is a practical method for users to gain profits using the platform. It is better than saving the money as it is, believing that it may increase. Furthermore, it makes Mutuum Finance the best crypto to buy for those who need theirs to work for them. Sharing Profits with Holders Mutuum Finance has intelligent rules for its token to increase its worth in the future. There would never be more than 4 billion MUTM tokens in existence. Nearly half of the tokens exist for the presale. For its tokens, the project has a way of rewarding people who stake in the project. A part of every dollar the project generates in fees will go into buying MUTM tokens back. Then, those tokens will reward the individuals who lock their tokens in the project’s system. For example, if the project generates $500,000 in fees, an individual with $2,000 worth of tokens might receive an additional reward of $500 in MUTM tokens. The Smart Choice for Investors Mutuum Finance is designed for making profits for investors through multiple means. The purchase in the presale provides a low rate before the initial launch, the loan mechanism generates passive income through interest, while the token mechanics reward loyal supporters who participate in the long run. All of these factors combine to increase the value of the token. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that wait for the general market to shift, Mutuum Finance generates its own growth. For someone asking which crypto to invest in currently for the potential of massive profits, the new crypto coin comes with an attractive plan. It is created to translate activities on their platform to real profits for the early supporters. This places it in the top selection for the best crypto to invest in currently.

In early January, the United States launched a military operation in Venezuela, resulting in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and significant upheaval in regional politics and energy markets. This action formed part of a broader US campaign against illicit networks and pressure on Caracas, with implications for global oil flows and uncertainty in macroeconomic sentiment across markets. Simultaneously, tensions between Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and US President Donald Trump over monetary policy and institutional independence have added another layer of volatility. In a rare and pointed statement, Powell framed the situation as a direct consequence of central bank independence, saying: “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Fed setting rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.” Despite these headline risks, Bitcoin’s price action has entered a period of calm, with realized volatility compressing to historically low levels. Such low-volatility regimes typically reflect a temporary balance between supply and demand. In past cycles, extended calm like this has often preceded periods of significant volatility and range expansion, as accumulated imbalances resolve with sharp directional moves. This sets the stage for a potentially decisive breakout as participants await clearer catalysts while price hovers near the critical $92K threshold. Volatility Compression Signals A Market Near Inflection A recent analysis by Axel Adler highlights a critical shift in Bitcoin’s market structure: realized volatility has compressed to 23.6 % , placing it near the lower end of this cycle’s historical range. Rather than signaling direction, this drop in volatility reflects a market that has temporarily lost momentum, with price swings narrowing and impulse strength fading. In past cycles, similar conditions have rarely persisted for long. From a structural standpoint, this environment suggests that Bitcoin is in a classic compression phase. As volatility contracts, underlying imbalances between supply and demand tend to build quietly beneath the surface. When these imbalances reach a tipping point, price typically transitions from stability into expansion—often abruptly. This view is reinforced by Bitcoin’s 30-day high–low range. The gap between recent rolling highs and lows continues to tighten, confirming that price is coiling within an increasingly narrow band. Both intraday and multi-day fluctuations have diminished, and neither buyers nor sellers have been able to assert sustained control. Historically, breakouts from such compressed ranges tend to attract algorithmic and trend-following capital, amplifying follow-through once price escapes the range. While this setup does not guarantee an upside or downside resolution, it does suggest that the probability of a decisive move is rising. With volatility and range metrics aligned, Bitcoin appears to be approaching a moment where consolidation gives way to renewed directional conviction. Bitcoin Price Reclaims $92K as Structure Slowly Improves Bitcoin is attempting to reclaim the $92,000 level after several weeks of consolidation following the sharp November drawdown. On the daily chart, price has formed a clear base in the $86K–$88K region, where aggressive selling pressure was previously exhausted. Since then, BTC has printed a sequence of higher lows, signaling a gradual shift from distribution into short-term accumulation. The recent push above the descending short-term moving average reflects improving momentum, although the broader structure remains mixed. Price is still trading below the declining mid-term trendline and well under the longer-term moving averages, which continue to act as overhead resistance near the $98K–$105K zone. This suggests that, while downside pressure has eased, Bitcoin has not yet re-entered a strong bullish trend. Volume remains relatively muted during the rebound, indicating that the move is driven more by reduced selling than by aggressive new demand. This aligns with a market transitioning into stabilization rather than immediate expansion. The $92K area now represents a critical pivot: holding above it would confirm acceptance at higher levels and open the door for a broader range rotation toward $96K–$100K. Failure to sustain this breakout, however, would likely keep BTC trapped in a consolidation range, with downside risk returning toward the $88K support. For now, price action suggests cautious recovery rather than trend reversal.

That surge pushed derivatives to claim most of the market’s activity, while spot trading grew at a much slower pace. Related Reading: XRP Ledger May Get A Tokenized Gold Upgrade, Web3 Founder Reveals Spot Volume Climbs While Futures Explode Spot trading finished the year near $18.6 trillion, an increase of roughly 9% versus the prior year. But futures and perpetuals were the real story: they totaled close to $62 trillion, making up about 77% of combined exchange volume. That heavy tilt toward derivatives shifted where liquidity and daily turnover were concentrated. Exchanges At The Center Of Activity Binance stood out as the top contributor to both segments. Reports show Binance handled roughly $25.4 trillion in Bitcoin perpetual futures alone — about 42% of the top 10 platforms’ Bitcoin perpetual volume — and continued to hold large stablecoin balances relative to peers. Other major venues such as OKX, Bybit and Bitget formed a secondary tier for futures trading. 2025 crypto exchange activity in review. Spot volume reached $18.6T (+9% YoY) while perpetuals surged to $61.7T (+29%), with Binance dominating spot, BTC perps, liquidity, and reserves. Growth is derivative-led, and market power continues to concentrate at the top. pic.twitter.com/Om8udJJ9Qv — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 12, 2026 Derivatives Data Variations Not all trackers measure markets the same way. Some platforms reported even higher figures for derivatives in 2025 — CoinGlass, for example, tallied about $85.7 trillion in crypto derivatives volume for the year. Differences in counting methods, which products are included, and which venues are covered explain much of the gap between sources. Why Futures Dominated Trading Traders used futures to take positions, hedge exposures, and respond quickly to price moves. That activity raised daily turnover and boosted the headline totals. While spot trading reflects direct buying and selling of coins, futures multiply notional flow because a single contract can represent a much larger notional value than a spot trade. The concentration of trading on a handful of platforms has drawn attention from watchdogs in recent years. Regulators have warned that heavy reliance on a small set of exchanges could pose risks if those venues suffer outages or enforcement actions. The data for 2025 renewed those concerns because a large share of the new volume was funneled through the biggest operators.

Institutional interest, products tied to regulated markets, and changes to stablecoin rules are all possible factors that could reshape volumes next year. Analysts caution that headline totals will keep varying with methodology and which datasets are used.

Under these rules, interest payments settled solely in connection with the holding of a stablecoin are prohibited while permitting rewards allocation for particular activities. Following this release, reports from reliable sources indicated that Senator Tim Scott, Chairman of the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, had presented a new bipartisan draft to the Senate Banking Committee. This bipartisan draft, known as a “negotiated market structure bill,” is set to undergo a markup session on Thursday, January 15. At this particular moment, committee members will conduct a heated debate on this legislation and may later proceed to a vote on the bill. Analysts identify a significant challenge in the stablecoin ecosystem Sources described the “negotiated market structure bill” as a game-changer set up to tackle highly contentious issues at the negotiating table. Notably, these challenges sparked intensified discussions between cryptocurrency firms and the banking sector for weeks. These sources decided to disclose the main content of the bill. They noted that this draft market structure bill clearly stated that digital asset service providers are not allowed to make interest or yield payments to users in relation to their stablecoin holdings. Nonetheless, they highlighted that these providers are permitted to offer rewards to their users in connection with specific activities, such as processing payments, staking, providing liquidity, or offering collateral. Interestingly, this newly released wording includes a compromise that Democratic Senator Angela Alsobrooks proposed last week. Alsobrooks played a key role in the talks. In her suggestion, crypto exchanges are permitted to issue yields to their users on stablecoins if clients carry out specific activities, such as selling their stablecoins. However, it forbids rewards for stablecoins that are just stored in an account. With this finding, analysts concluded that challenges arising from issues related to stablecoins yields have generated considerable friction between banks and the crypto industry. At this point, banking groups have raised concerns that the GENIUS Act , a US federal law enacted in July 2025, has established gaps that enable issuers or platforms to provide interest-like returns, thereby initiating new liquidity risks. Uncertainties surrounding rewards for stablecoins spark debate among individuals Reports clarified that the stablecoin law does not hinder third-party crypto platforms, such as the major crypto exchange and platform Coinbase , from issuing rewards to their users, despite prohibiting issuers from conducting direct interest payments. After these reports highlighted this situation, several crypto firms declared that the matter was already settled at the time talks about the GENIUS Act were held, hence alleging that banks are attempting to restrict their competition. Recognizing the increasing tension of the situation, Coinbase issued a warning that it would withdraw its backing for the market structure bill if lawmakers decide to go beyond just implementing improvements in disclosure requirements and start to impose more stringent restrictions on reward programs. On the other hand, sources noted that, apart from stablecoins, the newly established draft comprises a bipartisan proposal from the US Senators Ron Wyden and Cynthia Lummis.

ETH and Aster Look Promising, But APEMARS Crushes Them with 22,367% ROI & Tokens Vanishing Fast!",https://timestabloid.com/best-100x-crypto-for-2026-eth-and-aster-look-promising-but-apemars/,"January 2026 has opened with a familiar pattern in crypto markets. Established assets are tightening, narratives are shifting, and attention is quietly rotating before the next visible breakout. Ethereum continues to attract institutional interest, with staking activity steadily removing ETH from circulation and subtly tightening supply. At the same time, leverage across derivatives markets has surged without aggressive price expansion, a setup that historically increases volatility rather than signaling weakness. Alongside these conditions, newer narratives are building momentum beneath the surface. While Ethereum and Aster represent mature ecosystems navigating this phase with stability, a different kind of opportunity is unfolding in the presale market. APEMARS has entered this window at a moment when early positioning matters most, drawing attention from traders hunting the best 100x crypto before momentum becomes obvious. As of today, APEMARS is live in Stage 3 of its presale, priced at $0.00002448, with over 350 holders, $ 79 K raised, and more than 3.8B tokens sold. Previous stages sold out quickly at lower prices, and the current stage is moving at a similar pace, placing it firmly on the radar of early-stage investors seeking asymmetric upside. APEMARS Stage 3: Where Early Entry Becomes Asymmetric Momentum rarely announces itself loudly in presales. It builds through participation, pace, and structure. That is exactly how APEMARS is unfolding as Stage 3 officially accelerates. The mission-style presale moves on a fixed timeline, and when a stage sells out early, the system advances automatically. There is no pause and no waiting for late entrants. At $0.00002448, this stage represents one of the lowest remaining entry points before pricing steps up again, with an estimated 22,367% ROI projected at listing. What makes this moment compelling is not just pricing, but scarcity mechanics layered into the journey. Unsold tokens from early mission segments are permanently burned at predefined checkpoints, reducing the circulating supply as the presale advances. These burns are not random. They are scheduled at key stages, reinforcing scarcity while rewarding early participation. As Stage 3 fills rapidly, the window for securing tokens at this price narrows by the day, and once it closes, this valuation does not return. Beyond supply tightening, APEMARS introduces staking designed to reward patience rather than speculation. Participants can stake their tokens after joining the presale, with staking rewards activating two months post-listing. The fixed 63% APY, inspired by Mars’ average temperature, offers a structured incentive for holders who stay aligned with the mission beyond launch. This delay protects early market stability while positioning committed holders for sustained yield once staking goes live. Together, these mechanics turn early entry into a strategic advantage, not a gamble, strengthening APEMARS’ positioning among projects competing to be the best 100x crypto of this cycle. $2,000 Today → $449,000 at Listing: Stage 3’s 22,367% ROI Window Closes in 3 Days Early-stage conviction often forms when numbers meet urgency. At the current Stage 3 price of $0.00002448, a hypothetical $2,000 entry secures roughly 81.7 million APEMARS tokens. With a projected listing price of $0.0055, that position translates to a potential value near $449,000 at launch, reflecting the estimated 22,367% ROI that early participants are actively positioning for as they search for the best 100x crypto opportunities before momentum peaks. What intensifies this setup is timing. Stage 3 has less than three days remaining, and earlier stages didn’t reward hesitation. They sold out quickly at lower prices that are no longer accessible. Once this three-day window closes, the system advances automatically, pricing steps up, and this valuation disappears permanently. In presales driven by scarcity and pace, missing an early window often means missing the best 100x crypto setup entirely, with the cost of waiting measured in lost multiples rather than lost time. How to Buy APEMARS During the Presale Stage 3 Joining the APEMARS presale is designed to be straightforward. First, connect a supported non-custodial wallet through the official dashboard. Next, select your preferred cryptocurrency and enter the amount you wish to participate with. If you have a referral or bonus code, apply it at checkout to unlock additional benefits. Once completed, your purchased tokens appear instantly in your dashboard, reflecting your position in Stage 3 without unnecessary complexity. Ethereum: Institutional Strength in a Tightening Market Ethereum continues to anchor the broader crypto ecosystem as capital flows increasingly favor infrastructure over speculation. Trading at $3,088.41, Ethereum holds a commanding $372.75B market cap, with daily volume near $17.29B and a circulating supply of 120.69M ETH. The network’s transition toward efficiency and yield has made institutional staking a defining theme, quietly reducing liquid supply without disrupting market confidence. Recent market behavior shows Ethereum consolidating rather than expanding aggressively, a sign of strength rather than stagnation. Developers continue to build across DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 solutions, reinforcing Ethereum’s role as the settlement layer of Web3. While near-term price action remains measured, ETH’s fundamentals position it as a long-term cornerstone for portfolios prioritizing resilience and utility. Aster: Expanding Utility in a Competitive Layer Aster has emerged as a notable player within its niche, balancing growth with active ecosystem development. Currently priced at $0.6945, Aster carries a $1.73B market cap and records $173.66M in daily trading volume, supported by a circulating supply of 2.49B ASTER. Short-term price fluctuations have mirrored broader market movements, rather than signaling structural weakness. What sustains interest in Aster is its expanding use cases and focus on interoperability. The project continues to attract users through ecosystem incentives and strategic partnerships, reinforcing its relevance as competition among mid-cap assets intensifies. For investors seeking exposure beyond established giants, Aster represents a calculated blend of utility-driven growth and market participation. Conclusion: Timing, Structure, and the Case for Early Entry Ethereum and Aster reflect different stages of crypto maturity, each offering value through stability, utility, and ecosystem depth. They act as reference points for what sustained adoption looks like once momentum has already formed. Alongside them, APEMARS occupies a different but complementary position, drawing attention in its earliest phase, where structure, scarcity, and narrative align in a way early markets tend to reward. With Stage 3 live and pricing still at $0.00002448, while earlier stages have already sold out, APEMARS stands out as a presale shaped by pace rather than promises. For investors searching for the best 100x crypto, timing often defines outcomes more than headlines. In cycles where early positioning comes before visibility, opportunities like APEMARS rarely stay under the radar for long.

Cryptos with the highest 100x potential are usually early-stage projects with low entry prices, strong narratives, and clear scarcity mechanics. Presales like APEMARS often attract attention because upside is accessed before listings and broad market exposure. Which crypto will give 1000x to buy? While no outcome is guaranteed, 1000x opportunities typically appear in presales where pricing is deeply discounted, and momentum builds quickly. Projects with structured stages, strong community growth, and clear timelines tend to stand out early. How to find the next 100x crypto? Look for presales with rising holder counts, fast-selling stages, transparent tokenomics, and limited supply growth. Timing matters most when entering before visibility and hype reach the wider market, a strategy often highlighted by early-opportunity trackers like Best Crypto to Buy Now . What is 100x crypto? A 100x crypto refers to an asset that increases 100 times from its entry price. These moves usually happen when investors enter early, before exchange listings and mainstream adoption. Direct Answer Box: Ethereum (ETH), Aster (ASTER), and APEMARS ($APRZ) each offer different paths to growth in 2026. Ethereum continues to attract institutional interest with its transition to staking and network efficiency, solidifying its position as a long-term investment. Aster, with its expanding utility and focus on interoperability, holds potential for steady growth in its niche. However, APEMARS, currently in Stage 3 of its presale, presents an exciting opportunity for early investors. With a projected 22,367% ROI and a narrowing window to secure tokens at $0.00002448, APEMARS offers the highest risk-reward potential. With its scarcity mechanics, staking rewards, and momentum-building structure, APEMARS could be the best 100x crypto investment for 2026.

57142812,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261294,1768353911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hybrid Digital Asset Payment Tech: KB Kookmin Card’s Revolutionary Patent Filing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kb-kookmin-card-hybrid-payment-patent/,"BitcoinWorld Hybrid Digital Asset Payment Tech: KB Kookmin Card’s Revolutionary Patent Filing In a significant move for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, South Korean financial giant KB Kookmin Card has filed a groundbreaking patent application for a hybrid digital asset payment technology. This innovation, reported by Newsis in Seoul, South Korea, on April 10, 2025, aims to seamlessly merge blockchain-based digital assets with traditional credit card infrastructure. Consequently, this development could fundamentally reshape how consumers interact with both fiat and cryptocurrency for daily transactions. Decoding the Hybrid Digital Asset Payment Technology KB Kookmin Card’s proposed system introduces a novel bridge between decentralized finance and conventional banking. The core technology links a user’s existing blockchain e-wallet address directly to their standard credit card account. Therefore, customers would not need a new physical or virtual card. The payment logic follows a specific, automated hierarchy. Initially, the system attempts to draw funds from the stablecoin balance within the user’s linked e-wallet. Subsequently, if the digital asset balance proves insufficient, the transaction automatically defaults to a standard credit card payment processed through the existing card network. This architecture presents several immediate advantages. First, it leverages familiar payment rails that merchants already accept globally. Second, it provides a built-in safety net for users experimenting with digital asset spending. Finally, it simplifies the user experience by eliminating the need to pre-convert assets or manage separate payment apps at the point of sale. Industry analysts note this approach contrasts with earlier crypto card models that required asset liquidation before settlement. The Strategic Shift in Payment Processing This patent filing arrives amidst a broader industry pivot. Major payment networks and banks globally are actively exploring digital asset integration. For instance, Visa and Mastercard have developed programs for crypto-linked cards, though often relying on third-party intermediaries for conversion. KB Kookmin Card’s technology appears to internalize this function, potentially offering greater control and efficiency. The focus on stablecoins is particularly strategic, as their price stability mirrors traditional currency, reducing volatility risk for both consumers and merchants during transactions. Real-World Context and Market Impact The development must be viewed within South Korea’s vibrant fintech and cryptocurrency landscape. The nation boasts one of the world’s highest crypto adoption rates and a population keen on technological innovation. Regulatory frameworks, like the Travel Rule and the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, have recently matured, providing clearer guidelines for financial institutions. KB Financial Group, the parent company of KB Kookmin Card, has consistently invested in blockchain research, signaling a long-term commitment to the sector. Potential impacts of this hybrid payment technology are multifaceted. For consumers, it promises unprecedented flexibility in managing liquidity across asset classes. For merchants, it could eventually reduce payment processing fees associated with traditional card networks, assuming blockchain settlement proves cheaper. For the broader crypto ecosystem, successful implementation by a major institution like KB Kookmin Card would serve as a powerful validation, potentially accelerating institutional adoption worldwide. Seamless Integration: Uses existing card infrastructure; no new hardware required. Automated Asset Prioritization: Spends stablecoins first, then defaults to credit. Enhanced User Security: Leverages established banking-grade security protocols. Regulatory Alignment: Designed within evolving digital asset financial frameworks. Expert Analysis on the Patent’s Significance Financial technology experts highlight the patent’s focus on interoperability as its key innovation. “The true barrier to crypto payments has rarely been the blockchain itself, but rather its connection to the legacy financial world,” notes Dr. Soo-Min Lee, a fintech researcher at Seoul National University. “A patent that systematically solves for hybrid settlement at the point of sale, especially from a major card issuer, represents a concrete step toward solving the last-mile problem for digital assets.” The technology could also pave the way for programmable finance features, such as automated rewards paid in cryptocurrency or smart contracts that trigger based on spending behavior. Technical and Regulatory Considerations Implementing this hybrid digital asset payment system involves complex technical and regulatory hurdles. On the technical side, the system must ensure real-time balance checks across disparate systems—the blockchain and the card network—while maintaining transaction speed and reliability. It must also provide robust safeguards against fraud and errors in the asset conversion process. From a regulatory perspective, the system must comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations across both traditional finance and digital asset domains. The patent application itself will undergo rigorous examination, a process that typically takes several years, indicating that this is a strategic, forward-looking move by KB Kookmin Card. Comparison: Traditional Crypto Card vs. KB Kookmin’s Hybrid Model Feature Traditional Crypto Card KB Kookmin Hybrid Model Asset Settlement Pre-conversion to fiat required Direct stablecoin spend with credit fallback Infrastructure Often requires new card issuance Uses existing credit card account User Experience Separate app management Unified payment flow Primary Innovation On-ramp/Off-ramp service Integrated hybrid payment rail Conclusion KB Kookmin Card’s patent application for a hybrid digital asset payment technology marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrency. By proposing a system that intelligently blends stablecoin e-wallets with conventional credit lines, the company is addressing critical challenges of usability and integration. While the path from patent to product involves significant technical and regulatory development, this move underscores a clear direction for the future of payments. Ultimately, the success of such hybrid digital asset payment systems could determine the speed and scale at which cryptocurrencies transition from investment vehicles to practical tools for everyday commerce. FAQs Q1: What exactly did KB Kookmin Card patent? KB Kookmin Card filed a patent for a payment system that links a blockchain e-wallet to a traditional credit card. This hybrid digital asset payment technology allows a transaction to first use stablecoins from the wallet and then automatically use credit if needed. Q2: Would I need a new credit card to use this technology? No. According to the patent details, the technology is designed to work with a customer’s existing credit card by linking it to a separate digital asset wallet address, eliminating the need for a new physical or virtual card. Q3: Why does the system use stablecoins first? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar. Using them first minimizes price volatility risk at the point of sale. It also encourages the direct use of digital assets while providing a familiar credit backup. Q4: Is this technology available to customers now? Not yet. The company has only filed a patent application. This is a legal step to protect the intellectual property. Product development, regulatory approvals, and testing would need to follow, which is a multi-year process. Q5: How does this differ from other crypto debit/credit cards? Many existing crypto cards automatically sell your cryptocurrency to fiat currency at the time of purchase. This hybrid model is designed to spend the digital asset (stablecoin) directly when possible, only resorting to the credit function as a secondary layer, potentially offering a more integrated experience.

Analysts are more worried about the creative software maker than they’ve been in over a decade as concerns pile up about whether it can keep up in the AI era. Oppenheimer cut its rating on Adobe stock to perform Tuesday. It’s just the newest downgrade in a string of them. Analysts are worrie d th e company’s going to struggle against competitors like OpenAI that let user s ma ke images and videos just by typing what they want. All these downgrades have pushed Adobe’s consensus rating down to 3.91 out of 5. That’s the lowest it’s been since 2013. The number comes from looking at how many analysts say buy, hold or sell. Brian Schwartz at Oppenheimer listed several problems he thinks will hurt the stock this year. There’s a rough business environment as companies shift to AI technology, and that’s going to mean weak revenue growth that keeps getting slower. Schwartz also mentioned bumpy product rollouts, doubts about how strong Adobe’s competitive spot really is, investors not being that interested in software stocks right now, and profit margins that are expected to shrink compared to last year. Stock performance lags far behind tech sector Shares fell 2.6% Tu esday. The stock’s down 6.4% so far this year through Monday. That comes after drops of more than 20% in both 2024 and 2025. Adobe’s lost more than 45% of its value since the end of 2023. Compare that to how other tech stocks have done. A fund that tracks software companies is up nearly 30% in that same time. Companies seen as AI winners like Microsoft, Oracle and Palantir Technologies hav e do ne well. The Nasdaq 100 Index has jumped more than 50%, thanks mostly to the Magnificent Seven. Software-as-a-service companies have been getting hammered. Investors think services from AI-focused startups are going to steal customers and hurt growth. Oppenheimer wasn’t the only firm to downgrade Adobe in January. BMO Capital Markets dropped it to market perform last week. The firm said competitive pressures in the creative market are getting worse and it doesn’t see any good news coming. Jefferies downgraded it to hold before that, pointing out that any revenue bump from AI hasn’t shown up yet. Growth has actually been slowing since fiscal 2023, including in the company’s early projections for fiscal 2026. Goldman Sachs analyst Gabriela Borges started covering Adobe with a sell ratin g Ja nuary 11. The firm used to rate it a buy. Borges wrote that Adobe’s handled tech changes well before, but AI is different. It’s making design tools available to everyone, which means fewer people need Adobe’s professional-level software. Valuation concerns take backseat to competition worries BMO cut its price target too, from $400 down to $375. The firm said Adobe’s valuation isn’t really the problem. The bigger issue is the competitive pressure building in creative software. BMO said Adobe now ranks dead last in its coverage group. It likes rivals Salesforce and HubSpot better. Survey data backs up these worries. BMO found that more than 50% of students use Canva instead of Adobe now. Nearly half of freelancers rely on Canva versus about 10% who only use Adobe. Over half of users said they work with both tools. BMO thinks that’s bad news given how dominant Adobe used to be. Canva’s expected to go public sometime in 2026 or 2027. That’ll probably make things even tougher for Adobe. Shares dropped roughly 20% over the past year, doing worse than the software sector overall.

Prediction Markets Reach Unprecedented Trading Volume The $700 million daily volume represents a significant acceleration in prediction market growth. These platforms allow participants to trade contracts based on real-world event outcomes, ranging from election results to economic indicators. Consequently, this record-breaking volume demonstrates increasing institutional and retail interest in alternative financial instruments. The data, originally reported by blockchain analytics firm Wu Blockchain, reveals consistent growth patterns throughout early 2025. Moreover, this surge coincides with regulatory clarity in several major jurisdictions, providing market participants with greater confidence in these emerging financial platforms. Market analysts note several contributing factors to this volume explosion. First, geopolitical events in early 2025 created numerous trading opportunities. Second, technological improvements reduced transaction costs significantly. Third, traditional financial institutions began allocating small percentages to prediction markets as portfolio diversifiers. Additionally, user interface enhancements made these platforms more accessible to non-technical traders. The convergence of these factors created perfect conditions for volume expansion. Market Share Distribution and Platform Analysis Kalshi emerged as the dominant platform during this record-setting period. The regulated U.S.-based prediction market captured approximately $466 million in daily volume, representing a commanding 66.4% market share. This dominance reflects Kalshi’s regulatory compliance and traditional financial partnerships. Meanwhile, decentralized platforms Polymarket and Opinion each secured 14.3% market shares, processing approximately $100 million in daily volume each. The remaining 5% distributed across smaller platforms and emerging market entrants. Prediction Market Platform Performance (January 12, 2025) Platform Daily Volume Market Share Primary Focus Kalshi $466 million 66.4% Regulated U.S. events Polymarket $100 million 14.3% Global decentralized events Opinion $100 million 14.3% Sports and entertainment Other Platforms $34 million 4.9% Niche and emerging markets Platform specialization explains much of this distribution pattern. Kalshi focuses primarily on U.S. regulatory-approved event contracts, attracting traditional investors. Conversely, Polymarket operates on Polygon blockchain technology, appealing to cryptocurrency-native traders. Opinion concentrates on sports and entertainment markets, drawing from different participant demographics. This segmentation suggests prediction markets are developing distinct ecosystem niches rather than competing directly for identical user bases. Expert Analysis of Market Dynamics Financial technology researchers identify three key drivers behind this volume surge. First, prediction markets provide superior information aggregation compared to traditional polling methods. Second, they offer hedging opportunities against event risks unavailable in conventional markets. Third, their binary outcome structure simplifies participation for new entrants. According to Massachusetts Institute of Technology research, prediction markets have demonstrated 76% accuracy in forecasting events versus 68% for expert panels. This predictive advantage increasingly attracts institutional attention. Regulatory developments significantly influenced recent growth patterns. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved expanded event contract categories in late 2024. Similarly, European regulators established clearer guidelines for prediction market operations. These developments reduced legal uncertainty that previously constrained market participation. Consequently, traditional market makers and liquidity providers entered the space, dramatically improving market depth and reducing spreads. Improved liquidity then attracted additional participants, creating a virtuous growth cycle. Historical Context and Growth Trajectory Prediction markets trace their origins to experimental economics research in the 1980s. The Iowa Electronic Markets, established in 1988, demonstrated their forecasting capabilities through multiple election cycles. However, technological limitations constrained early adoption. Blockchain technology revolutionized the space beginning around 2017 by enabling trustless settlement and global accessibility. Daily volumes remained below $10 million until 2021, then experienced exponential growth through 2024. 2018-2020: Average daily volume below $5 million 2021: First $50 million daily volume recorded 2022: $100 million threshold crossed during midterm elections 2023: $300 million achieved during presidential primary season 2024: $500 million milestone reached in November elections 2025: $700 million record set in January This growth trajectory demonstrates accelerating adoption rather than isolated spikes. The 2024 U.S. election cycle particularly boosted mainstream awareness. Major media organizations began citing prediction market probabilities alongside traditional polling data. Financial news networks added prediction market tracking segments to regular programming. This media coverage introduced millions of new potential participants to these markets throughout 2024. Technological Infrastructure Developments Behind the volume numbers, significant technological advancements enabled this scale. Layer-2 blockchain solutions reduced transaction costs by approximately 94% since 2022. Oracle networks improved their reliability and speed, with average resolution times decreasing from 48 hours to under 6 hours for most event types. User interface designs evolved from technical cryptocurrency exchanges to intuitive trading platforms resembling mainstream investment applications. These improvements lowered participation barriers dramatically. Mobile application development particularly influenced retail participation growth. Prediction market applications now feature simplified onboarding processes and educational resources. Many platforms removed cryptocurrency requirements for entry, accepting traditional payment methods. These accessibility improvements expanded the potential user base from thousands of cryptocurrency enthusiasts to millions of general retail investors. Application download data shows 340% growth in prediction market app installations during 2024 alone. Economic Implications and Market Efficiency The $700 million daily volume milestone carries significant economic implications. Prediction markets increasingly function as leading indicators for various sectors. Corporate decision-makers monitor relevant contract prices for market sentiment data. Political analysts track election probabilities more frequently than traditional polling updates. Insurance companies explore prediction markets for catastrophic event risk modeling. This utility expansion drives participation beyond speculative trading into practical business applications. Market efficiency improvements represent another important development. Bid-ask spreads have narrowed substantially across most prediction market platforms. Major event contracts now typically show spreads under 1%, comparable to established financial instruments. This liquidity improvement reduces transaction costs for all participants. Additionally, arbitrage opportunities between platforms have diminished, indicating better price discovery mechanisms. These efficiency gains suggest prediction markets are maturing toward mainstream financial instrument status. Conclusion Prediction markets reached a definitive inflection point with their $700 million daily volume achievement in January 2025. This milestone reflects years of technological refinement, regulatory progress, and increasing mainstream acceptance. Kalshi’s dominant market position demonstrates the importance of regulatory compliance in attracting institutional participation. Meanwhile, decentralized platforms continue serving global markets with innovative contract types. The prediction market sector now represents a legitimate alternative data source and financial instrument category. Future growth will likely depend on continued regulatory cooperation and technological reliability improvements. However, the $700 million volume record clearly establishes prediction markets as permanent components of the global financial ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What exactly are prediction markets? Prediction markets are exchange-traded platforms where participants buy and sell contracts based on real-world event outcomes. These contracts settle at either $0 or $1 depending on whether the specified event occurs, with trading prices representing market-assessed probabilities. Q2: Why did Kalshi capture such a large market share? Kalshi operates as a regulated U.S. exchange with CFTC approval, attracting institutional participants requiring regulatory compliance. Their focus on U.S. events and traditional financial integrations provided advantages during periods of increased mainstream adoption. Q3: Are prediction markets legal everywhere? Regulatory status varies significantly by jurisdiction. The United States permits prediction markets through regulated exchanges like Kalshi. Many European and Asian countries have established specific frameworks, while some jurisdictions prohibit or restrict these markets entirely. Q4: How accurate are prediction markets compared to traditional polling? Academic research generally shows prediction markets outperform traditional polling in forecasting accuracy. Market participants risk real capital based on their beliefs, creating stronger incentives for accurate information than opinion polling typically achieves. Q5: What types of events do prediction markets cover? Markets cover diverse events including election outcomes, economic indicators, sports results, entertainment awards, technological developments, and geopolitical events. Regulatory approvals determine which event categories specific platforms can offer in different jurisdictions.

Here’s what could be the reason for it, according to the founder of Capriole Investments. Bitcoin Has Diverged From The Global M2 Supply Trend In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has talked about how Bitcoin has decoupled from the global liquidity flows recently. Below is the chart cited by Edwards, which compares the year-over-year (YoY) percentage change in BTC to that in the global M2 supply. As displayed in the graph, Bitcoin’s YoY change flatlined over 2025 while the total money supply of the world’s major economies witnessed growth, indicating BTC diverged from traditional liquidity flows. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selloff Ending? LTH Outflows Decline In the past, the cryptocurrency’s YoY percentage change has generally showcased a similar trajectory to the global M2 supply. “This is the first time Bitcoin has decoupled from money supply and global liquidity flows,” noted the analyst. What’s the reason behind this new trend? According to Edwards, it’s the threat posed by quantum computing to the network. Quantum computers are hypothesized to have the capability to break the cryptocurrency’s cryptography, with wallets from the blockchain’s early days being especially vulnerable. It’s uncertain when quantum machines will find a breakthrough, but the Capriole founder believes BTC passed into a “Quantum Event Horizon” in 2025. “The timeframe to a non-zero probability of a quantum machine breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography is now less than the estimated time it will take to upgrade Bitcoin,” said Edwards. In theory, a party with a sufficiently advanced quantum computer could break into old dormant wallets and dump the coins on the market. This would not only directly impact BTC’s price but could also undermine broader trust in the cryptocurrency itself. “Money is repositioning to account for this risk accordingly,” explained the analyst. One X user countered that most investors don’t seem to agree with Edwards’ quantum timeline, suggesting that the market would be unlikely to decouple based on a view not widely shared. “If you listen to all in bitcoin maxis on X you would think that,” Edwards replied to the user. “If you talk to real capital allocators and Bitcoin OGs in the space 7+ years in private – they are all considering this risk.” Related Reading: Solana Price Jumps, But Network Adoption Remains Weak In some other news, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have continued to face weak demand recently, as data from SoSoValue shows. From the above chart, it’s visible that last week saw $681 million exit from the US Bitcoin spot ETFs. The new week has started with inflows so far, but it only remains to be seen whether they will continue in the coming days.

57144777,657298,1768356022,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57144777.jpeg,Bitcoin Is Replicating The Same Cup And Handle As Silver To Lead To ‘Violent Repricing’,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-is-replicating-silver/,"A crypto analyst has just identified a distinct Cup and Handle formation on the Bitcoin price chart that closely mirrors the pattern Silver displayed just before its historic 2017 rally. At the time, the analyst said Silver’s breakout from this key structure had triggered a violent reprice as buyers flooded the market. With BTC now tracing a similar pattern, he suggests the leading cryptocurrency could soon break out of its Cup and Handle structure and experience an explosive move. Bitcoin Mirrors Pre-Rally Silver Pattern From 2017 Since the 2021 bull cycle , Bitcoin has been forming a Cup and Handle pattern that has extended into 2025 and now looks ready to explode in 2026 . Crypto analyst Merlijn the Trader has shared a video chart analysis comparing Bitcoin’s current pattern to the long-term Cup and Handle structure Silver formed before its legendary rally in 2017. The analyst noted that Silver spent nearly a decade building a broad base, which caused many investors to lose interest, before the price finally cleared the $54 level and surged higher . Merlijn the Trader recalled a 2017 conversation in which someone predicted that Silver would jump to $80, while he argued that a break above $54 would open the door to a move toward a lower target range of $70-$75. At the time, Silver’s chart formed a rounded bottom between 2011 and 2023, with a flat resistance level near its previous high. After breaking through that level, a handle formed, which quickly led to a violent repricing that pushed Silver beyond the range it had been stuck in for years. Merlijn the Trader said Bitcoin is showing the same long base and slow climb that Silver had before its big move in 2017. On the chart, the BTC price bottomed during the 2022 bear market and has been steadily rising toward its previous highs, forming a rounded “cup” that matches the structure seen on the Silver. The chart also highlights a resistance zone around $70,000, where BTC was repeatedly rejected before finally breaking through. Once it cleared that level, the cryptocurrency formed a rising handle that resembles the final consolidation Silver made before its explosive move higher. According to Merlijn the Trader, Bitcoin’s pattern reflects sellers’ exhaustion after a long period of sideways trading. He explained that once the last sellers in the market are gone, BTC is free to reprice just as dramatically as Silver did in 2017. Possible Target For BTC Repricing In classical technical analysis, traders often use the height of the cup in a Cup and Handle pattern to predict the breakout trajectory of a coin. For BTC, this suggests a potential repricing target of $120,000-$140,000 if the handle resolves like Silver’s did in 2017. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading near $92,000, so reaching that range would require a gain of more than 30%.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|silver|Silver news|Silver price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-14 02:00:22

The address staked an additional 94,400 ETH, valued at approximately $314 million, bringing its total staked Ethereum holdings to 1,530,784 ETH worth $5.1 billion. This substantial move represents one of the largest single-entity staking activities observed in 2025 and provides crucial insights into institutional blockchain participation trends. Bitmine’s expanding Ethereum staking position The recent transaction represents a continuation of Bitmine’s established staking strategy. According to on-chain data analysis, the address has been consistently accumulating and staking Ethereum over multiple quarters. This latest addition of 94,400 ETH follows a pattern of strategic accumulation during various market conditions. The total staked amount now represents approximately 1.27% of all staked Ethereum on the Beacon Chain, making this entity one of the largest single validators in the Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum staking involves locking cryptocurrency to support network operations and security. Validators who stake their ETH help process transactions and create new blocks. In return, they earn rewards typically ranging from 3-5% annually. The Ethereum network transitioned to proof-of-stake consensus in September 2022, fundamentally changing how the blockchain secures transactions and validates new blocks. This shift created new opportunities for institutional investors seeking yield from their cryptocurrency holdings. Ethereum staking ecosystem analysis The Ethereum staking landscape has evolved significantly since the network’s transition to proof-of-stake. Currently, over 32 million ETH worth approximately $107 billion sits staked on the Beacon Chain. This represents about 26% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. Major staking entities include: Liquid staking protocols like Lido Finance, which control approximately 31% of staked ETH Centralized exchanges including Coinbase and Binance, which collectively manage about 22% Solo validators and institutional entities like the Bitmine-linked address, representing diversified participation The growth of Ethereum staking correlates directly with network security improvements. Higher staking participation increases the economic cost of attacking the network, thereby enhancing overall security. Furthermore, staking reduces circulating supply, potentially creating upward price pressure during periods of high demand. Market analysts monitor staking flows as indicators of long-term holder confidence and network health. Technical implications of large-scale staking Large staking positions like Bitmine’s require sophisticated technical infrastructure. Each Ethereum validator requires 32 ETH to activate, meaning the address operates approximately 47,837 individual validators. Managing this scale necessitates: Enterprise-grade hardware with 99.9%+ uptime requirements Advanced key management and security protocols Geographically distributed infrastructure for redundancy Compliance with evolving network upgrade requirements The technical complexity increases operational costs but also creates significant barriers to entry, potentially leading to increased centralization concerns. However, the Ethereum community continues developing solutions like distributed validator technology (DVT) to mitigate these risks while maintaining network security. Market context and institutional adoption The timing of this staking activity coincides with several positive developments for Ethereum. The network recently implemented the Prague/Electra upgrade, which introduced proto-danksharding and improved transaction efficiency. Additionally, regulatory clarity in major markets has increased institutional confidence in cryptocurrency investments. Several factors contribute to current staking trends: Factor Impact on Staking Evidence Regulatory clarity Increased institutional participation SEC approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in 2024 Network upgrades Improved staking economics Reduced validator requirements in recent hard forks Market maturity Professional infrastructure development Growth of institutional staking service providers Institutional investors typically approach cryptocurrency staking with different considerations than retail participants. They prioritize security, compliance, and risk management alongside yield generation. The scale of Bitmine’s staking activity suggests confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability as both a technological platform and investment vehicle. This confidence appears justified by the network’s continued development and growing adoption across decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and enterprise blockchain solutions. Comparative analysis with other blockchain networks Ethereum’s staking model differs significantly from other proof-of-stake networks. While networks like Solana and Cardano employ similar consensus mechanisms, their economic models and validator requirements vary substantially. Ethereum’s 32 ETH minimum per validator creates higher barriers to entry but potentially greater decentralization through broader participation. The network’s slashing conditions—penalties for validator misbehavior—are also more nuanced, balancing security requirements with validator protection. Other networks typically feature lower minimum staking requirements but may have different security trade-offs. The Ethereum approach prioritizes network security and decentralization, even at the cost of higher participation barriers. This philosophical difference explains why large institutional validators like Bitmine play such a significant role in Ethereum’s staking ecosystem compared to other networks where retail participation dominates. Future implications and network development The continued growth of institutional staking has several implications for Ethereum’s future development. First, it provides stable, long-term security for the network. Second, it creates economic incentives for continued protocol improvement. Third, it establishes Ethereum as a legitimate asset class for institutional portfolios. Looking forward, several developments could further influence staking dynamics: Ethereum Improvement Proposal 7251 proposes changes to validator reward structures Increased liquid staking derivative integration with traditional finance systems Cross-chain staking solutions enabling participation across multiple networks Regulatory frameworks specifically addressing staking services and taxation Network developers continue working on solutions to balance decentralization with institutional participation. Technologies like restaking, introduced by protocols like EigenLayer, create new economic security models while maintaining network integrity. These innovations demonstrate Ethereum’s adaptive capacity and continued relevance in the evolving blockchain landscape. Conclusion The Bitmine-linked address staking an additional $314 million in ETH represents more than just a large financial transaction. It signifies growing institutional confidence in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model and long-term viability. With total staked holdings now exceeding $5.1 billion, this entity demonstrates commitment to network security and participation. The Ethereum staking ecosystem continues maturing, balancing institutional participation with decentralization principles. As blockchain technology evolves, large-scale validators will play increasingly important roles in network operations and security. The Bitmine ETH staking activity provides valuable insights into current market trends and future development directions for the entire cryptocurrency sector. FAQs Q1: What does Ethereum staking involve? Ethereum staking involves locking ETH cryptocurrency to support network operations under proof-of-stake consensus. Validators process transactions and create new blocks, earning rewards typically between 3-5% annually while helping secure the network. Q2: How significant is a $314 million staking transaction? This transaction represents one of the largest single-entity staking moves in 2025. The Bitmine-linked address now controls approximately 1.27% of all staked Ethereum, making it a major network participant with significant influence on security and operations. Q3: What are the risks of large-scale staking? Major risks include technical failures, slashing penalties for validator misbehavior, liquidity constraints during lock-up periods, and potential centralization concerns. Large validators must maintain enterprise-grade infrastructure with high uptime requirements to avoid financial penalties. Q4: How does staking affect Ethereum’s price? Staking reduces circulating supply, potentially creating upward price pressure during high demand periods. However, the relationship is complex and influenced by multiple factors including overall market conditions, network usage, and broader cryptocurrency trends. Q5: What distinguishes institutional staking from retail participation? Institutional staking typically involves larger amounts, professional infrastructure, compliance considerations, and different risk management approaches. Institutions often use dedicated service providers and implement sophisticated security protocols not typically available to retail participants.

By 2029, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $0.52. In 2032, FLOW will range between $0.58 to $0.85. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2026? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.09307 Market Cap $156.31M Trading Volume $26.34M Circulating Supply 1.634B FLOW All-time High $46.16 (April 05, 2021) All-time Low $0.074 (Jan 2, 2026) 24-hour High $0.0974 24-hour Low $0.0854 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 31.90% (Extremely High) 50-Day SMA $0.1717 14-Day RSI 33.26 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green Days 10/30 (33%) 200-Day SMA $0.3028 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown The daily trend is firmly bearish below $0.114. 4-hour bounces are weak and capped under $0.10. If FLOW loses $0.095, the downside continuation will accelerate. Flow coin 1-day price analysis On the daily chart for January 14, Flow is trading near $0.096, continuing to print lower highs and lower lows after the sharp breakdown from the $0.14–$0.15 region. The price is hugging the lower Bollinger Band, signaling persistent downside pressure rather than a mean-reversion bounce. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI is deeply suppressed around 29, confirming oversold conditions but with no meaningful bullish divergence yet. Likewise, the MACD remains negative, although histogram contraction hints that selling momentum is slowing, not reversing. As long as Flow remains below the mid-band near $0.114, the broader daily structure stays decisively bearish, with downside risk still active toward $0.085–$0.08. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, price is consolidating just under $0.10 after repeated failed recovery attempts, with the Alligator averages still clearly stacked bearishly. The recent rejection from $0.10–$0.102 reinforces this zone as immediate resistance, while support sits thin around $0.095. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI is hovering in the low 40s, showing mild relief but no momentum shift, and MACD remains flat-to-negative, reflecting a lack of aggressive buyers. This structure suggests distribution at lows rather than accumulation, increasing the risk of another leg down if $0.095 fails cleanly. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.09115 BUY SMA 5 $0.09363 SELL SMA 10 $0.09430 SELL SMA 21 $0.1142 SELL SMA 50 $0.1717 SELL SMA 100 $0.2262 SELL SMA 200 $0.3028 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.09433 SELL EMA 5 $0.09370 SELL EMA 10 $0.09996 SELL EMA 21 $0.1233 SELL EMA 50 $0.1708 SELL EMA 100 $0.2236 SELL EMA 200 $0.2909 SELL What to expect from Flow? Flow remains technically weak across both timeframes, with oversold conditions slowing the sell-off but not changing trend direction. A sustained reclaim above $0.114 is required to shift the daily bias, while failure to hold $0.095 likely exposes deeper downside toward $0.085. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming years. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $1-$2 by 2032. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance. Recent news/opinion on Flow A security incident was reported on Flow.

This explosive growth fundamentally reshapes the digital payments landscape while demonstrating accelerating mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. Furthermore, stablecoins now represent 0.583% of Revolut’s total payment volume, nearly doubling their previous share and establishing a significant new transaction corridor. Revolut Stablecoin Payments: Analyzing the $10.5 Billion Surge The $10.5 billion stablecoin payment volume represents a monumental shift in user behavior. For comparison, this figure exceeds the annual GDP of several small nations. Revolut processed these transactions through its integrated cryptocurrency platform, which supports multiple stablecoins including USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT). The platform’s seamless interface bridges traditional banking with digital asset functionality. Consequently, users can convert fiat currencies to stablecoins instantly. They can then send cross-border payments with minimal fees and settlement times measured in minutes rather than days. Industry analysts attribute this growth to several converging factors. First, Revolut’s global user base expanded to over 40 million customers worldwide. Second, increasing merchant acceptance of stablecoin payments created more utility. Third, volatile traditional currency markets in certain regions drove demand for dollar-pegged alternatives. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, fully implemented in 2024, provided crucial regulatory clarity. This framework established consumer protection standards that increased institutional and retail confidence in stablecoin transactions. The Infrastructure Behind the Growth Revolut invested heavily in blockchain infrastructure throughout 2023-2024. The company developed proprietary systems for real-time transaction monitoring and compliance verification. These systems automatically screen transactions against global sanctions lists. They also ensure adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) requirements across multiple jurisdictions. The technical architecture supports transactions on Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana blockchains. This multi-chain approach provides users with flexibility in network selection based on speed and cost preferences. Stablecoin Adoption Trends in Global Neobanking Revolut’s experience reflects broader industry patterns across the digital banking sector. Competitors including N26, Monzo, and Chime have similarly integrated cryptocurrency features, though with varying approaches. The table below illustrates how major neobanks compare in their stablecoin implementations: Neobank Stablecoin Support Transaction Volume (2024) Primary Use Cases Revolut USDC, USDT, EURC $10.5B Cross-border payments, trading, merchant payments N26 Limited crypto trading only Not disclosed Investment exposure Monzo Third-party integrations Estimated $1.2B Peer-to-peer transfers Chime No direct support N/A Traditional banking only This comparative data reveals Revolut’s first-mover advantage in fully integrating stablecoins into core banking functions. The 0.583% share of total payments, while seemingly modest, represents billions in transaction value. More importantly, it establishes a growth trajectory that financial analysts project will accelerate. Traditional banks process approximately $5 trillion daily in cross-border payments. Even fractional adoption of stablecoin technology within this massive market creates enormous volume potential. Regulatory Environment and Compliance Framework The regulatory landscape evolved significantly during Revolut’s growth period. The United Kingdom implemented its comprehensive crypto asset regime in 2024. Meanwhile, the United States progressed with clearer stablecoin legislation through the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act. These developments created more predictable operating environments for financial institutions. Revolut’s compliance team expanded to over 300 specialists focusing specifically on cryptocurrency regulations. Their work ensures all stablecoin transactions meet jurisdictional requirements across Revolut’s 50+ markets. Impact on Traditional Payment Systems and Banking Infrastructure Traditional payment networks face mounting pressure from stablecoin innovations. SWIFT, the global bank messaging system, typically settles cross-border transactions in 1-5 business days. Stablecoin transactions on Revolut’s platform often settle in under 5 minutes. This dramatic improvement in settlement speed addresses a longstanding pain point for businesses and individuals. Correspondent banking relationships, which add layers of cost and complexity, become less necessary with direct blockchain settlement. The cost structure difference proves equally significant. Traditional international wire transfers frequently incur fees of $25-$50 per transaction. Stablecoin transfers on Revolut typically cost less than $1 regardless of amount. For migrant workers sending remittances to families abroad, this represents substantial savings. World Bank data indicates global remittance flows exceeded $800 billion in 2024. Even modest adoption of stablecoin technology could save consumers billions annually in transfer fees. Speed advantage: Minutes versus days for cross-border settlement Cost reduction: 90%+ lower fees compared to traditional methods Accessibility improvement: 24/7 availability without banking holidays Transparency benefit: Public blockchain verification of transactions Technical Implementation and Security Measures Revolut’s engineering team developed sophisticated custody solutions for customer assets. The majority of stablecoins remain in cold storage with institutional-grade security protocols. Multi-signature wallets require multiple authorized personnel for access. Regular third-party security audits occur quarterly. Insurance coverage protects against potential breaches or losses. These measures exceed standard banking security requirements. They address unique blockchain-related risks while maintaining user accessibility for frequent transactions. Future Projections and Industry Implications Financial analysts project continued exponential growth in stablecoin payment volumes. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates the total stablecoin market will exceed $3 trillion by 2027. Revolut’s current trajectory suggests it will capture increasing market share. The company plans to expand stablecoin support to additional currencies including GBP-pegged alternatives. Geographic expansion into Asian markets presents another growth avenue. Partnerships with e-commerce platforms could further integrate stablecoin payments into everyday transactions. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) represent both competition and potential synergy. The Bank of England’s digital pound, currently in development, may eventually integrate with private stablecoin systems. This public-private hybrid model could combine regulatory oversight with innovation speed. Revolut executives have participated in multiple CBDC working groups. They advocate for interoperable systems that maintain consumer choice while ensuring financial stability. Expert Perspectives on Sustainable Growth Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Fintech Research Director at Cambridge University, explains the broader significance: “Revolut’s 156% growth isn’t merely a corporate metric. It reflects structural changes in how people move value globally. The doubling of stablecoin’s payment share indicates fundamental behavioral shifts. Users increasingly recognize the practical advantages of blockchain-based transfers. However, sustainable growth requires continued focus on regulatory compliance and risk management.” Michael Chen, Payment Systems Analyst at Deloitte, adds technical context: “The infrastructure supporting this volume deserves examination. Revolut processes approximately $28.8 million in stablecoin payments daily. This requires robust blockchain node management, liquidity provisioning, and real-time monitoring systems. Their technical achievements enable the user experience simplicity that drives adoption.” Conclusion Revolut’s stablecoin payment volume reaching $10.5 billion with 156% year-over-year growth marks a pivotal moment in financial technology evolution. The near-doubling of stablecoin’s share in total payments to 0.583% demonstrates accelerating mainstream adoption. This growth trajectory results from strategic infrastructure investment, regulatory compliance, and genuine user utility. As traditional payment systems face innovation pressure, Revolut’s experience provides a blueprint for integrating blockchain technology at scale. The convergence of neobanking and cryptocurrency continues reshaping global finance, with stablecoin payments emerging as a fundamental component of modern financial infrastructure. FAQs Q1: What exactly are stablecoins and how do they differ from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar or euro. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, they maintain consistent value. This stability makes them suitable for payments and transfers. Revolut primarily supports USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT). Q2: Why would someone use stablecoin payments instead of traditional bank transfers? Stablecoin payments offer three main advantages: significantly lower fees (often under $1), faster settlement (minutes versus days), and 24/7 availability. They’re particularly beneficial for cross-border transactions where traditional banking systems remain slow and expensive. Q3: Is my money safe when using stablecoins on Revolut? Revolut implements multiple security measures including cold storage for most assets, multi-signature wallets, regular security audits, and insurance coverage. Regulatory compliance with frameworks like MiCA in Europe provides additional consumer protections for qualified stablecoins. Q4: How does the 0.583% stablecoin payment share translate to real-world usage? While 0.583% seems small, it represents billions in transaction value within Revolut’s massive payment volume. More importantly, it indicates rapid growth from previously negligible levels. This trajectory suggests increasing mainstream adoption as more users discover the benefits. Q5: What does this growth mean for the future of traditional banking? Traditional banks face increasing pressure to modernize payment infrastructure. The speed and cost advantages of stablecoin systems will likely push traditional institutions to either develop competing solutions or partner with fintech companies. This innovation ultimately benefits consumers through better services.

57144479,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=261303,1768358711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"DZ Bank’s Revolutionary ‘meinKrypto’ Platform Launches, Bringing Regulated Digital Assets to Millions of German Savers",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dz-bank-meinkrypto-platform-launch/,"BitcoinWorld DZ Bank’s Revolutionary ‘meinKrypto’ Platform Launches, Bringing Regulated Digital Assets to Millions of German Savers In a landmark move for European finance, DZ Bank has officially launched its proprietary cryptocurrency platform, meinKrypto , marking a pivotal shift in how traditional banking institutions engage with digital assets. This launch, reported by Cointelegraph and occurring in Frankfurt, Germany, in late 2024, follows the platform’s formal approval under the European Union’s pioneering Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. Consequently, the platform will initially support four major digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA), offering a secure gateway for its vast network. DZ Bank’s meinKrypto Platform Enters the Regulated Arena DZ Bank, acting as the central institution for Germany’s cooperative financial network, supports over 700 local cooperative banks (Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken). Therefore, the launch of meinKrypto is not an isolated product release. Instead, it represents a strategic infrastructure deployment for a significant portion of the German retail banking sector. The platform’s existence directly results from evolving client demand and a clearer regulatory landscape. Initially, the service will provide custody and trading for a carefully selected quartet of cryptocurrencies, signaling a conservative yet confident entry into the market. This development arrives at a critical juncture. Major financial hubs globally are competing to establish dominance in the digital asset space. Germany, with its stringent financial regulations and strong economy, is positioning itself as a leader in compliant crypto finance. The choice of initial assets reflects a focus on established networks with substantial market capitalization and developer activity. For instance, Bitcoin and Ethereum serve as the foundational layer one protocols. Meanwhile, Litecoin offers a tested payments-focused alternative, and Cardano brings a proof-of-stake, research-driven approach. The MiCA Regulation: A Framework for Trust The launch’s timing is inextricably linked to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. MiCA, finalized in 2023 and applying fully from 2025, establishes a harmonized regulatory regime for crypto-assets across the EU’s 27 member states. Crucially, it provides legal clarity for issuers and service providers, mandating strict requirements for transparency, disclosure, authorization, and supervision of transactions. For a conservative institution like DZ Bank, operating within this clear regulatory perimeter was a non-negotiable prerequisite. MiCA’s provisions effectively bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). By requiring crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) to be licensed, it instills a level of consumer protection and market integrity previously absent in much of the crypto space. DZ Bank’s approval under this framework allows it to leverage its existing reputation for security and trust. Subsequently, it can translate that trust into the digital asset domain, offering customers a familiar and regulated environment. Expert Analysis on Institutional Adoption Financial analysts view this launch as a bellwether for broader institutional adoption. “The entry of a pillar of the German cooperative banking system into digital asset custody is a profound validation of the asset class,” notes Dr. Lena Schmidt, a fintech regulation professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance. “It signals to other risk-averse European banks that providing crypto services is not only feasible under MiCA but may soon become a competitive necessity. The curated asset selection shows a phased, risk-managed approach that other institutions will likely emulate.” Furthermore, the move aligns with growing asset allocation trends. A 2024 survey by the German Asset Management Association revealed that nearly 18% of institutional investors in Germany had some exposure to cryptocurrencies, a figure expected to double by 2026. DZ Bank’s platform provides the essential, regulated plumbing to facilitate this growing demand from both retail customers accessing crypto through their local bank and institutional clients requiring sophisticated custody solutions. Technical Implementation and Strategic Implications While DZ Bank has disclosed few technical specifics, the architecture of meinKrypto likely involves a hybrid custody model. Typically, such institutional platforms combine secure, insured cold storage for the majority of assets with a hot wallet system for facilitating transactions. Security remains the paramount concern, especially following high-profile exchange failures in previous years. The bank’s existing robust cybersecurity frameworks and compliance departments provide a significant advantage over native crypto startups. The strategic implications are multifaceted. For the German cooperative banking network, it offers a defensive product to retain customers who might otherwise seek crypto exposure through unregulated or foreign exchanges. It also creates a potential new revenue stream through trading fees and custody services. On a macro scale, it further integrates digital assets into the formal economy, enhancing transaction traceability and tax compliance. The platform’s design choices, such as the supported assets, will also influence market perceptions and liquidity for those specific cryptocurrencies. Initial Digital Assets on meinKrypto Asset Symbol Primary Use Case Consensus Mechanism Bitcoin BTC Digital Gold / Store of Value Proof-of-Work Ethereum ETH Smart Contract Platform Proof-of-Stake Litecoin LTC Peer-to-Peer Payments Proof-of-Work Cardano ADA Smart Contracts & DApps Proof-of-Stake Comparative Landscape and Future Roadmap DZ Bank is not the first German bank to explore crypto. However, its scale and central role in the cooperative network make it uniquely influential. Other German financial institutions have taken varied approaches: Commerzbank: Received a crypto custody license in 2023, focusing on institutional clients. Deutsche Bank: Partnered with Swiss crypto firm Taurus for custody and tokenization services. Sparkassen: The savings banks association has piloted crypto services but without a unified national platform yet. The meinKrypto launch likely represents only phase one. Industry observers anticipate a future roadmap that may include: Expansion of the supported cryptocurrency list, potentially including other major assets like Solana (SOL) or Polkadot (DOT). Integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for staking or yield-generation services, albeit in a heavily regulated wrapper. Exploration of tokenized traditional assets, such as bonds or funds, on blockchain networks. Broader rollout to the bank’s institutional and corporate client base. This phased expansion will depend on regulatory developments, market stability, and internal risk assessments. Nevertheless, the initial launch breaks a significant barrier, proving the operational model within a major, traditional bank. Conclusion The launch of DZ Bank’s meinKrypto platform is a transformative event in the convergence of traditional and digital finance. By leveraging the trust of Germany’s cooperative banking network and operating under the EU’s definitive MiCA regulation, it provides a secure, compliant on-ramp for millions of customers. This move significantly legitimizes the underlying technology and asset class, encouraging further institutional adoption. While starting with a focused selection of four cryptocurrencies, the platform’s establishment paves the way for a future where digital asset services are a standard offering within the European banking landscape. The success of meinKrypto will be closely watched as a benchmark for how traditional finance can successfully and securely embrace the digital asset revolution. FAQs Q1: What is DZ Bank’s meinKrypto platform? A1: MeinKrypto is a regulated cryptocurrency custody and trading platform launched by Germany’s DZ Bank. It allows customers of associated cooperative banks to buy, sell, and securely hold digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum under EU financial rules. Q2: Why is the MiCA regulation important for this launch? A2: The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation provides a unified legal framework across the European Union. DZ Bank’s approval under MiCA ensures the platform meets strict standards for consumer protection, transparency, and operational integrity, which was essential for the bank’s participation. Q3: Which cryptocurrencies are available on meinKrypto initially? A3: The platform launched with support for four digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA). This selection represents a mix of store-of-value, smart contract, and payments-focused cryptocurrencies. Q4: Who can use the meinKrypto service? A4: Initially, the service is available to retail and business customers of the local cooperative banks (Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken) that are part of DZ Bank’s network, which includes millions of account holders across Germany. Q5: How does this differ from using a standard cryptocurrency exchange? A5: Unlike many independent exchanges, meinKrypto operates as a service from a fully licensed, traditional bank. This offers integration with existing bank accounts, the consumer protections of the German financial system, and oversight under EU banking and MiCA regulations.

Over the past week, the network recorded about 327,100 new Ether wallets being created per day. Fresh on-chain data shows Sunday set a new high with roughly 393,600 wallets created in a single day. That was the largest daily increase ever recorded for Ethereum. This comes in when the global crypto market is printing green indexes, led by bulls. The cumulative digital assets market cap surged by more than 4% in the last 24 hours to hit $3.25 trillion mark. Ether price has jumped by over 7% in the past 30 days as Bitcoin safely regained the $95K mark. Lower fees spark fresh activity on Ethereum A sudden jump in ETH wallets follows a protocol upgrade that got rolled out in early December. The Fusaka upgrade changed how data is handled on the network. It has lowered costs for L2 systems to post information back to Ethereum. This move has made transactions cheaper and smoother for users on the network. The average gas costs fell to 0.051 Gwei. Ethereum Gas Price; Source: Etherscan A dip in the fees is pumping up the activity for the network. Santiment data shows that the stablecoin transfers on Ethereum reached a record late last year. The total volumes hit about $8 trillion in Q4. Payments and settlement flows at that scale often require new wallets. This suggests that users were bagging ETH when its price dipped, which eventually backed the address growth. Santiment data mentioned that trends from late December into January also point to new users entering the ecosystem. However, wallets are being created as users explore decentralised finance games and NFT-related applications. It added that seasonal factors may have played a role. Crypto markets often see renewed runs around the turn of the year. Traders and developers tend to reset strategies. Crypto Fear and Greed Index shows that investor sentiment has turned “Neutral” after spending weeks in the “Fear” territory. Ether had failed multiple times to hold above $3,300 over the past two months. The fresh push has helped ETH to overcome this barrier. Ethereum price surged by almost 8% in the last 24 hours. It is trading at an average price of $3,348 at the press time. DEX trading pulls back Activity across decentralised apps seems to be cooling down. DefiLlama data shows that aggregate DEX volumes over the past two weeks totalled $150.4 billion. This number dipped sharply from the $340 billion record set in January 2025. Ethereum seven day DEX volumes have hovered near $9 billion. It went on to peak at $27.8 billion in October. Derivatives markets also point to calmer conditions. 30-day implied volatility measures tied to Bitcoin and Ether have declined. These indicators reflect hopes for price swings. Lower readings suggest traders are looking for reduced near-term movement. This comes despite ongoing geopolitical risks and shifts in ETF flows. At the same time, SharpLink Gaming has expanded its exposure to the asset. The company has accumulated more than 865,000 ETH. The stake was valued at about $2.75 billion as of Tuesday.

The token initially soared to a market cap of $580 million but has since fallen sharply to approximately $133 million. Eric Adams Under Fire In a promotional video, Adams declared, “We’re about to change the game. This thing is about to take off like crazy.” However, the excitement was short-lived as evidence surfaced suggesting that the steep decline in value resulted from a significant sell-off involving a user connected to the NYC Token’s development team. Related Reading: New Hope For Crypto: Senators Introduce Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act Blockchain analysis platform Bubblemaps flagged potentially concerning activity linked to the NYC Token. Notably, a wallet associated with the token’s deployer withdrew around $2.5 million in liquidity when the token peaked. Although about $1.5 million was returned after the token’s value dropped by 60%, approximately $900,000 remains unreturned. This has led users on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to accuse Adams of orchestrating a crypto rug pull. Adams, who has been an outspoken proponent of cryptocurrency, stated during a Monday event that some of the funds generated by the NYC Token would be directed towards nonprofits focused on combating antisemitism and “anti-Americanism.” Additionally, he expressed intentions to use the proceeds to “teach our children about embracing blockchain technology.” The NYC Token’s official website states there is a total supply of one billion tokens in circulation, and details reveal that 10 percent of profits are allocated to the team’s activities, though the identities of those involved were not disclosed. NYC Token Team Responds In response to criticism, the NYC Token team acknowledged the liquidity withdrawal, stating, “Given the overwhelming support and demand for the token at launch, our partners had to rebalance the liquidity.” They added, “We’re in it for the long haul!” However, there remains uncertainty about the details surrounding the token’s launch, with a recently listed entity, C18 Digital, associated with the project. Delaware corporation records show that C18 Digital was incorporated on December 30, 2025. Related Reading: Coinbase Mulls Exiting Support For Crypto Market Structure Bill Ahead Of January 15 Deadline Typically, when a cryptocurrency launches, developers create a liquidity pool using various assets, such as Circle’s USDC or Solana (SOL), to allow users to buy and sell the new token. The NYC Token took a different approach by establishing a one-sided liquidity pool comprised solely of the token itself. As users began purchasing the token, they injected liquidity into the pool using USDC, which was followed by the significant withdrawal of $2.5 million. This tactic, described by analyst Vaiman, can be more subtle than direct token sell-offs. Following the viral reports of the alleged rug pull, a new account associated with the NYC Token announced that additional funds had been injected into the liquidity pool.

57144779,657305,1768359620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57144779.jpeg,Bitcoin Institutional Shift: CLARITY Act Nears Senate Review,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-institutional-shift-clarity-act-near-senate/,"Bitcoin has spent several weeks struggling around a pivotal price range, frustrating traders and reinforcing bearish narratives across the market. After failing to reclaim key resistance levels, a growing number of analysts are calling for a broader bear market to unfold. Price action has been choppy, momentum has faded, and volatility has compressed—conditions that often amplify pessimism. Yet beneath the surface, some analysts argue that Bitcoin is no longer behaving as it did in previous cycles. According to this view, the market structure itself is changing. Long-term holders appear less reactive, sell-side pressure has moderated, and on-chain activity suggests a slower, more deliberate market. Rather than a reflexive risk asset, Bitcoin is increasingly traded and held with a longer time horizon. This shift becomes especially relevant as the policy backdrop evolves in the United States. The US Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to mark up the crypto market structure bill known as the CLARITY Act on January 15, 2026. This event should not be interpreted as a short-term price catalyst. Instead, it represents a potential inflection point in how Bitcoin is positioned within the US regulatory framework. While prices remain relatively stable, on-chain data already hints at a market adapting to a more institutional, regulated environment. The implication is clear: Bitcoin may be entering a structurally different phase , even as sentiment remains divided. On-Chain Signals Point to Patience, Not De-Risking A report by CryptoQuant, authored by XWIN Research Japan, highlights that Exchange Netflow remains a critical signal in the current environment. Historically, periods of regulatory uncertainty tend to push Bitcoin into exchanges as investors prepare to sell or reduce exposure. Ahead of the upcoming CLARITY bill discussions, however, this behavior has not materialized. Exchange inflows have stayed relatively muted, suggesting that market participants are not positioning defensively or treating the legislative process as an immediate threat. SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) reinforces this interpretation. The metric, which measures whether moved coins are sold at a profit or a loss, is hovering around or slightly below the 1.0 threshold. This indicates subdued profit-taking activity. More importantly, it implies that on-chain spending itself remains low. In simple terms, Bitcoin is not being moved aggressively, either to realize gains or to exit positions. Together, Exchange Netflow and SOPR point to a market posture that is patient rather than defensive. Investors appear willing to hold through uncertainty instead of rotating capital or rushing to de-risk. The time horizon is clearly lengthening. From this perspective, the CLARITY Act represents more than a policy debate. It marks a potential step toward integrating Bitcoin into the U.S. financial framework as a regulated digital commodity. On-chain data already reflects this shift: before any major price move, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly “sticky,” signaling a transition away from speculative trading and toward institutional-grade holding behavior. Bitcoin Price Consolidation Continues Bitcoin price action remains constrained within a well-defined consolidation range, following the sharp correction that began in November. After rejecting from the $120K–$125K region, BTC experienced an impulsive sell-off that found a local bottom near the mid-$80K zone, where demand visibly stepped in. Since then, price has been carving a higher low structure, suggesting that downside momentum is gradually weakening. On the daily chart, Bitcoin is now attempting to stabilize above the $92K area, which aligns closely with a former support-turned-resistance level. This zone has acted as a pivot throughout the current range and remains critical for short-term direction. A sustained hold above it would strengthen the case for a broader recovery toward the $98K–$100K region, where the declining short-term moving averages converge. However, the broader trend remains technically fragile. Price is still trading below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, both of which are sloping downward. This indicates that the medium-term structure has not yet shifted back to bullish. Volume also remains relatively muted, reinforcing the idea that this move is corrective rather than impulsive. As long as Bitcoin remains trapped between roughly $88K and $95K, the market is likely to remain range-bound. A decisive break above resistance or a loss of current support will be required to resolve this consolidation phase and define the next directional move.

This historic surge represents a single-day gain of 5.16%, fundamentally reshaping the landscape for precious metals investors and industrial users worldwide. The dramatic move eclipses previous records set over a decade ago, signaling a potent convergence of macroeconomic forces and shifting investor sentiment. Spot Silver Price Shatters Decades-Old Records The journey to $90 represents a monumental breakthrough. For context, the previous all-time high for silver stood at approximately $49.50, set in April 2011. Consequently, the recent price action marks an increase of over 80% from that prior peak. Market analysts immediately noted the velocity of the ascent. Trading volumes on major commodity exchanges like COMEX spiked by over 200% compared to the monthly average. Furthermore, the rally occurred alongside significant gains in gold, which also tested its own record levels. This synchronous movement underscores a broad-based flight to tangible assets. The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) confirmed the benchmark price settlement, adding institutional validation to the milestone. Key Drivers Behind the Precious Metals Rally Several interconnected factors propelled silver to its unprecedented valuation. Primarily, persistent global inflationary pressures continue to erode fiat currency values, enhancing the appeal of hard assets. Central bank policies, particularly those of the Federal Reserve, remain a critical watchpoint for traders. Simultaneously, robust industrial demand forms a powerful fundamental base. Silver is a critical component in photovoltaic cells for solar energy, electric vehicles, and 5G infrastructure. The global push for green energy, notably the 2030 decarbonization targets, directly increases consumption. Geopolitical tensions in resource-rich regions have also disrupted supply chains, compounding scarcity concerns. Finally, substantial inflows into physically-backed silver ETFs, such as the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), demonstrate strong institutional and retail investment demand. Expert Analysis on Market Structure and Sentiment Market strategists point to a unique structural shift. “This isn’t merely a speculative bubble,” notes Dr. Anya Sharma, Head of Commodities Research at Global Markets Insight. “We are witnessing a fundamental repricing based on silver’s dual role as both a monetary metal and an indispensable industrial commodity. The supply-demand equation has tightened considerably, with mine production growth lagging behind consumption forecasts from the Silver Institute.” Technical analysts highlight that the break above the long-term resistance level near $50 opened a path for accelerated gains. Sentiment indicators, like the Silver Institute’s survey of fabricators, show expectations for continued tightness in the physical market throughout 2025. Historical Context and Price Performance Timeline Understanding this rally requires a look at silver’s volatile history. The metal’s price was famously manipulated during the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market in 1980, peaking near $50 (inflation-adjusted). After the 2011 high, a long bear market ensued, with prices languishing below $20 for much of the late 2010s. The turnaround began in 2020, fueled by pandemic-related stimulus and supply concerns. The following table illustrates key milestones in the recent ascent: Date Price (USD/oz) Catalyst/Event March 2020 ~$12.00 COVID-19 market crash low August 2020 $28.00 Peak of initial pandemic rally February 2021 $30.00 Reddit-fueled retail buying surge Q4 2023 $25.00 Consolidation phase January 2025 $45.00 Break above 2011 high resistance April 10, 2025 $90.00 (intraday) New All-Time High This timeline clearly shows the acceleration of gains following the decisive break of the $50 level, a classic technical pattern. Implications for Investors and the Global Economy The surge in the spot silver price carries significant ramifications. For investors, it validates strategies focused on commodity diversification and inflation hedging. However, it also increases volatility risks for short-term traders. Mining equities and royalty companies have experienced outsized gains, often leveraged to the underlying metal price. For industry, higher input costs pose a challenge for manufacturers of electronics, jewelry, and solar panels. This could potentially slow adoption rates or spur increased recycling efforts. On a macroeconomic level, rising precious metals prices are traditionally viewed as a barometer of declining confidence in fiat currencies and a hedge against systemic financial risk. Central banks may monitor this trend as they assess their own reserve asset allocations. The Critical Role of Industrial Demand Unlike gold, silver’s price has a substantial anchor in real-world consumption. Approximately 50% of annual demand originates from industrial applications. Key growth sectors include: Photovoltaics (Solar Panels): The Silver Institute projects this sector will consume over 150 million ounces in 2025. Electronics: Essential for conductors, contacts, and solders in everything from smartphones to automotive systems. Electric Vehicles: Each EV uses significantly more silver than a traditional combustion engine vehicle for electronics and battery management. Medical & Biotechnology: Silver’s antimicrobial properties drive use in coatings and equipment. This broad-based demand creates a price floor that is less susceptible to purely speculative flows. Conclusion The spot silver price reaching a stunning $90 all-time high marks a pivotal chapter in financial markets. This event is not an isolated incident but the result of sustained macroeconomic pressures, robust industrial demand, and shifting investment paradigms. The breach of this historic level confirms silver’s renewed status as a critical strategic asset. Moving forward, market participants will closely watch inventory levels at exchanges, central bank policy signals, and technological adoption rates. The $90 spot silver price serves as a powerful reminder of the metal’s unique position at the intersection of finance, industry, and geopolitics. FAQs Q1: What does ‘spot silver price’ mean? The spot price is the current market price for immediate delivery and payment of silver. It is the benchmark used for pricing physical metal, ETFs, and derivatives at any given moment. Q2: Why is silver’s price more volatile than gold’s? Silver has a smaller overall market value (market cap) than gold, making it more susceptible to large price swings from significant investment inflows or outflows. Its dual nature as both an investment and industrial metal also exposes it to both financial and economic cycles. Q3: How can an individual investor gain exposure to silver? Common methods include purchasing physical bullion (bars or coins), buying shares of a physically-backed Silver ETF (like SLV), investing in silver mining company stocks, or trading futures and options contracts (for advanced investors). Q4: Does high silver prices hurt the solar industry? Potentially, yes. Higher silver costs increase the manufacturing expense of photovoltaic cells. The industry actively researches thrifting technologies to reduce the amount of silver per panel and develops alternative conductive materials to mitigate this cost pressure. Q5: What are the main risks to the current high silver price?

Total hashrate refers to the total computer power utilized by a company for mining, encompassing both the mining machines owned and operated by the company itself and those operated on behalf of other companies. The change symbolizes a tectonic shift in mining, where, for a long time, MARA had been the first mining company, but Bitdeer’s rise reflects broader trends reshaping the industry. “Bitdeer reported 71 EH/s capacity as of end December (~6% of global hash rate), +18% m/m, +229% y/y,” VanEck Head of Research Matt Sigel said on X. “Like other miners, they are actively selling everything they mine (and more) to fund the AI pivot.” While differences in how these companies report figures make it difficult to declare a definitive leader, Bitdeer now controls a substantially higher total hashrate. Bitdeer’s rise to the top Bitdeer is a technology company based in Singapore, focusing on mining Bitcoin using powerful machines that can solve extremely complex mathematical problems, as well as constructing high-performance computers for AI and other advanced computing applications. The company developed its own mining machines, known as SEALMINER rigs, specifically designed for Bitcoin mining. By December 2025, these rigs had mined 636 Bitcoins, a significant increase from roughly 145 Bitcoins in December 2023. By this time, Bitdeer can self-mine around 55.2 EH/s, but it is mined in segments. The other sum of the power is created by hosting services and cloud services, in which Bitdeer helps others to run their machines. The expansion of Bitdeer has included an increasing number of SEALMINER rigs that it owns and controls directly. Deployed across multiple locations, these machines help the company generate more Bitcoin.” Additionally, the company does not limit itself to Bitcoin mining. It is making investments in artificial intelligence and high-performance computer infrastructure in locations such as Canada, Ethiopia, Norway, and the United States. This implies that Bitdeer is attempting to establish a presence in the Bitcoin and high-performance computing sectors of the artificial intelligence industry. What makes MARA different MARA Holdings is an older company that mines Bitcoin. It utilizes machines from another company, Bitmain , and operates numerous large data centers for its mining operations. In contrast to Bitdeer, MARA typically attempts to retain the Bitcoin it mines, rather than selling it. It implies that MARA has amassed one of the largest treasuries of Bitcoin among publicly traded mining companies over the years. Moreover, MARA has access to 18 data centers primarily using Bitmain’s Antminer ASIC mining chips. While MARA is also diversifying into AI operations, the company primarily aims to hold its mined bitcoin, helping to bolster the second-largest BTC treasury among public companies. MARA holds over 55,000 BTC, compared to Strategy’s 687,000 BTC and Bitdeer’s 2,000. Bitdeer was founded in 2020 by Jihan Wu, who co-founded Bitmain and created Bitdeer after splitting from Micree Zhan. Its AI projects disappointed investors in the third quarter of 2025, with a disappointing financial return despite a 173.6% growth in revenue compared to the previous year. On the stock market, Bitdeer (BTDR) is up more than 4% to $12.78, and MARA was up over 2%, at $10.93, according to The Block. Get seen where it counts.

Data from major exchanges reveals a pronounced short squeeze, where traders betting on price declines faced significant losses as the market moved against them. This event underscores the critical risks and mechanics of perpetual futures contracts, which have become a dominant force in crypto market structure. Consequently, understanding these liquidations provides vital insight into current market sentiment and leverage levels. Crypto Futures Liquidations: A $540 Million Market Reset The past 24 hours witnessed substantial crypto futures liquidations, totaling an estimated $540.9 million across the three largest assets by derivatives volume. A liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This mechanism protects the exchange from further loss. Notably, the data shows an overwhelming bias toward short liquidations, indicating a rapid price increase caught many traders off guard. Market analysts often view such concentrated liquidations as a catalyst for further price movement. Forced buying to cover short positions can create upward pressure, potentially fueling a feedback loop. The scale of this event suggests highly leveraged conditions were prevalent across the market. Below is a breakdown of the key liquidation data that sparked significant discussion among traders and analysts globally. Asset Total Liquidated Short Liquidations Long Liquidations Bitcoin (BTC) $294 million 92.06% 7.94% Ethereum (ETH) $214 million 89.11% 10.89% Solana (SOL) $32.9 million 93.45% 6.55% Mechanics of a Short Squeeze in Crypto Markets A short squeeze describes a rapid price increase that forces traders who borrowed and sold an asset to buy it back at a higher price to limit their losses. This covering activity adds more buy-side pressure. In crypto futures markets, this process is automated through liquidation engines. When the price rises against a short position, the trader’s equity decreases. If it falls below the maintenance margin requirement, the exchange’s system intervenes. The system then executes a market order to buy back the asset, closing the position. A cascade of these orders can lead to volatile, explosive price spikes. The recent data, with short ratios exceeding 89% for all three major assets, clearly signals a market-wide short squeeze event. Several factors can precipitate such an event, including: Positive Macro News: Unexpected regulatory clarity or institutional adoption news. Technical Breakouts: Prices moving above key resistance levels, triggering algorithmic buying. Overleveraged Shorts: Excessive borrowing by traders confident in a price drop. Historical Context and Market Impact Similar liquidation events have historically marked local price bottoms or accelerated strong trends. For instance, the bull market of late 2020 and early 2021 saw repeated billion-dollar liquidation days that often preceded continued upward movement. However, large long liquidations typically characterize market tops and crashes. The asymmetry in this event—predominantly shorts—suggests a forceful rejection of downward price action. The immediate impact includes a rapid reduction in open interest, representing the total number of outstanding derivative contracts. This reduction effectively “resets” leverage in the system, potentially creating a healthier foundation for the next price move. Furthermore, the event serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with high leverage, which can amplify gains but also lead to total capital loss very quickly. Analyzing the Asset-Specific Liquidation Data Bitcoin’s $294 million liquidation volume, the largest of the three, reflects its status as the primary market for crypto derivatives. The 92.06% short ratio indicates nearly all forced closures were bearish bets. This often happens when BTC breaches a critical psychological price level, triggering stop-losses and liquidation cascades. Ethereum’s $214 million in liquidations followed a similar pattern, closely tied to its correlation with Bitcoin and developments within its ecosystem. Solana’s data is particularly striking due to its 93.45% short ratio, the highest among the trio. Although the absolute dollar value is smaller, the ratio suggests an even more concentrated and aggressive bet against SOL’s price that was decisively wrong. This can occur with assets perceived as higher beta, where traders use larger leverage for amplified returns, increasing liquidation risk. The event likely cleared out significant speculative froth from the SOL futures market. Expert Perspective on Risk Management Derivatives analysts emphasize that such events highlight the non-custodial risk traders assume. Unlike spot trading, futures involve leverage, borrowed funds, and strict margin rules. Experts from major trading firms consistently advise using conservative leverage, setting stop-loss orders manually away from key technical levels, and never risking more capital than one can afford to lose. The 24-hour crypto futures liquidations event acts as a real-time case study in these principles. Data from funding rates—the periodic payments between long and short position holders—can also provide early warning signs. Persistently negative funding rates often indicate a crowded short trade, setting the stage for a squeeze if prices rise. Monitoring these metrics, alongside open interest and liquidation heatmaps, forms a core part of professional risk assessment in crypto derivatives trading. Conclusion The recent 24-hour crypto futures liquidations, totaling over $540 million, demonstrate the powerful and often unforgiving dynamics of leveraged digital asset markets. The extreme skew toward short liquidations confirms a significant short squeeze across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana markets. These events serve as critical market structure resets, flushing out excessive leverage and realigning positions with current price action. For traders and observers, understanding the causes and effects of such crypto futures liquidations is essential for navigating the high-volatility landscape of cryptocurrency derivatives. Ultimately, they underscore the paramount importance of disciplined risk management. FAQs Q1: What causes a crypto futures liquidation? A liquidation is triggered automatically by an exchange when a leveraged position loses enough value that the trader’s margin (collateral) falls below the required maintenance level. This forces the position to close to prevent further loss. Q2: Why were most of the recent liquidations short positions? The data shows over 89% were short liquidations, meaning the price of BTC, ETH, and SOL rose quickly. Traders who had borrowed and sold these assets, betting on a price drop, were forced to buy them back at higher prices as their positions were liquidated. Q3: What is a “short squeeze”? A short squeeze is a rapid price increase that forces traders with short positions to buy back the asset to cover their bets, limiting losses. This wave of buying can push prices even higher, creating a feedback loop that exacerbates the move. Q4: How can traders avoid being liquidated? Traders can manage this risk by using lower leverage, depositing additional margin to maintain their position, setting manual stop-loss orders, and avoiding over-concentration in a single, highly leveraged trade. Q5: Do large liquidation events like this predict future price direction? Not definitively. While a massive short squeeze can indicate strong buying pressure and lead to further gains, it can also simply represent a one-time clearing of overleveraged positions. It is one data point among many, including volume, spot market flows, and broader macroeconomic factors.

Russian Crypto Regulation Enters Critical Legislative Phase Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma’s Committee on Financial Markets, confirmed the preparation of a draft bill that would permit retail cryptocurrency investment. According to statements reported by the Russian state news agency TASS, this legislation will receive priority treatment during the spring regular session. Consequently, this development represents a significant policy shift for a nation that has historically maintained a cautious stance toward decentralized digital assets. The Russian government has devoted substantial resources to developing comprehensive digital financial asset frameworks. Moreover, this legislative push aligns with broader global trends toward cryptocurrency integration within traditional financial systems. Bloomberg previously reported Russia’s movement toward allowing retail crypto investment, indicating consistent policy evolution over recent years. Historical Context of Russian Cryptocurrency Policy Russia’s journey toward cryptocurrency regulation has followed a complex path since Bitcoin’s emergence in 2009. Initially, Russian authorities expressed skepticism about decentralized digital currencies. However, the government gradually recognized blockchain technology’s potential benefits. In 2020, Russia passed its first major digital financial assets law, creating a foundational regulatory framework. The following timeline illustrates key developments: Year Regulatory Development Impact 2014 Central Bank warns against cryptocurrency use Initial caution toward digital assets 2020 Digital Financial Assets Law enacted Legal recognition of cryptocurrencies 2022 Ministry of Finance proposes regulatory framework Path toward comprehensive regulation 2024 Experimental crypto payment programs launched Practical testing of digital asset systems 2025 Retail investment bill prepared for discussion Potential mainstream adoption pathway This regulatory evolution demonstrates Russia’s methodical approach to digital asset integration. Furthermore, international sanctions and economic considerations have influenced policy decisions significantly. The current legislative initiative reflects careful balancing between innovation promotion and risk management. Expert Analysis of Regulatory Implications Financial regulation experts note several critical aspects of Russia’s proposed legislation. First, the bill would establish clear guidelines for non-professional investor participation. Second, it would likely include consumer protection mechanisms. Third, the legislation must address anti-money laundering concerns effectively. International observers highlight these key considerations: Investor protection frameworks – Required safeguards for retail participants Exchange regulation standards – Oversight mechanisms for trading platforms Taxation protocols – Clear reporting requirements for cryptocurrency transactions Cross-border transaction rules – Guidelines for international digital asset transfers Technical infrastructure requirements – Security standards for custody solutions These regulatory components will determine the legislation’s practical effectiveness. Additionally, they will influence how quickly Russian citizens adopt cryptocurrency investment opportunities. Global Context and Comparative Regulation Russia’s legislative development occurs within a broader international regulatory landscape. Many nations have established cryptocurrency frameworks with varying approaches to retail investor participation. For instance, the European Union implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations in 2024. Similarly, the United States continues developing comprehensive digital asset legislation through multiple regulatory agencies. Comparative analysis reveals several regulatory models: Permissive frameworks – Countries like Switzerland and Singapore Cautious approaches – Nations including India and China Hybrid systems – Jurisdictions such as Japan and South Korea Russia appears positioned to develop a distinctive regulatory model. This model will likely incorporate elements from various international approaches while addressing specific national economic considerations. Economic Impacts and Market Implications The proposed legislation carries significant economic implications for Russia. First, it could stimulate technological innovation within the financial sector. Second, it might attract cryptocurrency-related businesses to establish Russian operations. Third, it could provide citizens with alternative investment vehicles during economic uncertainty. Market analysts identify several potential outcomes: Increased cryptocurrency trading volume through Russian platforms Development of domestic blockchain infrastructure projects Growth in cryptocurrency education and advisory services Enhanced integration between traditional and digital finance Potential ruble-to-cryptocurrency liquidity improvements These developments could position Russia as a significant participant in global digital asset markets. However, successful implementation requires careful regulatory design and enforcement mechanisms. Technical Implementation Challenges Practical implementation of retail cryptocurrency investment presents several technical challenges. Russian authorities must develop robust systems for several critical functions. These include transaction monitoring, investor verification, and platform oversight. Additionally, cybersecurity considerations require particular attention given cryptocurrency’s digital nature. Key implementation areas include: Digital identity verification systems for investor protection Real-time transaction monitoring for regulatory compliance Secure custody solutions for asset protection Interoperability with existing financial infrastructure Dispute resolution mechanisms for investor concerns Russian technology companies have demonstrated capability in blockchain development. Consequently, they may contribute significantly to implementation solutions. International technology partnerships could also facilitate effective system deployment. Conclusion Russia’s proposed retail crypto investment legislation represents a pivotal moment in global cryptocurrency regulation. The spring parliamentary discussion will determine whether non-professional investors gain legal access to digital assets. This Russian crypto regulation development reflects broader trends toward financial digitization worldwide. Successful implementation could establish Russia as a significant digital asset jurisdiction. However, careful legislative design remains essential for balancing innovation with investor protection. The international community will monitor these developments closely as they unfold throughout 2025. FAQs Q1: What does the Russian cryptocurrency bill specifically propose? The legislation would allow non-professional individual investors to legally purchase, hold, and trade cryptocurrencies through regulated platforms, marking a significant shift from previous restrictive policies. Q2: When will the Russian parliament discuss this cryptocurrency legislation? According to Chairman Anatoly Aksakov, the State Duma will treat the bill as key legislation during the spring regular session, with discussions expected in the coming months. Q3: How does Russia’s approach compare to other countries’ cryptocurrency regulations? Russia appears to be developing a distinctive regulatory model that may incorporate elements from various international approaches while addressing specific national economic and geopolitical considerations.

Buyers drove Bitcoin through the $94,000 to $95,000 zone that had capped it for weeks, and traders pointed to rising open interest and negative funding that can pressure short sellers during a fast push higher. Japan Stocks Stay Firm On Yen Slump As Wall Street Stumbles Japan’s equities stayed in rally mode. The Nikkei 225 advanced 0.9%, and the yen weakened to its softest level since July 2024, adding momentum to exporters and keeping regional risk appetite supported. In the background, traders headed into Wednesday watching for a possible US Supreme Court ruling tied to President Donald Trump’s global tariffs announced in April, a decision that could reshape how markets price trade friction and growth risk. Overnight in the US, stocks fell as financials led declines after JPMorgan warned that Trump’s proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates would hurt the economy and squeeze profitability across the sector.

Court documents filed Tuesday show Tesla will participate in private mediation with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The two parties expect to choose a mediator soon, with talks scheduled for March or April. Should mediation fail to produce an agreement, lawyers said they’ll submit a proposal to the court by June 17, 2026, outlining how to proceed with the lawsuit. The federal agency filed suit against Tesla in 2023, claiming Black workers at the Fremont factory experienced ongoing racial harassment. The complaint also alleges company leaders retaliated against employees who raised concerns about the treatment. This isn’t the first attempt at resolution Tesla and the commission already went through mandatory mediation back in June 2023, but those talks didn’t work out. Neither Tesla nor the employment commission provided comment when contacted. The case number is US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Tesla, 3:23-cv-04984, filed in federal court in Northern California. When the commission first brought the lawsuit, it accused the Austin-based automaker of creating a hostile environment for racial minorities at the California plant. Black workers faced severe and persistent racial harassment, according to the complaint. Company officials then punished workers who complained about what was happening. Tesla disclosed it was under federal investigation in an April 2022 filing with regulators. That probe came before California’s civil rights agency filed its own separate lawsuit accusing Tesla of turning a blind eye to rampant racism against Black workers at Fremont and other facilities statewide. Allegations Going Back to 2015 According to the federal suit, problems at the Fremont plant go back to at least 2015. Non-Black workers regularly used racial slurs and made monkey noises, the commission claimed. Managers sometimes addressed Black employees—both individually and as a group—using the N-word. Workers encountered racist graffiti around the workplace, including nooses and swastikas drawn on desks, in elevators, and even on vehicles moving down the production line. The commission wants the court to prohibit Tesla from subjecting Black workers to racism and retaliation or maintaining a hostile workplace. It’s seeking financial compensation for workers’ emotional distress and lost wages, either through back pay or reinstatement. The federal case was filed in Oakland, California. California’s civil rights agency has made similar claims, saying Tesla ignored years of employee complaints about racial slurs at the plant where the company builds its Model S, X, 3, and Y cars .

The draft legislation, formally known as the Digital Asset Market Structure Discussion Draft, represents one of the most significant regulatory developments in cryptocurrency history. This potential expansion of Treasury Department authority arrives amid growing global debates about financial privacy, national security, and technological innovation. Understanding the US Crypto Bill’s Surveillance Provisions The Senate Banking Committee’s draft legislation contains several provisions that concern privacy advocates and industry experts. Specifically, the bill could grant the U.S. Treasury Department unprecedented authority over digital asset transactions. Galaxy Research’s analysis highlights three particularly significant powers that could emerge from this legislation. First, the Treasury could suspend digital asset transactions without obtaining a court order. Second, the department’s special measure powers would expand specifically for digital assets. Third, the legislation would establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for decentralized finance platforms. These provisions represent a substantial shift from traditional financial surveillance approaches. Historically, government agencies required judicial oversight for similar actions in conventional banking systems. The proposed framework for the US crypto bill appears to streamline this process significantly. Financial technology experts note that this approach mirrors emergency powers typically reserved for national security situations. However, the legislation applies these measures to routine financial transactions within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Historical Context and Regulatory Evolution Current cryptocurrency regulation in the United States operates under a patchwork of existing financial laws. The Bank Secrecy Act, initially passed in 1970, forms the foundation for most financial surveillance. This legislation requires financial institutions to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering. Subsequently, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 expanded these surveillance capabilities following the September 11 attacks. These laws established the framework for financial institutions monitoring and reporting suspicious activities. The proposed US crypto bill represents a natural extension of these existing powers into the digital asset space. However, cryptocurrency presents unique challenges for traditional surveillance methods. Decentralized networks, pseudonymous transactions, and cross-border operations complicate conventional monitoring approaches. Government agencies have consistently argued that updated authorities are necessary to address these technological realities. Privacy advocates counter that expanding surveillance without corresponding privacy protections creates dangerous precedents. Comparative Analysis: Traditional vs. Digital Asset Surveillance Surveillance Aspect Traditional Finance Proposed Crypto Framework Transaction Suspension Requires court order in most cases Possible without court order Special Measures Limited to specific jurisdictions Expanded to all digital assets Platform Regulation Centralized institutions only Includes DeFi protocols Privacy Protections Established legal precedents Unclear or undefined Potential Impacts on Privacy and Innovation Galaxy Research’s analysis raises significant concerns about potential privacy violations stemming from the US crypto bill. The research firm emphasizes that expanded surveillance powers could fundamentally alter the relationship between citizens and financial privacy. Digital assets originally promised greater financial autonomy and reduced intermediary control. These proposed regulations might substantially diminish those core benefits. Furthermore, the legislation could establish precedents affecting broader digital privacy rights beyond cryptocurrency. The analysis also highlights potential impacts on industry growth and innovation. Cryptocurrency development in the United States already faces regulatory uncertainty. Additional surveillance requirements could: Increase compliance costs for startups and established companies Drive innovation overseas to more favorable jurisdictions Stifle DeFi development through restrictive requirements Reduce competitive advantage in global financial technology Industry leaders have expressed concerns about these potential consequences. They argue that balanced regulation should protect consumers while fostering innovation. The current draft legislation appears weighted heavily toward surveillance capabilities without corresponding innovation protections. This imbalance could have long-term consequences for American technological leadership in blockchain development. Expert Perspectives and Industry Response Financial regulation experts have offered varied perspectives on the proposed US crypto bill. Former regulatory officials acknowledge the legitimate national security concerns driving these provisions. They note that cryptocurrency has been exploited for illicit activities requiring government response. However, these same experts caution against overly broad authorities that lack sufficient oversight. They emphasize the importance of judicial review and transparency in surveillance programs. Cryptocurrency industry representatives have responded with measured concern. Major industry associations have called for balanced approaches that address security needs while preserving innovation. They highlight several alternative approaches that could achieve similar security objectives. These include enhanced transaction monitoring requirements, improved information sharing between exchanges, and international cooperation frameworks. Industry leaders stress that effective regulation requires industry consultation and technical expertise. Global Regulatory Context and Implications The United States is not alone in considering expanded cryptocurrency surveillance. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation includes similar monitoring provisions. However, MiCA incorporates stronger privacy protections and more defined oversight mechanisms. Asian jurisdictions have taken varied approaches, with Singapore implementing balanced frameworks while China has banned most cryptocurrency activities entirely. This global regulatory landscape creates competitive pressures that could influence American policy decisions. International standards bodies have also addressed cryptocurrency surveillance. The Financial Action Task Force has issued guidance for virtual asset service providers. These international standards emphasize risk-based approaches rather than blanket surveillance. The proposed US crypto bill appears to exceed FATF recommendations in several areas. This divergence could create compliance challenges for international cryptocurrency businesses operating across multiple jurisdictions. Technical Implementation Challenges Implementing the surveillance provisions in the US crypto bill presents significant technical challenges. Decentralized finance protocols operate without central authorities that can execute transaction suspensions. Blockchain networks are designed specifically to resist centralized control. Treasury Department officials would need to develop novel technical approaches to enforce these provisions effectively. Potential implementation methods could include: Node-level filtering at network entry points Exchange compliance requirements for transaction blocking Smart contract modifications to include surveillance capabilities Protocol-level changes through governance mechanisms Each approach presents technical and philosophical challenges. Node-level filtering could be circumvented through alternative network access points. Exchange requirements only affect centralized platforms, not peer-to-peer transactions. Smart contract modifications require protocol governance approval that might not be forthcoming. These implementation difficulties highlight the tension between traditional regulatory approaches and decentralized technologies. Legislative Process and Potential Amendments The US crypto bill remains in early discussion stages within the Senate Banking Committee. Legislative experts anticipate significant revisions before potential committee approval. The bill must navigate several procedural steps before becoming law. These include committee markups, potential amendments, floor debates, and reconciliation with House versions. This process typically involves substantial negotiation and compromise between different stakeholders. Privacy advocates and industry representatives have already proposed several amendments to address surveillance concerns. These proposed changes include: Judicial oversight requirements for transaction suspensions Sunset provisions that require periodic reauthorization Transparency reporting on surveillance activities Technical advisory committees to inform implementation The final legislation will likely reflect compromises between security concerns and privacy protections. However, the current draft establishes a starting position that favors expanded surveillance authorities. This positioning could influence the negotiation dynamics throughout the legislative process. Conclusion The proposed US crypto bill represents a pivotal moment for digital asset regulation and financial privacy. Galaxy Research’s analysis highlights legitimate concerns about expanded government surveillance powers without corresponding oversight mechanisms. The legislation’s potential impacts extend beyond immediate transaction monitoring to broader implications for innovation, privacy rights, and technological development. As the Senate Banking Committee continues its deliberations, stakeholders across the cryptocurrency ecosystem will closely monitor developments. The final legislation will establish precedents affecting digital finance for years to come, making balanced approaches essential for protecting both security interests and fundamental freedoms in the evolving financial landscape. FAQs Q1: What specific powers would the US crypto bill grant to the Treasury Department? The legislation could authorize three significant powers: suspending digital asset transactions without court orders, expanding special measure authorities specifically for cryptocurrencies, and establishing regulatory frameworks for decentralized finance platforms that previously operated outside traditional oversight structures. Q2: How does this proposed legislation differ from existing financial surveillance laws? Traditional financial surveillance typically requires judicial oversight for transaction suspensions and focuses on centralized institutions. The proposed framework extends similar authorities to decentralized networks and digital assets while potentially reducing oversight requirements, creating a substantially different regulatory approach. Q3: What are the main privacy concerns associated with this US crypto bill? Privacy advocates worry about reduced judicial oversight, potential overreach in transaction monitoring, establishment of precedents affecting broader digital privacy rights, and insufficient protections against government surveillance exceeding legitimate security needs in the cryptocurrency space. Q4: How might this legislation impact cryptocurrency innovation in the United States? The bill could increase compliance costs, drive development to more favorable jurisdictions, restrict DeFi experimentation through regulatory burdens, and reduce America’s competitive position in global financial technology innovation if implemented without balanced considerations. Q5: What happens next in the legislative process for this US crypto bill? The Senate Banking Committee will continue discussions, potentially amend provisions, hold markups, and possibly advance the legislation to the full Senate. Parallel processes may occur in House committees, with final legislation requiring reconciliation between different versions before potential presidential approval.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $2.92 by the end of 2029. By 2032, WIF’s price may surge to $4.80. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.4206 Market cap $420.29M Trading volume $226.13M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.4326 24-hour low $0.3680 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.30% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.3628 14-Day RSI 61.20 (Neutral) Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.6674 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown The daily trend has flipped bullish above $0.38. The 4-hour breakout confirms strong buyer control. A move above $0.45 would open up fast upside continuation. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart On the daily chart for January 14, WIF is trading around $0.421, holding firmly above the Bollinger mid-band near $0.356, which confirms a structural shift to the upside. The impulsive move from the $0.32–$0.34 base marked a clear trend change, and the recent pullback was shallow and corrective rather than aggressive selling. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The price is now consolidating just below the upper band, near $0.454, suggesting strength rather than exhaustion. The MACD remains positive and rising, signaling sustained bullish momentum. As long as WIF holds above $0.38, the daily structure stays bullish, with upside continuation favored toward $0.45–$0.48. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, WIF has cleanly broken above the Alligator cluster around $0.39, thereby firmly flipping the short-term trend bullish. The expansion candle into $0.42 shows decisive buyer dominance, not a slow grind. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview The MACD has firmly crossed into positive territory, and the OBV is rising sharply, confirming real volume-backed accumulation. Minor consolidation near $0.42 appears constructive, rather than distributive. As long as the price holds above $0.40, dips are likely to be bought rather than sold. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4006 BUY SMA 5 $0.3679 BUY SMA 10 $0.3725 BUY SMA 21 $0.3450 BUY SMA 50 $0.3628 BUY SMA 100 $0.4359 SELL SMA 200 $0.6674 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3958 BUY EMA 5 $0.3853 BUY EMA 10 $0.3631 BUY EMA 21 $0.3517 BUY EMA 50 $0.3788 BUY EMA 100 $0.4646 SELL EMA 200 $0.6224 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF is transitioning from recovery into continuation mode. Holding between $0.38 and $0.40 maintains the bullish trend, while a clean break above $0.45 would likely accelerate the upside expansion. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $100 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of approximately $2 by the end of 2026 and between $5 and $7 by 2032. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

As individuals await the UK’s official economic data on Thursday, January 15, analysts shared their predictions, noting a high likelihood of Britain achieving a slight growth of about 0.1% in November. On the other hand, card spending and business confidence, which are widely recognized as key economic indicators that provide real-time information, suggested that December demonstrated sluggish economic growth, which may be a sign of a similar situation this year. Analysts spark hope that the UK economy might soon pick up the pace Following the current economic situation in the UK, analysts have pointed out that stagnant economic growth in the country could be improved if the labor market becomes stronger and cautious consumers begin to ease their spending restraints. Following this assertion, the analysts emphasized that the country’s future economic growth largely depends on the state of the labor market. Some of the challenges that have been identified as factors behind the sluggish economic growth in the UK include heightened concerns among individuals regarding potential tax hikes in the months leading up to the budget and Jaguar Land Rover’s 2025 cyberattack. Concerning this cyberattack, reports highlighted that this incident prompted the automotive company to halt its production globally for a period of five weeks. Consequently, the firm’s supply chain was disrupted, and significant financial losses were incurred, marking the most significant hack incident in the nation’s history. Additionally, recently released data indicate that since Reeves made public an extra £26 billion or $34.9 billion in tax revenue while delivering her budget speech on November 26, household spending and the job market have deteriorated sharply. Barclays Plc issued a report highlighting that card spending declined by 1.7% this year compared to December last year. In reference to February 2021, when the UK was under a national lockdown, this scenario illustrated a much more significant decline. The report also noted that a significant proportion of consumers had adopted the idea of reducing expenditure on non-essential goods and services, particularly on clothing and dining out. As a result, several retailers presented underwhelming sales results during the Christmas season. Analysts commented on this matter. They pointed out that the low consumer situation could further deteriorate if individuals begin to express significant concerns about job security. They made this statement after discovering that several firms had begun to publicly announce their intentions to lay off their workforce shortly after Reeves’s budget announcement. However, in the holiday season, this trend declined. Job reduction in companies raises economic concerns Following the layoff announcement, data from the government showed that businesses made clear their intentions to reduce approximately 33,392 jobs in the four weeks leading up to December 14. This figure represented the most significant job cuts since early 2023. Reeves’s budget announcement had also weakened Business confidence . To support this claim, reports mentioned that a business confidence index for the fourth quarter, as reported by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, declined to its all-time low in three years. Furthermore, the key PMIs indicated a slight improvement in the economy as of December 2025. This situation was noted just after an initial forecast was reduced. Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at Berenberg, stated that, “Right now, it looks soft because we’re seeing weakness in the job market affecting spending.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

This strategic decision, reported by Bloomberg, signals a pivotal moment for the continent’s digital asset industry. Consequently, the company aims for a valuation between $4.6 billion and $5.8 billion. Moreover, financial giants Goldman Sachs and Citigroup will lead this high-profile offering, underscoring its importance in the global market. The Strategic Path to the Bitpanda IPO Bitpanda’s journey to a public listing represents a calculated evolution. Founded in 2014 by Eric Demuth, Paul Klanschek, and Christian Trummer, the platform began as a simple broker for Bitcoin. However, it has since transformed into a comprehensive fintech hub. Today, it offers trading in cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, and precious metals to over 4 million users across Europe. Therefore, this IPO is not an isolated event but the culmination of a decade of growth and regulatory navigation within the European Union’s financial framework. The choice of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, operated by Deutsche Börse, is highly strategic. Frankfurt is a central hub for European finance and boasts a robust regulatory environment. Specifically, Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) has established clear guidelines for crypto custody and trading. This regulatory clarity provides a stable foundation for a public listing. Furthermore, a successful IPO on this exchange would position Bitpanda as a bellwether for other European fintech firms considering similar paths. Market Context and Valuation Analysis The targeted valuation of $4.6 to $5.8 billion places Bitpanda among Europe’s most valuable private fintech companies. This valuation reflects several key factors. First, the company has demonstrated consistent user growth and geographic expansion. Second, it has diversified its revenue streams beyond simple crypto trading commissions. Finally, the involvement of top-tier investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup validates the company’s financial health and prospects. Their role typically involves underwriting the share issuance and ensuring market confidence. To understand this valuation, a comparison with recent market activity is useful. The following table outlines key metrics from comparable fintech and crypto entities: Company Sector Key Listing Detail Notable Context Coinbase (COIN) Crypto Exchange Direct Listing on NASDAQ (2021) Valued at ~$86 billion at debut; first major crypto exchange to go public in the U.S. Kraken Crypto Exchange Rumored IPO (Delayed) Has explored public listing but faced regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. Adyen (ADYEN.AS) European Fintech/Payments IPO on Euronext Amsterdam (2018) Successful European fintech listing, now a blue-chip stock. Bitpanda’s move differs significantly from Coinbase’s direct listing. An IPO, especially on a traditional exchange like Frankfurt, often signals a desire to attract long-term, institutional investors. This approach can provide greater stability and capital for future expansion. Additionally, the European market presents a different regulatory and competitive landscape than the United States, potentially offering a smoother path to listing. Expert Insights on Regulatory and Market Impact Financial analysts view this IPO as a critical test for the maturation of the European crypto sector. “A successful Bitpanda listing would be a powerful signal,” notes a fintech analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence. “It demonstrates that a crypto-native business can meet the stringent reporting, governance, and transparency requirements of a major traditional stock exchange.” This process inherently builds trust with a broader investor base. The regulatory implications are profound. By subjecting itself to the scrutiny of Deutsche Börse and BaFin, Bitpanda is effectively advocating for a model of compliance and integration. This could pressure other exchanges to elevate their standards. Moreover, it provides European regulators with a high-profile case study for overseeing a publicly traded crypto business. The outcome will likely influence policy discussions around the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation implementation across the EU. Potential Ripple Effects and Industry Implications The success or challenges of the Bitpanda IPO will have immediate consequences. For the industry, a strong debut could unlock significant venture capital and private equity interest in other European crypto ventures. Conversely, it could also accelerate consolidation as smaller players seek partnerships to achieve similar scale. For consumers, a publicly listed exchange may offer perceived increases in security and operational transparency due to quarterly financial disclosures. Key potential impacts include: Investor Access: Provides a regulated, traditional equity avenue for investors to gain exposure to the crypto economy. Legitimization: Further bridges the gap between conventional finance and the digital asset world. Competitive Dynamics: May force rivals like Binance, Crypto.com, and local European players to reconsider their own capital and corporate structure strategies. However, the path is not without risk. The company will face intense scrutiny of its financials, its handling of past market volatility, and its security protocols. Market sentiment toward crypto assets at the time of listing will also play a crucial role in determining initial demand for its shares. Therefore, the first-half 2025 timeline suggests confidence in both the company’s readiness and a favorable market window. Conclusion The planned Bitpanda IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is a watershed event for European cryptocurrency. It represents a bold step toward mainstream financial integration for the digital asset sector. With a targeted valuation of up to $5.8 billion and the backing of Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, this move underscores the growing institutional acceptance of compliant crypto businesses. Ultimately, the success of this Bitpanda IPO will be closely watched as a benchmark for the industry’s viability within the framework of traditional public markets. FAQs Q1: What is Bitpanda and why is its IPO significant? Bitpanda is a major European fintech platform based in Austria that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies, stocks, and other assets. Its IPO is significant because it would be one of the first major crypto-focused exchanges to list on a premier European traditional stock exchange, signaling maturation and regulatory acceptance for the industry. Q2: When and where is the Bitpanda IPO expected to happen? According to reports, Bitpanda is targeting an initial public offering in the first half of 2025. The chosen venue is the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Deutsche Börse) in Germany. Q3: What valuation is Bitpanda seeking? The company is aiming for a valuation in the range of $4.6 billion to $5.8 billion at the time of its public listing. Q4: Which banks are leading the Bitpanda IPO? Global investment banking leaders Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are set to lead and underwrite the offering. Q5: How does this compare to Coinbase’s public listing? Coinbase conducted a direct listing on the NASDAQ in the United States in 2021. Bitpanda is pursuing a traditional IPO on a European exchange, which involves issuing new shares to raise capital and often involves different regulatory requirements and investor expectations.

The move includes stakes in big names like Nintendo Co. and Bandai Namco Holdings Inc. The transfer will boost Savvy’s position in the gaming world. After the shares change hands, Savvy will own roughly 10% of several companies including Koei Tecmo Holdings Inc., NCSoft Corp., Nexon Co., and Square Enix Holdings Co. Bloomberg news reviewed company documents showing these holdings. Savvy Games Group was set up in 2021. The goal was helping Saudi Arabia put money into things besides oil. With $38 billion available to spend, Savvy purchased Scopely Inc., the developer behind Monopoly Go. They also invested in Niantic, which created Pokemon Go, and bought into several esports organizations. Monopoly Go turned out to be a hit. The esports investments haven’t gone as well – there have been staff cuts at the company. The fund is the largest investor in Electronic Arts Inc.’s $55 billion buyout, but Savvy won’t be involved in that transaction, according to someone who knows about the deal. The government fun d al ready transferred its 11 million shares of Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. last month, that showed up in a late December regulatory filing. Savvy will keep using the PIF’s hands-off approach. They don’t plan to actively manage these investments, the person said. div]:bg-bg-000/50 [&_pre>div]:border-0.5 [&_pre>div]:border-border-400 [&_.ignore-pre-bg>div]:bg-transparent [&_.standard-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pl-2 [&_.standard-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,ul,ol,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pr-8 [&_.progressive-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pl-2 [&_.progressive-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,ul,ol,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pr-8""> _*]:min-w-0 standard-markdown""> Transfer long planned, no strategy changes ahead Amar Batkhuu speaks for Savvy. He said they’ve been planning this transfer for a long time. “These transfers will move the stewardship of PIF’s games investments to Savvy, given Savvy is a leading games organization for the PIF and a core component of the National Gaming and Esports Strategy,” he explained. There aren’t any plans to change how they invest, he added. EA shareholders voted yes in December to the $55 billion sale. Investors at the Redwood City, California-based company approved the $210-a-share takeover. EA publishes games like EA SPORTS FC and Battlefield. It’s a big shift for EA after four decades. Saudi Arabia’s PIF is making large investments in gaming to reduc e de pendence on oil money. Going private means EA developers can focus on making games without worrying about quarterly earnings expectations from public investors. _*]:min-w-0""> Nintendo stock tumbles despite Switch 2 success Nintendo’s stock price in Japan has fallen hard in the last five months. It’s down about 33 percent from the peak, even though hardware sales look good. Shares hit 14,795 yen in August 2025 and closed at 9,950 yen today. Several things appear to be bothering investors. Possible price increases down the road, fewer big first-party game releases, and holiday season discounts in Western markets have all weighed on the stock. The drop suggest s co nfidence has weakened, despite Nintendo still posting strong numbers for its newest console. The Nintendo Switch 2 came out on June 5, 2025. It sold 10.36 million units in the first four months – the fastest-selling console Nintendo has ever launched. That beat the original Switch timeline by five months. Holiday sales in the West were uneven, down around 35 percent compared to when the first Switch launched. Sales in Japan have stayed exceptionally strong though. Don’t just read crypto news.

The on-chain metric of interest here is the “ Spent Output Age Bands ,” which tracks how many tokens that the various coin age groups or “age bands” are moving on the network. In the context of the current topic, the age band of interest is the one containing coins that have been dormant for between three and five years. Here is the chart for the Bitcoin Spent Output Age Bands shared by Maartunn that shows the data specifically for this cohort: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Spent Output Age Bands have captured two large transactions from the 3 to 5 years age band during the past couple of days. The first of these involved 539 BTC, while the second moved 1,566 BTC. The 3 to 5 years age band corresponds to coins that were purchased between January 2021 and January 2023, essentially covering the cycle spanning over the 2021 bull market and 2022 bear market. Thus, the tokens that have just been moved were held by investors who had been sitting silent since buying in the previous cycle. “Dormant supply waking up is often a signal—either smart money rotating or early holders exiting,” explained the analyst. It now remains to be seen whether these transactions were a temporary deviation or if long-term holder whales will make more such moves in the near future. In some other news, CryptoQuant has shared its 2025 review of digital asset exchange activity. One interesting finding is that stablecoins are heavily concentrated on Binance , with the exchange holding a combined $47.6 billion in USDT and USDC reserves. This is equivalent to 72% of the stablecoin holdings across the ten largest exchanges. Binance also dominated 2025 in spot trading activity, recording close to $7 trillion in volume. Binance’s dominance of trading volume wasn’t quite as stark as that of its stablecoin reserves, however, as it made up for 41% of the total spot volume among the top 10 platforms. The exchange’s share of the futures trading volume was similar, coming out at 42%. Overall spot and futures trading volume in the cryptocurrency sector grew during 2025 compared to the end of 2024, but the yearly growth rate declined.

Volatility has compressed, price has stabilized near key psychological levels, and market participants are increasingly divided on what comes next. Some analysts argue that this prolonged consolidation is laying the groundwork for a renewed upside recovery, while a broader consensus warns that Bitcoin could still face another leg lower before a sustainable trend emerges. Related Reading: XRP Consolidates Above $2 As Volume Z-Score Signals A Quiet Market Adding to this uncertainty, top analyst Darkfost points to an important and potentially concerning on-chain development: the first signs of long-term holder (LTH) capitulation are beginning to surface. The last time Bitcoin traded at similar price levels was in April 2025, roughly nine months ago. Since then, a large portion of market participants accumulated BTC at higher prices and have continued to hold through the recent correction. Today, many of those investors are sitting on unrealized losses. As a reminder, Bitcoin held for more than six months is classified as long-term holder supply, typically associated with higher conviction and lower sensitivity to short-term price moves. When this cohort begins to show signs of stress, it often marks a critical phase in the market cycle. Whether this emerging LTH pressure becomes a brief shakeout or evolves into broader capitulation could play a decisive role in shaping Bitcoin’s next major move. Early Signs of Long-Term Holder Capitulation Emerge What we are currently observing on the Long-Term Holder SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) is a behavior that typically appears during bear market phases. LTH SOPR measures whether coins held for more than six months are being sold at a profit or a loss, offering insight into conviction among the most resilient cohort of Bitcoin investors. In recent days, LTH SOPR briefly dipped below the critical 1.0 level. This signals that some long-term holders—most likely the younger segment of this group—have begun to capitulate by selling at a loss. Historically, such moves reflect rising stress among holders who bought closer to cycle highs and are now facing prolonged drawdowns. For now, however, this behavior remains limited. The 30-day moving average of LTH SOPR still stands at a healthy 1.18, meaning long-term holders have realized an average profit of 18% over the past month. While this confirms that broad-based capitulation has not yet materialized, it is worth noting that this level is well below the annual average near 2.0, indicating a clear slowdown in realized profits. A deeper deterioration would be bearish in the short term, signaling expanding sell pressure. Conversely, declining realized profits may also suggest that traders are gradually exhausting selling pressure. For a bullish continuation to develop, LTH SOPR would need to stabilize and begin trending higher again, confirming renewed confidence among long-term holders. Related Reading: Trump-Powell Conflict Fuels Volatility While Retail Sells Bitcoin At A Loss – Details Bitcoin Price Consolidates Below Key Resistance Bitcoin continues to trade within a well-defined consolidation range after the sharp correction from the October highs. On the weekly chart, price is holding just below the $92,000–$94,000 resistance zone, an area that previously acted as support before the breakdown. This level now represents a key inflection point for market structure. Despite the recent volatility, Bitcoin remains above its rising 200-day moving average, which continues to slope upward near the mid-$80,000 region. This suggests that the broader trend remains constructive, even as short-term momentum has weakened. The 100-day moving average has flattened, reflecting a loss of upside momentum, while the 50-day average is still attempting to stabilize after rolling over during the sell-off. Related Reading: Ethereum Long-Term Cost Basis Holds Firm: Structural Floor Forms Near $2.8K Price action over the past several weeks shows a series of higher lows, indicating that buyers are gradually stepping in and absorbing selling pressure. However, volume has declined during this consolidation, signaling a lack of strong conviction from either side of the market. This behavior is typical of compression phases that often precede larger directional moves. A sustained break and weekly close above $94,000 would signal renewed strength and open the door for a move toward the $100,000–$105,000 range. Conversely, failure to hold above the $86,000–$88,000 support zone would increase downside risk and shift focus toward deeper retracements. For now, Bitcoin remains in balance, building tension for its next decisive move.

Other top gainers were coins like Pepe (PEPE), Optimism (OP), Internet Computer (ICP), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). This article explains why the crypto rally is happening today. Crypto market going up after recent US jobs and inflation data One reason why the crypto market is going up today is that the US has published mixed macro numbers recently. A report released on Friday showed that the economy created just 50,000 jobs , while the unemployment rate improved to 4.4% Another one released on Tuesday revealed that the core consumer inflation softened in December. It moved from 2.7% in November to 2.6% in December, a trend that may continue this year. Donald Trump has made affordability a major issue this year as the US moves to the mid-term elections. He has announced a cap on credit card interest rates, barred institutional investors from buying homes , and asked Fannie Mae to start buying mortgage securities worth over $200 billion. Trump is also urging American oil companies to boost production, a move he hopes will lead to lower gas prices. Therefore, a combination of soft labor market data and lower inflation will push the Fed to start cutting interest rates. CLARITY Act markup and vote The crypto market is going up as investors reflect on the improving regulatory environment in the United States. The Senate has now published the text for the CLARITY Act ahead of the markup event on Thursday. Angry Crypto Show @angrycryptoshow · Follow JUST IN: 🇺🇸 SEC Chairman Paul Atkins on the CLARITY Act, says “we are very bullish on the effects of the bill getting to the President to be signed this year, and I think that’ll be a huge help to the crypto marketplace and investors.” $ADA $NIGHT Watch on Twitter View replies 9:22 PM · Jan 13, 2026 124 Reply Copy link Read 3 replies There are chances that the Senate will ultimately pass the bill, making it the second major legislation after the GENIUS Act. These bills are aimed at making the United States the crypto capital of the world. The SEC is already working on this goal. For example, it has ended various lawsuits that were filed by Gary Gensler’s team. It has also launched a crypto exemption week and approved numerous cryptocurrency ETFs. SCOTUS ruling on Donald Trump’s tariffs The crypto market is going up as investors wait for the upcoming ruling on Donald Trump’s tariffs. This ruling is widely expected to happen later today, with a Kalshi poll showing that the odds that they will vote in favor of these tariffs being at 33.8%. These odds have dropped from over 56% in September last year. SCOTUS ruling odds | Source: Kalshi A decision to end Trump’s tariffs would be a good thing for the crypto market. In theory, it would lead to lower prices as companies boost imports to the country. However, it is worth noting that Trump has some other options to implement the tariffs. Most of these options will only be implemented after a lengthy investigation. Crypto Fear and Greed Index has jumped Meanwhile, data shows that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has rebounded. It has moved from the extreme fear level of 10 in December to the neutral point at 52. Historically, crypto prices do well when the index is in a slow uptrend. They then drop sharply whenever the index moves to the extreme greed zone. Crypto Fear and Greed Index | Source: CMC More data show why the crypto rally is happening.

This sustained inflow pattern represents a notable shift in market sentiment following months of regulatory uncertainty and fluctuating investor interest in blockchain-based financial products. Ethereum ETFs Demonstrate Sustained Institutional Demand According to verified data from TraderT, the January 13 inflows represent a continuation of positive momentum that began the previous day. Remarkably, no individual fund recorded net outflows during this period, indicating broad-based institutional support across multiple financial products. This consistent performance suggests that Ethereum ETFs are establishing themselves as legitimate investment vehicles rather than speculative instruments. The sustained inflows occur against a backdrop of evolving regulatory clarity and improved market infrastructure for digital assets. Financial institutions have increasingly recognized the value proposition of Ethereum-based investment products, particularly as blockchain technology matures and real-world applications expand. Market analysts note that this two-day streak represents the most consistent inflow pattern since the initial launch period of these financial instruments. Leading Funds and Their Performance Metrics BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) emerged as the clear leader, attracting $53.03 million in inflows. This substantial figure represents approximately 41% of the total daily inflows and demonstrates BlackRock’s continued dominance in the digital asset ETF space. The company’s established reputation and extensive distribution network have proven instrumental in attracting institutional capital to cryptocurrency products. Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum Trust followed with $35.42 million in inflows, while Bitwise’s Ethereum Strategy ETF (ETHW) captured $22.96 million. Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) and Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) completed the positive flow picture with $14.38 million and $3.93 million respectively. This distribution across multiple providers indicates diversified institutional interest rather than concentration in a single product. January 13, 2025 Ethereum ETF Inflow Breakdown Fund Provider Fund Name Inflows (Millions) Market Share BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) $53.03 40.9% Grayscale Mini Ethereum Trust $35.42 27.3% Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (ETHW) $22.96 17.7% Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) $14.38 11.1% Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) $3.93 3.0% Market Context and Regulatory Developments The positive inflow trend coincides with several important market developments that have strengthened investor confidence in Ethereum-based products. Regulatory agencies have provided clearer guidance on digital asset classification and custody requirements, reducing uncertainty for institutional investors. Additionally, improvements in Ethereum’s underlying technology, including successful network upgrades and scaling solutions, have addressed previous concerns about transaction costs and network congestion. Market infrastructure has also matured significantly, with established custodians offering secure storage solutions and reputable market makers providing improved liquidity. These developments have collectively reduced the operational risks associated with Ethereum ETF investments, making them more accessible to traditional financial institutions and wealth managers. Comparative Analysis with Bitcoin ETF Performance Analysts frequently compare Ethereum ETF performance with their Bitcoin counterparts to assess relative market sentiment. While Bitcoin ETFs typically attract larger absolute inflows due to their first-mover advantage and greater market capitalization, Ethereum products have demonstrated stronger relative growth in recent months. This pattern suggests that investors are increasingly diversifying their digital asset exposure beyond Bitcoin alone. The Ethereum blockchain’s programmability and smart contract functionality provide fundamentally different value propositions compared to Bitcoin’s digital gold narrative. Consequently, Ethereum ETFs appeal to investors seeking exposure to decentralized finance applications, non-fungible token ecosystems, and enterprise blockchain solutions rather than purely monetary innovation. Institutional Adoption Patterns and Future Projections Institutional adoption of Ethereum ETFs follows identifiable patterns that differ from retail investor behavior. Large financial institutions typically implement phased allocation strategies, beginning with small pilot investments before scaling up exposure as they gain operational experience and regulatory comfort. The sustained inflows observed over two consecutive days suggest that many institutions have progressed beyond initial pilot phases. Several factors influence institutional allocation decisions: Regulatory clarity: Clear guidelines from SEC and other agencies Custody solutions: Established providers with insurance coverage Liquidity profiles: Demonstrated market depth and tight spreads Tax treatment: Favorable structures compared to direct crypto ownership Reporting integration: Compatibility with existing financial systems Market analysts project continued growth in Ethereum ETF assets under management throughout 2025, particularly as additional use cases emerge and regulatory frameworks mature. However, they caution that performance will remain sensitive to broader cryptocurrency market conditions and macroeconomic factors influencing risk asset allocations. Impact on Ethereum Network Fundamentals The growing popularity of Ethereum ETFs has secondary effects on the underlying blockchain network. Increased institutional investment typically correlates with reduced price volatility, making Ethereum more suitable for enterprise applications and decentralized finance protocols. Additionally, ETF providers often engage in staking activities with their ETH holdings, contributing to network security and generating yield for investors. Network analysts monitor several key metrics to assess ETF impact: Staking participation rates among institutional holders Changes in circulating supply available on exchanges Correlations between ETF flows and network transaction volumes Developer activity and protocol upgrade timelines These interconnected factors create feedback loops where ETF success strengthens network fundamentals, which in turn makes Ethereum more attractive to additional institutional investors. This virtuous cycle has become increasingly apparent throughout 2024 and early 2025. Risk Considerations and Market Dynamics Despite the positive inflow trend, Ethereum ETF investors face several notable risks that require careful consideration. Regulatory developments remain a primary concern, as policy changes could affect product structures or availability. Technological risks associated with blockchain networks, including potential security vulnerabilities or consensus mechanism challenges, also warrant monitoring. Market dynamics present additional considerations: Concentration risk: Heavy reliance on few large investors Liquidity mismatch: Potential ETF redemptions exceeding market depth Tracking error: Differences between ETF performance and underlying ETH Fee structures: Management expenses affecting long-term returns Financial advisors typically recommend that Ethereum ETF allocations represent only a portion of overall investment portfolios, with percentages varying based on individual risk tolerance and investment horizons. Diversification across multiple digital assets and traditional investments remains a fundamental principle for managing cryptocurrency exposure. Conclusion The consecutive days of net inflows for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs represent a significant milestone for cryptocurrency investment products and institutional adoption of digital assets. With $129.72 million flowing into these funds on January 13, 2025, following similar positive momentum the previous day, Ethereum ETFs demonstrate growing acceptance among traditional financial institutions. This trend reflects improving regulatory clarity, maturing market infrastructure, and increasing recognition of Ethereum’s unique value proposition beyond simple cryptocurrency exposure. As blockchain technology continues evolving and finding real-world applications, Ethereum ETFs will likely play an increasingly important role in providing regulated access to this innovative asset class for both institutional and individual investors. FAQs Q1: What are spot Ethereum ETFs and how do they differ from futures-based products? Spot Ethereum ETFs directly hold Ethereum tokens as their underlying asset, providing investors with direct exposure to ETH price movements. Futures-based products, in contrast, hold derivative contracts tied to future Ethereum prices, introducing additional complexities including contango and backwardation risks. Q2: Why are consecutive days of inflows significant for Ethereum ETFs? Consecutive inflow days indicate sustained institutional interest rather than isolated trading activity. This pattern suggests that financial institutions are implementing strategic allocation plans rather than making tactical trades, signaling longer-term commitment to Ethereum exposure through regulated products. Q3: How do Ethereum ETF inflows affect the price of Ethereum? ETF inflows create direct buying pressure on the underlying ETH tokens as providers purchase assets to back their shares. This increased demand, particularly from large institutional buyers, can support Ethereum prices and potentially reduce volatility by moving tokens into long-term investment vehicles. Q4: What risks should investors consider with Ethereum ETFs? Key risks include regulatory changes affecting product availability, technological risks associated with blockchain networks, liquidity constraints during market stress, tracking errors between ETF performance and underlying ETH, and management fees that reduce net returns over time. Q5: How do Ethereum ETFs compare to direct cryptocurrency ownership? Ethereum ETFs offer several advantages over direct ownership, including regulated custodianship, simplified tax reporting, integration with traditional brokerage accounts, and elimination of private key management responsibilities.

This disclosure comes amid allegations that the group is engaging in entrenchment and attempting to silence investor voices. Former BNC Director Linked to 10X Capital In its latest statement shared on X, YZi Labs emphasized that transparency is “non-negotiable,” as it highlighted what it described as undisclosed ties between an “independent” director at BNC and 10X Capital. At the center of the claims is Russell Read, who recently stepped down from the board of CEA Industries Inc., the corporate entity associated with BNC. In a December 30 8-K filing, the company described the group from which Read resigned as independent, stating that his departure followed his acceptance of a new role requiring him to step down from external boards. The document also includes a statement from him, in which he praised the entity for its “diligent and independent oversight.” However, YZi Labs pointed to those same SEC disclosures to show that the former executive previously served as Vice Chairman of 10X Capital. According to the venture capital firm, this relationship directly challenges claims of independence and raises concerns about the board’s oversight. Additionally, YZi Labs alleged that the asset manager structured a 20-year agreement that allows it to continue collecting fees even after termination, arguing that such terms deepen potential conflicts of interest and merit closer scrutiny from shareholders. YZi Labs Pushes for Board Expansion The governance clash is fueled by a fundamental disagreement over BNC’s direction. As CryptoPotato reported previously, YZi Labs and other investors backed BNC specifically for its focus on BNB Chain-related treasury strategies. Recent internal discussions, however, have hinted at a potential pivot to other digital assets, causing unease. YZi Labs has pointed to public comments from BNC’s CEO in November 2025 about contemplating assets like Solana as evidence of this strategic drift. “We remain committed to protecting BNC shareholder rights and upholding the integrity of the BNB ecosystem,” wrote the company. The newly raised questions about board independence add another layer to YZi Labs’ campaign for change. The firm has filed a formal consent statement to expand BNC’s board and install its own nominees, a list that includes former U.S. Senator Max Baucus and blockchain figure Matthew Roszak. YZi Labs maintains its goal is to protect shareholder rights and uphold the integrity of the BNB ecosystem it believes BNC was built upon. The outcome of this fight will be a test of shareholder activism in the crypto-corporate sphere and could determine whether BNC remains tethered to the BNB ecosystem or charts a new course. For now, YZi Labs is betting that allegations of conflicted governance will persuade other shareholders to support its call for a boardroom overhaul. As of January 12, the venture capital firm has reported direct ownership of 2,150,481 shares of common stock and additional shares underlying pre-funded, stapled, and strategic advisor warrants.

Data compiled by trader T reveals that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively attracted a net inflow of $753.73 million. This remarkable figure represents the largest single-day capital injection these funds have seen in three months. Consequently, this event marks a significant pivot point for cryptocurrency investment vehicles, which have faced volatile flows since their landmark approvals. The substantial influx provides a clear signal of renewed confidence from major financial players. Breaking Down the Record Bitcoin ETF Inflow The January 13th data provides a detailed breakdown of which fund managers captured the lion’s share of new capital. Fidelity’s FBTC fund led the charge decisively, attracting $351.36 million in new investments. Following closely, Bitwise’s BITB secured $159.42 million, while industry giant BlackRock’s IBIT saw inflows of $126.28 million. Other notable contributors to the total included Ark Invest’s ARKB with $84.88 million and a newer, smaller product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini ETF, which gathered $18.80 million. VanEck’s HODL and WisdomTree’s BTCW rounded out the positive activity with $10 million and $2.99 million, respectively. This distribution highlights a broad-based demand rather than a concentration in a single fund. To provide clearer context, the following table summarizes the key inflows from January 13, 2025: ETF Ticker Issuer Inflow (USD) FBTC Fidelity $351.36M BITB Bitwise $159.42M IBIT BlackRock $126.28M ARKB Ark Invest $84.88M Other Multiple $31.79M This coordinated inflow event did not occur in a vacuum. Importantly, it followed a previous day of positive flows, creating a two-day streak of net capital entering the spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. Such consecutive gains often indicate a shift in market sentiment rather than a one-off anomaly. Analysts frequently monitor these flow patterns to gauge institutional positioning and long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. The Broader Context of Cryptocurrency ETF Performance Understanding the significance of this $753.7 million day requires examining the recent history of these investment products. Since their groundbreaking regulatory approval in early 2024, spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced periods of explosive growth followed by stretches of outflows or stagnation. The three-month period preceding January 13 saw more subdued activity, characterized by smaller inflows and occasional redemptions as investors reacted to macroeconomic pressures and Bitcoin price volatility. Therefore, this sudden, large-scale capital commitment breaks that pattern decisively. Several interconnected factors likely contributed to this surge in demand. First, evolving macroeconomic indicators, such as inflation data and interest rate expectations, can alter the appeal of alternative assets like Bitcoin. Second, technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price chart often influences institutional timing, with key support levels attracting buyer interest. Finally, ongoing developments in blockchain technology and regulatory clarity for digital assets provide a fundamental backdrop for investment decisions. This confluence of factors creates a complex environment where ETF flows serve as a critical barometer. Expert Analysis on Institutional Sentiment Market strategists interpret large inflows as a sign of institutional accumulation. When heavyweight asset managers like Fidelity and BlackRock see significant capital moving into their products, it often reflects decisions by pension funds, endowments, and large registered investment advisors (RIAs). These entities typically conduct thorough due diligence and operate with longer time horizons than retail traders. Their participation lends credibility and stability to the asset class. Furthermore, the diversity of funds receiving inflows suggests the demand is widespread across different investment theses and fee structures, from low-cost index-style exposure to more active strategies. The timing is also noteworthy. Early January often sees portfolio rebalancing and new annual allocations from institutional investors. This “January effect” can lead to increased volumes across various asset classes as fresh capital is deployed. The spot Bitcoin ETF inflow data strongly suggests that digital assets are now a formal part of this annual allocation process for a growing number of institutions. This institutionalization process is a key metric for the maturation of the cryptocurrency market. Market Impact and Future Implications The immediate market impact of such a substantial inflow is multifaceted. Primarily, the ETF issuers must purchase an equivalent amount of physical Bitcoin to back the new shares created. This creates direct, measurable buying pressure on the underlying Bitcoin market. According to standard market mechanics, sustained buying pressure from a large, regulated vehicle can provide support for Bitcoin’s price and potentially reduce downside volatility. Moreover, positive flow data often generates its own momentum, attracting media coverage and further investor interest in a self-reinforcing cycle. Looking ahead, analysts will monitor whether this inflow represents the start of a new trend. Key questions for the coming weeks include: Will the inflow streak continue? Consecutive days of positive flows would solidify the bullish signal. How will Bitcoin’s price react? The relationship between ETF inflows and spot price is a primary focus. Is this a reallocation from other assets? Determining if this is new money or a shift from gold ETFs or bonds is crucial. The performance of these ETFs also has regulatory implications. Strong, sustained demand demonstrates to policymakers and regulators that there is a legitimate, substantial market for regulated cryptocurrency exposure. This evidence can support the case for approving additional digital asset products, such as spot Ethereum ETFs, by showing investor protection and market integrity can be maintained within the existing framework. Conclusion The $753.7 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 13, 2025, stands as a pivotal event for digital asset markets. As the largest single-day total in three months, it powerfully interrupts a period of quieter activity and signals a potential resurgence of institutional confidence. The leading roles played by established financial giants like Fidelity and BlackRock underscore the deepening integration of cryptocurrency into the traditional financial system. While single-day data points do not guarantee future trends, this substantial capital movement provides a clear, quantitative measure of renewed institutional belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Consequently, market participants and observers will watch subsequent flow data with heightened attention, as it may define the investment narrative for the first quarter of 2025. FAQs Q1: What is a spot Bitcoin ETF? A spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds actual Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency’s price movements without having to directly buy, store, or secure it themselves. These funds trade on traditional stock exchanges like the NYSE or Nasdaq. Q2: Why is a $753.7 million inflow significant? This level of inflow is significant because it is the largest single-day amount in three months, indicating a major shift in investor sentiment and potentially signaling the start of a new period of institutional accumulation after a phase of slower activity. Q3: How do ETF inflows affect Bitcoin’s price? When an ETF receives new investor money, the issuer must buy an equivalent amount of Bitcoin to back the newly created shares. This creates direct buying pressure in the underlying Bitcoin market, which can provide support for or increase the price of Bitcoin. Q4: Which Bitcoin ETF had the largest inflow on January 13? Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) attracted the largest portion of the inflow, with $351.36 million in new capital on January 13, 2025. Q5: What does “net inflow” mean in this context? Net inflow refers to the total amount of new money invested into the ETFs minus any money that was withdrawn (redeemed) from them on the same day. A positive net inflow means more capital entered the funds than left.
